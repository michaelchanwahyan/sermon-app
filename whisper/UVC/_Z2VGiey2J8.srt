1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
 All right, I'll hand it over to Mark.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,380
 Well, thank you, everyone, for coming.

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,280
 And as Kelly told us last Sunday,

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,280
 it was our Easter Sunday and also our seventh anniversary. Right.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,980
 So we can say everybody, everybody,

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:23,680
 happy birthday to each other because we are launching

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,660
 the seventh year as a church, as a church plan, as a church family.

8
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:32,360
 So it's a happy day. And so last week we celebrated Easter Sunday.

9
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:35,260
 And I want to tell you

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:38,500
 sometimes or most of the times

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,400
 we do treat Easter as an afterthought,

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,440
 a kind of a footnote,

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,380
 because we often feel like the center of Christianity,

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:51,720
 the center of being a Christian is the cross.

15
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:56,680
 Whatever Jesus did for us on the cross, he died for us sacrificially.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,660
 He died for us redemptively and to rescue all of us as sinners.

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,800
 So sometimes we focus on the cross and there's nothing wrong with that.

18
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:10,160
 There's everything right about it, because biblical faith does center

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,940
 on the on the cross, on the accomplished work of Jesus Christ.

20
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,780
 And that's why we celebrate and worship together on Good Friday.

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:18,640
 Right. Were you here?

22
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,280
 And that's why we also celebrate Easter.

23
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,780
 However, sometimes I get the feeling that, you know, after Easter,

24
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:29,620
 after we talk about resurrection and then we get it done

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,280
 and then we just move on. Right.

26
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,360
 And then we focus on, OK, the love of God, the love of Jesus on the cross.

27
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,260
 Though there's nothing wrong with that.

28
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:40,720
 However, if you flip the pages of the Bible,

29
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,240
 New Testament, particularly all four Gospels,

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,160
 all the New Testament books, especially the letters to the churches,

31
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:52,800
 especially Paul's letters to the churches.

32
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:57,480
 They often remind the early believers,

33
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,280
 the early church to center their beliefs, not just on the cross,

34
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,720
 not just on the love of God, but on the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

35
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,420
 the son of God.

36
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,480
 I don't know if you pay attention to that.

37
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,860
 If you check all of the early church documents.

38
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:18,800
 Including Apostles Creed,

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,640
 we recite that last Sunday on Easter Sunday

40
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,240
 as we worship together.

41
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,680
 The Apostles Creed has 12 articles.

42
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,280
 And whoever draft that those 12 articles

43
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,020
 and summarizing the entire biblical faith in 12 statements,

44
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:39,620
 they did not forget to add, I believe in what?

45
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:42,060
 The resurrection.

46
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,800
 The resurrection of Jesus Christ.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,260
 I believe in that.

48
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,760
 And that's why we have hope.

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:51,100
 And that's why our faith is founded on solid rock.

50
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,300
 So that's why I want to start this mini series on living the resurrection

51
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,580
 to remember what resurrection means for us.

52
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,380
 And don't just think that this is a footnote of Christianity,

53
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,640
 just a footnote of the biblical faith.

54
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,380
 Because again, as I said, all four Gospels and all the epistles,

55
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:12,080
 all the letters to the churches, especially Paul's letters,

56
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,260
 never stop at the cross.

57
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,860
 They move on.

58
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:20,100
 Yes, on the cross, God redeems us.

59
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,900
 Jesus died for us, sacrificially for mankind, for sinners.

60
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:27,540
 But all four Gospels, all Paul's letters

61
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,340
 go to a great length, emphasizing

62
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:36,380
 the fact of empty tomb, the fact that Jesus' tomb is empty

63
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,780
 and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

64
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,980
 The early church did.

65
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,160
 And so we should. Right.

66
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,520
 So there are two points I want to share with you.

67
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,120
 And those are very, very important points for this

68
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,500
 first part of the sermon.

69
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,860
 But before we do that, let's read the scripture.

70
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:57,300
 And I picked this passage, this story.

71
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,840
 It's a long, kind of long 18 verses

72
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,700
 record of the first Easter Sunday.

73
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,640
 I want you to go through this 18 verses, this story,

74
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,780
 this historical account with a mind that,

75
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,160
 you know, you all go students, right?

76
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,520
 You're good students.

77
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,360
 As good students, we pay attention to details. Right.

78
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,360
 So we're going to read through this 18 verses.

79
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,740
 And I want to I want you to pay attention to some of the details

80
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:31,340
 and ask the question why the details are there.

81
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,100
 All right.

82
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,040
 Gospel of John, chapter 20, verse one.

83
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,640
 Early on Sunday morning, while it was still dark,

84
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,180
 Mary Madeline came to the tomb and found that the stone

85
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,220
 had been rolled away from the entrance.

86
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:54,520
 She ran and found Simon, Peter and the other disciple,

87
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,860
 the one whom Jesus loved should be John.

88
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:02,600
 As you said, they have taken the Lord's body of the tomb

89
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,140
 and we don't know where they have put him.

90
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,740
 Peter and the other disciples start off for the tomb.

91
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,900
 They were both running and the other disciple outran Peter.

92
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,400
 Probably John is the little John and he's younger.

93
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,740
 So he's he he's outrunning Peter and he reached a tomb first.

94
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:27,020
 So he stood and look in to the tomb and saw the linen

95
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,460
 wrappings lying there.

96
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:31,500
 But he did not go in.

97
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,520
 Then Simon, Peter finally came, finally arrived.

98
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:39,260
 Trying to catch his breath and went inside the tomb.

99
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:42,440
 He also noticed the linen wrappings lying there

100
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:46,540
 while the cloth that had covered Jesus head and was

101
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,340
 it was fold up and lying apart from the other wrappings.

102
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:56,280
 Then the disciple who had reached the tomb first

103
00:05:56,280 --> 00:06:00,720
 also went to the tomb and he saw and believed.

104
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:06,220
 For until then, they still had not understood the scriptures

105
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:08,920
 that said Jesus must rise from the dead.

106
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,940
 Then they went home.

107
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,040
 Mary, however, was standing outside the tomb crying

108
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,280
 and as she wept, she stood and looked inside the tomb.

109
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:26,060
 She saw two white robe angels, one sitting at the head,

110
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:29,700
 the other at the foot of at the foot of the place

111
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,360
 where the body of Jesus had been lying.

112
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,800
 Dear woman, why are you crying?

113
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:37,940
 The angels asked her, because they have taken away my Lord,

114
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,600
 she replied, and I don't know where they have put him.

115
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,400
 She turned to leave and saw someone standing there.

116
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,600
 It was Jesus, but she did not recognize him.

117
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,800
 Dear woman, why are you crying?

118
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:54,540
 Jesus asked her, who are you looking for?

119
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,380
 She thought he was the gardener.

120
00:06:57,380 --> 00:07:00,880
 So she said, if you have taken him away,

121
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,420
 tell me where you have put him.

122
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,880
 I will go and get him.

123
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,360
 Mary, Jesus said, she turned to him and cried out,

124
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,400
 "Rabboni," which in Hebrew means rabbi, teacher.

125
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,040
 "Don't cling to me," Jesus said,

126
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,100
 "for I have not yet ascended to the Father,

127
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:20,800
 but go find my brothers and tell them,

128
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,480
 I'm ascending to my Father and your Father,

129
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,040
 to my God and your God."

130
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,640
 Mary Magdalene found the disciples and told them,

131
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,480
 "I have seen the Lord."

132
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,520
 Then she gave them his message.

133
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,480
 Eighteen verses.

134
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,560
 And there are two points here.

135
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,960
 A very important point.

136
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,060
 The first one is the historical reliability,

137
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:47,560
 the historical authenticity of the first Easter Sunday account

138
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,400
 that we found in the Bible.

139
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,200
 The historical authenticity.

140
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:54,040
 When you read the record, when you read the story,

141
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:59,040
 there is a, you find marks and marks of authenticity

142
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,020
 that is a true report.

143
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,820
 There's a true news report.

144
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:08,820
 And the second point is the new creation has begun

145
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:10,860
 on Easter Sunday.

146
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:14,360
 Now, first point, historical authenticity.

147
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
 Now, like good students, right?

148
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,560
 You're good students and there are many good,

149
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,300
 moody students here, all right?

150
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,100
 I'm going to give you a quiz.

151
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,900
 (laughs)

152
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,900
 Just kidding.

153
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
 (laughs)

154
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:31,900
 As you read the story, pay attention to some of the details.

155
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,940
 Pay attention to some of the details.

156
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:37,300
 What are some of the details that would bear the marks

157
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,820
 of historical authenticity?

158
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,620
 Now, what do I mean by that?

159
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:43,020
 What do I mean by that?

160
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,660
 If you know there's an event that happened

161
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:49,580
 and you turn on the TV or you go to YouTube,

162
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:51,500
 you read some news report.

163
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:56,500
 You probably read the version from CNN, NBC, CBS,

164
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:58,740
 or any news channel.

165
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,300
 And you find different versions of the same event, right?

166
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,540
 Yes, the details are different.

167
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:08,500
 Some of the minor details are different.

168
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:13,500
 However, these reports have the marks of authenticity.

169
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:19,060
 The marks, what marks them authentic is not

170
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:21,460
 because all these accounts are exactly the same.

171
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:25,660
 On the other hand, it is because the exact details

172
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:29,760
 are all different, they bear the marks of authenticity.

173
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,900
 The Gospel of Matthew, the first gospel

174
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,060
 of the four gospels, said who first witnessed

175
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:41,660
 the empty tomb was Mary Magdalene and the other Mary.

176
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:47,740
 The gospel mark, Mary Magdalene, and there's another Mary.

177
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,900
 By the way, there were a lot of people called Mary

178
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,280
 back in the first century.

179
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,180
 So you go on the street and you call Mary,

180
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,700
 there are probably 10 or 20 people responding to you.

181
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,180
 Hey, yeah, right, Mary's here.

182
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:04,220
 And gospel mark, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Jesus

183
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:05,760
 and other women were there.

184
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:10,620
 Gospel of Luke, the women, and also Mary Magdalene

185
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,860
 and other named women were there.

186
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,380
 Gospel of John, we just read, only Mary Magdalene was there

187
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:23,220
 because the camera is on Mary Magdalene, on her only.

188
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,320
 Now, all four accounts are quite different,

189
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,620
 but because they are different,

190
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:35,620
 that's why they can be historical reliable, right?

191
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,260
 Authentic.

192
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:44,060
 Now, pay also attention to the two pieces of linen cloth.

193
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:48,520
 There's one wrapping the head of Jesus' body,

194
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,740
 the other piece of cloth wrapping his body.

195
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:53,940
 So there are two pieces.

196
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:57,860
 In fact, archeologists tells us

197
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,540
 what we found in the first century tomb,

198
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,280
 all the first century tombs around Jerusalem,

199
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:07,720
 when they wrapped the body, prepared the body to be buried,

200
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,980
 they have two pieces of cloth,

201
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,940
 one for head and one for the body.

202
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,660
 So as you can tell, the account was very, very authentic,

203
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:18,780
 reflecting the custom of the day.

204
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,460
 One more detail.

205
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,360
 Both pieces of linen cloth were neatly folded up.

206
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:33,460
 You don't see any signs of disorder,

207
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:38,340
 or the tomb being robbed, or the tomb being sabotaged.

208
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:40,620
 Everything is in order.

209
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:43,780
 You look into, they look into the empty tomb,

210
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:46,460
 everything is in order.

211
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:49,660
 How many of you make your bed after you wake up?

212
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,060
 How many of you?

213
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:51,900
 How many?

214
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,740
 One.

215
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,000
 Wow.

216
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,900
 We don't, two, okay.

217
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:58,040
 What minorities?

218
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,060
 You don't?

219
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,420
 I don't make my bed.

220
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,900
 I don't make my bed.

221
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:06,220
 So in some sense, if someone walked into your room right now,

222
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,300
 they probably would think this is in chaos, right?

223
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,220
 Or probably some thieves just went there,

224
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:16,140
 just robbed your bedroom, right?

225
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:22,740
 But on the other hand, the tomb of Jesus was in order.

226
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,900
 Everything is in order.

227
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:28,420
 Now, aside all these details,

228
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,260
 I'm sure you pick up the other detail.

229
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:34,200
 The other detail is the appearance of women.

230
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,960
 The women are the first witnesses

231
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:39,880
 of the resurrection of Jesus.

232
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,820
 And what is authentic about it

233
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,820
 is that if you understand the first century context,

234
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:46,820
 the background of first century,

235
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:51,580
 women were often looked down by men.

236
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,420
 No surprise, right?

237
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,100
 It was a patriarchal culture.

238
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,380
 You know, all through the years,

239
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,780
 I have collected some of the Jewish writings

240
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,220
 that reflect the men's attitude toward women.

241
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,220
 And I want to share with you.

242
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:07,180
 There were a few of them, all right?

243
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:10,520
 So I want you to read this, not in the Bible,

244
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,020
 not in the Bible, but it's outside of the Bible,

245
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,340
 outside scripture.

246
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:18,700
 And this statement or this sentence, this writings,

247
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,900
 are reflecting the patriarchal attitude,

248
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,940
 perspective on women.

249
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,540
 You ready?

250
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:27,380
 First one.

251
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:33,180
 This is what the rabbi said, okay?

252
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,060
 This is what the rabbi said.

253
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,660
 "So long as a man talks too much with a woman,

254
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,620
 he will bring to himself three consequences.

255
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,140
 These three bad consequences is first one,

256
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,380
 he, the man, will bring trouble on himself

257
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,580
 if he talks too much with a woman.

258
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:52,140
 Second is, waste his time being spent on studying the Torah."

259
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,980
 Right?

260
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,200
 You want to do Bible study than talking to a woman.

261
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,740
 Number three is that you will end up in hell, right?

262
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,140
 Gehenna, right?

263
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,560
 Era of Gehenna.

264
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,720
 Now what kind of attitude is that?

265
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,340
 The man are looking down the woman, right?

266
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,340
 Second, again, this is what the rabbi said,

267
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,060
 or the Jewish rabbi of Jesus' day.

268
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:18,700
 He said, "Because women are gluttonous,

269
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,980
 they like to eat, they like to eat a lot,

270
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,780
 for she is suspect of uncovering the instant part

271
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:28,240
 of her female friends to find out what she is cooking."

272
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,460
 Now that kind of attitude is reflected

273
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,440
 by men who wrote this thing,

274
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,180
 and how they see women, right?

275
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:39,620
 Because women, they like to cook,

276
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,180
 and they like to eat,

277
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,980
 and they have no self-control.

278
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:46,580
 They don't even lack of self-control with what they cook,

279
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:50,660
 but they are curious about what other people,

280
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:52,060
 their neighbor, are cooking.

281
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:58,380
 Number three, Josephus, a first century Jewish historian.

282
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:02,360
 He said, "Let not a single witness be credited,

283
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,220
 but three or two at the least,

284
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:09,420
 and those such whose testimony is confirmed

285
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,900
 by the good lives.

286
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,900
 But let not the testimony of women be admitted to the court

287
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,080
 on account of the levity and boldness of their sex."

288
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:26,220
 There you go, you can see how men see women.

289
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,440
 By the way, that's not my perspective, all right?

290
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,620
 That is the perspective of the first century people,

291
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,580
 especially Jewish society.

292
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,640
 So again, if you look at the women

293
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,240
 of the story of the first Easter Sunday,

294
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,040
 you would not expect women to be there.

295
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:46,020
 If someone would fabricate a story

296
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,380
 and make you believe that Jesus did rise from the dead,

297
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,140
 he would not write such a account, right?

298
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:55,780
 He would say the first one who witnessed the empty tomb

299
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,980
 must have been one of the disciples, one of the males,

300
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:03,060
 because their testimony has to be

301
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,860
 more credible than the women.

302
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,560
 Now, reverse that question.

303
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,860
 You're gonna ask, why did the gospel writers,

304
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,720
 all four of them, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

305
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,160
 they recorded the way they did,

306
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,060
 that the women were the first witnesses of the empty tomb?

307
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:25,360
 Well, very likely, it did happen that way.

308
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,500
 So they cannot lie.

309
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,620
 They just have to report the truth, right?

310
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,800
 Now, I'm sure if you read the empty tomb story,

311
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,280
 the first Easter Sunday story,

312
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,360
 you probably get the feeling

313
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:41,440
 that the women were going in and out,

314
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,520
 nobody's tracking them, they're not afraid of anything, right?

315
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,360
 And the male disciples, where were they?

316
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,620
 Where were they when Jesus died?

317
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,920
 They were hiding, they were hiding.

318
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,560
 Now, what's going on here?

319
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,500
 Nobody care about the women going in and out of the tomb

320
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,740
 and checking on the tomb?

321
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:03,180
 I remember some years ago,

322
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:08,180
 I heard a testimony from a Christian missionary

323
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:12,060
 who went to Middle East for some mission work.

324
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:16,020
 And he was telling us that it was time of war.

325
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,500
 So both sides are fighting,

326
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,980
 with the guns and tanks and all that.

327
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:26,420
 And the defensive side, all the men were hiding

328
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,580
 because they were scared.

329
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:33,660
 But the missionary was telling us that, you know,

330
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,140
 from eight to five in the morning, in the afternoon,

331
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,140
 the women are going on the street and going to supermarket

332
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,200
 and get their vegetables, get their food,

333
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,620
 and then go back home and then they cook.

334
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:50,420
 They bring the kids outside and then they come back in, right?

335
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:55,260
 So this is kind of the context of the gospel account.

336
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:00,160
 The men were hiding because the government,

337
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,000
 the Roman Jerusalem government,

338
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,940
 were looking for the Jesus followers

339
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,440
 and persecute after them, right?

340
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,280
 They want to pursue them, they want to arrest them

341
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,660
 because they're starting a movement

342
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,180
 that will rock the boat of the society.

343
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,480
 They would disturb the peace of the society.

344
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:19,480
 So they were looking after and pursuing the male disciples.

345
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,880
 While the women, nobody cared, right?

346
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,520
 Nobody cared because women,

347
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,360
 in those days, they have the anti-woman attitude, right?

348
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,280
 So you look at the empty tomb account,

349
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,440
 the first Easter Sunday account,

350
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,440
 this sort of cultural anti-woman attitude is not there

351
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,280
 because the first witnesses of the empty tomb

352
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,640
 were the women.

353
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,860
 In fact, if you track the story of Luke,

354
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:55,160
 after the women discover that Jesus rose from the dead,

355
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,840
 they went back to the male disciples.

356
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,140
 And the male disciples, how did they respond?

357
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,080
 The story sounds like nonsense to the men.

358
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,460
 So they did not believe it.

359
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,500
 Don't think for a minute, don't even think about,

360
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,140
 okay, because they're ancient people, 2,000 years ago,

361
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:15,940
 they didn't have iPad, they didn't have iPhone,

362
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,780
 they didn't know anything better.

363
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:20,900
 We know science, we know how the world works, right?

364
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:24,100
 And don't think that because they're ancient people,

365
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,420
 so they must have believed the resurrection.

366
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:31,140
 No, it says Luke 24, 11.

367
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:34,880
 The story sounds like nonsense to the men,

368
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,120
 to the male disciples.

369
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:40,460
 So you get the feel that none of the disciples is ready

370
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,980
 for the resurrection of Jesus.

371
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:46,420
 Now, to tell you the truth, in Jesus' day,

372
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:50,420
 most of the Jews believe in bodily resurrection.

373
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:54,260
 They believe the physical resurrection of the human body.

374
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,360
 Because there's a hope in Jewish theology in those days,

375
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:01,940
 that in the eschaton, in the final day,

376
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:04,820
 when everything, God will set everything right

377
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,820
 in the final day, the eschaton,

378
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,320
 the last day of human history,

379
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,180
 God will come and his glory will descend,

380
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,700
 and everything will be set right.

381
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,740
 There will be justice, there will be peace

382
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,180
 and righteousness and love, and all that stuff.

383
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,660
 And when everything will be consummated,

384
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,220
 the new creation will finally come.

385
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,460
 And they all believe that.

386
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:26,820
 Most of the Jews, they will believe

387
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,460
 and look forward to that day,

388
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,580
 and all the dead will rise from the dead.

389
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:36,020
 So they have some sort of idea of resurrection.

390
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,820
 But what caught them surprise

391
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,420
 on the first Easter Sunday morning

392
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,680
 was that Jesus rose from the dead first,

393
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,280
 before everyone else.

394
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,260
 Jesus is the first man who conquered the tomb,

395
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,180
 and he was resurrected from the tomb,

396
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,020
 and his tomb is empty.

397
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,580
 And what caught them surprise was this.

398
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,540
 Hey, we were looking for some day

399
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:04,060
 that God will consummate every single thing

400
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,420
 in our universe, the new heaven and new earth will descend,

401
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,060
 and glory will fill the entire world, and entire cosmos.

402
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,060
 But hey, now Jesus rose from the dead,

403
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,500
 and that is surprising, because we didn't expect that.

404
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,420
 I remember when my kids were younger,

405
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:25,140
 they go to elementary school,

406
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:27,020
 and there were some days they set aside,

407
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,340
 it's called the pajamas day.

408
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,420
 You know pajamas day?

409
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:34,460
 They wear pajamas, and then they go to school,

410
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,580
 and then the teachers will also wear pajamas

411
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:39,900
 and go to school, right?

412
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,540
 And they kind of have fun, right?

413
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,740
 You know I think about it,

414
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:46,940
 the first Sunday was kind of like that.

415
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,900
 It's like a pajamas day.

416
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,420
 Okay, so imagine with me, imagine with me,

417
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,380
 in the early morning, six o'clock, six a.m.,

418
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,960
 the sun rises, breaking the dawn,

419
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,160
 six o'clock, and where are you?

420
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,460
 You're still in bed, right?

421
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:09,260
 You're still in bed, and you're still in your pajamas.

422
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:13,220
 And you hear knocking on the door.

423
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:16,700
 Six o'clock, you're still in bed with your pajamas.

424
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:19,960
 Six o'clock, somebody knocking on your door loudly.

425
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,180
 And from the outside, you hear a voice,

426
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,020
 hey, this is Joe, Joe Biden.

427
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:31,060
 I'm at your door.

428
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,740
 I have coffee and I have donut ready for you.

429
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:36,020
 Please let me come in, you open the door.

430
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,340
 And how will you respond?

431
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,780
 How will you respond?

432
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:44,140
 You probably will brush your teeth and wash your faces,

433
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,400
 and you're still in your pajamas,

434
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,780
 and you open the door, right?

435
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:50,180
 And you hear, hey Joe, right, can you help me with taxes?

436
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,660
 You know, I need some help, right?

437
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,500
 You invite him to come in,

438
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,620
 he is the biggest man in this country.

439
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:59,380
 And coming, knocking on your door.

440
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:03,460
 Now this is kind of like the first Easter Sunday morning.

441
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,540
 The disciples were not quite ready.

442
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:08,220
 They were still in their pajamas.

443
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,780
 They just don't know what to do yet.

444
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,640
 The first Easter Sunday was kind of like that.

445
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,740
 Jesus rose from the dead unexpectedly and surprisingly.

446
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,260
 And that's why in the New Testament, in the early church,

447
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,580
 they were trying to sort out

448
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:25,360
 what is going on in the empty tomb.

449
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,240
 What is going on in the bodily resurrection of Jesus?

450
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,340
 When Jesus met them, talked to them about the kingdom of God,

451
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:33,020
 they were trying to figure out what is going on

452
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,780
 because yes, we're looking forward to some day,

453
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,660
 the final day, everybody will rise from the dead.

454
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:42,900
 But however, Jesus is the first guy who rise from the dead.

455
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,480
 And that's why the New Testament uses some terms

456
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,980
 to try to understand what is going on

457
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,040
 with resurrection of Jesus Christ.

458
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,380
 They describe Jesus Christ,

459
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:57,100
 one of the example is first fruit of the harvest.

460
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:00,420
 Now if you're farmers, you know how it works.

461
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:04,160
 The first produce harvest from your field

462
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,360
 will guarantee the rest of the field

463
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,340
 will have harvest for you.

464
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,580
 And that's why the first fruit

465
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:12,900
 will guarantee the rest of the fruit.

466
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,540
 First fruit is the resurrection of Jesus Christ.

467
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:21,500
 You see him, he rose from the dead, his tomb is empty,

468
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,860
 and he has defeated death, decay, and destruction.

469
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:29,900
 He has defeated evil and will guarantee the finishing off

470
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,420
 of everything God is going to do.

471
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:34,840
 If you read the Bible carefully,

472
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,900
 actually you don't have to read much.

473
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:39,280
 If you read the first two chapters of the Bible,

474
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,200
 Genesis one and two,

475
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,480
 and you read the last two chapters of the Bible,

476
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,480
 which is Revelation chapter 21 and 22, right?

477
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,040
 First two chapter and last two chapters,

478
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:56,600
 you figure out the entire Bible is a grand story.

479
00:24:56,600 --> 00:25:01,520
 It's a grand narrative that God created the world all good.

480
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,240
 That is the original creation.

481
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:08,180
 And sin came into the world and evil destroyed the world

482
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,120
 and twisted everything else, right?

483
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,560
 So partially we can see the original creation

484
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,000
 is still good today.

485
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
 However, there were a lot of things,

486
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,280
 you observe the universe are being twisted.

487
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,160
 You see pollution, you see racism,

488
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,360
 you see all kinds of different issues with our world.

489
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,520
 It's good and bad, it's a mixed bag.

490
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,520
 But God is going to bring everything to the finish line,

491
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,600
 which is the new creation.

492
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,800
 You read the last two chapters of the Bible,

493
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:40,280
 Revelation chapter 21 and 22.

494
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:44,920
 You see that it's not just us escaping from the earth,

495
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:48,400
 escaping from this physical world universe.

496
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,400
 It's that the, it's on the other hand,

497
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:55,840
 it's the heaven descending to the earth.

498
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,340
 It's like our Lord's prayer.

499
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,920
 You know how do we say that?

500
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,720
 Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name,

501
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,160
 thy kingdom come, the future kingdom will come.

502
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,820
 Your will will be established on earth as it is in heaven.

503
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:16,600
 This is kind of like a vision, a future vision

504
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,920
 of what God will be doing.

505
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:21,940
 And what God will be doing is that he will bring heaven

506
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:25,100
 and earth together and the new earth

507
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,180
 and new heaven will arrive.

508
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,420
 And now with the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

509
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:34,520
 all of a sudden the future kingdom launch into our world.

510
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,540
 The new chapter has begun.

511
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:39,100
 The new creation has become.

512
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:42,080
 And we'll see this new creation being fulfilled finally

513
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,380
 in the final day.

514
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,760
 However, in the Jesus resurrection,

515
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:49,940
 we see that this chapter has already opened.

516
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,880
 This chapter has already launched.

517
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:55,580
 So my second point is that not only did Easter Sunday

518
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:00,300
 account in the gospels were authentic historically,

519
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:05,300
 the new creation in the first Easter morning

520
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,020
 was that the new creation has come.

521
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,580
 It has arrived.

522
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,460
 What we looking forward to the new kingdom,

523
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,460
 the new reality has already broken into our lives,

524
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,400
 broken into our world.

525
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,940
 Easter Sunday is the beginning of that new creation,

526
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,620
 heaven and earth.

527
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:32,860
 But those of us, I know not many of us here who are older,

528
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,600
 we should remember there's an old hymn called In the Garden.

529
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,620
 Now I don't know if that rings any bell,

530
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:44,460
 but you check In the Garden hymn, you check the lyrics.

531
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:50,940
 The hymn says, you know, me and Jesus walking in the garden.

532
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,460
 Everything is so nice.

533
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,900
 You know, the birds are singing and the nature is so nice.

534
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,340
 The weather is so nice, unlike Chicago.

535
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,780
 And everything is so warm and it's like a spring.

536
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:05,200
 And I'm walking with Jesus in the garden.

537
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,200
 It's a song, it's a hymn that communicates,

538
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,900
 that reflects the communion we have,

539
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,100
 the fellowship that we have with God, right?

540
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,240
 But if you think about it further,

541
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:24,580
 you know, the Bible or what Jesus has done for all of us,

542
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,940
 is not just going back to the good old days.

543
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,820
 It's not going back to the first chapter of the Bible,

544
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,420
 going back to Eden.

545
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,580
 It's not back to paradise.

546
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:38,900
 It's a linear development that we look forward

547
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,540
 someday salvation will come to all of us.

548
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,340
 And that salvation is not just our soul or our spirit

549
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:51,340
 being released or escape from this physical dying body.

550
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:57,720
 What God is doing, the creation and redemption project,

551
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:01,080
 is to rescue everything in our cosmos.

552
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,020
 Not only our soul will be escaping

553
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:07,980
 from this physical bodies, this dying body,

554
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,140
 and then we're just kind of flowing in the heaven

555
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,100
 and sitting on the cloud and that's it.

556
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,420
 That's only the first part.

557
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,560
 The second part, the final part, is the physical redemption.

558
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,100
 That is the final destination.

559
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,740
 That is the final finishing off

560
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,600
 of God's entire project of redemption.

561
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,660
 Redeeming all of us, even our physicality,

562
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,160
 our physical body.

563
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:39,020
 Parents with young kids probably have this sort of experience

564
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:45,300
 and I remember when I was younger and our kids were younger,

565
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,340
 sometimes we plan for a long road trip.

566
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:50,620
 So we drive from Chicago to,

567
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:57,420
 let's say for example, we go to Disney World.

568
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,380
 Disney World in Florida.

569
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,460
 And how many hours of driving that would take?

570
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,620
 Many, many hours.

571
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:09,540
 So on the long road trip, we'll just get everything packed

572
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,780
 and then put in a minivan and then we'll just drive off.

573
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:16,160
 And then there's always many stops in between.

574
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:21,020
 So as today, you go on the highway

575
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:25,660
 and then sometimes you need a stop in between,

576
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:28,300
 bathroom break or lunch break,

577
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,300
 and then we go to McDonald's.

578
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:36,260
 Our kids will go into McDonald's and as you can tell,

579
00:30:36,260 --> 00:30:37,940
 McDonald's is a very nice place,

580
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,500
 and they go in and they get the hamburgers,

581
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,980
 they get fries and happy meals

582
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,500
 and almost all the McDonald's have playland

583
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,780
 attached to the restaurant.

584
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:52,300
 And then the kids will, after they eat,

585
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,020
 and then they'll go in and play and take off their shoes

586
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,660
 and just play in the playland.

587
00:30:57,660 --> 00:31:01,820
 And there are times that daddy, mommy are saying,

588
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,940
 "We gotta go because we are not there yet."

589
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,620
 And they were crying and then yelling at us

590
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,060
 and almost we have to abuse them

591
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:14,140
 to grab them out of the playland, right?

592
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,940
 Because we are not there yet, right?

593
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:19,020
 They are so happy because of the playland,

594
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,300
 they thought this is the Disney World,

595
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,540
 this is the whole story.

596
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:25,820
 No way, I said, "Son and daughter, we gotta go.

597
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:28,100
 "Come on, man, we gotta go.

598
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,100
 "Wake up, we have a final destination to hit."

599
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,660
 Now sometimes I feel that Christian faith

600
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,580
 and Christian life is like that

601
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,020
 because we stop at the playland,

602
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:42,500
 just the grass, just God loving us.

603
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,820
 Yeah, good, that's very nice.

604
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,860
 However, these two stories telling us

605
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:51,660
 the new creation yet to come and has already here, right?

606
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:55,580
 Someday it will bring to the finish end.

607
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,900
 So don't think for a moment that God merely redeemed us

608
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,580
 so that our souls will go to heaven

609
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,620
 and we're sitting on a cloud.

610
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:06,940
 No, this is not the salvation that we have in the Bible.

611
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:12,180
 Otherwise, there's no need for empty tomb.

612
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,500
 There's no need for resurrection of Jesus Christ

613
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,220
 in his empty tomb.

614
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:21,660
 The best is yet to come and it has already begun.

615
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:27,900
 It is so revolutionary to the first century Christians

616
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:32,980
 that they even changed the day of their worship.

617
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:36,060
 For Jewish Christians, they used to worship

618
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,580
 on the seventh day, the Shabbat of the week,

619
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,660
 the seventh day, the last day of the week.

620
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:44,700
 However, when Christians came to faith,

621
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,980
 they understood the reality of resurrection.

622
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:53,460
 They changed the worship day to first day of the week,

623
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:57,540
 Sunday of the week, that they worship Jesus Christ

624
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:00,700
 because he has begun the new creation.

625
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:04,780
 This is why when the Bible talks about resurrection,

626
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,780
 it's not an afterthought.

627
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:09,700
 It's the core of our belief.

628
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,180
 It's the foundation that we have hope.

629
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,340
 Yes, we live in a sad world.

630
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,140
 This is a broken world in many different ways.

631
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:21,340
 You look around our cosmos, our world,

632
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,180
 you see, hey, everything is not working right, right?

633
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:29,620
 There are issues, there are problems,

634
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,500
 there are twists and distortion that we see.

635
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:37,740
 However, it's the linear hope that someday God will come

636
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:41,740
 and Jesus will bring about the new heaven and new earth.

637
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:46,500
 And in the empty tomb, now we see that.

638
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,340
 The new creation, the new chapter has begun.

639
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:54,860
 When you accept Jesus Christ, this new reality has begun.

640
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,620
 You have a new life and this new life will consummate,

641
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:01,580
 will finish off someday in the future.

642
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:03,420
 And who guarantees it?

643
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,220
 It's the empty tomb of our Jesus Christ.

644
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:09,980
 I wanna close with the last verse of this Easter story,

645
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,060
 John chapter 20, 18.

646
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,660
 It says, "Mary Magdalene found the male disciples

647
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:20,580
 "and told them, 'I have seen the Lord.

648
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:21,940
 "'I have seen the Lord.

649
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,460
 "'The new life has begun in all of us in Christ.'"

650
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:32,860
 You are being sent, just like Jesus sent Mary,

651
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,100
 the first witness, to go out to her world

652
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:39,220
 and to tell of the resurrection of Jesus Christ,

653
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,620
 the new life that we have in Christ.

654
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,540
 How do we do that?

655
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:46,260
 You know, in our daily life, you have your own role.

656
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,820
 Maybe you're a housewife,

657
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:51,140
 maybe you're a worker in your workplace.

658
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,940
 Maybe you're someone who thought

659
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:56,860
 that you're not significant enough.

660
00:34:56,860 --> 00:35:01,180
 Well, we're all are very small figures in our own world,

661
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:05,100
 but we make the resurrected Jesus Christ

662
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:08,180
 visible by our lives.

663
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:14,740
 Talk in a new way, in a biblical way.

664
00:35:14,740 --> 00:35:17,580
 Relay in a biblical way.

665
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,940
 Relay to other people.

666
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,540
 Care for other people in a new way

667
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:23,660
 because the new life has already begun.

668
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,140
 Shall we do that?

669
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:26,860
 Shall we do that this week?

670
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:30,060
 Bring that message of resurrection,

671
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:34,500
 that hope, that new life, into your own life.

672
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:38,460
 Relay to your spouse, relay to your kids,

673
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,340
 your neighbors, in a totally different, brand new way

674
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,940
 because that is what Jesus' resurrection is all about.

675
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:48,620
 Yes, the best is yet to come,

676
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:51,060
 but it has already begun.

677
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:54,020
 And let it begin with our lives.

678
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,220
 Let's all pray together.

679
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:59,700
 Father, we praise you because of the resurrection

680
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,740
 that we have in Jesus Christ, our Lord.

681
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:07,860
 As we reflect on the teaching of resurrection,

682
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,100
 the accounts of resurrection,

683
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,540
 praise you, thank you.

684
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,860
 Thank you for the arrival of the kingdom,

685
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,500
 the new creation has begun.

686
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:24,100
 And we want to offer our praises and our worship to you.

687
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:28,580
 And may our lives be visible to other people,

688
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:31,140
 the reality of the empty tomb.

689
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,380
 In Christ's name we pray.

690
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:42,380
