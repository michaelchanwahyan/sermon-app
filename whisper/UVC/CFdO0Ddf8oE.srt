1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,600
 Thank you everyone.

2
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:05,920
 - All right, good to see you all.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,800
 And why don't we say hi to each other?

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,760
 Okay, just a little, yeah.

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,920
 There we go, all right.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,040
 Good to be together as a church family

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,040
 as we continue to reflect on the topic of being a church,

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:22,940
 being a healthier church,

9
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:26,360
 being a healthy church that will bring glory to God.

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:30,280
 Again, the adjective is important.

11
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,380
 It's a healthy church.

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:34,000
 It's not a good church.

13
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,160
 Now, I don't like that adjective, good.

14
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,640
 Is this church good church?

15
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,320
 You know, it's really subjective.

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,320
 But you know, at least another adjective, healthy church,

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,680
 will bring us a little bit closer to what the Bible says.

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,800
 Of course, the best adjective, I think,

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,160
 is biblical church, right?

20
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,960
 But biblical church, you know,

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,360
 it depends on how much do we know about the Bible,

22
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,000
 what the Bible says about church.

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,960
 So I hope this series will continue to, you know,

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,320
 help you ponder on the question

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,200
 of what the church is all about, okay?

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,360
 Now, an analogy, an analogy.

27
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,920
 If you go to a restaurant, you check the menu, right?

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,160
 And you're gonna order something from the menu.

29
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,920
 Do you think a restaurant is a good restaurant

30
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,040
 because the menu has tons of items?

31
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:31,000
 No?

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,240
 Have you ever been to a restaurant like that?

33
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,240
 - [Audience Member] Oh, yeah.

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,720
 (audience laughing)

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,080
 - There you go, yeah.

36
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,440
 You know, sometimes we go to a restaurant like that,

37
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,520
 and we probably have to spend 20 minutes or so

38
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,160
 in order to pick what you like, right?

39
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,120
 Too many menu items.

40
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,440
 Sometimes it's good, sometimes, you know,

41
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,880
 well, what I'm saying is,

42
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,080
 what that restaurant is a good restaurant.

43
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,920
 (audience laughing)

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,520
 All right, because we're going online, right?

45
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,640
 Yeah, I don't take any commission,

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,160
 but that restaurant is a good restaurant.

47
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,280
 But, you know, all I'm saying is,

48
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,040
 it's not necessarily so, right?

49
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:08,920
 You go to a restaurant,

50
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,720
 probably the restaurant has a few menu items,

51
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,320
 and they do really good.

52
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:17,440
 They do really good quality food, right?

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,480
 And that is also a great restaurant, right?

54
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,200
 Some weeks ago, I was in California, right?

55
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,880
 And people always tell me, if you go to California,

56
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,640
 you gotta go to In-N-Out, right?

57
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,120
 You have to go there, right?

58
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,440
 So it's kind of like a pilgrimage.

59
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:37,120
 You gotta go there and order or eat there,

60
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,080
 you know, order a hamburger, right?

61
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,560
 Yeah, those who are from California,

62
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,160
 you know, In-N-Out is a big thing, right?

63
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,280
 Anyways, I don't think In-N-Out is as good as Culver's here.

64
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,520
 You think so?

65
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,400
 No?

66
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,800
 How many of you think Culver's is better than In-N-Out?

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,920
 - Yeah.

68
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,680
 - Culver's, yeah, right, yeah.

69
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,800
 Well, anyways, now my example is,

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,280
 you go to In-N-Out, you know, how many items do they have?

71
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,800
 Only a few, right?

72
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,880
 Only a few.

73
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,600
 But they do it really, really well, right?

74
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,320
 It's a great restaurant.

75
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,600
 Same for church.

76
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,320
 No, a healthy church does not mean

77
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,960
 that you have all kinds of programs

78
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,000
 that you can think of, right?

79
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,320
 Oh, you can walk in the church

80
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,160
 and you can think of, you know,

81
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:31,960
 babysitting, preschool, Sunday school,

82
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,720
 kids' Sunday school, youth,

83
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,120
 college, young adult, couples,

84
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,040
 and senior adults,

85
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,040
 or all kinds of life stages are being covered.

86
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,160
 Does it mean, does it mean if a church

87
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,960
 has all the menu items,

88
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,560
 does it mean the church is a healthy church?

89
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,240
 Not necessarily so, right?

90
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:53,120
 It would be nice to have those things.

91
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,240
 But I want you to think about

92
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,200
 what a church really means, right?

93
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:02,960
 So there's nothing better to go to the Word of God.

94
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,360
 As I said, as I emphasized before,

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,000
 the authority of God's Word.

96
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,360
 You are Christian, how you live,

97
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,360
 and what you think about God,

98
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,320
 how you think about God,

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,680
 is not by your own preferences.

100
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,640
 How you think about ministry,

101
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,560
 how you think about serving God,

102
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,640
 using your gifts in different areas of the church,

103
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,840
 is not according to your preferences.

104
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,960
 You may have preferences,

105
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,760
 you may have your own opinions.

106
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,640
 However, the most important thing is

107
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,400
 you go back and return to the Word of God.

108
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,760
 That is the most important thing,

109
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,000
 because the Word of God is the ultimate standard

110
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 and authority.

111
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,360
 Now, we have been studying the book of 1 Corinthians.

112
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,120
 If you have your Bible, turn to it.

113
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:56,200
 We were at chapter 12.

114
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,200
 And as you know, Apostle Paul, as a pastor,

115
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:03,200
 he wrote this letter to the church in Corinth

116
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,000
 and tried to address some of the problems they have.

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
 Now, you think about it,

118
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,200
 among all the New Testament churches,

119
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,760
 you can think of church in Philippi,

120
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,200
 church in Galatia,

121
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,440
 church in Ephesus,

122
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,320
 anywhere else.

123
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,320
 The church in Corinth probably is the Macca church

124
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,560
 of the first century.

125
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,280
 Macca church doesn't mean a lot of people.

126
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,480
 Probably it was a really, really small church, right?

127
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:37,240
 That's the same case for other churches

128
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,880
 in the New Testament era.

129
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,600
 However, they are the best in terms of manual items,

130
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
 in terms of people being gifted and talented in the church.

131
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,840
 In fact, the Apostle Paul said that is the case.

132
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,840
 Right off the bat in chapter one, verse five,

133
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:02,480
 he said, "Through him, God has enriched you guys

134
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,280
 "in every single way you can imagine,

135
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,240
 "your eloquent words and all of your knowledge."

136
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,360
 So you can pick one guy or some person

137
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,880
 from the church of Corinth,

138
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,640
 you can tell, wow, he's so gifted, right?

139
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,840
 This person or that person is so gifted

140
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,840
 or probably in a very high level

141
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:29,320
 in terms of the social status.

142
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:33,560
 So Paul actually praises the church in Corinth

143
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,240
 and saying, "You guys are so gifted and so talented

144
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,280
 "and so equipped with all kinds of words and knowledge

145
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,520
 "and talents and gifts."

146
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:44,160
 That's why in chapter 12,

147
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,160
 he come to address the issues arising from spiritual gifts.

148
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,840
 He has to teach them and remind them

149
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,680
 what spiritual gift is all about.

150
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,440
 As you know, the Corinthian church,

151
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,880
 they are gifted in some way

152
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,640
 that other churches probably don't have.

153
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
 The speaking of tongue, right?

154
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,000
 They can speak the language of the angels,

155
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,240
 the heavenly language.

156
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,760
 Nobody could understand unless there was someone else

157
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,080
 who is gifted how to interpret that kind of language

158
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:19,240
 into human language, right?

159
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,520
 So whether you believe it or not,

160
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,040
 that is being addressed in chapter 12.

161
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
 So Paul is trying to tell them,

162
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,600
 "You guys are so spiritually gifted,

163
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,320
 "but you need to understand the ultimate goal

164
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,960
 "of spiritual gifts or how you being talented

165
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,560
 "or your resources, your spiritual gifts that you have.

166
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,200
 "What is the ultimate purpose?"

167
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,080
 The ultimate purpose, remember, is common good.

168
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,320
 It is for common good.

169
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,040
 You are gifted in a certain way,

170
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,160
 you are gifted in some other way.

171
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,800
 You need to think of the image of body.

172
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,240
 We are just parts of the whole body,

173
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,520
 making up the whole community.

174
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,040
 So in chapter 12, toward the end,

175
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,960
 the apostle Paul said,

176
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,840
 "All of you together are the body of Christ,

177
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,320
 "and each of you is a part of it."

178
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,720
 Here are some of the parts that God has appointed,

179
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,920
 he has ordained for the church.

180
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,040
 First, first set of gifts is apostles.

181
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:27,160
 Second is our prophets.

182
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,600
 Third are teachers.

183
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,200
 And then those who do miracles.

184
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 Would be nice to have a church

185
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,520
 where some people can do miracles, right?

186
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,960
 Yeah, right?

187
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,840
 If something doesn't work, you know,

188
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,680
 (fingers snapping)

189
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,360
 right, it works.

190
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,160
 That's nice, right?

191
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:44,600
 Well, the church in Corinth,

192
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,440
 they do have some people like that.

193
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,600
 Those who have the gift of healing,

194
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,120
 that would be nice, right?

195
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,720
 I'm not feeling good, you know, these days.

196
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,880
 What if we have a spiritual doctor, right?

197
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,880
 (fingers snapping)

198
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,720
 I'm okay.

199
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:04,880
 It would be nice, right?

200
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
 Those who can help others,

201
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,480
 and those who have the gift of leadership,

202
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:13,200
 those who speak in unknown languages,

203
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,840
 the speaking of tongue.

204
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,040
 Well, pay attention to how Paul

205
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,720
 organized or prioritize the spiritual gifts.

206
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,640
 He put apostle, prophets, and teachers

207
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,800
 the very beginning of the list.

208
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,800
 And then he pushes down the so-called spectacular gifts.

209
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,560
 Those gifts that can show off, right?

210
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,120
 Those gifts that can express, you know,

211
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,200
 how powerful the presence of God is, right?

212
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,280
 Like speaking of tongue.

213
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:51,040
 But he put that in the last, right?

214
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,400
 In the last set of the gifts.

215
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,000
 So there's a priority, why?

216
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:58,800
 Again, it's the ultimate question is,

217
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,360
 what is the gift for?

218
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,800
 What are spiritual gifts for?

219
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,320
 What are your resources for?

220
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,880
 It's for the common good.

221
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,920
 And he put apostles, those who establish churches,

222
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,200
 church planters these days,

223
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,640
 prophets who proclaim and speak the word of God

224
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,960
 in authority, teachers, teaching the church,

225
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,120
 teaching other people what to believe and how to behave.

226
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,760
 These three gifts are put in the priority list.

227
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:32,680
 And because they are used to build up other people,

228
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,840
 not for themselves.

229
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,800
 Now, there were many, many different gifts

230
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,360
 and God is using those gifts

231
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:43,800
 so that we can build up the church.

232
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,480
 Now, in my prayer, I mentioned

233
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
 there was a core team meeting today, right?

234
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,840
 We have a monthly core team meeting

235
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,920
 on the first Sunday afternoon.

236
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,560
 So all the core team members are deacons.

237
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,600
 We don't call them deacon,

238
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,120
 but we call them core leaders, right?

239
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,840
 Core team members.

240
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,720
 We're gonna meet together for a couple of hours

241
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,720
 for guiding the church and leading the ministries.

242
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,120
 If you sit down with the core team members,

243
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,200
 I thank God that we are being gifted in so many,

244
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,080
 why a variety of gifts, right?

245
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,840
 How many of you know that I'm not very good at finance?

246
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,480
 I'm really not that good, yeah, right?

247
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,120
 I'm really not that good, you know?

248
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,800
 I don't track the budget.

249
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,120
 I try to, right?

250
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,080
 Do you guys know how to use Excel?

251
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,920
 Excel, yeah?

252
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,960
 So only a few of you?

253
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,880
 Oh man.

254
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,840
 I use Excel, you know?

255
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,200
 I know how to use it, you know?

256
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,600
 The basic functions, you know,

257
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,520
 how to calculate the sum or summary and all the formulas.

258
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,880
 I know how to do it.

259
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,000
 But you know, I'm just not good at numbers.

260
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,240
 I'm just not good at finance, right?

261
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:58,480
 And my wife is so much better, you know,

262
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,320
 handling finance.

263
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:02,240
 So when we got married,

264
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,760
 she has always been the one who is,

265
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,880
 she's the watchdog, you know?

266
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,200
 She's telling me, "Hey, you overspend, you know?

267
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,120
 "You need to stop, okay?

268
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,320
 "Yeah, whatever you wanna buy,

269
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,440
 "but you know, you have to wait," right?

270
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,120
 She is the watchdog.

271
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,440
 She key in almost every single transaction

272
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,560
 in a Excel worksheet, right?

273
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,920
 Some people are really gifted in that way, you know?

274
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,800
 They may not be the ones who are going upstage

275
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,440
 and doing something in public,

276
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,080
 but they are good.

277
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,160
 They are really gifted.

278
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,240
 So in our quality members,

279
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,600
 there are a couple of people

280
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,880
 who are really gifted in that way.

281
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:49,960
 So they use the gifts for common good

282
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,920
 so that we can build a church together, right?

283
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,160
 You cannot imagine if our church,

284
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:59,920
 the finance and budget are managed by me.

285
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,360
 That would be a disaster, right?

286
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,600
 It would be a disaster, right?

287
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,160
 And the accountants, those who are trained

288
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,720
 in handling numbers and finance,

289
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,080
 there we go, right?

290
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:18,080
 And some people are really good at IT stuff, right?

291
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,760
 The computer and all this stuff.

292
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:26,800
 We rely on them in order to have a smooth surface, right?

293
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,520
 Smooth operation, right?

294
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,960
 Some people are really gifted in youth ministry,

295
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,960
 talking to young people, right?

296
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,560
 I'm not one of those, right?

297
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,760
 I cannot teach young people, right?

298
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,080
 Some people are really, really gifted in that way,

299
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:46,040
 and God is calling them to do those things.

300
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:49,120
 Some people obviously are gifted in music, right?

301
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,960
 They can pick up an instrument

302
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:55,640
 and lead us in praises and in inspiration.

303
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,600
 So God uses different gifts together

304
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,760
 in order to build up our church.

305
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,760
 So my homework for you is that,

306
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:09,960
 remember I told you something about spiritual gifts, right?

307
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,480
 In the first round of our series.

308
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,720
 Is to discover and to develop, right?

309
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,840
 Your spiritual gifts, right?

310
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,800
 So my homework for you is,

311
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:24,580
 after the service, you go to at least three people

312
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:28,380
 and tell them what I think you're gifted at, okay?

313
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,320
 What I think you're gifted at.

314
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,280
 So not for yourself, you go to the other person

315
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:37,000
 and say, "Hmm, I think you're gifted at this or that."

316
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:37,840
 Right?

317
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,800
 All right, no pressure, no pressure.

318
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,920
 It's just you think, right?

319
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,560
 Yeah.

320
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,760
 The person may not think that way, but you know.

321
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,220
 Well, it's one of the ways

322
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,840
 that we can encourage one another to discover.

323
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,080
 Always tell people, you know,

324
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:54,500
 spiritual gifts are like pepper in the teeth.

325
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,240
 Pepper in the teeth.

326
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:02,240
 You know, have you had some like black pepper,

327
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,600
 you know, seasoned food,

328
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,760
 and you had it and it looks really gross, right?

329
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,280
 The pepper is between your teeth.

330
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,560
 Nobody can see it.

331
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,640
 You need somebody else to tell you,

332
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,440
 "Hey, you got some pepper in your teeth," right?

333
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:21,320
 Spiritual gifts work like this.

334
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:26,320
 Nobody knows that you are gifted in this or that,

335
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,400
 unless other people tell you, right?

336
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,280
 That's what I'm saying.

337
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,600
 Pepper in the teeth.

338
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,160
 Somebody has to tell you.

339
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,760
 Somebody has to confirm it.

340
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:39,080
 The community has to confirm it.

341
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
 Before I went to seminary,

342
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,800
 I felt called to ministry, right?

343
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,040
 I felt called, at least, you know,

344
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,040
 I feel that I am gifted teaching, right, in teaching.

345
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:54,920
 So that is the direction I was going forward.

346
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:59,920
 And I did talk to my elders of the church, my home church,

347
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,000
 and they have to come together and say,

348
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,120
 "Hey, Mark, you are, I think you're gifted.

349
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,840
 "Yeah, but you still need training.

350
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,320
 "Yeah, you still suck.

351
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,040
 "But you still need training.

352
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:11,920
 "You still need to be equipped, right?

353
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,460
 "But I think you, maybe you got the potential, right?

354
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,560
 "The trajectory, I can see that.

355
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,300
 "So you have to work hard, too, right?

356
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,640
 "So, you know, in school, in seminary, I work hard.

357
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,840
 "I really work hard.

358
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,360
 "It doesn't mean I'm gifted.

359
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,760
 "Then everything is smooth, right?

360
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,960
 "I don't need to do homework or, you know,

361
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,800
 "and all that stuff.

362
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:30,720
 "I still need to work hard.

363
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,640
 "I still need to develop it."

364
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,320
 That is the nature of spiritual gifts, right?

365
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,960
 So all the Moody students here,

366
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,960
 let me remind you, you know, study hard.

367
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,280
 Okay, all right.

368
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,160
 So what is spiritual gifts for?

369
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:46,120
 And he continues, Paul continues to talk about it.

370
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:50,800
 He said, "It's not enough that you are gifted.

371
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:54,560
 "It's not enough that you think you are talented.

372
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:58,520
 "The most important thing is you should earnestly

373
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:01,920
 "desire the most helpful gifts.

374
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,880
 "The most helpful gifts are those gifts,

375
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,440
 "those talents that you can use for the common good

376
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,760
 "to build up the body of the church."

377
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,600
 So Paul is saying, "Now, let me tell you

378
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:15,520
 "a way of life that is best of all."

379
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,560
 And that way of life is the way of love.

380
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,920
 Take a look at this passage.

381
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,480
 He said three hypothetical situations.

382
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:30,040
 If I could speak all the languages of the earth,

383
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:35,040
 even the language of angels, but did not love others,

384
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,560
 I would be a noisy gong, noisy cymbal.

385
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:44,320
 Second situation, if I had the gift of prophecy

386
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,800
 and I understand all the secret,

387
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:51,800
 I possess all the spiritual knowledge, mystical knowledge.

388
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,680
 If I have such faith that I could move mountains,

389
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:59,680
 but did not love others, I would be nothing.

390
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,000
 Not even something, nothing without love.

391
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,160
 If I gave everything I have to the poor

392
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,160
 and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it,

393
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,920
 but if I did not love others, I would have gained nothing.

394
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,520
 What Paul is saying is without love,

395
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:23,640
 no matter how gifted you are, it means nothing.

396
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:27,360
 Three times he said, "If I did not love,

397
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,760
 if I did not use my gifts and use my time

398
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:33,840
 and talents, my treasure for the common good,

399
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,040
 for the eternal cause, I would be nothing."

400
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,280
 Now, at this point, I wanna,

401
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,760
 I just wanna appreciate some of the people

402
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,800
 who have been with us in the last few years,

403
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,560
 especially the last few years.

404
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,320
 As you know, because of the pandemic,

405
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,720
 the last three, four years, we're really, really tough.

406
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,040
 We're really, really tough.

407
00:18:57,040 --> 00:19:02,040
 You know, I still remember in year 2020, in March,

408
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:07,560
 we came back here because of the CDC guideline.

409
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,960
 Everything has to be locked down.

410
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:11,360
 Everything has to be shut down,

411
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,000
 and we have to switch to online completely.

412
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I still remember one weekday, weekday evening,

413
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,880
 we came with some brothers and sisters,

414
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,800
 and we tried to grab something,

415
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:28,600
 and then we hauled it back to my home.

416
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,600
 And my basement became the workstation, right?

417
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,040
 The studio.

418
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,360
 And we did the online service from there.

419
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,360
 It's been so tough.

420
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:46,800
 And a number of months ago, we opened, right?

421
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,800
 Now, what I wanna appreciate is all those sisters

422
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,400
 and brothers, the workers,

423
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,560
 who have been working tirelessly during this period.

424
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:01,840
 Why I appreciate them most is that it was tough.

425
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,400
 When you're doing something

426
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,560
 and you don't see the results immediately, right?

427
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:12,040
 When you're serving and you don't see people returning,

428
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:14,800
 it has been really, really tough.

429
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,080
 That's why I wanna appreciate each one of them.

430
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,800
 I can't name all the names,

431
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,360
 but I really appreciate those who are trying

432
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,360
 to get things going, right, with our limited resources,

433
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:31,040
 to get the worship going, to get the singing going,

434
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:36,880
 teaching online, preparing something backstage,

435
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,400
 figure out the IT problems, troubleshoot all the issues.

436
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,280
 Right?

437
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,240
 Just cannot imagine.

438
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
 This is crazy.

439
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,920
 This is crazy.

440
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,880
 So I would say they are tired.

441
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:55,320
 They are exhausted.

442
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,000
 If you talk about burnout, you know,

443
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,280
 I think they are the first one to get burned out.

444
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,360
 It's just not easy, right?

445
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,200
 Not easy.

446
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,040
 So I really appreciate all of them.

447
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,120
 They did not quit.

448
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,280
 And they are with us until this day.

449
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,080
 Really appreciate it.

450
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,080
 Now, when we open, we are still working tirelessly, right?

451
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,800
 Just give you an office example, it's my wife, right?

452
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:25,560
 You know, she's a tough nut, yeah.

453
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,400
 She's really, really tough.

454
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,680
 You know, of course, when we switched to online,

455
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,120
 she got, she had no kids ministry, right?

456
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,640
 Everything is done by video and all that stuff,

457
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,720
 and she didn't do it.

458
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,480
 But when we opened some months ago,

459
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,480
 she's the one and with some other sisters and brothers

460
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,680
 trying to, you know, we build and we open the kids ministry.

461
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,640
 What I really appreciate people like this

462
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,520
 is that no matter what, they are there.

463
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:05,760
 No kid, they still prepare, right?

464
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,960
 In fact, last night, we came home,

465
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,760
 and she was preparing for Sunday school.

466
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,480
 Of course, with her team, when I said team,

467
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,360
 there's only one or two people.

468
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,240
 But they are tirelessly working together

469
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,000
 in order to build a ministry.

470
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,320
 So, you know, we, sometimes we throw up the church.

471
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,240
 It's very natural for us to assume the role of consumers.

472
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:39,200
 We come here, we enjoy it.

473
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,560
 Do you enjoy today?

474
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,600
 Today's church?

475
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,440
 Eh, not really, right?

476
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,280
 Yeah.

477
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,960
 Do you enjoy the program here?

478
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,880
 You know, that kind of mentality is customer mentality.

479
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,040
 I mean, I can't blame you.

480
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,200
 I mean, it's very natural, right?

481
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:01,440
 You show up, yeah, there's something here, right?

482
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,440
 You don't show up, eh, they're okay, right?

483
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:11,120
 I wanna say with apostle Paul, we need to do it with love.

484
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:15,880
 We are being called together to constitute the church,

485
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,800
 to form the church body, the spiritual family of God.

486
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,720
 Everyone has his part.

487
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,000
 Everyone has her part to play, to give,

488
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,280
 to use our talents to build up the church.

489
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,920
 That is the way of love.

490
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,800
 And that's why 13.4 and following

491
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:39,120
 is the most famous love passage of all times.

492
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,840
 Take a look.

493
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,160
 Love is patient and kind.

494
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:49,760
 Love is not jealous, not boastful or proud or rude.

495
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,040
 It does not demand its own way.

496
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,480
 It is not irritable.

497
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,680
 It gives no record of being wrong.

498
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,320
 It does not rejoice in injustice,

499
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:04,000
 but rejoices whenever the truth wins out.

500
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,640
 Love never gives up, never loses faith.

501
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:12,520
 It's always hopeful, endures through every circumstance.

502
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,000
 That is love.

503
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,120
 Remember, this passage is often used in Christian wedding.

504
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:23,360
 This passage actually has nothing to do with marriage.

505
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,520
 Remember that?

506
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,360
 The context I told you from chapter 12, now to chapter 13,

507
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,520
 Paul is talking about church life, the way of love.

508
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,600
 Love is patient, love is kind, right?

509
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:41,080
 You come to the church, we live together

510
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:43,640
 as a church body, as a church family.

511
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:49,520
 The best way to do it is not administration.

512
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,040
 The best way to do it is not leadership.

513
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,040
 The best way to do it is not we have spectacular programs.

514
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,360
 The best way to come together as a church

515
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,400
 that is pleasing to God is the way of love.

516
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,200
 That means when you show up, when you come here,

517
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,600
 you think of others.

518
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,080
 That is what love is.

519
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,280
 It's not self-seeking.

520
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,480
 It's not about me, it's about you.

521
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:23,200
 Remember I said, you know, this is,

522
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:28,400
 at least in the context, it's not talking about marriage.

523
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,520
 But every single principle here

524
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:34,280
 actually is applicable to marriage, right?

525
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:38,680
 In all relationship, in all social gatherings,

526
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,480
 in all situations, love is the best way.

527
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:46,040
 Now a couple days ago, or actually a couple weeks ago,

528
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,560
 I think last week, a week ago, yeah,

529
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,320
 my daughter suggested that we as a family,

530
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:57,400
 we're gonna watch a movie, all right?

531
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,700
 So what kind of movie that she likes to watch?

532
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,020
 Um, it's this one.

533
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,500
 Cars.

534
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,300
 Cars.

535
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:10,740
 No, as you know, have you ever watched this one?

536
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:11,580
 Cars 1?

537
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:13,540
 You did?

538
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,580
 Nobody?

539
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:18,660
 Oh, come on, this is probably one of the best movies, okay?

540
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,980
 So you should get together and watch this movie.

541
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,940
 And it talks about Lightning McQueen, right?

542
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,100
 The race car.

543
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:29,540
 And he always want to win the race, right?

544
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,660
 To win the cup, right?

545
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,500
 The what?

546
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,900
 The piston cup, right?

547
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,980
 The piston cup, whatever.

548
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,420
 He just wanna be number one.

549
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:38,900
 He just wanna beat other people,

550
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,180
 and then he's gonna win, right?

551
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:44,340
 And unfortunately, he end up in a very small town

552
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,380
 called Radiator Spring, right?

553
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:50,020
 Radiator Spring on Route 66.

554
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,460
 And he got stuck there, but he quickly find out

555
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:57,460
 this town of not too many people,

556
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,340
 they are very simple people.

557
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,760
 You know, they love the town.

558
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,580
 They wanna build up the town.

559
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:08,500
 They feel sad if the town is being abandoned,

560
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,960
 being in ruin.

561
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,500
 So they love each other and care for one another.

562
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,140
 It's a small family.

563
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,860
 So they went to, so the story,

564
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:19,820
 a lot of the stories happened in that little town,

565
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:21,420
 Radiator Springs.

566
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,500
 And then, eventually, Lightning McQueen,

567
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:29,580
 this young race car, met someone

568
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:34,660
 who has been retired,

569
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,860
 used to be very successful race car.

570
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,260
 Dog, right?

571
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:40,340
 Dog.

572
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,980
 And there's one line in this movie,

573
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:45,100
 I think it's very, very meaningful.

574
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:47,580
 Because this old guy, you know, retired,

575
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,820
 and he look at the piston cups like nothing, right?

576
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,660
 It's just empty cup, right?

577
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:54,900
 In fact, he won a few of them, right?

578
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:59,420
 So for him, it really means nothing to him.

579
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:02,500
 And this old guy, retired,

580
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,620
 taught Lightning McQueen with this line.

581
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,980
 He said, "When was the last time

582
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,380
 "you care about something except yourself?"

583
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:13,060
 When was the last time?

584
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:17,060
 You care about something except yourself.

585
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:21,420
 That's a great line.

586
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,260
 That's a great line.

587
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,940
 When was the last time you care about something

588
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:24,780
 except yourself?

589
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,100
 Like how you enjoy ministry?

590
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,300
 Like how you enjoy church?

591
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,580
 Like how you enjoy the family?

592
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,580
 Like how you get something out of it, right?

593
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:39,940
 When was the last time you turn the table around and say,

594
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,540
 you know, that is not important

595
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:43,860
 because that is not the way of love.

596
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,780
 Love is not self-seeking.

597
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,900
 I'm not number one.

598
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,900
 Who cares?

599
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,140
 Whether I get something out of it, right?

600
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,980
 Whether I enjoy it.

601
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,860
 That is not the point.

602
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,260
 The point is whether I'm practicing the way of love.

603
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:04,140
 Paul continues.

604
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:07,020
 He said, "Prophecy, speaking in unknown languages,

605
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,020
 "speak special knowledge, will eventually become useless."

606
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,060
 It will be useless.

607
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,060
 Eventually it will be useless.

608
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,820
 In all the programs, fantastic stuff,

609
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,820
 you can make it happen in the church.

610
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:24,260
 Eventually it will become nothing

611
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,860
 because they will not last.

612
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,780
 They will not last forever.

613
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:29,380
 They are not eternal.

614
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,300
 However, the kids ministry, how exciting it is,

615
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:37,380
 how entertaining it is, how engaging it is,

616
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,580
 Paul is saying it will become nothing

617
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:44,180
 compared to what the gifts, the spectacular gifts

618
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:46,300
 the Corinthian Christians have,

619
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,380
 speaking in unknown languages.

620
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:51,340
 Wow, how great that is, right?

621
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,420
 You know, when I was in seminary,

622
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,820
 it was in Southern California,

623
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,140
 I was roommate with three other Korean guys.

624
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,820
 One of those guys, Korean guys,

625
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,780
 he said he's gifted in speaking in tongue.

626
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,220
 Have you ever heard speaking in tongue?

627
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:15,940
 Every morning, he was doing his devotional, right?

628
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:16,820
 And he prays.

629
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,940
 And nobody understands what he's saying.

630
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,140
 But he is so close to God.

631
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,300
 That's what, at least that's what he said, right?

632
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,300
 Now, I for sure, I for sure, he was not speaking Korean,

633
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:38,100
 even though I know nothing about Korean.

634
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:41,140
 But those are not human language, right?

635
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,860
 But he was using that language to get close to God, right?

636
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,820
 He was gifted in such a way.

637
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,220
 But Paul is saying, even so,

638
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,500
 it will become useless.

639
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,900
 But love will last forever.

640
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,100
 Love will last forever.

641
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:59,900
 Even the gift of prophecy,

642
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,820
 only reveal part of the reality, right?

643
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,780
 No matter how great the teaching is,

644
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,780
 only, we only see partially the whole picture.

645
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:11,980
 He said, when the time comes,

646
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,820
 that means when Jesus comes back,

647
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,860
 time of perfection comes,

648
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:20,980
 these partial things will become useless.

649
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,420
 Useless.

650
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:28,540
 Now, we need to mature.

651
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,700
 When I get mature, and Paul is saying,

652
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:33,180
 "When I was a child, I spoke like a child.

653
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,580
 "When I grew up, I put away childish things.

654
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:40,860
 "And now we see things imperfectly,

655
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,780
 "like puzzling reflections in the mirror."

656
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:48,260
 But then, when Jesus comes, when the kingdom comes,

657
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:51,460
 we will see everything with perfect clarity.

658
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,260
 Now what we see is incomplete,

659
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:58,220
 but we will know everything completely when the time comes.

660
00:31:58,220 --> 00:32:05,060
 Therefore, only something will last forever.

661
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:07,780
 And Paul said, three things will last forever.

662
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:13,020
 Surprisingly, nothing about speaking in tongues,

663
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,220
 nothing about your spiritual gifts,

664
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:17,020
 nothing about your talents.

665
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,980
 Only three things will last forever.

666
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,100
 Faith, hope, and love.

667
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,180
 And the greatest of these is love.

668
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:29,340
 So my challenge to you today is that you come to church,

669
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,540
 or even you're not going to church,

670
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,420
 you're not in the weekdays, right?

671
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,540
 You're not seeing other sisters and brothers.

672
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,340
 How do you practice the way of love?

673
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:42,860
 Well, at least I would suggest to pray for the church.

674
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:48,540
 When you come together, when you care for one another,

675
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,100
 love is not self-seeking.

676
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:57,420
 It's to seek the benefit of the church, the common good.

677
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,460
 Seek the benefit of other people.

678
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:05,020
 So let's all pray and prepare our hearts and our mind

679
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,780
 and pray to God.

680
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:12,660
 I spend some moment to pray that, you know,

681
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,620
 come to God and say, "Dear God,

682
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:18,700
 "let it not be about myself,

683
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:23,740
 "but about the kingdom, the church.

684
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:28,820
 "Dear God, can you use me in such a way

685
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,060
 "to build up the body of Christ?"

686
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:32,260
 Let's all pray together.

687
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,680
 (pastor and congregation murmuring)

688
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:40,860
 Father, we come before you

689
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:44,340
 and we realize that we are your vessels.

690
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:47,140
 We are simply your instruments,

691
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:50,820
 that you use your sovereignty

692
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,700
 to grant us different gifts and talents

693
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,540
 and treasure and resources.

694
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:59,500
 And I pray that we will be a church

695
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,260
 that will practice the way of love.

696
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:07,140
 To care for one another, to put others before ourselves,

697
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:11,260
 to serve other people for the benefit of your church

698
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:14,980
 so that your name will be made famous.

699
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,620
 That people will come and observe us

700
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:20,060
 as a church family, as a spiritual family.

701
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,980
 They will be surprised by the way of love.

702
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:26,540
 They will see us as a community

703
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,300
 that is different from the culture.

704
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,460
 Yes, the world is teaching us and molding us

705
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,460
 in such a way that we always come as a customer

706
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:41,380
 to seek for our own enjoyment,

707
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,420
 to seek for our own benefit.

708
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:46,780
 But we come before you at the foot of the cross.

709
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:51,020
 We know that the best way, the eternal way

710
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,140
 that will last forever is the way of love.

711
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:56,620
 Help us to care for one another.

712
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,780
 Help us to pray for one another.

713
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,860
 To build up your church so that your family will be strong.

714
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,820
 Strong in love, close in love.

715
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:10,260
 And I pray that you will continue to grow our church

716
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,580
 and grow in such a way that we will continue

717
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,500
 to be mature in the way of love.

718
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,620
 In Christ name we pray, amen.

719
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,500
 Well, thank you for coming.

720
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,140
 And I pray that you will have a good time today

721
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:26,860
 and this week and God bless you in your work

722
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,660
 and your career and your family.

723
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:31,740
 And make sure you pray for one another,

724
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:35,620
 especially those who are out of town this week or next week

725
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:38,460
 and we'll continue to serve one another in our church.

726
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,700
 All right, God bless you.
