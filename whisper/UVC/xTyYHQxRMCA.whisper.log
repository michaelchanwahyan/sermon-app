[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   Yeah, do let me know if you're interested,
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.680]   join the retreat and it's gonna be a fun time
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.360]   and if there are enough people going,
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.920]   we're gonna make this happen, okay?
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.960]   Why don't we say hi to your neighbors, okay?
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.480]   Just say hi, you know, yeah.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.300]   Say good morning and welcome,
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.560]   some of those friends in our midst.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.800]   We continue with our series on worship
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.000]   and we learn how to be better worshiper.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And this pretty long series, this is part seven already.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.520]   And remember the list of things that I present to you
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.560]   from the Bible, if we try to summarize
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.800]   what worship is all about and all the elements
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.420]   or aspects of worship.
[00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:52.160]   This list, by the way, is not an exhaustive list
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.840]   of things we do in worship
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.400]   and should not be used mechanically
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.320]   because the Bible lays down general principle,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.240]   basic principles for us to practice our worship together,
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.660]   but not the details.
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.080]   And so often the details are dictated
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.580]   by the local community or local faith, family,
[00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.960]   churches or even generation.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.320]   But we need to learn how to become a better worshiper
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.640]   and that is a central question for the entire series.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.960]   And let me ask you this question,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.240]   are you becoming a better worshiper?
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.040]   Are you becoming a better worshiper?
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.760]   Week after week, you know, Sunday is our Shabbat, right?
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.360]   Sunday is kind of our big day and the first day of the week.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.200]   We come to give God our worship and our offering.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.960]   And are we becoming better worshiper?
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.400]   And that's the central question we need to ask ourselves.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.040]   And today we need to learn how to sing songs, okay?
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.760]   How to understand songs.
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.760]   There are so many elements we can add
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.440]   to the list of worship here.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.400]   However, I think the main thing,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.680]   there's a main element that we cannot miss
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.800]   in our weekly worship, in our Sunday worship
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.280]   is the songs, the poems, the lyrics,
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.280]   the hymns that we use to sing to God
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.520]   and to offer our worship together.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.680]   And let me tell you my personal story.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.960]   I'm quite surprised that many churches today,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:26.640]   or at least some of the churches,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.680]   you know, a good number of churches
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.240]   are still struggling with using old hymns
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.000]   and new praise songs, right?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.880]   And many churches are still debating this issue.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.280]   And I'm pretty surprised because, you know,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.120]   I'm quite old, okay?
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.240]   I'm quite old compared to many of you guys.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.960]   I remember back in the '80s, 1980s, can you believe that?
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.240]   1980s, where are you?
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.200]   Probably not born, right?
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.080]   Right, but you know, I've been going to churches
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.000]   for many decades.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.360]   1980s is 40 years ago, right?
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.360]   The 1980s when I was so much younger, so much younger,
[00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.840]   churches had huge debates on the use of songs, you know,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.880]   especially use of new songs,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.760]   contemporary praise songs, so-called.
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.760]   When the praise songs were first introduced in 1980s,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.560]   early '80s or even late '80s,
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.720]   and those of you who are old enough
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.440]   or comparatively older,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.160]   you still remember a music ministry called Marilyn Arthur.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.440]   Remember that?
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.280]   Yeah?
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.280]   No, right?
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.760]   I'm one of the older guy here.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.080]   You know, some of the songs are still around.
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.280]   Some of those songs written and composed
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.520]   by Marilyn Arthur Music Ministry are still around.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.480]   One of those songs we have used before,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.160]   or we have used a lot of time,
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.520]   is called "As the Deer."
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.280]   As the Deer.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.840]   And you know the lyrics, right?
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.240]   "As the deer panted for water,
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.880]   "so my soul longed after thee."
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.280]   Right, "You alone are my heart's desire,
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.840]   "I long to worship thee."
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.160]   And "You alone my strength, my shield, and so on,
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.800]   "I long to worship thee."
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.440]   You see, this is the first,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.400]   so-called first generation praise songs
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.240]   that have been composed and used by churches
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.000]   since the 1980s and late '80s, early '90s.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.200]   And it became very, very popular.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   You know where this song comes from?
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.340]   The lyrics, the content?
[00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.360]   Which song from the Bible?
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.260]   No?
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.280]   Psalm 42, right?
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.520]   42, exactly like that, okay?
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.440]   Psalm 42.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.200]   And even the lyrics is using some old King James English,
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.200]   right, "thee."
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.440]   Some of those words are old English words,
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.320]   older English words.
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.640]   It became very, very popular,
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.880]   and there were people who don't like this kind of songs.
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   You know, and I'll tell you why.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.880]   And because these kind of contemporary words,
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.400]   contemporary worship songs are simple, repetitive,
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.040]   and sometimes too short, right?
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.800]   And look at this song, you know, you have one verse.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.400]   Of course you have verse two,
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.120]   somebody add verse two later,
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.280]   and then a chorus, right?
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.640]   "You alone my strength, my shield," and all that.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.920]   But there's not much you can tell from the song itself.
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.520]   Therefore, there are people who think
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.520]   that contemporary worship songs dumbed down worship.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.760]   Overly simplified worship, right?
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.280]   Because the songs that we use,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.440]   or some of the songs that many modern churches are using,
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.040]   like Melanother, first generation,
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.620]   are very short and repetitive,
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.960]   and they don't cover a lot of content.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.840]   They don't cover, definitely they don't cover
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.240]   a lot of theological or biblical content, right?
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.440]   So there's still a debate in the church,
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.680]   and some people who are like me, or even older than me,
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.960]   they would prefer the older hymns, right?
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.720]   The hymn books, traditional hymns.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.600]   And if you check out some of the traditional hymns,
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.040]   they do present a lot of content,
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:26.760]   or a lot more content than Melanother,
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.720]   or contemporary praise songs.
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.480]   And check this out.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:34.040]   Oh, this is one of the, if you know Mandarin,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.900]   this is also the first generation,
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:39.640]   so-called first early generation of praise songs, right?
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.080]   Okay?
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.140]   This is actually the first one.
[00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:49.640]   The first one they wrote, and became so popular,
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.240]   and this ministry, Stream of Praise,
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.800]   has been around for, boy, for decades.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   Yeah, for decades.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:00.700]   I remember my wife used to buy the CD.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:03.200]   Each year they have a new album, right?
[00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.960]   And she would go to a Christian bookstore
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.080]   and pick up a new CD, all right?
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:10.080]   Every single year, and no matter if she likes the songs
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.440]   or not, she will buy a new CD, right?
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.880]   But you know what CDs are?
[00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:18.680]   You don't even know, right?
[00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:21.640]   I give you a CD, you can't even play it today, right?
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.200]   So we use Spotify, and Apple Music, and all that.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.440]   iTunes or something.
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:30.440]   But this is a first generation praise song,
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.400]   and some people don't like it, because it's too simple.
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.320]   Look at the lyrics.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.480]   There's not much there.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.240]   It's very focused, though, right?
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:41.760]   Now if you check out some of the traditional hymn,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:45.240]   like this one, this is a very, very popular classic
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.220]   Christian hymn, Amazing Grace.
[00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.400]   There are four stanzas, right?
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.000]   Four verses.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.800]   Actually, there are six verses.
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:56.520]   Some versions have six verses,
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:08:00.160]   and here I present to you four verses.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.400]   And you see how rich, in terms of content.
[00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.800]   These kind of traditional hymns are very, very rich,
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.420]   and teach you a lot of things.
[00:08:09.420 --> 00:08:12.640]   Verse one, Amazing Grace.
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.260]   How sweet the sound, save a wretch like me,
[00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:17.960]   was once lost, but now I'm found,
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   was blind, and now I see.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:25.840]   What kind of doctrine is verse one presenting?
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.020]   Forgiveness, right?
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:29.700]   Forgiveness in grace, right?
[00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.240]   My sin is forgiven.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:33.800]   And then second verse,
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.640]   grace taught my heart to fear,
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.920]   my fears relieved in grace,
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.680]   and how precious did that grace appear,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:46.180]   the hour, the moment I first believed in Christ.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.180]   So stanza two present to you the doctrine of salvation,
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.120]   right, and that is salvation in grace.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.680]   And verse three, it talks about,
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:01.280]   this is one of my favorite verse in the entire hymn,
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.720]   is through many dangerous toys and snares,
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.440]   I have already come, and God is leading me,
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.520]   safely in grace, and leading me home.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:10.840]   And that's my life journey,
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:13.400]   because full of the grace of God.
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.960]   Ups and downs in my life journey, in your life journey,
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.040]   and when you sing it, when you sing stanza three,
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.920]   you realize that the song is trying to tell you
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.220]   the providence of God, right?
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.720]   The guidance of God in your life journey.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.240]   And you are kept safe because of the grace of God.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.800]   And then the last verse,
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.420]   talks about the future.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.520]   The future, the eternity that we share in Christ Jesus,
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.000]   and the glorious future, right?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.880]   Someday God will appear and his kingdom will come on earth,
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.440]   and I will be God's.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.420]   And I say to God, forever,
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:57.640]   I am yours and forever you are mine.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:10:01.680]   So, it's eschatology, it's the doctrine of last things,
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.680]   right, it's something that will happen in the future,
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.700]   according to the promises of God,
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:10.340]   the promises of the Bible, the new creation,
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.600]   the heaven, right?
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.720]   Our true home, and we are heading there,
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.360]   and there will be forever praise.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.480]   And as I talk through this song, this hymn,
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.440]   you see, each verse, each stanza,
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:28.240]   has some sort of profound theology to tell us.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.760]   So that's why there are some people who would prefer
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.540]   using theologically rich songs,
[00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:37.200]   and the contemporary worship songs,
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:40.520]   they are too simple to be used in worship.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.600]   But we have to ask the question,
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:43.880]   is that a biblical argument?
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.360]   Is there really no place for simple songs
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.660]   in worship services?
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:54.240]   Is there a place for shorter, simple songs,
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.880]   simple praise songs, like the contemporary praise songs,
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.600]   that kind of song?
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.440]   Do they have a legitimate place,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.600]   legitimate role in our liturgy, in our worship?
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:10.080]   Let's turn to some of the Bible verses,
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.600]   and one of those is found in the last book of the Bible,
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.760]   the book of Revelation, chapter four.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:21.000]   Chapter four, verse eight, the angels are praising God.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.280]   You know, the apostle John who wrote the book of Revelation,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.220]   he is being lifted up to another realm,
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.840]   you know, the heavenly realm.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.760]   And what he sees is the heavenly worship,
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:38.120]   what worship truly is in eternity.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.400]   And he found the angels are praising God,
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:45.280]   you know, day and night, day after day, night after night.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.880]   They keep on saying, they keep on praising God
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.880]   with one song, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty,
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:59.360]   the God who always was, who is, and who is still to come.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.440]   How long is that song?
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:05.700]   Only two lines, right?
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.360]   And how many times are they singing it?
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:14.000]   Many times, day and night, right?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.680]   They sing it 24/7, right?
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:18.840]   And it's very simple, very focused,
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.480]   praising God for his holiness.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.120]   And by the way, what is holiness?
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.880]   Holiness is separate, you know,
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.080]   it's totally different from us.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.040]   Separate from us, set apart from us,
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.480]   that is the basic meaning of holy, or holiness.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.860]   So they're praising God being holy God,
[00:12:35.860 --> 00:12:39.000]   because he is sinless, he is separate from us.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.280]   However, he has come to redeem us so that we can praise him.
[00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.920]   That's what the angels are talking about.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.520]   The content is clear and is glorifying God.
[00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.200]   And then the next chapter, chapter five,
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.520]   again in the heavenly realm, you know,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:57.360]   in God's realm, in God's domain,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.520]   and the people and the angels are singing praises
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.560]   to the lamb that was slain.
[00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:08.240]   If you remember our set of worship in the beginning,
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:11.960]   and Josh led us to read this part of scripture,
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.800]   the angels are praising God in front of the throne
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.240]   of the lamb of God who was slain.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.920]   And they said, they're saying,
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.960]   "You are worthy to take the scroll
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.400]   "and break a seal and open it."
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:29.140]   Now what does it mean breaking the seal of the scroll?
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:30.560]   You know, in the ancient time,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:32.680]   when they write important documents,
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:35.680]   they would roll it up, you know, roll it up.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.040]   In animal skin or in papyrus,
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:39.560]   they roll it up and then they tie it up
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:41.880]   and then they will have a lump of clay
[00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:44.740]   to stamp on it to seal the document.
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:48.620]   So whoever has that stamp, whoever has the signature,
[00:13:48.620 --> 00:13:50.840]   has the authority to open up the scroll.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:53.560]   And the scroll is all about the future,
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:56.300]   about the future of creation.
[00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:59.720]   And who is ruling the entire creation,
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.740]   the entire timeline of history,
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:04.640]   from past, present, and future?
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:08.140]   Who is worthy to open the scroll?
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:09.700]   Who is it?
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:13.000]   For you were slaughtered, your blood has ransomed people
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.640]   for God from every tribe, language, people, and nation.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.120]   And you have caused them to become a kingdom of priests
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:24.340]   for our God and they will reign on the earth.
[00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:26.520]   Who is worthy to open the scroll?
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.640]   Who has the authority, the sovereignty
[00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.200]   to control your future, to control the future
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:33.000]   of the entire creation?
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.800]   It's the lamb who was laying on the cross.
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.820]   The lamb who suffered and died but rose again.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:43.140]   He is the living God in Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:45.420]   He is worthy to open that scroll.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:49.800]   And this is actually the song the angels were using
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.940]   to worship the lamb in front of his throne.
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.840]   How long is this song?
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:14:57.340]   Not too long, right?
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.900]   Short enough I can put it in one slide, right?
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.500]   And that's what they were singing
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.540]   and they were using to worship God.
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:08.340]   So these are very, very short,
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:13.320]   kind of like contemporary worship songs, right?
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:14.980]   So they're legit.
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:17.500]   We can use those because they're focused.
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.480]   They don't tell a lot of content
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:22.540]   but the focus is very, very sharp.
[00:15:22.540 --> 00:15:28.340]   Now are there long praise psalms in the Bible?
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:31.700]   Psalm 119, right?
[00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:33.500]   It's a Torah psalm.
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:36.400]   Appraising the word of God, the value of the word of God,
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:38.500]   the honor of the word of God.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:40.140]   And it's very, very long.
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:46.380]   But again, there are many psalms that are shorter
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:50.060]   and much shorter and sometimes even shorter
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.260]   than the contemporary praise songs.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:54.260]   Like Psalm 1, right?
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:55.180]   You remember Psalm 1?
[00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.300]   Blessed is the man who does not walk
[00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.540]   in the pathway of the sinners and all that.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.540]   And Psalm 1, how many verses are there?
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.800]   Six, six verses.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:12.920]   Psalm 23, and many of us know how to recite Psalm 23, right?
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:16.280]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be want.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.760]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.060]   How many verses are there?
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:24.000]   Six, six verses only.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   121, I lift up my eyes and where my help come from.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.840]   121, eight verses.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:36.520]   133, behold how good the brothers,
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.600]   how beautiful the brothers are living together,
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:40.680]   staying together.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.980]   133, three verses only.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:48.980]   So there are shorter songs, many shorter songs
[00:16:48.980 --> 00:16:51.240]   in the Bible for worship.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.820]   And also there were filled longer,
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:58.620]   theologically rich songs that can be used
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.400]   in worship services.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:05.120]   You know, if you check out some of the traditional hymns
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:08.360]   that one of the examples I showed you, Amazing Grace,
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:13.200]   they try to squeeze major doctrines into one song, right?
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:16.320]   I went through with you, Amazing Grace,
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.240]   there are at least four kinds of,
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.080]   or four aspects of theology being squeezed into one song.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:27.080]   Now I don't think, I think there's a legitimate way
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:32.580]   to do it and it has been done so well in Amazing Grace.
[00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:37.240]   But I don't think we should expect a song to be like
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:42.640]   a systematic theology textbook, right?
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:45.080]   I know a lot of you don't read, right?
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.980]   You don't read books anymore, right?
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.240]   We all go TikTok, right?
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:52.160]   Short videos, right?
[00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:54.720]   If you pick up some of the books from our library, right?
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:57.940]   From our library corner, you pick up one of those
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.500]   systematic theology books, how many pages are there?
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.240]   500 pages.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.220]   That's crazy, right?
[00:18:06.220 --> 00:18:08.840]   If you take one of the courses in seminary,
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:12.460]   systematic theology, that's one of the textbooks
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:13.940]   that you're gonna read, right?
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:15.340]   There's only one.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.100]   There are probably 10 books you have to read.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.860]   And you just, you pick up one of those books,
[00:18:21.860 --> 00:18:23.700]   you know, it's like weapon, you know?
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.440]   You can bang people on the head and it's gonna hurt, right?
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.740]   You know, if you squeeze the entire book,
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.040]   systematic theology book, into one song,
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:38.480]   which is about five minutes long, three minutes long,
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.800]   it may be counterproductive at times, right?
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.140]   Right?
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:48.740]   Because you go through so many, so many different types
[00:18:48.740 --> 00:18:51.940]   of teachings, so many different types of content
[00:18:51.940 --> 00:18:56.140]   in one medium, one short medium,
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.520]   that may not be the best way to do it, right?
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:04.380]   And in worship service, as you can tell
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:05.660]   from the list that I gave you,
[00:19:05.660 --> 00:19:08.940]   all the elements of worship service,
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.940]   I think in terms of conveying content,
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.400]   you know, offer you materials, information,
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.900]   I don't think songs are the best way to do it, right?
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:21.440]   Do you agree?
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:25.540]   Probably preaching, 25 minutes, 30 minutes,
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:28.800]   is the better way to convey content.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   So again, I can understand why some guys like me,
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:39.180]   who are older, would prefer traditional hymns, right?
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.900]   But, you know, there was legitimate role
[00:19:41.900 --> 00:19:45.260]   for shorter, you know, simple songs,
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:48.780]   so that our praise and our worship would be focused.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.780]   And some people in the discussion or debate
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:58.940]   would prefer traditional hymns over contemporary music
[00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:03.900]   because of quality, because of quality.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:08.740]   And contemporary pop music sometimes is rejected
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.360]   because of lower music quality, right?
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:12.200]   Do you agree?
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:16.660]   Those are the songs that we use today, week after week,
[00:20:16.660 --> 00:20:20.140]   they are lower music quality, right?
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:22.620]   And of course, right, musically speaking,
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:27.100]   you know, classical music is of better quality, right?
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.580]   In terms of harmonization, in terms of sophistication,
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.920]   right, you know, Handel's Messiah,
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.620]   I mean, it's so complicated, it's so rich, right?
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:42.340]   And the harmonization and the arrangement is so rich,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.100]   you know, Mozart, Beethoven, you know,
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:49.060]   those kind of music, traditional classical music
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:52.120]   is of better quality in terms of musicality.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:56.860]   So arguably, they are better music quality.
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:20:59.140]   And some people would prefer the traditional hymns
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.880]   because of that, because of the better quality.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.880]   But as I explained to you in the entire series,
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.860]   I asked the question, is it the church mission
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.500]   to preserve traditions?
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:16.540]   Is it or not?
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:22.340]   Is it the mission of a church to preserve music or art
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:23.700]   of highest quality?
[00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:26.200]   Is it our mandate?
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:30.020]   Partially, I think so, right?
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.880]   Cultural mandate, Genesis one.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:38.020]   However, one can arguably say
[00:21:38.020 --> 00:21:41.300]   that this is not the church mission, right?
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:45.300]   Some of the music that we use in the entire long history
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:50.300]   of Christian history only serve for one generation
[00:21:50.300 --> 00:21:54.060]   because that generation understand
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.260]   that kind of language of worship.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:00.420]   And I told you, I learned some Hebrew songs, right?
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:04.580]   And those songs are particularly understandable,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:07.900]   intelligent to that particular culture.
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.220]   And it would not be, it would not have the same effect
[00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:14.180]   for us, right?
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:19.180]   And so, there are people who say
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:24.580]   that music, church music, has to be good enough
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.940]   to be preserved beyond its own time.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:31.080]   Otherwise, we should not use it in worship service.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.260]   Now, I appreciate the basic intent,
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:38.940]   but I don't think this is totally biblical
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:41.260]   because remember the principle of Paul
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.980]   in 1 Corinthians 14.
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:47.260]   He said, "No matter what we do, we need to do it
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.100]   "in such a way that we can edify the entire family,
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:53.860]   "the church, the local church.
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:55.900]   "The church can be strengthened."
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.860]   Even new visitors come in and they can feel God's presence.
[00:22:59.860 --> 00:23:04.180]   They can understand the lyrics without much difficulty.
[00:23:04.180 --> 00:23:07.980]   And that is what Paul is going after
[00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:10.420]   in terms of quality, right?
[00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:13.020]   Because there are many different kinds of quality
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.220]   in the world.
[00:23:14.220 --> 00:23:16.700]   And Paul is saying to the Corinthian church,
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:20.540]   "And please, do your worship and engage in worship
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.180]   "in such a way that is good for everybody."
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:29.180]   Even it is effective for new believers or non-believers.
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:32.260]   And they come in, what is best in music
[00:23:32.260 --> 00:23:34.740]   in terms of what Paul is saying
[00:23:34.740 --> 00:23:37.940]   is that the music that will communicate
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:41.300]   with people today, right?
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.100]   And certainly there are musics that I've used
[00:23:44.100 --> 00:23:49.260]   or my worship life has used in the past.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.180]   They are bygone.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:54.140]   You know, we don't use it anymore
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:57.980]   because it spoke to the previous generation
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.060]   but no longer speaking to this generation.
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:06.820]   So I think there are place for all kinds of music.
[00:24:06.820 --> 00:24:11.260]   There are place for all kinds of worship songs
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.220]   including contemporary modern praise songs.
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.140]   And again, we need to understand what song is all about.
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:25.180]   Song or poem is not the ideal medium for content, right?
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:30.220]   As I told you, it's only five minutes long, right?
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.500]   You can't say much.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.060]   You can only focus on one thing at a time.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.700]   And we have to understand and ask the question
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:40.980]   how we can become a better worshiper
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:47.180]   by understanding what worship songs is all about.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.000]   You know, if you have come to church for quite some time,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.260]   you understand worship songs are like prayers.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:59.660]   They are directed toward God, right?
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:04.980]   They are prayer-like songs and directed to God, right?
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:07.300]   Most of the songs that we use.
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:11.500]   And as such, worship songs or worship poems,
[00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:16.500]   the songs that we sing, are written for expression,
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:20.300]   emotional expression, emotive impact.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:24.580]   And in order to create that kind of emotive impact,
[00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:29.580]   it has to be somewhat reparative, right?
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:31.420]   The contemporary worship songs,
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.700]   even the traditional hymns, are reparative in some way
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.340]   because that is the nature of worship songs.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.660]   I would like to use the analogy
[00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:44.820]   that worship songs are like love songs, right?
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.840]   You know, you sing some of the love songs,
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.700]   even secular love songs, right?
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.340]   Those are very good songs, right?
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.620]   They are reparative in some way.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:00.620]   Or worship songs are like love songs and national anthems.
[00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:04.100]   National anthems.
[00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:06.300]   Has to be repeated, right?
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.320]   It is kind of reparative.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.380]   You do it one time, two time,
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.540]   repeatedly, regularly, right?
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:18.540]   Every NFL game start with national anthem, right?
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.260]   And we're gonna sing together
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:24.020]   because national anthem are pretty much like love songs.
[00:26:24.020 --> 00:26:26.160]   They are emotional expression
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.540]   to declare allegiance to the country, right?
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.900]   Are there any reparative songs in the Bible?
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.220]   There are.
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:40.540]   One of the example is Psalm 136.
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:44.100]   Here I give you the first five verses.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:45.620]   Give thanks to the Lord for he is good,
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:49.420]   for his standfast love endures forever.
[00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.820]   Give thanks to the Lord, give thanks to the God of gods
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:56.620]   for his standfast love endures forever.
[00:26:56.620 --> 00:26:59.340]   Give thanks to the Lord for his standfast love
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:00.420]   endures forever.
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.740]   To him who alone does great wonders
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:05.400]   for his standfast love endures forever.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:08.880]   To him who by understanding made the heavens
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:12.760]   for his standfast love endures forever.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.300]   And it keeps on repeating the same chorus again and again
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:18.220]   and tells you why do we praise God,
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.820]   why do we give thanks to him.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:24.580]   And this Psalm 136 is very, very long, right?
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:25.700]   It's very, very long.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.380]   And it actually recites the entire history of Israel.
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:34.540]   How God told his people, talk about Exodus,
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:37.980]   talks about signs and wonder God has done in the midst,
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:41.580]   talk about wilderness, talk about how God provides for them.
[00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.540]   And that's why God is praiseworthy.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:50.860]   Now, this is a very emotive expression.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.940]   Repetitive, repeat again and again,
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.460]   for his standfast love endures forever.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:27:58.580]   Yes, amen, it endures forever.
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.820]   That's why we praise him.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:02.620]   And every time the chorus repeats,
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.340]   it talks about different aspects of God
[00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:08.220]   and what God is doing in your life, right?
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.220]   God has certainly provided for you,
[00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:12.220]   God has certainly sustained your life,
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:16.660]   God has certainly guided through your life journey,
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:18.940]   and that's why he is praiseworthy
[00:28:18.940 --> 00:28:23.020]   for his standfast love endures forever, right?
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.280]   These are emotions, right?
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.260]   Just like my wife would prefer me to say I love you.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.180]   For how many times?
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.820]   Many times, right?
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.540]   I can't tell my wife, you know,
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:42.740]   I told you five years ago, right?
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:44.260]   It's done deal, right?
[00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:47.700]   There's no more content I wanna express to you, right?
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:51.540]   But you understand this emotive expression, right?
[00:28:51.540 --> 00:28:56.540]   It has to be spoken or verbalized from time to time, right?
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:02.060]   You know, when my kids were younger,
[00:29:02.060 --> 00:29:07.340]   we try to intentionally do that, you know,
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.060]   we try to teach our kids, you know,
[00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.620]   as you know, kids don't talk these days, right?
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:16.300]   They're often with their phone, right?
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:19.500]   So when they were so much younger,
[00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:24.500]   we tell them, you know, you have to express your feeling.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:27.140]   You know, you have to verbalize it.
[00:29:27.140 --> 00:29:29.180]   When you see a sunset is beautiful,
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.980]   you should say it is beautiful, right?
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.940]   It is awesome, right?
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:37.860]   They need to learn how to find the right word
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:40.020]   to describe their feelings.
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.240]   And we intentionally do that at home.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:48.700]   I will tell them I'm happy because what happened, you know?
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.860]   I'm happy, I'm excited, I'm sad, I am kind of depressed,
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.700]   I'm exhausted.
[00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:57.860]   You know, these kind of vocabularies
[00:29:57.860 --> 00:30:00.180]   are emotional vocabularies, right?
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:03.660]   I tell my kids, "Love you," right?
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.100]   And they tell me, "I love you."
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.980]   And this sort of expression has to happen,
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:11.980]   you know, linguistically, I mean, verbally,
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.060]   it has to be described, right?
[00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:19.580]   And I want to bring this analogy to worship as well,
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.020]   because worship is an emotional language.
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:27.140]   And I want to tell you from my own life journey,
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.260]   my own cultural heritage, right, Asian Chinese, right?
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:34.180]   We have lack of emotional vocabularies.
[00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:36.300]   We have none, okay?
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.780]   We have no emotional vocabularies in our dictionary, right?
[00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:40.620]   Don't you agree?
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.100]   How do we express love to our children?
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:48.940]   Chinese parents, we do, "Eat some more."
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:50.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:51.140]   Have you eaten?
[00:30:51.140 --> 00:30:53.540]   Go eat, right?
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.340]   Oh, eat some more, right?
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:56.980]   This is how we do it, right?
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:58.140]   This is pretty sad.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:01.260]   One time I was visiting a family,
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:07.060]   and they have one of their loved one passed away.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.540]   It's very tragic.
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.300]   So I went to visit the family,
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:16.300]   and they just have no vocabularies to describe the feelings.
[00:31:16.300 --> 00:31:20.220]   In the entire visitation, almost an hour,
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:22.580]   I stay there an hour, and I pray with them,
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:24.300]   you know, I care for them.
[00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:29.300]   All they say is, "Pastor, eat."
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:31.740]   Or, "You have to eat," okay?
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:33.020]   I said, "I had dinner."
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:34.700]   "Oh, no, you have to eat."
[00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.300]   "Oh, you have to drink some more," okay?
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:39.060]   And then we talk for about 10 minutes,
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:42.580]   and then later on, you know, the family members come,
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:46.540]   and we found the dish, and come, "Hey, eat," okay?
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.340]   I mean, can we say I'm sad?
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:55.300]   Can we say I'm depressed, and I wanna cry,
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:57.060]   and I can lament, right?
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.460]   This is a legitimate emotional expression
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.120]   that we need to use.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:03.420]   This is a love language, right?
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.020]   And we need to learn that.
[00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:07.620]   And in order to be better worshiper,
[00:32:07.620 --> 00:32:10.660]   we need to learn that kind of language as well.
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:15.260]   So I wanna suggest to you, we need to do that.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:17.460]   Not just for parents, okay?
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:19.580]   Not just for family relationship.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:23.780]   You know, all kinds of relationship
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:28.780]   have to be emotionally related, emotionally expressive, right?
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:36.100]   I, as a father, I need to learn how to use those words, right?
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:42.020]   And there are difficulties I need to overcome, right?
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.760]   At first, I was quite uncomfortable to say that, right?
[00:32:45.760 --> 00:32:48.400]   To say to my wife, "I love you."
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:51.140]   Say to my kids, "Love you," right?
[00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:53.780]   And I kind of, along the way,
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:56.700]   I find some cool way to say it, right?
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:32:57.540]   "Love you."
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:59.620]   (audience laughs)
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.620]   And then I get used to it.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:03.380]   I get more comfortable to express it.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:07.040]   But my main point is we need to learn that, right?
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:10.260]   Even between friends.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:14.180]   You know, how do we get closer and closer, right?
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:21.080]   It has to be emotionally expressive, right?
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:23.320]   You gotta have some emotional connection.
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:27.840]   And worship is an emotional response to God, right?
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:29.400]   Like this psalm.
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:31.280]   "God has saved us and redeemed us,
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.740]   "created us and sustained us.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:36.440]   "And we feel good," right?
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.100]   We wanna give thanks.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:43.880]   Even giving thanks itself is an emotional response, right?
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:45.560]   And we respond to the goodness of God
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.800]   and ultimately the salvation that we have in Jesus Christ
[00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:51.920]   because we sinners, we're separated from the holy God.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:56.920]   Only Jesus came to bridge the chasm
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.760]   between the holy God's totally separate from us,
[00:33:59.760 --> 00:34:04.440]   alienated from us, and us, broken sinners.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:07.280]   And Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   so that we can be bridged back to God, related to God.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.120]   So how can we be a better worshiper?
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:19.440]   And may I suggest to you three more things
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.140]   as your take-homes.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:24.620]   First, be intentional.
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.940]   We have to be intentional.
[00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:30.600]   Our weekly Sunday worship service,
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.720]   we have to be intentional.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:36.400]   And you realize how much time we devoted
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.640]   to prepare for worship service,
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.400]   no matter how many people show up?
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.440]   I think we practice, this practice, today's rehearsal,
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:51.440]   I think it took us two plus hours, right?
[00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.640]   And with the preparation and all that,
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:59.640]   number of hours, we do, we rehearse
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:03.440]   in order to craft our worship, right?
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:07.360]   Of course, it's not the best of the world, right?
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:08.560]   We're not professionals.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:11.520]   But we try to do our best, right?
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:15.020]   So what I'm saying is, first point is be intentional
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.700]   if we want to become better worshipers.
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.240]   Arrive a little bit earlier.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:25.240]   I told you many times, my best practice is come in
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:30.440]   and find a seat, find some space, and I can pray to God.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.780]   I can meditate on God.
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:37.220]   Remember, worship is a relational encounter, right?
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:38.500]   And today is Father's Day.
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:42.360]   God is our true Father, right?
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.960]   We early fathers are broken.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:49.460]   We are sinners, and we need redemption of Christ,
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.860]   just like our children do.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.580]   But God is our true and perfect Father.
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.680]   And Jesus died on the cross to redeem us
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.920]   from sin and from death, so that our relationship
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:04.640]   with God is a reality now in Christ.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:08.520]   So be intentional, because God is relating to us, right?
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:12.960]   God is not an ideal or a concept, or even not a philosophy.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.360]   God is a living God.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.280]   He's a person, and we have a personal relationship
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.300]   with our Creator, with our Redeemer.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:24.280]   Secondly, I would suggest to pray.
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.100]   Learn how to pray.
[00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:27.680]   What do I mean by that?
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:32.680]   You know, in prayers, we don't just make a list
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:39.340]   of needs and wants in front of God.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:42.700]   That is not the essence of prayer.
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.100]   Prayer is to come before God with an open heart,
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:52.100]   be honest, and be open, and tell God how you feel today,
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:54.940]   how you feel this week.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:36:57.240]   Maybe you're so tired this week.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:59.720]   Yes, open to God, right?
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:01.980]   Tell God that you are tired.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.340]   Tell God that you are exhausted.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.260]   I need your help.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.540]   Tell God you feel frustrated.
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:09.980]   You feel anxious.
[00:37:09.980 --> 00:37:11.940]   You worry about things.
[00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:16.940]   You present those emotional feelings to God,
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:20.340]   and even tell God you are joyful today.
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.220]   Tell God you're excited, right?
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:28.120]   Did you listen to the words that we use?
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.300]   Emotional, expressive terms, right?
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:34.380]   God, I'm exhausted, I'm frustrated.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:37.380]   God, I'm happy, right?
[00:37:37.380 --> 00:37:38.820]   I'm joyful.
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:41.900]   All kinds of emotions are found in the book of Psalms.
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.740]   All kinds of emotions are found
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.900]   in the worship elements in the Bible.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.940]   I remember September 11th.
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:55.180]   September 11th, I think it happened on,
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:38:00.180]   of course, it happened on September 11th, 2001, right?
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:04.100]   And I think it happened on Monday or Tuesday,
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.860]   yeah, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:10.860]   And I remember after September 11th happened,
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:15.440]   I was serving in the church,
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.540]   and the worship leaders called me up and say,
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:22.580]   how should we respond, right?
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.700]   You know, the original worship set,
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.780]   we have chosen some songs, right?
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:31.660]   And we have to change every one of them, right?
[00:38:31.660 --> 00:38:33.140]   And I suggested to them, you know,
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.580]   we don't have to come to worship
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.700]   always feeling joyful and excited.
[00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:43.920]   We can come before God with our laments, right?
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:45.580]   Lamentations.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:47.740]   Those are legitimate worship response
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:48.940]   and emotional response.
[00:38:48.940 --> 00:38:50.460]   We can lament before God.
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.300]   And the book of Psalms contains many, many psalms
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.180]   that are laments, community laments,
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.660]   or individual laments.
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:03.100]   Those are sad songs, but we can present those to God.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.740]   So I suggest to you to pray, to learn how to pray.
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:10.340]   Think for a minute how you would respond
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.580]   if God actually appeared to you right now.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:17.460]   If God all of a sudden, (mimics God's voice)
[00:39:17.460 --> 00:39:21.680]   appeared before you, how would you respond, right?
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:26.420]   You know, in the Bible, there were many encounters like this
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.500]   in the book of Job.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:31.340]   Job was suffering, right?
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:33.500]   He's a righteous guy and suffered a lot.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.260]   And he demanded God to answer his questions.
[00:39:38.260 --> 00:39:42.020]   He has so many questions about suffering, right?
[00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:43.940]   Why am I suffering, right?
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:47.220]   An innocent man suffering a lot.
[00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:50.460]   Job demanded God to answer his questions.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:54.500]   However, at the end of the book, God did show up.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.020]   God said, "Yeah, you wanna interview me?
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:58.460]   "Yes, here I am."
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.260]   But when God met Job,
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:06.380]   God in turn asked him a lot of questions, right?
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.080]   Do you have the wisdom?
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:11.340]   Do you have my transcendent wisdom
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:15.820]   to govern the entire cosmos?
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:17.260]   Do you have that kind of wisdom?
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:19.540]   Can you understand that kind of wisdom?
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.980]   And Job was silent before the Creator.
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:27.340]   And he encountered God in such an awesome way, right?
[00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:33.260]   Moses and Isaiah, they encountered God in worship.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.580]   And they realized God is holy and sinless.
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.500]   And they were unworthy.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:41.660]   And they begged for mercy,
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:44.620]   that we need your grace, God, to come before you.
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:48.060]   Otherwise, we are undone, right?
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.760]   We are over because we are sinful.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.820]   And God is so bright and so glorious, so pure.
[00:40:53.820 --> 00:40:55.140]   How can we approach God?
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.580]   There's no way we can approach God,
[00:40:56.580 --> 00:40:59.720]   except on the ground of grace.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:02.740]   And maybe we can come before God
[00:41:02.740 --> 00:41:04.460]   and prepare ourselves in prayer,
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:09.300]   knowing that only Jesus made forgiveness possible for us,
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:11.900]   so that we can worship God, we can come before God,
[00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:14.760]   because Jesus first loved us.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:18.740]   And number three I wanna suggest to you is to learn, right?
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:20.380]   We have to learn.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.940]   No matter how long you have been to church,
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:24.820]   no matter how long you've been a Christian,
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.100]   no matter how long you have followed Christ,
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.180]   we need to learn how to worship,
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.000]   how to worship better.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Because worship is not about passively watching a show.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:42.200]   It's not Saturday night life, right?
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:45.060]   It's not just come in and you just absorb something.
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:48.540]   It's not passively engaging.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:52.680]   It's about actively, proactively, we participate.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:55.640]   Because we believe in Jesus and we are God's people.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:59.160]   And God is calling his people to worship him.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.580]   And worship flows out of our living relationship
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:04.680]   with God himself.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:10.860]   Today, even I've been worshiping for many decades,
[00:42:10.860 --> 00:42:13.100]   I'm still learning new songs, right?
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:17.380]   Because I understand when God does new things in history,
[00:42:18.340 --> 00:42:20.220]   there are new songs of worship.
[00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:23.340]   And I'm trying to learn those new songs, right?
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:25.860]   Try to learn and try to concentrate.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.740]   Try to direct our attention to God
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:31.940]   so that God is totally pleased in your worship,
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:34.580]   in my worship, in our worship.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:39.380]   Let us all pray and pray that God will help us
[00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:44.420]   to be better worshipers, to be a better church.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.180]   Heavenly Father, we call you Father because you are perfect
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:54.160]   and you are holy and sinless and pure.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:57.180]   Yes, we can come before you today
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:00.220]   only on the ground of grace.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:05.940]   Because of the grace of God expressed to us,
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:08.960]   demonstrate to us on the cross of Jesus.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:13.880]   Thank you for first loving us so that we can love you back.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.020]   Thank you for this living relationship
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.140]   that we have with you.
[00:43:18.140 --> 00:43:23.420]   Our prayers are not talking to empty air.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:27.440]   Our prayers are directed to you.
[00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:30.120]   And you are our loving Father.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:34.740]   Thank you for sustaining us, providing for us.
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:38.020]   And God, we come before you, we are sorry.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:43.340]   Forgive us, forgive our shortcomings.
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:45.820]   Sometimes we come before you to worship
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:50.020]   as if this is a job, as if this is one of the things
[00:43:50.020 --> 00:43:54.300]   that in our checklist, we wanna get it done
[00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:55.860]   and get it over with.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.660]   Father, forgive us.
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.900]   Bring us into true worship.
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:04.940]   Help us to be better worshipers,
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:10.980]   to learn languages that will express our thanks to you,
[00:44:12.140 --> 00:44:15.820]   to learn songs and poems that we can say to you,
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:17.260]   you are our awesome God.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:22.220]   Thank you for being our loving God.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.540]   Thank you for saving us and redeeming us
[00:44:24.540 --> 00:44:27.340]   from sin and from death and darkness.
[00:44:27.340 --> 00:44:29.340]   Bring us into your light.
[00:44:29.340 --> 00:44:35.400]   Help us to be renewed because we understand your grace.
[00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:38.780]   So transform our lives this week
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:41.000]   so that our lifestyle will honor to you.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:45.120]   And as we come week after week to worship you,
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:49.360]   may our worship be pleasing to you
[00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:53.000]   for you are worthy of our praise.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:54.160]   In Christ name we pray.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:58.520]   Well, God bless you all and please stay behind
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:45:01.200]   for a little time of fellowship together
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:03.120]   and there was some refreshment out there
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.280]   and say hi to some of our new friends
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:07.760]   and say hi to your neighbors, okay?
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:08.600]   God bless.
