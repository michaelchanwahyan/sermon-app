[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500]   Mr. Jinwook for today's sermon.
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.660]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:17.300]   - Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.140]   Did you hear me?
[00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.700]   Okay.
[00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.900]   How have you been doing?
[00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.020]   It's been very cold these days,
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.660]   and Omicron is surging,
[00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.540]   and things are still going on,
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.180]   and we don't feel much peace sometimes.
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.740]   But I want you to receive God's peace
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:39.880]   through this worship.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.140]   God wants to give you life, peace, joy, and love.
[00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.060]   All these things we can only find in our Lord.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.820]   Today I'm gonna deliver God's message
[00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.820]   from 1 John, chapter four, verse 72 to 12.
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.100]   (keyboard clicking)
[00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.980]   Okay, so if you have your Bible, open your Bible.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.140]   1 John, chapter four, verse 72 to 12.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.820]   1 John, chapter four, verse 72 to 12,
[00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.580]   because it's a short passage, let's read together.
[00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.300]   Dear friends, let us love one another,
[00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.340]   for love comes from God.
[00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.020]   Everyone who loves has been born of God and knows God.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.060]   Whoever does not love does not know God,
[00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.740]   because God is love.
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.060]   This is how God showed his love among us.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.460]   He sent his one and only Son into the world
[00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.900]   that we might live through him.
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.940]   This is love, not that we loved God,
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.180]   but that he loved us and sent his Son
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.300]   as the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.420]   Dear friends, since God so loved us,
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.540]   we also ought to love one another.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.900]   No one has ever seen God, but if you love one another,
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.900]   God lives in us, and his love is made complete in us.
[00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:12.780]   This is the word of God.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.500]   Amen, amen.
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.940]   So let's pray.
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.700]   (pages rustling)
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:29.820]   Father, here we are in front of you,
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.460]   and I'm gonna deliver your word to your people.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:39.140]   But I know that my lips are corrupt,
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.860]   and my heart is not truly loving.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.140]   So when I deliver this message,
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.460]   Father, I'm convicted in my heart already.
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.600]   Holy Spirit, come upon us.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.140]   Let us listen to your voice, Lord.
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.820]   Convict our hearts, and bring the changes in our lives
[00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.100]   that we may glorify you, that we may live in you.
[00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.020]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.620]   So last year, at the end of last year,
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.460]   when I was asked to deliver three times of Sunday messages,
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.940]   one per month, this year from January to March,
[00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.140]   I had to think about what I do really wanna share with you,
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.460]   brothers and sisters.
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.980]   Just as many of you know, after 13 years of living
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.940]   as a missionary to America, my family and I
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.740]   are going back to my country next month.
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:48.060]   And thankfully, some of you guys came to Christ
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.580]   through my ministry.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.740]   It was not my power, but it was God's grace.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.100]   Therefore, this is the last moment,
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.500]   so as my last word to you, brothers and sisters,
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.500]   I intentionally chose the three topics last December.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.580]   So prayer, I delivered the message about prayer in January.
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.580]   Today, love, and living as a disciple next month.
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:19.420]   So those are the three topics I really care
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.100]   that you wanna really understand me before I go.
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.380]   Yeah, your pastor, Mark, will continuously
[00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.100]   remind you the same thing,
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.700]   but these are the three topics in my heart.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.260]   Prayer life, loving life, and living your life
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.380]   as a disciple.
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.500]   So though I well know that I am weak in love
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.820]   and not qualified to preach about love,
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:48.180]   I am also convinced that love is so essential
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.380]   for a Christian's life.
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.100]   And I'm gonna deliver this message about love
[00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.860]   Jesus showed us.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.140]   It's not my love, it's not my experience,
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.100]   but it's Jesus' love, and the love Jesus wants us
[00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.660]   to live out in our lives.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.860]   So let me ask you this question, brothers and sisters.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.980]   What is love for you?
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.620]   What is love?
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.260]   Have you ever seen a couple falling in love
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.900]   with each other?
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.660]   Some days ago, Jim Fan and Paul came to our house,
[00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:21.580]   and they were grabbing their hands
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.300]   and just hugging all the time, trying to touch each other.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.220]   So when their love is just starting,
[00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.220]   they are literally on flame, flame of fantasy,
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:38.380]   like fantasy love.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:42.580]   They are so happy with only their dating partner's presence.
[00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.340]   They feel like they have everything,
[00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.380]   and life is so good and perfect.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.660]   But the problem is this.
[00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.700]   How long does the flame of love last?
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.460]   It depends on the couples,
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.780]   or on different, some research measures.
[00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.220]   However, we just know that just a few months later,
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.060]   or a couple of years later,
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.020]   or a few years later at most,
[00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:12.660]   the strong sense of love to win those
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:15.660]   decreases little by little.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.020]   And many couples, many husbands and wives,
[00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.060]   feel so dull about their relations.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.860]   Many feel and think that
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.860]   they do not love each other anymore.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.020]   And I watched a Korean live show.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.700]   The speaker asked the people in the studio hall,
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.060]   the studio hall was packed with people,
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.620]   and the speaker asked this question.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:41.020]   If you feel your couple, as a husband and wife,
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:44.260]   love each other, please raise your hand.
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.020]   And I exactly remember eight people
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.860]   raised their hands among couple of hundreds.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.020]   Okay, only eight people.
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.260]   So surely, husband and wife relationship
[00:06:56.260 --> 00:07:01.100]   should be the most meaningful and beautiful in our lives.
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.060]   But truly loving relationship
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:07.780]   between husband and wife is quite rare.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:08.700]   It's quite rare.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.220]   What is the problem?
[00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:13.700]   The problem is this.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:18.260]   Even though we desire love so badly,
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:22.500]   we cannot hold even the greatest love in our lives.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.980]   Why do the people get married?
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:26.220]   Your parents, they're hating each other,
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.700]   but actually they love each other.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.300]   We cannot hold even the greatest love in our lives.
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.460]   What does that mean?
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:40.940]   It means that we receive, oh no, no, no, I'm sorry.
[00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.700]   So, we easily lose and destroy love.
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.900]   So today I'm gonna help you understand
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:50.300]   three important lessons about love
[00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.460]   through today's passage.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:53.620]   Okay, three lessons.
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.060]   Pastor's love number three, right?
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:58.900]   The first lesson about love is that
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.700]   love is the greatest gift in our lives.
[00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:03.860]   Everybody repeat after me.
[00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.860]   Love is the greatest gift in our lives.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:15.060]   Even though love is the greatest among all gifts,
[00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:17.140]   it's a gift.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:19.140]   Do you get it?
[00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:23.060]   Love is the greatest among all gifts,
[00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:25.300]   but it's still a gift.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:26.700]   What does that mean?
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.700]   It means that we receive and enjoy love for a brief time.
[00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:34.460]   We didn't create love.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:37.420]   We couldn't think out of love.
[00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:41.140]   We received everything about love.
[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:48.220]   So, verse seven in today's passage says like this.
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:49.140]   Verse seven.
[00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:53.020]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:56.260]   I'm gonna use this very fancy one.
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.100]   Okay, let's read together.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.700]   Dear friends, let us love one another,
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.100]   for love comes from God.
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:05.940]   One more time.
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:08.060]   Dear friends, let us love one another,
[00:09:08.060 --> 00:09:09.540]   for love comes from God.
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:12.300]   What does, where does love come from?
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.660]   According to this verse, from God.
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:19.580]   And interestingly, my Korean Bible reads like this.
[00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.820]   Love, yeah, Korean translation reads like this.
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.620]   Love belongs to God.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:29.300]   Whether love comes from God or love belongs to God,
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.460]   both means that God is the creator of love.
[00:09:33.460 --> 00:09:36.860]   God is the creator of love,
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.980]   and the owner of love, and the giver of love.
[00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:44.740]   Again, God is the creator of love,
[00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:48.180]   owner of love, and the giver of love.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:53.180]   We receive love as a gift, roughly in two ways, from God.
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.380]   We receive love from God in two ways.
[00:09:55.380 --> 00:09:59.060]   Number one, we receive love as a gift,
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:03.740]   because God made us as loving beings.
[00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.980]   God made us as loving beings.
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.020]   He could have made us as another being,
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.780]   like unable to love.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.900]   Let's take an example of ostriches.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:18.380]   The Book of Job, the letters is quite small,
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.780]   but Book of Job, chapter 39, verse 14 to 16,
[00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:25.140]   describes this, how a mommy ostrich
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:30.140]   does never have any sense of love toward her babies.
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.940]   Have you heard about that?
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.340]   It goes like this.
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.580]   She, a mommy ostrich, lays her eggs on the ground
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:41.060]   and lets them worm in the sand.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.980]   Unmindful that a foot may crush them,
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:48.060]   that some wild animal may trample them.
[00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.340]   She treats her youngs harshly,
[00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:52.580]   as if they were not hers.
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:56.400]   She cares not that her labor was in vain.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.900]   Did you hear me?
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:02.020]   Why is a mommy ostrich like this?
[00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:07.020]   And the following verse, verse 17, gives the answer.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:13.160]   Verse 17, for God did not endow her with wisdom
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:17.960]   or give her a good sense, a share of good sense.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.380]   In other words, ostriches, mommy ostriches,
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.340]   cannot have truly caring love toward their youngs
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:30.340]   because God intentionally did not give the ability to love.
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:38.460]   But in the opposite, why do we humans
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.060]   care so much about love?
[00:11:40.060 --> 00:11:42.420]   Do you care about love?
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:46.220]   Actually, if we express it or not with our mouth,
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.740]   we actually all the time, 24/7, we care for love.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:53.660]   We are flourishing because of love.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.960]   We are dying out lacking love.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.020]   Love is the essence.
[00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.900]   Even though we have been hurt because of love,
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.940]   even though we have a lot of conflicts and troubles,
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:10.380]   because of love, we know that we cannot live without love.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:15.820]   Why is love so essential for human existence?
[00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:18.700]   Because God made us in that way.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.780]   God made us as loving beings.
[00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:24.620]   So the Bible so many times emphasizes that
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:28.420]   God made us in his image, in his image.
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:33.460]   Genesis chapter 1, 27 says,
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:37.140]   "So God created man in his own image.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.040]   "In the image of God, he created him.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:43.460]   "Male and female, he created them."
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.580]   So humans are in God's image.
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:47.020]   You know that, right?
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:49.540]   And then, what is God's image?
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:51.340]   What is God's image?
[00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:54.780]   And verse eight in today's passage says,
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.260]   God is what?
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.380]   God is love.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.140]   God is love and we were created in God's image.
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:02.020]   Do you understand?
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:06.340]   So our essence, being a human, means love.
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:10.020]   So since made in God's image,
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.980]   we were created as loving beings.
[00:13:12.980 --> 00:13:16.740]   This is why love is a gift from God.
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.500]   God made us able to love.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:20.340]   Like what?
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:21.920]   Love between family members,
[00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:23.580]   love between men and women,
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:25.420]   love between brothers and sisters.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.340]   All these forms of true love.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.900]   Now the world are calling so many different ideas love,
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:35.780]   but they are not love.
[00:13:35.780 --> 00:13:38.420]   But God gave us the right forms of love
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:41.460]   and all these right forms of love came from God
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.860]   and we are able to enjoy these loves
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:47.980]   because God gave us that ability.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:52.100]   This is why love is gift from God.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:57.340]   Second, we receive love as a gift
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:14:02.220]   because God redeemed our inability to love.
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:05.020]   Why is it a gift, love is a gift?
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:09.260]   Because God redeemed our inability to love.
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:12.460]   Though God made us as loving beings
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:14.700]   after Adam and Eve's fall, as you know,
[00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:18.740]   we lost the true loving ability.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:23.020]   Are you able to love without fear?
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.260]   We have a lot of fears.
[00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.300]   We cannot love.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:31.460]   We are lonely, but we cannot love.
[00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:36.180]   Our love became so self-centered.
[00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:37.820]   We think we love,
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.780]   but actually we love only for ourselves.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:43.980]   This is the most serious problem in our life.
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:46.660]   We think we love,
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:49.660]   but actually we love only ourselves.
[00:14:49.660 --> 00:14:53.380]   Our self-centered love makes our life really painful
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.620]   and brings conflict so many times.
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:57.420]   Why is your life so painful?
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:02.180]   Why is your life with all kinds of conflicts?
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:04.620]   Because we are self-centered.
[00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:08.980]   In 2 Samuel chapter 13,
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:12.820]   there is a very horrible story in King David's family.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.260]   As you know, King David had many wives,
[00:15:16.260 --> 00:15:18.780]   and Amnon, his name was Amnon,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:21.820]   Amnon was the oldest among all sons.
[00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:25.060]   Amnon had a half-sister named Tamar.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:30.380]   Half-sister meaning that Amnon, this guy, and Tamar,
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:32.460]   they had the same father, King David,
[00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:34.580]   but their mothers were different.
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:39.580]   But Amnon, this guy, began to love his half-sister, Tamar.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.260]   To make a long story short,
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.500]   Amnon asked his father, King David, to send Tamar,
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.460]   that she might take care of him
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.340]   when he was pretending to be ill.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.540]   He was pretending to be ill.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.420]   And then what happened?
[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:59.300]   Amnon raped his sister
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.580]   and had a sexual relationship by force.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.220]   When he was trying to do this,
[00:16:04.220 --> 00:16:06.820]   Tamar was resisting him, saying,
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.900]   "Please don't do this dishonorable thing,
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:13.500]   but ask father to give me to you."
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.260]   Okay, but however, Amnon did not listen to her
[00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:19.140]   and defiled her.
[00:16:19.140 --> 00:16:23.980]   Then after raping her, Amnon's mind abruptly changed.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.340]   He thought he was loving her.
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.980]   He thought, "I love you so much, this much."
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.700]   But right after that, doing the wrong thing,
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:34.900]   his mind changed.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:35.740]   He thought,
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:39.820]   after he was, when he was raping her,
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.060]   Tamar, with the right sense, she resisted him.
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:44.820]   And then this made him angry.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:45.860]   You know what?
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.140]   This made him angry.
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.700]   So he drove her out from his house after the wrongdoing.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.540]   And then 2 Samuel, chapter 13, verse 15,
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:17:01.460]   exposes Amnon's insanely selfish love.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:03.420]   Insanely selfish love.
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.220]   Then Amnon hated her with intense hatred.
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:11.420]   In fact, he hated her more than he had loved her.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:15.340]   Amnon said to her, "Get up and get out."
[00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:16.180]   Is that love?
[00:17:16.180 --> 00:17:22.900]   Insanely selfish love.
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:26.180]   Brothers and sisters, love is so essential
[00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.820]   and central in our lives.
[00:17:28.820 --> 00:17:31.940]   We know that we cannot live without love.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:34.900]   But the problem is that we don't know how to love,
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:36.780]   how to truly love.
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.660]   Many of us are going through bitter
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:40.380]   and painful stage of life
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:44.380]   because we were hurt by others whom we loved,
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.660]   or we hurt others in the name of love.
[00:17:47.660 --> 00:17:51.700]   So we are now quite tired of loving others
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.780]   and scared to love anymore.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.820]   We are tired.
[00:17:55.820 --> 00:18:00.140]   This is why Jesus had to come.
[00:18:00.180 --> 00:18:01.660]   When Jesus died on the cross
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.580]   and shed all this blood for us,
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:05.780]   he renewed our heart.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.460]   He renewed our senses.
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:10.700]   He cleansed our evil and dirty conscience.
[00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.020]   We had a lot of evil and dirty things in our hearts,
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.260]   but Jesus cleansed it and gave us a new heart
[00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:20.180]   that we may be able to love each other again.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:22.580]   Because of Jesus, we can say like this,
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:25.620]   let's love again.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:27.340]   I am dirty.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.780]   You are hurt.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.900]   But we can have the courage to love each other again,
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:36.620]   forgiving each other again, trusting each other again.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:40.700]   Jesus made it possible.
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:47.300]   When I was in my 20s and 30s,
[00:18:47.300 --> 00:18:49.820]   as I shared many times before,
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:53.980]   if you forget this, please remember this only about me.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.660]   Who was I, your pastor?
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:00.860]   In my 20s and 30s, sometimes I was extremely lonely.
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.460]   I was extremely lonely.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.820]   I needed people, but I was afraid of making relationships.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:09.300]   And whenever I tried to approach people,
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:11.780]   I felt fear and burden.
[00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:14.700]   And I even didn't have any hope
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.140]   toward the love between man and woman.
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.900]   Because my heart was so defiled and dirty,
[00:19:19.900 --> 00:19:22.820]   I didn't have any hope toward the marriage
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:23.940]   between man and woman.
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:28.460]   But you know, yeah, I had a lot of fear,
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.460]   guilt, and problems, pride, many problems.
[00:19:32.460 --> 00:19:36.380]   But however, when Jesus entered my life,
[00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.620]   he literally renewed everything in me.
[00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:41.940]   Jesus removed my sins.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:45.300]   Jesus removed my unclean thoughts and behaviors
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.060]   and my fears.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:49.580]   Jesus removed my fears.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.980]   I am not completely free from the fears,
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:54.940]   but removed most of the fears in my life.
[00:19:54.940 --> 00:20:00.100]   When I continuously gave my life to him
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:03.820]   in obedience to him, Jesus filled my heart,
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.220]   filled my life with many meaningful relationships.
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:10.980]   He enabled me to love others,
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.060]   even though it is not perfect.
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.580]   And Jesus gave me my wife and my children.
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:19.100]   Whenever I look at my children and my wife,
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.100]   and whenever I find my heart is loving them
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.900]   without shame, without guilt, without fear,
[00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:26.980]   I know that it is from Jesus.
[00:20:26.980 --> 00:20:29.620]   It is not my love.
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:35.780]   I know that all the people I have and I love,
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.700]   they came from Jesus,
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.660]   especially through his forgiveness
[00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.060]   and the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:44.820]   and the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.820]   I want you to come to the worship.
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.620]   I want you to know Jesus,
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:50.500]   because when you receive the Holy Spirit,
[00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:51.780]   there is the power,
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:54.260]   there is the only one thing that will hold you up,
[00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:57.380]   that will hold your love up
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.380]   with nothing else, with nothing else.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:11.940]   Now I fully know that if I have love, any love,
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.060]   it is not my own ability.
[00:21:14.060 --> 00:21:15.980]   It's all because of Jesus.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.300]   It's all because of Jesus.
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.540]   This is why love is a gift from God,
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:22.940]   the greatest gift in our lives.
[00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.340]   So today I'm giving this message,
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:29.340]   number one, love is the greatest gift in our lives.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.500]   Second, love is the greatest power.
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.700]   Everybody, love is the greatest power.
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:39.500]   There is a very well-known research
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.500]   called Grant and Gluck study, Grant and Gluck study.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.500]   For over 75 years, they researched 456,
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:55.220]   listen, 456 very poor men growing up in Boston
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:59.620]   from 1939 up to 2014.
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.300]   75 years of research, can you imagine?
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.980]   And then 200, in the opposite, in comparison,
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:09.900]   268 male graduates from Harvard University,
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:13.340]   classes of 1939 to 1944.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:14.980]   Very contrasting group.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.940]   Very poor people, very wealthy people.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.540]   And their research, after 75 years later,
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:25.820]   tens of millions of dollars of research investment,
[00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.860]   this research concludes,
[00:22:27.860 --> 00:22:31.100]   the most important single factor in our life
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.940]   that makes our life truly happier and healthier is what?
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:37.980]   Only love.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:42.340]   Not money, not education, not position, nothing else.
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:45.060]   But the single factor that makes human
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:48.060]   really healthy and happy is love.
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:50.660]   Furthermore, when one has,
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:55.340]   when you have this solid and lasting love in your life,
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:00.340]   you feel that life is satisfying and even fulfilling.
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:03.260]   So everything depends on love.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:05.460]   This is the power of love.
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:09.140]   Love is the most important and the greatest power in life.
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:14.900]   Since we forget spiritual things so easily, right?
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:17.100]   You guys forget, but spiritual things,
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.340]   it's easier to forget.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:21.380]   Next week, you don't remember
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:24.300]   what you heard the previous week, right?
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.140]   Since we forget spiritual things so easily,
[00:23:26.140 --> 00:23:29.980]   I repeat some very powerful stories again and again.
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.740]   Some of you guys hear me, heard me,
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.980]   talking about this story again and again.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:40.340]   One of these stories is the man, Nick Vujicic.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.180]   Do you remember Nick Vujicic?
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:45.340]   Yeah, this is the guy.
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.180]   When Nick Vujicic was born,
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.220]   he was now Australian pastor.
[00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:54.580]   When he was born, without two arms, without one legs.
[00:23:54.580 --> 00:23:57.580]   And the remaining one leg is a very tiny little one.
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:23:59.180]   It's not like the real legs.
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:05.020]   So, do you know, even at the age of eight,
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.980]   my second daughter, my first daughter, is now eight.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:11.260]   My daughter's 50s age.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:15.300]   When this guy, Nick Vujicic, when he was only eight years old,
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.700]   he learned about despair.
[00:24:17.700 --> 00:24:22.180]   Only despair.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.660]   He couldn't find any hope in his life.
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:27.100]   He thought no one would love him,
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.260]   or no woman would want to get married to.
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:34.420]   Who will actually love him?
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:36.380]   Look at myself.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:41.380]   But however, in his teens, Nick Vujicic met Jesus Christ.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.660]   And the power of Jesus' love changed him.
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:50.460]   And verse nine in today's passage, it goes like this.
[00:24:50.460 --> 00:24:51.660]   Let's read together.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.820]   This is how God showed his love among us.
[00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:58.140]   He sent his one and only son into the world
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:25:00.780]   that we might live through him.
[00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:04.220]   Nick Vujicic, this brother, began to see hope
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.780]   in his life through Jesus' love.
[00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.860]   He began to see his life as a unique one
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.980]   from God's perspective.
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:15.500]   Before meeting Jesus, he thought, I do not have any hope.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.980]   But after meeting Jesus, Jesus' love changed his heart.
[00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:22.820]   He began to see his life, my life is just unique.
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:28.020]   My body is just unique, a gift from God.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:28.860]   From God.
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.380]   He finished his college degree.
[00:25:34.380 --> 00:25:37.620]   He swims without legs and arms.
[00:25:37.620 --> 00:25:38.620]   He can swim.
[00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:40.820]   He does all kinds of sports.
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.340]   And nothing could stop him.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:46.700]   He drums with his little tiny foot.
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.700]   Yeah, he plays drums.
[00:25:48.700 --> 00:25:50.860]   He enjoys life fully.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:53.300]   And his wonderful character, his heart,
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.580]   and right attitude toward life
[00:25:55.580 --> 00:25:59.580]   made him a very good international speaker.
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:01.500]   He travels all around the world.
[00:26:01.500 --> 00:26:05.420]   And he gives the message about Jesus, message about hope.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.740]   So even though he does not have any arms to hug others,
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:12.140]   hundreds of thousands of people in the world,
[00:26:12.140 --> 00:26:13.660]   they hugged this guy.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.220]   Because they learned how to thank
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:19.260]   and how to love this life on earth.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.580]   And you know what?
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.980]   And finally, look at the picture.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.700]   Finally, a woman, beautiful woman,
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:28.580]   she loved Nick Vujicic.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:31.700]   They got married and have four beautiful children,
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.140]   as you see in the picture.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:36.460]   And where all these miracles start?
[00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:40.500]   Where these miracles start?
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:43.820]   Yes, from Jesus' love.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:47.100]   Love has the greatest power in our life.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:50.900]   When you meet true love, you will surely change,
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.900]   and your life will be surely different.
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:57.660]   And that true love is Jesus, God's love.
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:00.940]   Message is simple.
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.380]   Love is the greatest gift.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.780]   Second, love is the greatest power.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:10.340]   And then, the last one, third, what is love to you?
[00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:11.940]   What is love?
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:16.580]   Third, love is the greatest purpose.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:20.060]   Everybody, love is the greatest purpose.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:24.580]   What does this mean, love is the greatest purpose?
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:27.460]   Since we were made in God's image,
[00:27:27.460 --> 00:27:32.380]   who is love, the very essence of being a human is love.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:37.860]   We were made to love each other fully without fear.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.380]   However, we fall in love with many undesirable.
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:45.860]   We want to love, but we love many undesirable,
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.340]   unhealthy things in our lives.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:55.620]   We love, in other words, we love what we should not love.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:57.700]   Why do people pursue money?
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.300]   Why do people pursue money?
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:03.540]   Yes, they love money more than any other things.
[00:28:03.540 --> 00:28:06.100]   So for those people who love money,
[00:28:06.100 --> 00:28:09.180]   sometimes money is more important than relationship.
[00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:12.660]   Sometimes money is more important than their family.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:16.180]   How about those people pursuing power?
[00:28:16.180 --> 00:28:19.180]   In a month, you know, in a month, in Korea,
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:21.620]   there will be the presidential election.
[00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:24.460]   And then those presidential election candidates,
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:28.180]   they are pursuing power, right, and fame.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:29.940]   That's what they love.
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.940]   For these guys, their candidates,
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:35.340]   like Joe Biden and Donald Trump did,
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.060]   nothing is more important.
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:40.420]   So they almost try to destroy the others
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.500]   through all possible ways to get the power.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.100]   Because for them, power is what they love.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:53.740]   Here is a very famous picture.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.140]   When you look at the left side, you can see a picture.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.780]   The picture is very small,
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:29:01.900]   but there is a very black little child.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:04.180]   She's a Sudanese girl.
[00:29:04.180 --> 00:29:07.660]   And she was going to the food center.
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.220]   On her way to the feeding center,
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.340]   because of hunger, she collapsed on the road
[00:29:13.340 --> 00:29:16.220]   without any power to go on.
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.100]   Do you see, there's a vulture.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.340]   There's a very big, yeah, like eagle,
[00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.540]   a vulture waiting for her to die.
[00:29:24.540 --> 00:29:26.700]   Very tragic picture.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:30.940]   The photographer who took this picture
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.980]   was the guy on the right side.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:37.420]   His name was Kevin Carter, 1993, in Sudan.
[00:29:37.420 --> 00:29:41.740]   At first, this photographer tried to drive away the vulture
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.340]   from the girl for a time.
[00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.220]   However, when this guy was going to the place,
[00:29:47.220 --> 00:29:49.740]   people warned him not to touch anything
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.300]   because it could bring some infection, like coronavirus.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.500]   It was not that serious in those days,
[00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.740]   but some kinds of infection.
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.300]   So he was warned.
[00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:02.420]   At first, he was trying to protect her.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:07.260]   But later, he didn't really try to protect this girl
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:09.100]   and just went away.
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.940]   Next year, because of this picture,
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:16.020]   Kevin Carter, he got Pulitzer Prize.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.580]   Do you know Pulitzer Prize?
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:19.940]   The highest honor for a journalist.
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.100]   However, only a few months later,
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:27.940]   Kevin Carter, this guy, committed suicide.
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:31.700]   He didn't love the girl's life at the moment.
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:34.780]   However, later, when he came to the right mind,
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:37.940]   he realized that he loved the wrong things,
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:41.340]   his career, his report, his safety,
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:46.100]   while neglecting a human's tragic death.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.980]   Do you think that Kevin Carter is a really evil guy?
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.900]   But that's who we are.
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:00.620]   We are choosing the wrong things over the right things.
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:05.380]   We are loving the wrong things over the right things
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:06.620]   most of the time.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:10.900]   That's why the world is not changing.
[00:31:10.900 --> 00:31:13.740]   That's why the church is not being criticized
[00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:16.140]   because we are not changing.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.220]   Because we love so many unhealthy things
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.700]   more than any other things.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:24.100]   We don't know how to love the right things.
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:34.900]   My brothers and sisters, we are like him.
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.180]   We are no better than him.
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.540]   Are you choosing the right thing?
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:44.180]   Or are you neglecting the people you should love
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.020]   in your life?
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:50.780]   We have one life, brothers and sisters.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:52.540]   We have one purpose.
[00:31:52.540 --> 00:31:55.220]   And how do we know the purpose of our lives?
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:01.700]   How do you know what is the purpose of your life?
[00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:03.700]   When we look at what you love.
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:08.340]   When we look at what you love, it shows what you love.
[00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:12.100]   What you care is the purpose of your life.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:16.540]   But Jesus gave us only one command.
[00:32:16.540 --> 00:32:19.260]   Summarizing all the commands in the Old Testament.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:24.580]   316 commands and laws in the Old Testament.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:28.980]   Jesus summarized all the 613 laws into one.
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:32.460]   Like this, love God and love your neighbor
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:34.060]   as you love yourself.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:38.020]   And the last supper, right before going to the cross.
[00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:40.780]   Some hours later, Jesus was going to be killed.
[00:32:40.780 --> 00:32:42.740]   But Jesus gave only one command.
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:48.620]   John 15, chapter 15, verse 17.
[00:32:48.620 --> 00:32:52.340]   This is my command, love each other.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:53.820]   Let's read together.
[00:32:53.820 --> 00:32:57.780]   This is my command, love each other.
[00:32:57.780 --> 00:33:00.340]   According to Jesus' command, there should be only
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:04.620]   one purpose in our lives, which is love.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:09.580]   Love is and should be the greatest purpose in our lives.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.460]   Because love is the greatest gift.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:14.860]   And love is the greatest power in our lives.
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:21.300]   God wants us to live a truly happy and full life.
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.900]   God wants to give us a good life.
[00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:28.460]   And this kind of life comes only through true love.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.540]   Without true love, our life is just empty.
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:36.740]   Without love, life's just empty.
[00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:43.540]   Before closing, I'm gonna give you a very short three tips.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:46.940]   Here are a few practical ideas to help you
[00:33:46.940 --> 00:33:50.460]   to be a man and woman of a true love.
[00:33:50.460 --> 00:33:51.500]   How can we do that?
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:55.820]   Number one, you need to love what is good and real.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:34:01.420]   Listen, you need to love what is good and real.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.700]   You should not love what is not good, what is not real.
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:06.940]   I repeatedly have warned you.
[00:34:06.940 --> 00:34:10.660]   Most of us are seriously addicted to media.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:14.900]   How many hours are you spending your time for media?
[00:34:14.900 --> 00:34:15.980]   Or your money?
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:19.540]   Or shopping?
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.220]   Or sexual temptations?
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.660]   Because you are young people.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:28.100]   God wants to give all those things for true love.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.580]   But if you are addicted to the wrong things,
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:34.420]   God cannot give you the right things.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:40.220]   And those things cannot make you truly happy.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:45.820]   They make you slaves of sin and steal your heart
[00:34:45.820 --> 00:34:47.940]   and destroy your life.
[00:34:47.940 --> 00:34:50.820]   Instead, what is real and what is good,
[00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:53.620]   you need to love God.
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.140]   You need to love God.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:34:58.900]   That is my urge for you guys.
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:02.460]   You should love God.
[00:35:02.460 --> 00:35:05.500]   Not just coming to the Sunday worship is not enough.
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.420]   You should love God more than anything else.
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:14.740]   If you love God, then you'll be blessed.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.780]   How can you love God?
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:19.860]   Make Sunday worship the center of your life.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.220]   My brothers and sisters,
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.940]   make the Sunday worship the center of your life.
[00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:30.460]   Keep Sunday worship in any case.
[00:35:30.460 --> 00:35:31.940]   It's simple.
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.180]   If you neglect Sunday worship,
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.740]   if you choose work over Sunday worship,
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:40.980]   you are loving money more than God.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.980]   You need to make reading God's word
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:47.460]   and praying the first priority in your life.
[00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:50.500]   You need to meet God in your daily life.
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:52.140]   You need to read God's word.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.820]   You need to spend time with God.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:56.180]   That should be the first priority in your life.
[00:35:56.180 --> 00:36:01.140]   I'm telling you the truth again.
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:04.380]   You cannot serve God and money at the same time.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:09.300]   In your life, the greatest enemy,
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.180]   the greatest idol is money.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.660]   You should be careful.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:19.660]   Second, you need to love how to express love through words.
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:21.980]   How is your mouth?
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.820]   Your words has a lot of power.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.340]   You need to learn how to hold up your mouth.
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:33.740]   We speak so many useless, negative, and destructive words.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.740]   Then we mess up our relationship.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:39.220]   Why our relationships are messed up, broken?
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.020]   Mostly because of our hearts and because of our words.
[00:36:42.020 --> 00:36:46.540]   And then we have been reinforced to spit,
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:50.340]   to spit poisonous words throughout our lives continuously.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:54.820]   Actually, when we are doing it,
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.620]   we are killing and ruining our families
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:00.540]   and people around us through our words.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:02.380]   And we cannot change ourselves.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:03.900]   Sometimes we understand that
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:06.060]   we are spitting out very poisonous words.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.500]   But can you change yourself?
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.820]   Can you change your mouth?
[00:37:10.820 --> 00:37:12.700]   Why can't you change?
[00:37:12.700 --> 00:37:15.660]   Because before that, you need to change your heart.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.220]   You need to change your heart.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:23.660]   When can we change?
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.980]   When we are filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:30.740]   This is why you should love the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:30.740 --> 00:37:32.420]   Do you desire the Holy Spirit?
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:35.100]   Do you desire the Holy Spirit?
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:37.820]   Holy Spirit, you are the first one I want to get,
[00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.260]   I want to receive, I want to spend time with.
[00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:45.020]   When you love the Holy Spirit, He will change you.
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:49.260]   He will change your heart, your mouth, and your behavior.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.300]   You know what?
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:55.580]   We remember a really beautiful word someone spoke to us.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.180]   When I was working as a teacher,
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.820]   a woman sister who was much younger than I,
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.180]   she spoke one word to me,
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:06.020]   maybe more than around 20 years ago.
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:07.940]   But I cherish the expression
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:10.060]   because it really pleased me.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:12.060]   Very kind and honoring word.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.780]   But how about this?
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:18.300]   Instead, we cannot forget some very hurtful words
[00:38:18.300 --> 00:38:20.620]   someone told us many, many years ago.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:24.100]   Word has great power.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.340]   We need to learn how to love each other through words.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:30.380]   Third, the last one.
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:31.900]   Love is spiritual.
[00:38:31.900 --> 00:38:33.260]   Love is spiritual.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:34.660]   What does that mean?
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:38.500]   Love includes some emotional parts, I know.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:39.940]   Emotion is very important.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:44.940]   However, ultimately, love is from God and it is spiritual.
[00:38:44.940 --> 00:38:48.740]   So if you follow the way of God, what does that mean?
[00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.820]   Love is spiritual, what does that mean?
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:53.700]   If you follow the way of God,
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.780]   if you obey God's word,
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.140]   you'll be better ready to love.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:01.540]   Your heart will be better ready to love on a daily basis.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:03.860]   But if you do not follow the way of God,
[00:39:03.860 --> 00:39:06.740]   if you do not obey the way of God,
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:09.620]   you will never be able to love others.
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:13.620]   Love belongs to God.
[00:39:13.620 --> 00:39:16.540]   We cannot love others by ourselves.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.140]   Whenever we gather without Jesus, it's a tragedy.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:22.420]   You know, church is not a safe place.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.220]   Without Jesus, we can't hurt each other.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:29.860]   Only when we gather with Jesus, in the name of Jesus,
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:33.060]   whenever we worship, that is the time we are healed
[00:39:33.060 --> 00:39:35.740]   and our relationship will be different.
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:40.340]   Let me close.
[00:39:40.340 --> 00:39:46.580]   Listen, remember, love is the greatest gift coming from God,
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:51.020]   the greatest power coming from God's love and forgiveness.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:55.380]   And love is the greatest purpose of our life,
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:57.860]   found only in God.
