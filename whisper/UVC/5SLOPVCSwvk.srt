1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [no audio]

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Well, good morning. I just want to start by saying how grateful I am to be here

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 and how grateful I am to you all for having me and my family here.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 [Cantonese]

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 We love Urban Voice and love the time that we've spent here, and being here today is really special for us.

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 It feels like a little reunion seeing a lot of good friends again, so it's a blessing.

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 [Cantonese]

8
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 And this time of year is a special time of year, time of year that I enjoy when we celebrate Christmas.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:55,000
 [Cantonese]

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 I enjoy the get-togethers like today, the food, the decorations, all of those things.

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 [Cantonese]

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 I even like the Christmas movies, all the good ones and the cheesy ones that are on TV all the time this year.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 [Cantonese]

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 But this morning I want us to think a little bit about the meaning of Christmas and what the heart of the meaning is.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 [Cantonese]

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Because Christmas is much more than just the gifts and the decorations and the lights and the time with family and friends.

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 Those things are wonderful, but the meaning is deeper than that.

18
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 [Cantonese]

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 So let's look at a few verses in the book of Luke, chapter 2.

20
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 [Cantonese]

21
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 We're going to read verses 8 to 14.

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 [Cantonese]

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 These verses come from right after the birth of Jesus.

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 [Cantonese]

25
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 Jesus has just been born in Bethlehem in the stable.

26
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 [Cantonese]

27
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And the Bible tells us that there were shepherds living out in the fields nearby, keeping watch over their flocks at night.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 [Cantonese]

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 [Cantonese]

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid.

32
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 [Cantonese]

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,000
 I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people.

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 [Cantonese]

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Today, in the town of David, a Savior has been born to you.

36
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 [Cantonese]

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 He is Christ, the Lord.

38
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 This will be a sign to you.

39
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.

40
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 [Cantonese]

41
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Suddenly, a great company of the heavenly host appeared with the angel.

42
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 [Cantonese]

43
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Praising God and saying, "Glory to God in the highest."

44
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 [Cantonese]

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 And on earth, peace to men, among whom his favor rests.

46
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 [Cantonese]

47
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 Now these verses tell us that the birth of Jesus was good news, really good news.

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 [Cantonese]

49
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 In fact, verse 10 specifically tells us it was good news of great joy to all people.

50
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 [Cantonese]

51
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 But why? Why was it such good news?

52
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 [Cantonese]

53
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Why was this such a special event?

54
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 [Cantonese]

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 To begin to answer that question,

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
 [Cantonese]

57
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 we have to zoom out a little bit and consider the place of the Christmas story in human history.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 [Cantonese]

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 The Bible details to us God's work throughout history.

60
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 [Cantonese]

61
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And although the Bible contains many different stories,

62
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 [Cantonese]

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 it's really one big story.

64
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 [Cantonese]

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 One grand narrative that runs from beginning to end.

66
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 [Cantonese]

67
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 It has a lot of different climatic moments.

68
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 [Cantonese]

69
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 And the Christmas story is a climatic moment in the Bible.

70
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 [Cantonese]

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 But it's not the beginning of the story.

72
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 [Cantonese]

73
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 And it's not the end of the story either.

74
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 [Cantonese]

75
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 To start to grasp the importance of the birth of Jesus,

76
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 [Cantonese]

77
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 we need to go back to the beginning of the story

78
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 when God began to work with humans.

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 [Cantonese]

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 The story of the Bible begins with the act of creation.

81
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 [Cantonese]

82
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Now before creation there was God.

83
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 [Cantonese]

84
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 The scripture tells us that he has always existed.

85
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 [Cantonese]

86
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 He has no beginning or end. He is uncreated. He has always been.

87
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 [Cantonese]

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Earth did have a beginning and so did we.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 [Cantonese]

90
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 God spoke the earth into existence.

91
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 [Cantonese]

92
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 He created out of nothing from the force of his power and wisdom.

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 [Cantonese]

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 And he made everything on the earth including us.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 [Cantonese]

96
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 God created us and made us uniquely in his image.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 [Cantonese]

98
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Nothing else that he made was made in his image.

99
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 [Cantonese]

100
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 Humans are very special in that regard.

101
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 [Cantonese]

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Now being made in his image means many beautiful things for us.

103
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 [Cantonese]

104
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 But one thing that it means is that we are relational

105
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 beings.

106
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 [Cantonese]

107
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 God created us for relationship.

108
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 [Cantonese]

109
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 He created us for a right and healthy relationship to him.

110
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 [Cantonese]

111
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 And for right and healthy relationships with one another.

112
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 [Cantonese]

113
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But not long after the moment of creation,

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 [Cantonese]

115
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 there was a problem.

116
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 And it was us.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 [Cantonese]

118
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 See, we as humans have always thought we're a little bit smarter than God.

119
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 [Cantonese]

120
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And that we could really improve on the world he made if only we were in charge.

121
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 [Cantonese]

122
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 And the very first man and woman decided they didn't want to let God be in control.

123
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,000
 [Cantonese]

124
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 They didn't want to follow his instructions.

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 [Cantonese]

126
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 They felt like they could do better making their own choices.

127
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 [Cantonese]

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And so they chose to reject God.

129
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 [Cantonese]

130
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 And to reject his instructions for life.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 [Cantonese]

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 And that was the first broken relationship.

133
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
 [Cantonese]

134
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 The first breakup that happened.

135
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 [Cantonese]

136
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 And it wasn't God, it was us.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 [Cantonese]

138
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 We're the ones who said, "God, it's not me, it's you. It's your fault."

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 [Cantonese]

140
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 "I want to go my own way and do things on my own."

141
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 [Cantonese]

142
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 And ever since that moment throughout time,

143
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 [Cantonese]

144
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 all of us have made that same choice.

145
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 [Cantonese]

146
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 All of us at some point have chosen to reject God.

147
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 [Cantonese]

148
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And to pursue our own comfort and our own ideas and what seems best to us.

149
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 [Cantonese]

150
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And that has led to all of the pain and the heartache of the human condition.

151
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 [Cantonese]

152
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Instead of choosing right relationship with God and each other,

153
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 [Cantonese]

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 we choose to please ourselves.

155
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 [Cantonese]

156
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And out of this comes selfishness,

157
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 and greed and lust and oppression, hatred, wars, jealousy, racism, lies, betrayal, theft,

158
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 the list goes on and on, all these things.

159
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 [Cantonese]

160
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 And the reality is there's not any one of us who hasn't done that.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 [Cantonese]

162
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 Everyone in this room has at some point acted selfishly.

163
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 [Cantonese]

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Or done something to hurt another human.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 [Cantonese]

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 We've all done that, I certainly have.

167
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 [Cantonese]

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 All of us have sinned and fallen short of what God wants us to be.

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 [Cantonese]

170
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 But there's a glimmer of hope here.

171
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 [Cantonese]

172
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 And that is that God wasn't okay with a broken relationship.

173
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 [Cantonese]

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 God didn't want to leave it that way.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 [Cantonese]

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 So God had a plan from the very beginning.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 [Cantonese]

178
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 His plan was to restore and heal our relationship.

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 [Cantonese]

180
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 To make things right.

181
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 [Cantonese]

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 And to make a way for us to be forgiven.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 [Cantonese]

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 God's plan was to send us something.

185
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 [Cantonese]

186
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 Or rather someone.

187
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 [Cantonese]

188
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 God didn't choose to send us a letter or a text or a voicemail.

189
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 [Cantonese]

190
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Not an email or a DM or any other kind of message.

191
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 [Cantonese]

192
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 God sent his only son.

193
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 [Cantonese]

194
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And that's who Jesus was.

195
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 [Cantonese]

196
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 The son of God sent on a rescue mission.

197
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 [Cantonese]

198
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 To heal and restore and ultimately save us.

199
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 [Cantonese]

200
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 That's why in verse 10 the angel says the birth of Jesus is good news of great joy.

201
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 [Cantonese]

202
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 Jesus was the first gift of the first Christmas.

203
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 [Cantonese]

204
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 And God gave this gift to all of us.

205
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 [Cantonese]

206
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,000
 Every human that has ever lived or ever will live on the earth.

207
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 [Cantonese]

208
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 God gave us this gift of his son.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 [Cantonese]

210
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And through his son.

211
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 [Cantonese]

212
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 The gift of relationship with our creator.

213
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 [Cantonese]

214
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 But how is it that Jesus could rescue us?

215
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 [Cantonese]

216
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 And what was it about his birth that was so different than all the other births?

217
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 [Cantonese]

218
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 The Bible tells us that Jesus was and is someone very special.

219
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 [Cantonese]

220
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Because he was the son of God.

221
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 [Cantonese]

222
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 He was fully God.

223
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 [Cantonese]

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 And yet also fully human.

225
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 [Cantonese]

226
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 The book of John chapter 1 tells us that Jesus is the word of God made flesh.

227
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 [Cantonese]

228
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 The revealing of all that God is.

229
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 [Cantonese]

230
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 That means all of God's justice, God's love, God's peace, and infinitely more than that

231
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 brought together into human flesh.

232
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 [Cantonese]

233
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 Full of grace and truth.

234
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 [Cantonese]

235
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Jesus was Emmanuel.

236
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 [Cantonese]

237
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 God with us.

238
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 [Cantonese]

239
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 Notice in verse 14, the original language doesn't just communicate peace to us.

240
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 [Cantonese]

241
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 It communicates peace among us.

242
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 [Cantonese]

243
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 Jesus was the manifestation of God.

244
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 [Cantonese]

245
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Not just to show us who God is.

246
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 [Cantonese]

247
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 But to be with us.

248
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 [Cantonese]

249
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
 To live among us.

250
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 [Cantonese]

251
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And to make us able to live with God.

252
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 [Cantonese]

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Jesus left the comfort of heaven to do this.

254
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 [Cantonese]

255
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 He made himself subject to all the limitations and brokenness of humanity.

256
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 [Cantonese]

257
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 So that he could rescue us.

258
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 [Cantonese]

259
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Because he was human.

260
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 [Cantonese]

261
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 Jesus dealt with every struggle that we deal with.

262
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 [Cantonese]

263
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 He became tired.

264
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 [Cantonese]

265
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 He experienced hunger.

266
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 [Cantonese]

267
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 He got cold.

268
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 [Cantonese]

269
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 All of those things that happened to us.

270
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 [Cantonese]

271
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 He was also tempted to reject God and sin just like we are.

272
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 [Cantonese]

273
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 He was tempted to be angry.

274
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 [Cantonese]

275
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 To be selfish.

276
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 [Cantonese]

277
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 To lust.

278
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 [Cantonese]

279
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 To seek revenge on those who had wronged him.

280
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 [Cantonese]

281
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 He was tempted to be greedy and pursue his own comfort.

282
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 [Cantonese]

283
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 He was tempted to be lazy and to be fearful and to give in to his fears.

284
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 [Cantonese]

285
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 He was tempted to be consumed with anxiety and to be stressed and worried.

286
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 [Cantonese]

287
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 All the things that challenge us and hurt us.

288
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 [Cantonese]

289
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 He dealt with those same things.

290
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 [Cantonese]

291
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 But in all those temptations he didn't sin.

292
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 [Cantonese]

293
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 He didn't give in to any of those things.

294
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 [Cantonese]

295
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,000
 He loved and served and healed those that he met here on earth.

296
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 [Cantonese]

297
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 And at the end of his life, he gave himself as a sacrifice for us.

298
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 [Cantonese]

299
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 He died on a cross.

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 [Cantonese]

301
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 Murdered in a way that he never deserved.

302
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 [Cantonese]

303
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 So that he could win life for us.

304
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 [Cantonese]

305
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 In a way that we never deserved.

306
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 [Cantonese]

307
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 He traded his perfection for our brokenness.

308
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 [Cantonese]

309
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 So that through him, we might find perfection and have our brokenness restored.

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 [Cantonese]

311
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 His death in our place gave us an opportunity to know our creator.

312
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 [Cantonese]

313
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 But he didn't stay dead.

314
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 [Cantonese]

315
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 After three days he was gloriously resurrected.

316
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 [Cantonese]

317
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 And he defeated death once for all.

318
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 [Cantonese]

319
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 He opened a doorway to freedom.

320
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 [Cantonese]

321
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 From sin and death.

322
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 [Cantonese]

323
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 He opened a doorway to relationship with our creator.

324
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 [Cantonese]

325
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 And he opened a doorway to heaven and eternal life for those who believe in him.

326
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
 [Cantonese]

327
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 That's why his birth was good news.

328
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
 [Cantonese]

329
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 It was the beginning of God's great rescue plan to restore us.

330
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 [Cantonese]

331
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 The arrival of Jesus was the first step in our healing.

332
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 [Cantonese]

333
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 And that brings us to another unique and powerful truth about the birth of Jesus.

334
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 [Cantonese]

335
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 And that is the intentional nature of Jesus stepping into our world.

336
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 [Cantonese]

337
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 He did it on purpose.

338
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 [Cantonese]

339
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 Have you ever thought about the fact that Jesus actually chose where he would be born?

340
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 [Cantonese]

341
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 He's the only person in history who's been able to do that.

342
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 [Cantonese]

343
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 If you could go back and choose your birth,

344
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 [Cantonese]

345
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 your family, where you would be born,

346
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 [Cantonese]

347
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 maybe there's something that you would change.

348
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 [Cantonese]

349
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,000
 But Jesus did have the opportunity to choose.

350
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 [Cantonese]

351
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 He could have been born anywhere to any parents.

352
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 [Cantonese]

353
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 But he chose to be born to an unknown, poor, and hard-working couple

354
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 from a tiny, struggling town in an oppressed country.

355
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 [Cantonese]

356
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 When Jesus was born,

357
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 [Cantonese]

358
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 Rome ruled his homeland.

359
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 [Cantonese]

360
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 A Caesar sat at the pinnacle of human power in Europe.

361
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 [Cantonese]

362
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 And the Han Dynasty sat at the pinnacle of human power in Asia.

363
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,000
 [Cantonese]

364
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
 There were kings throughout the world.

365
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 [Cantonese]

366
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Influential families,

367
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 [Cantonese]

368
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 wealthy clans,

369
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 [Cantonese]

370
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 people with palaces and grand estates.

371
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 [Cantonese]

372
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And riches and servants and animals.

373
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 [Cantonese]

374
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 But Jesus didn't choose to be born there.

375
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 [Cantonese]

376
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 He didn't choose to be born in a capital city.

377
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 [Cantonese]

378
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Or in a palace.

379
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 [Cantonese]

380
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 He chose to be born in a country that was suffering under heavy oppression.

381
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 [Cantonese]

382
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 He was born in a small town so full of travelers,

383
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 [Cantonese]

384
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 that his parents couldn't even find a decent room.

385
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:14,000
 [Cantonese]

386
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 He was born in a place where animals were kept.

387
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 [Cantonese]

388
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 And his first bed was literally a feeding trough.

389
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 [Cantonese]

390
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 This shows us clearly that Jesus

391
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 [Cantonese]

392
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 purposely entered into our brokenness.

393
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 [Cantonese]

394
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 He didn't just barely approach us and hold his nose to get away from the stench.

395
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 [Cantonese]

396
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 He didn't just come around the corners of our brokenness and mostly avoid it.

397
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 [Cantonese]

398
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 He dove straight into the middle of our human mess.

399
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 [Cantonese]

400
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 He saw us at our very worst.

401
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 [Cantonese]

402
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And he loved us there.

403
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 [Cantonese]

404
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 And he knowingly walked straight into all of our chaos.

405
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 [Cantonese]

406
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 And that's good news.

407
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 [Cantonese]

408
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 That is such good news.

409
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 [Cantonese]

410
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 Because we humans are still a mess.

411
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 [Cantonese]

412
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 Our lives are still full of brokenness and chaos.

413
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 [Cantonese]

414
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 We have struggle and hurt and pain.

415
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 [Cantonese]

416
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 But Jesus showed us beyond a shadow of a doubt

417
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 [Cantonese]

418
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 that our brokenness doesn't keep him away.

419
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 [Cantonese]

420
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 He's here to fix the worst that we could have to offer.

421
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 [Cantonese]

422
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 There's nothing too broken that he can't fix.

423
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 [Cantonese]

424
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 There's nothing or no one too dirty that he can't cleanse.

425
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 [Cantonese]

426
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 There's no pain or hurt too deep that he can't heal.

427
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 [Cantonese]

428
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 And there's nothing so dark that he cannot forgive it.

429
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 [Cantonese]

430
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 And that is good news.

431
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 [Cantonese]

432
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 News of great joy to all people.

433
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 [Cantonese]

434
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:52,000
 That's why the birth of Jesus was such a big deal.

435
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 [Cantonese]

436
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 That's why heaven was celebrating that night.

437
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 [Cantonese]

438
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Stars were moving in the heavens.

439
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 [Cantonese]

440
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 Angels were singing.

441
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 [Cantonese]

442
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 That's why we still celebrate.

443
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 [Cantonese]

444
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Over 2,000 years later,

445
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 [Cantonese]

446
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 we still talk about that night and we sing about it.

447
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 [Cantonese]

448
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 Because of what it meant.

449
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 [Cantonese]

450
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Jesus stepped into our brokenness to bring healing.

451
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 [Cantonese]

452
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 Now there are just three points of application

453
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 [Cantonese]

454
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I want us to think about as we close.

455
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 [Cantonese]

456
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 First of all, perhaps there are some people here today

457
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 who don't have relationship with Jesus.

458
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 [Cantonese]

459
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 Maybe you've never heard much of this story before.

460
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 [Cantonese]

461
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Maybe you always thought Christmas was just about Santa

462
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 and presents and ugly sweaters.

463
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 [Cantonese]

464
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 [Laughter]

465
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Maybe even Christmas is a difficult time for you,

466
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 something that you don't really like.

467
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 [Cantonese]

468
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 That's okay.

469
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 [Cantonese]

470
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 Maybe your life is messy.

471
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 [Cantonese]

472
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 The good news for you

473
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 [Cantonese]

474
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 is that's why Jesus came.

475
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 [Cantonese]

476
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 If you're experiencing brokenness

477
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 [Cantonese]

478
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 if there's difficulty in your relationship with family and friends

479
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 [Cantonese]

480
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 or in your marriage or your job

481
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 [Cantonese]

482
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 or your emotional or mental health

483
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 [Cantonese]

484
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 or your finances or you're trapped in some type of addiction or pain

485
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 [Cantonese]

486
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 the good news for you

487
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 [Cantonese]

488
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 is that Jesus has chosen to show up

489
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 [Cantonese]

490
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 right where you are

491
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 [Cantonese]

492
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 in the middle of all the pain and brokenness

493
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 [Cantonese]

494
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 and there's nothing he can't fix.

495
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 [Cantonese]

496
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 If you're willing to believe on him

497
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 [Cantonese]

498
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 and follow him

499
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 [Cantonese]

500
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 then he'll begin to heal your mess

501
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 [Cantonese]

502
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 and bring you back into that healthy and right relationship with God

503
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 [Cantonese]

504
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 that you were created for.

505
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 [Cantonese]

506
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 This is the good news for you.

507
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 [Cantonese]

508
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 Jesus has seen you at your worst

509
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 [Cantonese]

510
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 and loved you.

511
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 [Cantonese]

512
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 Call out to him for help

513
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 [Cantonese]

514
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 and if you're open to relationship with him

515
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 [Cantonese]

516
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 he's waiting with open arms for you.

517
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 [Cantonese]

518
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Second

519
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,000
 [Cantonese]

520
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 maybe you're here today and you already have relationship with Jesus

521
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 [Cantonese]

522
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 maybe you've had that relationship for a short time or a long time

523
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 [Cantonese]

524
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 but there's still some mess in your life

525
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 [Cantonese]

526
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 just because we're a Christian, a follower of Jesus

527
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 [Cantonese]

528
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 doesn't mean everything is easy

529
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 [Cantonese]

530
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 we still struggle

531
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
 and have pain and hurt

532
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 [Cantonese]

533
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 the good news for you

534
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 [Cantonese]

535
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 is that the same Jesus who saved you

536
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 [Cantonese]

537
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 wants to be at work in your life right now

538
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 [Cantonese]

539
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 redeeming the mess

540
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
 [Cantonese]

541
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 fixing those broken things

542
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 [Cantonese]

543
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 healing you

544
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,000
 [Cantonese]

545
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 turning the ashes of your failure and my failure into the beauties of his grace

546
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 [Cantonese]

547
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 if you're in that position this morning

548
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 [Cantonese]

549
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 maybe you're trying to hide some of those messy corners of your life in your heart

550
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 [Cantonese]

551
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 from Jesus

552
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 [Cantonese]

553
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 but if you're burdened and struggling

554
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
