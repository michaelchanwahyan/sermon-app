1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,640
 Good morning family and welcome. I'm excited that we're here again together to open God's Word.

2
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:12,720
 And once again we're looking at the Kingdom Values found in the Sermon on the Mount, Matthew chapter 7.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:20,120
 And today is kind of a special day and an exciting day because we are finishing up this study of Kingdom Values.

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,600
 We're finishing up the study of the Sermon on the Mount.

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,640
 And we have been looking at it for a very long time now, for over a year.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,800
 There is so much truth in this passage and so we've just been kind of going really slow verse by verse

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,320
 and mining those truths, digging those things out.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,280
 And I'm excited that we've gotten this far. I appreciate you all for sticking with it.

9
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,800
 I know this has been a long study and if you've been watching this from the beginning

10
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,440
 then you've been in this passage of scripture for a long time.

11
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,680
 But it's really so good for us and has so much truth and so much that we've learned.

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,000
 I hope that on this journey of walking through this passage that you've really learned a lot of God's truth.

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,640
 It's been really transformative to my heart and to my life.

14
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:10,960
 And I pray that it's been transformative to your heart and to your life as well.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,160
 But today we're going to finish it up.

16
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,280
 We're in the last couple verses of Matthew chapter 7 verses 28 and 29.

17
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,000
 So let's read these verses together and consider what they're saying to us this morning.

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,440
 This is Matthew 7 verses 28 and 29. It says this,

19
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,720
 "And when Jesus finished these things, the crowds were astonished at his teaching.

20
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:44,480
 For he was teaching them as one who had authority and not as their scribes."

21
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:49,840
 Now this is just kind of a little coda tacked onto the end of the Sermon on the Mount.

22
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,720
 It doesn't seem like it's really that significant, these two verses.

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:57,880
 But there actually is a lot of significant truth here that I want us to consider today.

24
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:06,320
 What does it mean when it says that Jesus was teaching them as one who had authority and not as their scribes?

25
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,560
 In verse 28 we see that it's pretty clear that whatever way Jesus was teaching,

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:15,840
 it was really revolutionary to his listeners, to the people who were listening.

27
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,200
 Verse 28 says they were astonished at his teaching.

28
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
 They couldn't believe what they were hearing.

29
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:27,080
 And verse 29 tells us that what was astonishing to them was the authority that he taught with.

30
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,360
 The authority that he taught with.

31
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,440
 And what was that referring to?

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,840
 Well, in Jesus' day and in his time, the scribes were people who knew the Scripture very well.

33
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,520
 The Pharisees, many of them would have been scribes as well.

34
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:47,400
 They were scholars of the Scripture and of the Old Testament Scripture.

35
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:54,960
 And not just of the Scripture, but of all of the rabbinical teachings that they practiced in Judaism along with the Scripture.

36
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,720
 And so the scribes were these people who were scholars that really knew the Bible,

37
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:07,360
 knew all these other rabbinical teachings, knew all this minutiae and these obscure facts about the meaning and all these things like that.

38
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:14,520
 And so these scribes were people who taught and who expressed that scholarship to others in the synagogues.

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,560
 And people were used to hearing this type of teaching.

40
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,520
 But Jesus was teaching in a way that was very, very different.

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:30,120
 I think what we see in this passage is that Jesus was teaching different because Jesus was teaching on his own authority,

42
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,240
 while the scribes taught based on scholarship.

43
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:41,040
 The scribes taught in a way that's very similar to the way that we often teach today the Bible, the New Testament and the Old Testament.

44
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:49,240
 By looking at the context, by looking at the history, by looking at what other people have said about the passage and how they've interpreted it,

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:53,320
 and trying to determine what the meaning of the passage is.

46
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,160
 That's how the scribes taught.

47
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,720
 They taught based upon their scholarship, based upon their knowledge, based upon the things they had read,

48
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:07,720
 based upon the things that they had been taught by others, based upon the knowledge that they had gained in their lifetime of study.

49
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,000
 And there's nothing wrong with that.

50
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,280
 But Jesus was teaching in a very different way.

51
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,960
 Jesus was not teaching based upon his scholarship.

52
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,080
 Jesus was teaching based upon his own authority.

53
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:29,440
 We actually see this in Matthew chapter 5, in verses 21 and 22 and 27, where Jesus says, "You have heard this.

54
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,800
 You've been taught this.

55
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,040
 You've been told that it was this way.

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,200
 But I say to you..."

57
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,880
 That's an example of what we're talking about here.

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,240
 Jesus was saying, "You've been taught by the scribes, by the scholars, by the people who say they understand the scripture,

59
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:52,080
 and they've taught you that things are like this, or that obeying God is like this, a relationship to God is like this.

60
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,240
 But I am telling you that it's different.

61
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,160
 I am telling you, based upon my own authority, that relationship to God is different than you think,

62
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:08,000
 or relationship to God is different than what you've heard, or relationship to God is different than what you've been told."

63
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 Jesus was teaching on his own authority.

64
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,200
 Now, how is it that Jesus could speak with this authority?

65
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,920
 And that was what was so astonishing to the people that were listening.

66
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:23,000
 They were like, "I can't believe this guy, a carpenter from Nazareth,

67
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:30,720
 in Galilee, in this rural, unheard of place, is teaching with this kind of authority."

68
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,120
 Obviously, there was clear, deep truth and wisdom in what Jesus was saying.

69
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:45,600
 And Jesus was able to really incisively and perceptively really cut through a lot of the cultural trappings

70
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,200
 and all the other things that were so confusing that the scholars got caught up in.

71
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,800
 They argued about all the minutiae, just like scholars today argue about all the minutiae of different things.

72
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,560
 And Jesus was able to cut through that and to speak clearly and succinctly to the issues.

73
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,200
 So I think that was a part of what people were astonished at.

74
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:10,000
 But they were also astonished at the fact that Jesus was not only teaching with amazing wisdom and amazing perception

75
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,480
 and amazing understanding of God's truth, but he was saying, "Hey, believe this because I'm telling you."

76
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:19,680
 He was calling them to believe it based on his own authority.

77
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,280
 And that was just mind-blowing. It was just astonishing.

78
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,720
 How could he do that? How could he claim to know that much about God and about relationship to God?

79
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,200
 How could he claim to know that much about the truth? How could he claim to know that much?

80
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:39,200
 And that's what was astonishing to the people.

81
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:44,960
 And that's a question that I want us to examine today for us as well.

82
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,680
 How do we know that Jesus was able to speak with such authority?

83
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,640
 How do we know that all these things he's saying in the Sermon on the Mountain, throughout the Gospels, really are right and true?

84
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:01,840
 And first, I want us to consider this, that Jesus speaks with authority because he is the Word of God,

85
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:07,280
 or the truth of God, or the knowledge of God. That's who Jesus is.

86
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,920
 Let's look at the book of John, the very beginning of the book of John.

87
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:14,000
 In chapter 1, verse 1, we'll read the first five verses. It says this,

88
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:19,840
 "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.

89
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,520
 He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him,

90
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,920
 and without him was not anything made that was made. In him was life,

91
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:34,000
 and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it."

92
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,800
 Now that first verse says, "In the beginning was the Word."

93
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:45,840
 And in the original language, that word is "logos," and it's this word that is talking about the knowledge, the truth of God.

94
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,560
 And we know from Scripture that God's knowledge encompasses everything. God knows everything in the universe.

95
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,560
 And then as this passage goes on, it says, "The Word was God," that that knowledge, that the truth of God,

96
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,800
 is a part of God's character, it's a part of who he is. And then it says, "And the Word was God."

97
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:12,400
 And then it says, "He was in the beginning with God." So we start to see that the Word is embodied in the Godhead.

98
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:18,480
 It's embodied in a person. And as we read on through this passage, we start to see that the Word,

99
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:23,040
 the knowledge of God, the truth of God, is embodied in the person of Jesus Christ.

100
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,720
 "All things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made."

101
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,480
 That tells us about the deity of Christ. "In him was life, and that life was the light of men."

102
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:38,400
 And as you go on and read in John 1, it becomes clear that it is talking about Jesus,

103
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:46,320
 the one who came to earth to be our Savior. Jesus is the embodiment of truth.

104
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,640
 Jesus is the embodiment of God's wisdom, of God's knowledge, of God's understanding.

105
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,480
 Jesus is the embodiment of those things. All of the knowledge and wisdom and truth of God,

106
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:08,400
 which is all of the knowledge and wisdom and truth in the universe, because God is omniscient. He knows all.

107
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:16,400
 It's all wrapped up and embodied and personified in Jesus Christ. The scripture is clear about that.

108
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:22,720
 And so when Jesus began to speak about truth and wisdom and knowledge,

109
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,120
 he knew exactly what he was talking about because it was him.

110
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:33,120
 That's a very difficult thing for us to understand because we think of truth and wisdom and knowledge

111
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,080
 and those types of things as being outside of ourselves, as being some type of standard that

112
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:46,080
 that we may compare something to, but not as being a part of us. And that is true for us as human beings

113
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:51,760
 because we are imperfect and our knowledge is limited. And there are many things that we do not

114
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,720
 know and many things that we do not understand in many areas where we do not have wisdom.

115
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,240
 But that is not true of God. God is different than us. God is completely beyond us in every way.

116
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:11,120
 God is in a class by himself. And God ultimately is the standard of righteousness and holiness and goodness.

117
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,280
 God himself is the standard. How do we know what goodness is? We know that because God has revealed

118
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:25,120
 to us who he is. He has revealed his character to us. And we know goodness because we know God.

119
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,360
 And as we know God more, we begin to understand more of what goodness truly is. How do we know

120
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,400
 what righteousness is or what holiness is? How do we know what pleases God and what's the right

121
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,560
 way for us to live and what's the right way for us to treat other people? How do we know what

122
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:44,480
 justice is? How do we know those things? Do we define them ourselves? Do we try to imagine what

123
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
 we think would be best in the world or what we think would be a standard of right or what we

124
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,400
 think would be holy or sacred? No, those things are defined by God himself and by his character.

125
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:04,160
 Who he is defines to us what is right, what is just, what is holy, what is sacred, what is sinful and

126
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:11,040
 evil and wrong and off limits. All of those things are defined by God. And God personifies those good

127
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,080
 things, those good attributes of his character in perfection. God is perfectly holy. God is

128
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:21,600
 perfectly just. God is perfectly righteous. God is perfectly good. He personifies those things

129
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,920
 completely in perfection. And in that way, God is the standard of what those things are in our lives

130
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:34,800
 and in the universe. God's the standard of goodness, righteousness, holiness, justice, everything else.

131
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:45,600
 Jesus being fully God was the standard of righteousness and of holiness and of truth.

132
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,400
 And so when Jesus began to talk about these things, he knew what he was talking about

133
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:56,800
 because this was him. This was who he was. This was his character. To begin to speak about the

134
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:03,520
 values of the kingdom was to begin to speak about his own character. Jesus was the earthly

135
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:08,960
 personification of these things. And so when he said in verse 21 and verse 27, "Listen, I know

136
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,200
 you've heard from other people that this is what it looks like to be right with God, or this is

137
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,840
 what God wants, or this is what righteousness looks like, but I'm telling you something different."

138
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:23,440
 He knew exactly what he was talking about and he meant exactly what he said because he was

139
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,880
 the personification of those values of that goodness, of that righteousness, of that holiness.

140
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:37,920
 Jesus spoke with this authority and Jesus still in our day speaks with this authority because he

141
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:44,560
 is the word of God. He is the truth of God. He is the wisdom and the knowledge of God,

142
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,280
 personified and embodied in human form.

143
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:56,880
 Jesus was also able to speak with authority because he is perfect relationship with God.

144
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:03,280
 That's one of the huge things in the Sermon on the Mount that I hope you did not miss. I talked

145
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:09,760
 about it over and over again, is that Jesus is really pointing us towards relationship with God

146
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:17,280
 the Father. Throughout the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus repeatedly contrasts the emptiness of just

147
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:24,720
 external religious conformance with the vibrancy of living in relationship with the God who made

148
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,120
 us and loves us. And Jesus makes it clear that what God desires is relationship with us. That's

149
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:36,640
 what God desires between us and him. God created us for relationship with him, for a healthy and

150
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:43,440
 right relationship. And that's what he wants. And God is not trying to get us to just simply fall

151
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,600
 into a system of religious conformance and where we do external things. We do outward observances

152
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:55,680
 to try to make it look like we're a good person. God wants us to know him from our hearts and to

153
00:13:55,680 --> 00:14:02,160
 love him from our hearts and to live rightly because we are full of love for him. And Jesus

154
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:07,920
 just repeatedly emphasizes that in the Sermon on the Mount. He repeatedly draws that contrast. He

155
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,200
 repeatedly talks about how dangerous hypocrisy is and how dangerous empty religion is and how

156
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:19,200
 dangerous it is to try to please God in other ways. And he repeatedly calls us back to relationship

157
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:25,200
 with God and the importance of relationship with God. And again, Jesus could speak with authority

158
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:32,400
 about this because who better to teach us about relationship with God the Father than the one who

159
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:39,040
 has a perfect relationship with God the Father. In the book of John, Jesus speaks about this in

160
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:45,920
 different places. In John chapter 10, verse 30, he says, "I and the Father are one." He's saying

161
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:52,480
 that he and the Father agree in every way. Their will is totally aligned. And we know the doctrine

162
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:57,440
 of the Trinity, it's an amazing and beautiful doctrine. It's difficult for us to comprehend

163
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,800
 sometimes, but God is one God in three persons. And so even though Jesus is a separate person

164
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,960
 from God the Father, he is one with God the Father in every way. They are aligned in every way and

165
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:16,560
 their desires are the same in every way and their activity is the same in every way and they are

166
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:23,360
 always in agreement. John 14, 9, it says, "Jesus said to him, 'Have I been with you so long and

167
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:31,680
 you still do not know me, Philip? Whoever has seen me has seen the Father.'" Again, Jesus is showing

168
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,600
 his disciples, his followers that he is one with the Father, that they are always in perfect

169
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,680
 agreement. Their relationship has no distance. It has no conflict. It has no tension. There is

170
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,960
 never a time where Jesus is headed in one direction and God the Father is headed in the other direction.

171
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:55,200
 They are always in agreement. Jesus lives constantly in perfect relationship with God the

172
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,800
 Father. And so when Jesus begins to speak about how we can have right relationship with God in

173
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:06,240
 the Sermon on the Mount, he speaks with authority because he knows exactly what that is and he knows

174
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:12,480
 exactly how to achieve it. And Jesus spends so much time in the Sermon on the Mount speaking about

175
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,600
 that, how we can have right relationship with God. It is one of the major themes of the Sermon.

176
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:22,880
 And as I said, I hope you have not missed that as we have gone through it. The Sermon on the Mount,

177
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:29,200
 Jesus is calling you into a loving relationship with God that manifests itself in the values of

178
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,440
 the kingdom and you living your life. But that is what it is about. It is about a relationship

179
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:38,400
 that Jesus is inviting you into. And that brings us to the last thing I want us to consider,

180
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:45,360
 which is that Jesus is speaking with authority because he is the way to God. If one of the major

181
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:51,040
 themes of the Sermon on the Mount is this relationship with God and how to walk in

182
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:57,520
 relationship with God instead of just trying to merely conform to external religious observances,

183
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,240
 then one of the big questions that that leaves us with is how does that relationship

184
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:10,880
 take place? How do we know the way? Jesus himself is the way. In the Sermon on the Mount,

185
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,120
 Jesus has laid out this striking and amazing vision of the kingdom of God. And Jesus has

186
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,120
 described the good life for us. He has described the good life for us as humans by articulating

187
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,840
 the values of the kingdom. He said, look, if you want to live a life that is full of fulfillment

188
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:35,200
 and joy and peace and all of these beautiful things that you desire, the shalom that you desire,

189
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,520
 then you need to live out the values of the kingdom. And if you do so, you'll be living in

190
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:44,480
 right relationship with the creator God who made you and in right relationship with the rest of the

191
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:50,480
 human beings around you. Jesus is painting this beautiful picture for us throughout the Sermon on

192
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:57,120
 the Mount. He's described it for us. But the truth that he's also been very honest with us about is

193
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:05,920
 that there is no way to the kingdom of God through our own effort or through our own merit. The

194
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,600
 kingdom of God is not accessible to any of us humans by our own effort or our own merit. And

195
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,920
 living out these beautiful values of the kingdom that Jesus has described for us, living out the

196
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:22,640
 good life and experiencing shalom in the way that we want is not accessible to any of us humans by

197
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,960
 our own effort or merit. Jesus is the only way to right relationship with God and right relationship

198
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:37,600
 with other humans in our world. And Jesus himself is the only way to the kingdom of God. We talked

199
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,120
 about what the kingdom of God is at the beginning of this study, that the kingdom of God is both the

200
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:49,200
 future kingdom of heaven, where it will be fully manifested, where there will be no crime, where

201
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,960
 there will be no hatred, where there will be no sin, no lying, no disease, no COVID. All of those

202
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:01,920
 things will be completely eradicated in heaven because the kingdom of God will be fully manifested.

203
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:07,280
 And that is the future kingdom of God. And there is no way to the future kingdom of God in heaven

204
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,560
 apart from Jesus Christ. There's no way to get there based upon our own efforts or our own merit.

205
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:18,080
 But there's also the present kingdom of God, whereby believers in Jesus, the subjects of the

206
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:24,400
 kingdom, those who have put their trust in Christ can manifest the kingdom here on earth as they

207
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,840
 submit to the rule and reign of God. And as they submit to the rule and reign of God in their own

208
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,480
 lives, they start to live out the values of the kingdom. And that is the present manifestation

209
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,160
 of the kingdom of God, even though it's not complete and full on earth, because there will

210
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,800
 always be brokenness, there will always be sin. We can be a part of the present manifestation of

211
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:53,440
 the kingdom of God, but the present manifestation of the kingdom of God, again, is only accessible

212
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:58,240
 through Jesus. There is no way for us to experience that through our own effort or through our own

213
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,320
 merit. We can't try hard enough to live out the values of the kingdom. We can't just try harder

214
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:09,200
 and learn to live out the beatitudes through our own effort or through trying to achieve something

215
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,680
 or through our attainments or through our accomplishments or through our education or

216
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:18,960
 through any other source. We can't buy it. Remember the book of Acts, the story of the man who tried

217
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,920
 to buy the gift of the Holy Spirit. We can't purchase it with money. We can't trade for it

218
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:29,040
 with anything we have. It's only through Christ. And the future kingdom of God is the same way.

219
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:34,640
 We can't purchase it. We can't earn it. We can't get there by trying hard enough. It's only through

220
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:42,240
 Christ. And Jesus is so clear about that. Jesus is the only way to healing and shalom in our broken

221
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:49,600
 world. We live in such a broken world. We live in such a hurting world and we desire healing. And

222
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,520
 that's good. You know, if you don't desire healing in our world after the past couple of years that

223
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:02,880
 we've been through, then you need to examine your heart and see if you're still alive and healthy.

224
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,720
 Because we have seen so much brokenness over the past few years. We've seen disease. We've

225
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,840
 seen COVID that has just taken so many lives and made so many people sick. And we've seen economic

226
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:20,720
 issues and troubles and struggles. We've seen all types of racial tensions and racism on display and

227
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,520
 evil things on display. We've seen so many people harmed. We've seen political turmoil. We've seen

228
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:32,240
 political unrest and oppression around the world and people being silenced and all these terrible

229
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:40,720
 things going on. Our world is deeply broken. And it's only right that as human beings, much less

230
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:47,200
 as Christians, that we should desire healing and shalom. And we should want to see things fixed and

231
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,840
 want to see peace and want to see wholeness and want to see health and want to see fullness in

232
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:59,600
 our world. Our heart should cry out for that. But here's the thing, as our hearts cry out for that,

233
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,240
 we have to see that the only way to experience it is through Christ. Every other avenue that we try

234
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,880
 to follow in order to experience those things on our own will end up falling short. Every road that

235
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:18,880
 we go down trying to experience healing and shalom on our own apart from Christ will end up being a

236
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:25,840
 dead end. We will not experience these things apart from Jesus. Jesus is the only way to healing and

237
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,600
 shalom. Jesus is the only way to the future kingdom of heaven. Jesus is the only way to the present

238
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,600
 manifestation of the kingdom of heaven here on earth in our lives. And Jesus is the only way

239
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,040
 to the beatitudes. If we want to live out the things that he talked about, being poor in spirit,

240
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:47,120
 being meek, being pure of heart, hungry and thirsty after righteousness, being a peacemaker,

241
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:52,480
 all of those beautiful things, being able to be strong and persevere during times of persecution

242
00:22:52,480 --> 00:23:00,000
 and difficulty, all that stuff, that's only going to happen through Jesus. Any other pathway we'll

243
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,080
 try to find will not lead us there. And ultimately those other pathways will lead us to pain and to

244
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:12,720
 harm and to self-destruction. Jesus is the only way. Remember John 14, 6, Jesus said this explicitly

245
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,360
 to us. He said, "I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except

246
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:26,080
 through me." And that's why Jesus could speak with authority because he knew he was the way to God.

247
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,600
 He didn't have to say, "Well, I think if you really dig into some of the history of this,

248
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:37,120
 or if you really examine the words here, I think it's saying that this is the way to heaven." No,

249
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:43,200
 Jesus already knew the way to heaven because he was the way to heaven. Jesus, one with the Father,

250
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:52,000
 incarnated, came down and took on human flesh in order to show us the way. And how did he do that?

251
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,680
 He did that by living a perfect sinless life. He never sinned. He was tempted in every way,

252
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:04,080
 just like we are, to sin. He was hurt. He was rejected. He was spit upon. He was mistreated.

253
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,800
 He went through everything that we have experienced, but Jesus never sinned in any of it.

254
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:17,040
 And at the end of his life, he chose to give his life for us, to lay his life down as a sacrifice

255
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,320
 in our place, taking on himself the punishment that we deserve because of our sins, because of

256
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:26,160
 all the stuff that we've done, all the way that we've mistreated everybody else, and all the

257
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:29,760
 self-destructive stuff we've done, and all the hateful things that we've done, and all the lies

258
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:37,520
 we've told, and all that. Jesus took that on himself, made himself our substitute. He took

259
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:43,920
 the penalty of sin and bore the wrath of God in our place so that because of what he did,

260
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:51,600
 we could be forgiven and we could have access to relationship with God. We could have access to the

261
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,680
 love of the creator God who made us. We could have access to restoration, to right relationship that

262
00:24:57,680 --> 00:25:02,400
 had been broken in the beginning because of our own sin. It was our fault that we broke up in

263
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:10,240
 the first place. But God loved us and came to us in love and sent Jesus in order to open the door

264
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,720
 to heaven, in order to open the way for us to know God and have right relationship with him.

265
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,200
 And that's the beauty of the gospel, but it's also the beauty that we see here in the Sermon

266
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,520
 on the Mount. The Bible is clear that this happens by grace and through faith, that we don't have to

267
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:32,880
 do anything, we can't do anything to try to earn it or to try to achieve it. We simply have to trust

268
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:38,880
 in Jesus that he has done that for us and that he is great enough and good enough to forgive our

269
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:44,800
 sins. And we ask him to come into our heart and to become the Lord and leader of our life and to

270
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:51,120
 begin to follow him in our life and to begin to seek to submit our lives to the rule and reign of

271
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:58,000
 God to the values of the kingdom. And as we do that, by God's grace, we begin to live out these

272
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,520
 values that we've been talking about over the last year. We begin to become so saturated with

273
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:08,320
 the work that Jesus is doing in our heart and life that the values of the kingdom are what come out

274
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,800
 of our lives. Whether it's in good times or bad times, whether things are easy or difficult,

275
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,920
 whether we're being challenged, whether we're rejoicing or whether we're mourning,

276
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:26,880
 the values of the kingdom are going to come out. God's love, God's peace, God's joy, humility,

277
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:34,080
 care for others, purity of heart, hungering and thirsting after righteousness. All of these

278
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,720
 beautiful things that Jesus articulated for us in this amazing sermon can come out of our lives.

279
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,600
 And that's what we want and that's what we desire. Jesus spoke with authority because he is the word

280
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:55,680
 of God. He is perfect relationship with God and he is the way to God. And my prayer is that in my

281
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:02,160
 life and in your life, we would enter into relationship with God by grace and by faith in

282
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:09,280
 Jesus so that we can begin to truly live out these values of the kingdom. We can respond to the

283
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:15,200
 authority that Jesus spoke with, to the truth of his words, and we can begin to obey God and live

284
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,320
 in right relationship with him so that the values of the kingdom come out of our lives and flood

285
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,160
 every life around us and our family and our community and our cities, because that's what

286
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:31,600
 we desperately need in the world we live in. We desperately need the love of Christ. We desperately

287
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:38,960
 need the values of the kingdom. Let's pray. God, thank you for all that we have learned as we have

288
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,000
 walked through the Sermon on the Mount. God, thank you for your truth. God, thank you that we can

289
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,400
 trust your authority that Jesus spoke with authority because he knew what he was talking

290
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:57,760
 about because all of these things were who he was to the core of his being. And God, I pray that you

291
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:03,760
 would help us to trust. If we don't have relationship with you, God, I pray that we

292
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:08,800
 would start there by beginning relationship by faith and the grace that you've extended,

293
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:13,840
 the unmerited favor that you've extended to us. But for those of us who do have relationship with

294
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,720
 you and we've been walking with you, God, help us to trust you more and to trust that if we will

295
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,640
 really orient our lives around the values of the kingdom, if we will really surrender to living out

296
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,280
 those things that even though it may seem countercultural, it may seem difficult, it may seem

297
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:37,200
 even confusing at times, that you will work in us and through us and you will use what you are doing

298
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:43,760
 in our hearts to work in our world and to bring about healing and peace and love in the lives of

299
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,200
 others, God. We thank you for who you are. We thank you for this beautiful Sermon on the Mount

300
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:53,600
 that you gave us, God. Help us to believe you. Help us to trust you. Help us to live it out,

301
00:28:53,600 --> 00:29:00,480
 God. Give us the grace to live out the values of the kingdom day by day. In Jesus' name, amen.
