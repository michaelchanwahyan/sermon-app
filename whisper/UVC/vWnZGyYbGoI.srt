00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 (audience clapping)

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,520
 - Hello, hello.

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,160
 Okay, good morning, UV.

4
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,960
 Thank you for welcoming me to your church and your community.

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,740
 It was a pleasure to spend some time

6
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,320
 with the kids this morning and to be able to,

7
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,960
 yeah, speak from the word of God with you all today.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,840
 So if you have some non-believer friends or family

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,580
 and you have tried to share the gospel with them,

10
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:29,980
 I'm sure at some point you will run into some questions

11
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,920
 along the line of, if there is a God,

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:37,700
 or if God is really good, why is there so much suffering

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,240
 and evil in our world?

14
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:42,760
 Well, for some people, this are maybe just a way

15
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:45,500
 for them to discredit the Christian God,

16
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,140
 but I feel like for the rest of the people,

17
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,280
 this is a legitimate and reasonable questions

18
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,900
 just coming from either their personal experience

19
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,740
 or just the things that they have seen around the world.

20
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,320
 And if I'm just being honest,

21
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,280
 I feel like even a lot of times as Christians,

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,960
 we don't really have any adequate answers

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,780
 to this question as well.

24
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,760
 And living in a big city like Chicago,

25
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,720
 if we just pay attention or open our eyes

26
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,880
 to our surrounding, it is not hard for us

27
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,560
 to see a lot of brokenness, injustice, and suffering

28
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,920
 that is in such close proximity with us, right?

29
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,120
 And at times like this, these questions of evil

30
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,260
 and suffering become even more relevant.

31
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:33,640
 So my questions for today is, as the people of God,

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:36,920
 how should we face the suffering and pain in our lives?

33
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,720
 As believers, how do we suffer differently

34
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,080
 than the rest of the world?

35
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:45,240
 So today, we're going to take a look at Psalm 39

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,840
 and see how it approaches these questions.

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,560
 I will be reading from the NIV version,

38
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,160
 so if you have a different version,

39
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,160
 you can feel free to follow along on the screen behind me.

40
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,520
 So Psalm 39 is attributed to David,

41
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,880
 but the actual circumstances behind these Psalms

42
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,240
 is not clear.

43
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,860
 But what we can know is this,

44
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,480
 this is an individual lament to the Lord,

45
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,320
 and this is a Psalm that is basically lament,

46
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,620
 pouring out a complaint to the Lord.

47
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,520
 So let's look at Psalm 39 together.

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,280
 (pages rustling)

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,080
 Verse one.

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:30,000
 I say, I will watch my ways and keep my tongue from sin.

51
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,660
 I will put a muzzle on my mouth

52
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,540
 while in the presence of the wicked.

53
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,960
 So I remain utterly silent, not even saying anything good.

54
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,880
 But my anguish increases.

55
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,160
 My heart grew hot within me.

56
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,900
 While I meditated, the fire burned.

57
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,040
 Then I spoke with my tongue.

58
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,360
 So before we can answer the questions

59
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,320
 of how, as the people of God,

60
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,880
 we can suffer differently than the rest of the world,

61
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,160
 we first need to come to terms that, as believers,

62
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,720
 we are actually not exempt from suffering in this life.

63
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,980
 Again, as believers,

64
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:08,080
 we are not exempt from suffering in this life.

65
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,720
 In verse one, we see that the Psalmist,

66
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,800
 he chooses to remain silent and to restrain himself,

67
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,200
 and this is for two reasons.

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,440
 First, so that he does not sin against the Lord.

69
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:23,080
 And secondly, because the evil and the wicked are present.

70
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,240
 Again, the actual circumstances behind the Psalmist

71
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:28,280
 is not clear, but it is very possible

72
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:31,160
 that these wicked people have somewhat contributed

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,920
 to his suffering as well.

74
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:37,100
 And one of the realities of living in a broken

75
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,320
 and fallen world is that even sometimes

76
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,480
 our best attempt to do the right thing

77
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,000
 might actually bring us undesirable results.

78
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,440
 Maybe some of you here,

79
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,760
 you might lose a job promotion at your work

80
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,520
 because you choose to hold on to your Christian ethics

81
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,300
 or Christian morals.

82
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,000
 Or maybe for some of you,

83
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,200
 you might become a target or outcast

84
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,400
 in different social settings because, once again,

85
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,800
 you choose to remain outspoken about your faith.

86
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,740
 And maybe for some of you, you might lose a friendship

87
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,640
 because you choose to speak the truth and remain truthful.

88
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,660
 And this is exactly what the Psalmist is experiencing here.

89
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,500
 Despite his best effort to do the right thing,

90
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,100
 which in this case is to restrain himself

91
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,960
 and to not speak up,

92
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,400
 we see that his situation actually become worse

93
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,240
 and that the anguish increase within him,

94
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,800
 his anguish intensify.

95
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,360
 So, can you sense the frustration

96
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,860
 that the Psalmist is experiencing right here?

97
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,560
 And can you think of similar situation

98
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
 in your personal life as well?

99
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,420
 Maybe you know that you are doing the right thing.

100
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,960
 You know that you are doing the way

101
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,020
 that God would want you to do,

102
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,720
 but the outcome of it might just not be favorable

103
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,560
 towards you.

104
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,740
 And as a result of that, we see that the Psalmist,

105
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:59,040
 he could no longer hold back his silence

106
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,340
 and he finally decide to speak up.

107
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,920
 So, listen to what he has to say

108
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
 when he finally decide to speak up.

109
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,680
 So, verse four.

110
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:13,140
 Show me, Lord, my life's end and the number of my days.

111
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,580
 Let me know how fleeting my life is.

112
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,640
 You have made my days a mere hand breath.

113
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,080
 The span of my years is as nothing before you.

114
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,380
 Everyone is but a breath, even those who seem secure.

115
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,120
 Surely everyone goes around like a mere phantom.

116
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,240
 In vain they rush about, heaping up wealth

117
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,480
 without knowing whose it will finally be.

118
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,060
 And so, let us just pause here for a moment.

119
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,620
 This three verse that we have just read through,

120
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:46,980
 the imagery that if you just try to like

121
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,200
 paint a picture of it, it is actually kind of bleak

122
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,900
 and in some ways hopeless, right?

123
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,960
 And so, again, before we can answer the questions

124
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,600
 of how as the people of God we can suffer differently,

125
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,920
 we need to acknowledge that suffering and death

126
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,080
 is part of our human experience,

127
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,480
 living in a broken and fallen world.

128
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,920
 So, what is the Psalmist's request here

129
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,560
 to the Lord in verse four?

130
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,080
 He asks, "Show me, Lord, my life's end

131
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,740
 "and the number of my days.

132
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:19,740
 "Let me know how fleeting my life is."

133
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,280
 In some of the more recent scholarship,

134
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,600
 verse four is interpreted not as a request

135
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,260
 to know how brief his human life is,

136
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,520
 because you already know and acknowledge that

137
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,980
 in verse five and six.

138
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:30,820
 But right here in verse four,

139
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,840
 this is actually a request to know

140
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,100
 how long his suffering would last.

141
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,120
 Again, because he understands that suffering and death

142
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,960
 is just part of human experience, living in this world.

143
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:44,060
 And the urgency of this request

144
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:46,660
 to know how long his suffering would last

145
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,300
 is then further reinforced by his own acknowledgement

146
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,860
 in verse five and six that,

147
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:54,540
 "Yes, surely, life is indeed brief,

148
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,740
 "and even our human effort can be meaningless as well."

149
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:02,740
 So, our English translation might not capture this well,

150
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,180
 but in these three verses,

151
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,380
 there's a Hebrew word that is being repeated twice

152
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,100
 that is the Hebrew word hevel.

153
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,300
 It is being translated as mere hand breath in verse five,

154
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,220
 and in verse six, it is being translated as in vain.

155
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,180
 So, this word hevel is actually a major theme

156
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,260
 in the wisdom literature of Ecclesiastes.

157
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,700
 And in a more literal sense,

158
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:28,800
 it just means something like a breath or a vapor.

159
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,720
 And in a more metaphorical sense,

160
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,700
 it can refer to something that is fleeting or elusive.

161
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:38,000
 So, in the book of Ecclesiastes,

162
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,300
 with everything under the sun being deemed as hevel

163
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,880
 or being deemed as meaningless,

164
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,380
 the author actually concludes at the end of the book

165
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,340
 that, "The end of the matters, all has been heard.

166
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,060
 "Fear God and keep his commandment,

167
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:55,140
 "for this is the whole duty of man."

168
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:58,820
 In other words, the author of Ecclesiastes

169
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,140
 is trying to say is that,

170
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,940
 "The only things that truly give meaning and purpose

171
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,500
 "to this life is a life that is live with God,

172
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,040
 "a life that is live with God,

173
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,880
 "that is fear God and keep his commandment."

174
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,960
 So, similarly here in Psalm 39,

175
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,680
 we see that by acknowledging

176
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,240
 how short and transient human life is,

177
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,900
 the psalmist is actually agreeing

178
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,320
 with the book of Ecclesiastes that,

179
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:30,320
 "Yes, life apart from God is indeed meaningless or hevel."

180
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:35,100
 And we will actually see this being more clearly

181
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,180
 pan out in the second half of the Psalms.

182
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:43,980
 So, now knowing that sin, suffering, and death

183
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,420
 are just inevitable part of our human life,

184
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:50,860
 where does this leave us as the people of God?

185
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,380
 Where does this leave us as believers?

186
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:56,900
 And what is the main thing that actually differentiate us

187
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:59,800
 than the rest of the world in the way that we suffer?

188
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,760
 If we continue to look in verse four,

189
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,920
 I think the psalmist actually provide us with some clues.

190
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,680
 So, look with me in verse seven.

191
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,900
 So, verse seven,

192
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,480
 "But now, Lord, what do I look for?

193
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,380
 "My hope is in you."

194
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,180
 So, yes, we know that sin and suffering

195
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,540
 are just inevitable part of our human life

196
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,380
 because we live in a fallen world.

197
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:26,160
 However, as the people of God,

198
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,740
 we do not have to face these realities

199
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,900
 with despair or hopelessness.

200
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,760
 As the people of God,

201
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,240
 we have a greater hope in the eternal God himself.

202
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,600
 So, today, what I really want to press in on our heart

203
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,160
 is this, that even in the midst of our sin and suffering,

204
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,980
 we can hope in the Lord.

205
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,440
 Even in the midst of our sin and suffering,

206
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,160
 we can hope in the Lord.

207
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,200
 And this is a difference, brothers and sisters.

208
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,420
 This is the thing that actually set us as believer,

209
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,800
 as people that believe in the Lord,

210
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,540
 that believe in Jesus.

211
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,520
 This is the thing that sets us apart

212
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,360
 from the rest of the world in the way that we suffer

213
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:11,200
 because with God as our eternal hope,

214
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,080
 we can put our hope in him,

215
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:15,820
 even in the midst of our sin and suffering.

216
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:19,080
 And I want to be clear right here.

217
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,120
 The way that the psalmist used the word hope in verse seven

218
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,600
 is probably very different than the way

219
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,480
 that we use the word hope in our current day and age.

220
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:31,400
 Maybe some of you here are students

221
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,020
 and or think back to your time as a student,

222
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,540
 you might completely butcher your final exams

223
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,920
 and when it is time to get your grade back,

224
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,360
 you might use the word hope in this sense of like,

225
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,620
 "Oh man, I just hope that I can pass this test

226
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,240
 "so that I don't have to retake the entire class."

227
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,880
 Or maybe some of you are new parents

228
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,500
 that have some younger kids at home

229
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,140
 and you just haven't been able to sleep

230
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:57,460
 for the past, I don't know, week or two weeks,

231
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,940
 and you might use the word hope in this sense of,

232
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,480
 "Oh, I just hope that I can get

233
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,580
 "maybe just four hours of sleep tonight."

234
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:08,120
 Again, this is not what the word hope means here

235
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,800
 and this is not how the psalmist used the word hope

236
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,700
 in verse seven here.

237
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,220
 In contrast to the meaningless or the heavel of life

238
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:19,180
 that he talks about in the previous verse,

239
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,940
 right here in verse seven,

240
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,860
 the object of the hope is actually anchored

241
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:28,200
 in the one that is from everlasting to everlasting.

242
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,580
 The object of our hope is anchored

243
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,340
 in the one who never fell on his promises

244
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,100
 and the one who will never change.

245
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,020
 In other words, the object of our hope

246
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,900
 is anchored in the eternal God himself,

247
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,620
 just as the psalmist confidently proclaimed,

248
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,200
 "My hope is in you, Lord."

249
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,820
 So, what are some of the grounds

250
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,140
 of our confidence in the Lord

251
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:55,020
 and why is he our only hope as the people of God?

252
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,460
 So, let's follow along the psalmist

253
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:59,660
 as he pour out his request to the Lord.

254
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,780
 Verse eight.

255
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,580
 Save me from all my transgression.

256
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:09,060
 Do not make me the scorn of fools.

257
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,420
 I was silent, I would not open my mouth,

258
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:15,660
 for you are the one who has done this.

259
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,820
 Remove this scourge from me.

260
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,060
 I am overcome by the blow of your hand.

261
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:26,220
 When you rebuke and discipline anyone for their sin,

262
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:28,400
 you consume their wealth like a moth.

263
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,200
 Surely, everyone is but a breath.

264
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,940
 Hear my prayer, Lord.

265
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,640
 Listen to my cry for help.

266
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,460
 Do not be deaf to my weeping,

267
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,520
 for I dwell with you as a foreigner,

268
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,240
 a stranger, as all my ancestors were.

269
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,980
 Look away from me, that I may enjoy life again

270
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,820
 before I depart and am no more.

271
00:12:54,820 --> 00:13:00,060
 So, the biggest reason that we can put our hope in the Lord

272
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,360
 and that he is our only hope

273
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:05,820
 is because ultimately, he is the only one

274
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,580
 who can deliver us from our sins.

275
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:11,800
 So, more than the threats of the wicked

276
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,580
 that we have seen in verse one

277
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,020
 and the threat that comes from the outside,

278
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,500
 the psalmist understand that ultimately,

279
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,420
 what he needs to be delivered from

280
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,780
 is something that is within him, that is his own sins.

281
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:28,380
 And again, I feel like a lot of times,

282
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,100
 speaking for myself, when things doesn't go right,

283
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:33,360
 it is easy, again, for me to point my fingers

284
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,220
 at things that is outside of me,

285
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:37,880
 maybe my circumstances, different people,

286
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,320
 different relationships.

287
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:44,140
 But how often do we actually take a look within ourself

288
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,780
 and to examine our own heart?

289
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:50,060
 I think this is a good practice that we should all,

290
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,700
 yeah, be aware of.

291
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,460
 A lot of times, instead of blaming the things

292
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,140
 that is outside of us, that is not out of control,

293
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,700
 we also have to take a look within ourself as well.

294
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,040
 So, yes, we can hope in the Lord

295
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,020
 even in the midst of our sin and suffering

296
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:10,400
 because he is the only one that can deliver us.

297
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,540
 But I also want you all to hear this.

298
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,980
 God's deliverance does not necessarily

299
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,460
 preclude divine discipline.

300
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:20,980
 Or sometimes, the way that God delivered us

301
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:23,200
 is actually through his divine discipline

302
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:26,260
 or his divine wrath.

303
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:29,340
 This is because the divine wrath and discipline of the Lord

304
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,620
 is actually a means of grace that is with the purpose

305
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,620
 to bring us into an awareness of our own sins,

306
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,980
 of our own shortcoming, so that we can come before the Lord

307
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,980
 in repentance, in confession, asking him for forgiveness.

308
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:47,420
 In other words, it is actually for our own good

309
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,300
 that the Lord has disciplined us

310
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,100
 and to deliver us from our own sins.

311
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,900
 And again, this is what the psalmist is experiencing

312
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,220
 right here from verse nine to 11.

313
00:14:57,220 --> 00:15:02,460
 So, having the awareness of the futility of life

314
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:05,820
 and also the awareness of his own sins,

315
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,960
 it prompts the psalmist to cry out one last time

316
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,800
 to the Lord.

317
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,940
 He say, "Hear my prayer, Lord.

318
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,860
 "Listen to my cry for help.

319
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,320
 "Do not be deaf to my weeping,

320
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,580
 "for I dwell with you as a foreigner,

321
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:23,060
 "a stranger, as all my ancestors were."

322
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:26,160
 So right here, again, he cried out to the Lord,

323
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,680
 asking the Lord to hear his prayer,

324
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,160
 do not be deaf to his cry,

325
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,140
 and to not be silent to his tears.

326
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,840
 And what is the reason of that?

327
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:38,680
 Because he understands that, he say,

328
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,540
 "For I dwell with you as a foreigner,

329
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,180
 "a stranger, as all my ancestors were."

330
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:49,380
 And by comparing himself to a foreigner or a stranger,

331
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,260
 the psalmist understand that,

332
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:55,620
 ultimately, his final destination is not this short

333
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,900
 and transient life on this earth,

334
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,580
 but he's actually on his way to a life

335
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,680
 that will last for eternity.

336
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,100
 He understands that the power of sins over him

337
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,900
 is only temporary,

338
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,120
 because one day he will not only be free

339
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,540
 from the power and the penalty of sins,

340
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:15,900
 but when he spend eternity with the Lord,

341
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:19,000
 he will be free from the presence of sins forever as well.

342
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:24,060
 In other words, he knows that he has a place

343
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:26,100
 in the family of God.

344
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,700
 This is why he emphasized to the Lord that,

345
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,620
 "I dwell as a foreigner with you.

346
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:34,880
 "I dwell with the Lord as a stranger."

347
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,300
 And if we just continue, in verse 13,

348
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,200
 we see that the psalm just sort of ends abruptly,

349
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,660
 with the psalmist asking the Lord

350
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:47,300
 to turn away his angry gaze from him

351
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:51,380
 so that he is able to enjoy the remainder of his life.

352
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,100
 And we actually find no resolution

353
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,020
 or no response from the Lord in the psalm itself.

354
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:01,180
 So, we've come to the end of these psalms,

355
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,140
 but I want to turn our attention to this.

356
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,340
 The silence that the psalmist is facing from the Lord,

357
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:12,060
 pouring out his request before the Lord,

358
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,100
 but hearing no response, at least within the psalmist.

359
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:18,300
 I think the psalmist is actually not alone

360
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,740
 in facing this deafening silence from the Lord.

361
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,980
 I know last week we observed Good Friday

362
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,660
 and celebrate Easter Sunday.

363
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:29,580
 So, we're probably very familiar with this.

364
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:32,900
 Right before Jesus' death at the cross,

365
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,660
 he pours out the cry quoted from Psalm 22.

366
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:40,860
 "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"

367
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,820
 And I feel like a lot of time we can just

368
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:47,700
 kind of like brush off the magnitude

369
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,780
 of this cry from Jesus.

370
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:53,900
 But this person that make this cry at the cross,

371
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:58,020
 this is the outcry of Jesus, the Son of God,

372
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,660
 bearing the sins of the world

373
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,580
 and facing kind of like the wrath

374
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,980
 from his own Father as well.

375
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,740
 But we know that as the obedient Son of God,

376
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,100
 Jesus understands that the only way

377
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,100
 to resurrection and glorification

378
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,500
 is actually through his suffering at the cross.

379
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,380
 So, speaking about this, the book of Hebrews

380
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:21,060
 described that Jesus, as the author

381
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,140
 and perfecter of our life,

382
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:26,260
 "For the joy sets before him,

383
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:29,460
 "he endured the cross, despising its shame."

384
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,660
 And so Jesus' example actually becomes a paradigm

385
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,940
 for all of us as believers on how we are

386
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:40,260
 to make our journey on our life on this earth

387
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,500
 with all his suffering, with all his pain.

388
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,140
 And we are able to endure our journey through this life

389
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:49,620
 because Jesus not only provide us with the way

390
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:52,780
 through his death and resurrection at the cross,

391
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,660
 but Jesus actually also sets an example of endurance

392
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:57,860
 for us to follow.

393
00:18:57,860 --> 00:19:01,140
 And this is why he is our only hope

394
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:03,660
 in the midst of our sin and suffering.

395
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:06,020
 The reason that Jesus is our only hope

396
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,540
 in the midst of our sin and suffering

397
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:11,300
 is because he is the only one not just providing

398
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,620
 the means for us to be reconciled to God

399
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:15,740
 through his death and resurrection,

400
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:19,100
 but he's also the only one that lives a perfect life

401
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,060
 for us to follow.

402
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:22,820
 So from the time that we put our faith in Jesus

403
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,420
 to the time that Jesus comes again,

404
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:28,820
 Jesus basically model for us on how we are

405
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,980
 to live our life.

406
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,580
 And he is the only perfect example for us.

407
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:38,180
 So maybe some of you here,

408
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:41,180
 you're in a season where you're just standing face to face

409
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,500
 with suffering or just with a lot of brokenness,

410
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:47,740
 whether it is physically, relationally,

411
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:50,060
 emotionally, or mentally.

412
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:53,700
 Or maybe are you in a season

413
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,500
 where the realities and pressure of life

414
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,220
 just feels so overwhelming.

415
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:04,820
 Or maybe like the psalmist here in Psalm 39,

416
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,300
 you are currently just facing the deafening silence

417
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:10,660
 from the Lord, despite countless days and nights

418
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,740
 of prayers and fasting.

419
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:18,860
 And if I'm being honest, I am familiar with this currently.

420
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,300
 Or perhaps there's just a particular sin

421
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:28,700
 or addiction in your life that you have prayed

422
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,700
 and asked the Lord to kind of like remove you from,

423
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,820
 but you're just struggling to overcome.

424
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,100
 Of course, I want to acknowledge

425
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:40,820
 that all of these experience are true and real,

426
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:42,460
 and I don't view them lightly.

427
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:46,740
 But maybe, just maybe at the same time,

428
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,580
 this might be an opportunity for us

429
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,980
 to learn how to hope in the Lord.

430
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:54,380
 How to put our faith and trust in Jesus.

431
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,620
 Again, because our faith does not just get perfected

432
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,060
 in an instance.

433
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,460
 To be able to hope in the Lord

434
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,180
 actually requires a lot of practice.

435
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,100
 It requires constantly coming before the Lord,

436
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:10,180
 asking Him, and in some ways, when He responds to us,

437
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,060
 that are the basis of our future hope in Him as well.

438
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,780
 So once again, before I end,

439
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,340
 I want to encourage you all with the truth

440
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,500
 that the psalmist here in Psalm 39

441
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,660
 that even in the midst of our sin and suffering,

442
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:28,100
 we can put our hope in the Lord.

443
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:32,100
 So I'm gonna pray us, so let's bow our head in prayers.

444
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:42,500
 Heavenly Father, we just want to give our praise

445
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:45,300
 and give our thanks to you.

446
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,260
 For you are our hope,

447
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,020
 and we are grateful to you.

448
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:56,060
 For you are the only one that we can put our hope in,

449
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:58,340
 and the only one that would never fail us.

450
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:04,540
 Jesus, we praise you,

451
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,300
 for you are the only one that provide the means

452
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,060
 for us to be able to reconcile to the Father again.

453
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:17,140
 And you're not only a God, but you are fully human as well.

454
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,380
 A great high priest who is able to empathize

455
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,020
 with our weakness,

456
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,700
 because you have been tended in every way,

457
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,540
 just as we are, yet without sin.

458
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:33,020
 So even when we face just a different suffering

459
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,260
 and challenges that life thrown at us,

460
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,780
 we know that Lord, we know that Jesus,

461
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,380
 you know how he feels,

462
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,860
 and you are with us in the midst of our sin and suffering.

463
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,420
 Holy Spirit, we thank you for,

464
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:53,420
 you are the living and active spirit living in us.

465
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,740
 You intercede for us when we do not know

466
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,340
 what we ought to say or what we ought to pray for.

467
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,100
 And yet, you know our hearts,

468
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,900
 and you pour out your prayers on our behalf before the Father.

469
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:11,180
 Lord, would you just teach us

470
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,740
 to learn how to put our hope in you

471
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,620
 in a way that honors you,

472
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,100
 in a way that brings glory to you,

473
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:21,820
 in a way that show the broken world

474
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,820
 that our God is a God that is worthy of all the praise

475
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,500
 and all the glory and all the honor.

476
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:32,940
 So we pray this in your son's name, amen.

477
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:35,440
 (piano music)
