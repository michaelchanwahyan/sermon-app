[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.500]   Awesome. Well thank you very much for having me.
[00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.480]   It's great to be here and be with your pastor, Pastor Mark.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.740]   Yeah, it's really neat for me because I was in a, so I'm in the process of
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.860]   planning a church, all people's church in the West suburbs, and Pastor Mark was
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.540]   one of the trainers, the facilitators, so it's really cool to come and be with
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:40.340]   you all now. So well let me pray for us before we get in.
[00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.700]   Father in heaven, I pray that you would be with us now.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:56.400]   Bless the words of my mouth and the meditations of all our hearts. In Jesus
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:07.540]   name we pray, amen. Amen. What we believe about God is the most important thing
[00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:19.500]   about us. What we think about God, it's the most important thing about us. Do we
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:29.820]   see God as distant? Do we see God as a some kind of cosmic killjoy? It matters.
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:37.140]   It matters our view of God. I got four points for us today as we look at what
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.140]   Paul is saying, what Paul is saying, and just a little background here. We're
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.540]   jumping just right into the verse, these verses in Philippians chapter 3, and this
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.900]   probably comes out of my church had been going through the book of Acts for like
[00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.060]   a year plus, and then we jumped into Philippians because in the book of Acts,
[00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.700]   kind of the last half of it, we get a picture of into Paul's life as he is
[00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.020]   going around much of the known world at the time, 2,000 years ago, sharing about
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:15.940]   Christ, and the Holy Spirit is making disciples, and it's this amazing thing
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.220]   that God is doing. And then he finally gets to Rome where he's under house
[00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.100]   arrest, and he's under house arrest for two years as he's looking to stand
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.240]   before the Emperor Nero. And the Emperor Nero, many of you have heard of him, he was a
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.200]   pretty bad dude as we know through history. And so he's waiting, he's waiting
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.860]   for two years, and we get a few letters. We get these amazing letters of
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.380]   scripture that Paul writes during this time as he's just waiting in prison. We
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.780]   get this letter of the Philippians, we get Ephesians, we get Colossians, we get
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:57.180]   some of these letters. And so he's writing from under house arrest, and I
[00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.300]   saw that's important, that's important. And so he writes the
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.020]   Philippians, he hears how they're doing, and he has to write to them. And so
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.300]   that's where we get, starting off right here in verse 1, to write the same
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:15.420]   things to you is no trouble. The same thing. So he's previously instructed them,
[00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:20.260]   he knew them, he was with their right, Paul and Silas, maybe you remember that
[00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.820]   story growing up. And he wants to write them the same things, especially he wants
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:32.860]   to pinpoint, laser focus on the gospel, on the gospel. See the gospels is as Tim
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.420]   Keller says really well, not the ABCs of Christianity, but the A through Z of
[00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.740]   Christianity. He doesn't want them to be distracted by some other doctrine or
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.900]   teaching or something else because there's been false apostles, there's
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.900]   false teachers, and people are spreading lies about that. And so he wants us to
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:02.660]   look right at the gospel. And what he's talking about, I'm reminded today is
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.220]   you guessed it, no not Halloween, it's Reformation Day. It's Reformation Day.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:18.180]   Yes, yes, of course. Yeah, so I'm a nerd and I got a really bad joke for you. So
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.380]   it's Halloween and some kids come to the door, they knock on Martin Luther's door.
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:38.740]   All right, they knock knock. "Who is it?" "Ah, trick or treat!" "No, no kids, I said 95
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.140]   feces, not 95 Reese's, okay? I don't have any candy for you. I got the gospel though."
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.980]   Okay, yeah, bad joke, bad joke. I just had to though, I couldn't resist. All right, so
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:57.700]   at least Pastor Mark is laughing with me, he gets the joke. All right,
[00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:03.660]   Reformation Day reminds us of how Martin Luther, John Calvin, these reformers, these
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:08.460]   others, they point us back to the truth because the church had gone way off and
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.500]   they reminded us of two huge things. That our trust is in the Word of
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.660]   God alone. That's our authority, God's Word. We got to find truth there, nowhere
[00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:28.660]   else. That's the ultimate place. And then secondly, that we are saved by grace. We
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.740]   are saved by grace through faith. And that's what really he is wanting to
[00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.340]   pinpoint and remind the Philippians of today. And I think we need that
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.780]   desperately as well. So that's what's coming up. That's what's going on. That's
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:50.140]   why the stupid joke. And Martin Luther, I love he said this, he says justification.
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:55.700]   Justification is the biblical Christian word that just means that we are saved
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.580]   by grace, we're accepted by God, we've declared and made righteous by his work,
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:05.860]   not our. He says justification is the article by which the church stands or
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:13.860]   falls. But he wants them to remember the gospel. He tells them this, "Therefore my
[00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.940]   brothers and sisters, you whom I love and long for, my joy in my crown, stand firm
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:25.900]   in the Lord this way, dear friends." He wants them to stand firm on the gospel.
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.100]   Stand firm in what I taught you. What Silas and I, what we taught you when we
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.700]   shared the gospel. And that's the same thing for us, brothers and sisters. Stand firm on
[00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:43.820]   the gospel. So that's our first point that I want us to get. We want to
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:49.220]   rejoice in the Lord. We rejoice in the Lord. We need to know the gospel. We need
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:53.660]   to stand firm on the gospel and nothing else. Friends, what are you standing firm
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.260]   on? What are you standing firm on today? Is it anything else other than the gospel?
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.580]   Then that will really be shaken. I can tell you from experience that will be
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:08.700]   shaken. All right. And we're just gonna continue to explore this even more.
[00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:14.860]   Second point is this, Paul has for us, is to reject works righteousness. If we
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:21.620]   really want to rejoice in the Lord, to take joy in knowing Christ, because
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.940]   that's what this passage is all about, then we have to reject works
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:33.500]   righteousness. We see that in verses 2 through 6. Look with me there. He says,
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.540]   "Watch out for those dogs, those evildoers, those mutilators of the flesh."
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:45.340]   Wow. He's got some strong language there. Strong language. He's not, he's not holding
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:52.060]   back. Dogs. All right. So he calls them dogs. So what's going on here, all right?
[00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:55.900]   What's going on here? They talk about circumcision before and maybe some
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.540]   of you get a little squeamish now. So there are these Jewish
[00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:05.740]   Christians and people who are coming in. There was this huge tension between Jews
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:10.700]   and non-Jews. Jews and Gentiles at the beginning of the church. And a lot of
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:14.380]   these Jewish Christians, some Jewish Christians were saying, "All right, you
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:20.580]   have to be circumcised in order to be a follower of Christ." And in fact, they so
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:25.300]   tied it to it that it was part of their justification, it was part of their salvation.
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.780]   That, all right, in order to know that you're really saved, you've got to be
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:35.900]   circumcised. All right? Maybe some Christians today, you think of, you think
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:40.340]   of, all right, you have to be baptized in order to be saved. It's like, all right,
[00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:45.340]   you know, you get saved because you, or you become saved, you become a follower
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:49.340]   of Christ, and then you get baptized. All right? But that doesn't mean it's not
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:53.900]   works-based. And so that's what he's getting at with this. That's what he's
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.300]   getting at. And he calls them dogs because back in the ancient world, 2,000
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.300]   years ago, it wasn't like your sweet little puppy dog, you know, it wasn't your
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:10.220]   nice pet dog. 2,000 years ago, all right, dogs were gross. They were filthy. No one
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:15.300]   had them as pets. They ran wild in the streets, okay? They were disgusting. All
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:21.740]   right? So he's saying, "The dogs." And you know what? It was a ethnic slur,
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:27.980]   actually, that Jews would use for non-Jews. They'd say, "Man, those dirty,
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:35.300]   uncircumcised Gentiles, those non-Jews, they're dogs." So Paul turns it around, he
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:38.860]   flips it around, he says, "You know what? Who really are the dogs? These people who
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:44.900]   are saying, 'Oh, you have to be circumcised in order to be a Christian.'"
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.340]   Because what did you have to do to be a Christian? To believe, to be saved by
[00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:53.420]   grace through faith, right? So he's saying, "All right, these evildoers, these
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:10:00.100]   mutilators of the flesh." He goes on, he says, "We are the circumcision, who
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:05.780]   worship by the Spirit of God in glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:08.980]   the flesh." So he's saying, "You need to reject works righteousness. You're not
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:16.900]   saved by this ritual, all right? No, you're saved by faith." Circumcision in the Old
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:22.860]   Testament was never meant to be a thing that, "Oh, that's a work that
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:27.820]   saved you." No, it was a sign. It pointed to the reality that you had been
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:33.780]   saved, that sin has been cut away in your life and now you're a follower of God.
[00:10:33.780 --> 00:10:40.700]   I love this. He goes on, verse 4, let's keep going, "Though I myself have reasons
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:46.340]   for such confidence." So now Paul is, all right, he's worked up here. He's like,
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.660]   "All right, if you want to say some confidence in the flesh of what our
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:56.540]   works are, he doesn't want them to be that way." So he says, "All right, I have
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:11:01.500]   some confidence in my flesh that I could talk about. If someone else thinks he has
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:08.980]   reasons to put confidence in flesh, I have more." All right? So then Paul goes
[00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:15.460]   into this and he has seven things that he can have confidence in, all right, that
[00:11:15.460 --> 00:11:20.220]   he was this amazing Jewish person, all right, circumcised on the eighth day.
[00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.100]   All right, you were supposed to do that according to Leviticus, according to the
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:31.620]   command of God, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin. All right,
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.980]   Benjamin, that tribe was one that sometimes stayed more faithful to God
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:40.780]   when other tribes fell away from God throughout Old Testament history. He was
[00:11:40.780 --> 00:11:43.900]   a Hebrew of Hebrews. All right, what does that mean? All right, we know, we already
[00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:49.780]   know you're Jewish, Paul, okay? No, so what that meant was that he was not only
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:56.740]   Jewish, but he actually spoke Aramaic and his parents spoke Aramaic. That was the
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:02.060]   Hebrew language of the day. So he's saying, "I don't just speak Greek, I speak,
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:06.500]   man, I'm..." So he's building his credential, all right? His resume is building. He's like,
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.140]   "Man, wow." All right, he keeps going though. In regard to the law of Pharisee,
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:16.580]   Pharisees were regarded as the strictest kind of Jewish sect at the time. There are
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:20.820]   a few kind of branches, if you will, of Judaism, and Pharisee, that was strict, and
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:29.980]   he was climbing that ladder. As for zeal, persecuted the church. I persecuted the
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:36.300]   church. Man, I was so zealous for my faith in God, I was such a good Jewish boy that,
[00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:41.020]   man, I held the cloaks for those, I held the coats, I was the coat rack for those,
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.900]   who stoned Stephen, the first Christian martyr. You can go back and look at
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:51.660]   that, it's like Acts 7, I think. I persecuted the church. As for
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.460]   righteousness based on the law, faultless. As for righteousness based on the law,
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:00.500]   faultless. All right, so this doesn't actually mean that Paul was without
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:04.620]   sin. You can read Romans 7, you can read a lot of the rest of his letters, he is
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:10.860]   very... He says, "I'm the chief of all sinners. I'm the worst." Right? But he said, "On the
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:15.740]   outside, I kept all the laws. On the outside, it looked like I was perfect."
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:21.020]   That's what he's talking about here. So he's telling, all right, this is...
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.620]   Paul's supposed to sound just crazy. All these things, though, they sound very,
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:33.660]   very good. The Jews would be wowed by his resume, you know? Maybe for some of you,
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.700]   maybe some of you young people who are looking to go to college, or went to
[00:13:38.700 --> 00:13:43.580]   college, or going to get your master's, or whatever. Man, you did so many
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:50.220]   extracurriculars, right? And you're Asian too, I know how it is. No, I'm just kidding.
[00:13:50.220 --> 00:13:57.620]   Hey, hey, yeah, exactly. I shout out because I grew up in San Francisco Bay Area. I was
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.500]   talking to Pastor Mark before on this. I was just back after 11 years, San
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:07.140]   Francisco Bay Area. And I got a lot of my Asian friends there, man. All the Asian
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:12.580]   love, man. I'm telling you. All my friends were Chinese, and all my friends,
[00:14:12.580 --> 00:14:17.620]   most of my friends were Asian because I was in the honors AP classes, right? They
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:21.300]   were in the honors AP. So they were all Asian. I'm just saying, I'm just saying. I
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:26.460]   know how it is. I know your parents and how your parents are. Yeah, there you go.
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:32.100]   But yeah, maybe you were building that resume to try to impress your parents.
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:36.900]   But maybe you keep doing that to try to impress God. Man, God, I've done this for
[00:14:36.900 --> 00:14:41.420]   you. I've sacrificed. I went on that mission trip. Man, I'm praying hard. I'm
[00:14:41.420 --> 00:14:45.740]   reading my Bible. It's just the same thing like circumcision. All right, I'm
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:53.860]   all right. That'll make me earn your approval. I know for me, I was just
[00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:59.460]   the same way, a huge way. I remember when I was in college, I became part of this
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:03.860]   church. And it was a very passionate church. There were a lot of good
[00:15:03.860 --> 00:15:08.980]   things there. I remember I was coming out of a, I've shared with many people in my
[00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:14.700]   church, I deal with situational depression. And I had the worst, my
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:21.060]   first bout when I was 17. And I would have been depressed out of my mind. I had
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:25.980]   considered myself before that a mature Christian. But God really humbled
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.340]   me. And so I have all that baggage and I'm going, I come out here to the Midwest
[00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:34.740]   to go to school. I go to Wheaton College. And right, it's just this, supposed to be
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:40.500]   this evangelical flagship that just, and there's, I'm on a dorm floor and there's
[00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:48.460]   40 other Christian guys. And you know, we were praying in the classroom. I have
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:52.460]   professors who are Christian. I go to chapel three times a week, three times.
[00:15:52.460 --> 00:15:59.900]   Chapel. I get involved in this passionate church, right? I go on mission trips. Man,
[00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:04.500]   God totally changed my life through this dorm discipleship group, these
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:08.980]   guys. He started to bring me out of this depression and really restore my
[00:16:08.980 --> 00:16:14.420]   relationship with him again. This group was so intense that it meant three
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:20.380]   nights a week as a very rigorous academic school. Three nights a week. This
[00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:25.140]   meant, and they totally changed my life. I got real with these other guys and
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:31.260]   they got real with me about their lives and we encouraged each other. And so I
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:36.540]   just wanted to share my faith with others as well. And I would go to some
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:43.140]   local campuses, college campuses, and share my faith with them. And I would go
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:49.100]   one to three times a week to share the gospel with people at campuses. I started
[00:16:49.100 --> 00:16:54.580]   leading small groups with my church. I was passionate and I would fast
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:58.940]   one or two times a day because I want to set apart time to meet with God. I would
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:05.220]   spend two or three hours in the morning meeting with God. You know, after a couple
[00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:10.500]   years of all that, I remember at one point I was trying to spend just a few
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:17.340]   minutes with God. This was after I was married and my wife and I, our picture of
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:20.340]   the world and our worldview of Christianity had been totally turned upside
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:23.940]   down just a few months before because we had realized some very dysfunctional
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:29.700]   things about that church. It was very passionate but it was so works
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:34.340]   oriented. And I had this huge burden on my shoulders of self-righteousness
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:40.660]   because I was a Pharisee of Pharisees, guys. See, I had an impressive resume too.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:43.940]   On the outside I looked really good, but man on the inside I felt like dead man's
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.820]   bones. And that's Paul's story too. And so he's passionate about telling the
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:56.220]   Philippians here, "Man, trust in the gospel of grace." Preaching the gospel to
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:18:00.860]   yourself. It requires us, you see here, "reject works righteousness." He says, "All
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:06.500]   right, reject it. Don't put it, base it on anything else, your own works, your own
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:14.340]   goodness, whatever, other than Christ's goodness, His grace." All right, let's keep
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:19.380]   going. Third point, "Remain in faith righteousness." Remain in faith
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:27.260]   righteousness. We see this in verses 7 through 11. "But whatever were gains to me
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:35.020]   I now consider loss for the sake of Christ." So if you will, he's got
[00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:40.660]   these two columns, right? Your gains and losses column. He says, "All right,
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:45.260]   just as I went through all these gains, he went through all these gains. I'm a
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:48.900]   Hebrew of Hebrews. I was circumcised on the eighth day. I was a Pharisee. I
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:54.380]   persecuted the church. Man, I was there. I was so passionate for God." He's got
[00:18:54.380 --> 00:18:58.980]   all these gains. He says, "You know what? They're in the losses column now.
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:05.540]   Every single one of them. Every single one of them. Where gains to me now I
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:09.100]   consider as a loss for the sake of Christ. What is more?" He goes further,
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.700]   verse 8, "I consider everything a loss because of the surpassing worth of
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:23.340]   knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things." Remember,
[00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:30.260]   he's in house arrest in Rome. Man, he's been shipwrecked a couple
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:38.660]   times. He's been beat with rods. He's suffered the lashes. He's been stoned. One
[00:19:38.660 --> 00:19:42.220]   time they thought he was dead. He was just been stoned. They were about to
[00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:46.380]   make him, they were about to sacrifice to him. They were calling him Zeus and
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:52.860]   Barnabas, him Hermes and Barnabas Zeus. They were about to make sacrifices to
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:58.180]   him. And then some Jews come in and they start stoning him. Man, what a
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:02.940]   contrast there. They thought he was dead, but he ends up getting up. This guy had
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:09.020]   been through so much, right? He says, "All right, because of this grace, because this
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:15.580]   free gift of grace, not works righteousness, lost all things because I
[00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:21.300]   want to know Jesus. I want to know Jesus. I consider them garbage." So not only
[00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:26.180]   are they in the loss column, but I consider them garbage. That's this word
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:32.060]   that means refuse. Refuse. So I want to say then, just think about what this word
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:40.020]   means. They didn't have running water or a sanitation system like we do now.
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:50.700]   Nuff said. Refuse. He says, "All these good works, I consider them refuse and be found
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:55.100]   in him." Verse 9, "Not having a righteousness of my own that comes from
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:21:00.620]   the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ." The righteousness from
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:05.060]   God on the basis of faith.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:13.900]   It's amazing. It's good news. It is good news. We're learning to preach the
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:18.740]   gospel to ourselves. We need to learn to preach the gospel to ourselves to know
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:24.340]   this. So what is it for you? Maybe is it your own purity? Maybe that your
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:31.740]   parents are Christian? That you're Christian? That you go to church? Maybe
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.300]   you've done some significantly good things in your life? Your knowledge of
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:42.980]   the Bible? Your giving? Your overall just you're a good moral person? Is
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:49.340]   that what you're basing your acceptance with God in? Or is it in Christ's work?
[00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:59.860]   Verses 9, he talks about the life of righteousness. That we're saved by faith
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:04.740]   alone, Luther said, but that faith that saves is not alone. So how do we remain
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:10.500]   in faith righteousness? Yeah, we keep on rejecting it. We find ourselves in that.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:14.700]   We encourage ourselves in that. That it's by grace. We keep on preaching that to
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.420]   ourselves, but we also want to continue. We want to obey. We want to keep
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:25.980]   following Christ. And this is amazing what he says here. Let's keep going on.
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:30.300]   Verse 9, he says, "And be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:35.440]   comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ." I want to know
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:41.340]   Christ, yes. I want to know the power of the resurrection and participation in
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:46.180]   sufferings, becoming like him in his death, and so somehow attaining to the
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:52.060]   resurrection of the dead. That I may know him. Man, we make life about so many
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:58.100]   things, guys, right? But do you, every day, do you get up and say, "All right, I want to
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:05.060]   know Jesus today. At the end of today, I want to know Jesus." He says, "I want the
[00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:09.660]   power of his resurrection." What's the power of his resurrection? The power to
[00:23:09.660 --> 00:23:17.980]   save sinners. That sinners are saved. That, all right, we get the righteousness of
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:24.340]   Christ because he got all our sin on the cross, and God punished him for that. But
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:30.460]   then that means we get the righteousness of Christ. That's amazing. The power of
[00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:35.500]   the resurrection is also God saves us through Jesus on the cross, but then he
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:41.860]   also helps us to live a life of love, of loving others, of loving God. It's the
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:47.580]   power to live holy lives. That I may share in his sufferings. Man, did you see
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:51.140]   that this last week? Did you say like, "Man, you know what? I want to share in the
[00:23:51.140 --> 00:24:00.460]   sufferings of Jesus." I doubt most of you said that. Man, we might not be persecuted
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:06.260]   in a way that Paul is, but we will in other ways. If we're sharing the gospel,
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:10.620]   we can do that. If we're living as Christians, as we just go through
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.540]   hardship in our lives because of the choices that we make to follow Jesus,
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:19.740]   it's gonna be difficult. It is hard to be a Christian. The way is narrow, and it's
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:26.420]   hard, but it leads to life. He says, "Becoming like him in his death." Becoming
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:33.620]   like him in his death. That we also can die to ourselves. We can die to our sin
[00:24:33.620 --> 00:24:41.900]   to follow him. That he would attain the resurrection of the dead. So don't get
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:47.740]   Paul wrong. He's saying, "Once saved, always saved," but we have to endure to the
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:55.140]   end. He's encouraging that you have to continue to follow Christ. It's the cross
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:25:02.540]   before the crown. That we die before we can live, and we do that each day in our
[00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:09.700]   lives. So how do we, again, rejoice in knowing Christ? We remain in faith
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:16.580]   righteousness. In our righteousness, we are righteous because of our faith in him,
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:22.980]   not our own works. Fourthly, fourth point, he says to reside in his work of
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:29.980]   righteousness. We rest in his work of righteousness. We see this in verses 12
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:35.820]   and also through the end of the passage in 4.1. How do we do this? How do we do
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:40.180]   this? I love there's this, there's this line in the book of Hebrews, and he's
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:44.500]   talking about the rest of God. The rest of God. The Sabbath rest for God's
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:49.420]   people. And he says, "You know, man, you guys need to rest." He says, "How do you do that
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:58.780]   though? You strive." What? "You work really hard to not work." So what he's saying is,
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:04.620]   you got to work, you got to fight to remain in his righteousness. That it's
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:09.580]   not your work to be accepted by God. You got to work at that. You got to work to
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:14.460]   also live a life of holiness as you continue, because he wants to strain
[00:26:14.460 --> 00:26:18.660]   toward the goal. We see this in verse 12. He says, "Not that I have already obtained
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:24.260]   this." Alright, so I'm not with Christ fully now. I'm not in heaven. I'm
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:29.140]   not arrived at that goal. I'm not perfect, but I press on to take hold of which
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:34.500]   for which Christ Jesus has taken hold of me. Alright, so I can I can strive for
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:38.220]   that because, man, I'm already Christ. He took hold of me. Can you get out of
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:47.780]   Christ's hand? No. How absurd would that be? How can you go out of God's hand? So I
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:55.060]   want to keep on going to make Christ my own. I want to press on, take hold of it.
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:04.540]   It's like this picture, right? I love the great artist, sculptor, Michelangelo,
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:11.140]   right? You guys probably know that famous statue of David, picture of David,
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:17.220]   and Michelangelo was asked, "Alright, how do you do this?
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:21.660]   You produce these amazing works, sculptures and works of art. How do you
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:26.180]   do this?" He says, "I just..." See, back then what they'd get is this big
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:32.620]   rectangular or block of marble, just huge massive block of marble, alright? And he
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:37.660]   says, "I would look at the block of marble and I would see the man in there. I would
[00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:41.460]   see the man in there and I just have to try to call it out. I have to like bring
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:47.980]   it out of there." Isn't that beautiful? But how he does that, there's this block of
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:53.060]   marble and he would have to go over there and have this huge block and slowly chip
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:59.900]   away at this block of marble all around it to get this amazing, just very
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:09.300]   intricate, detailed body of David that we see. That's what God does to us. Holiness,
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:18.180]   striving toward God, is as we continue to reside, to rest in his work for us,
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:25.140]   we have to press on toward the goal. It's painful at times. He's chipping it away
[00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:31.180]   at our sinful nature, but that prize, he says, "The prize is the fullness of
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:37.300]   rewards and joys in heaven." And so he sets his eyes on that, the fullness of
[00:28:37.300 --> 00:28:45.740]   the rewards and joys in heaven. It's this perfect life with Christ forever.
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:53.780]   Verse 17, he says this, he says, "Join together in following my example,
[00:28:53.780 --> 00:28:59.500]   brothers and sisters, just as you have us as a model. Keep your eyes on those who
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:05.940]   live as we do." Alright, so look at me, look at your Christian leaders, look
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:12.020]   at your pastor here, look at the leaders and mentors that you guys have. To imitate
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:16.460]   them, imitate them, to have godly discipleship. Maybe some of you need to
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:20.820]   say, call up or text someone in the church and say, "You know what? I need to
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:26.300]   talk to you. I love, I need your help in following Christ. Let's do this together.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:32.460]   Let's follow Christ together." That's huge. That's massive. That has totally changed
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:36.540]   my life, walking with other believers, walking with other men of God who I want
[00:29:36.540 --> 00:29:40.540]   to be like, and we can sharpen one another.
[00:29:40.540 --> 00:29:50.500]   Verse 18, "For as I have often told you before and now tell you again, even with
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:55.380]   tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their destiny is destruction.
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:30:00.140]   Their God is their stomach. Their glory and their shame, their mind is set on
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:06.140]   earthly things." So what's he talking about here? So these are these Judaizers,
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:11.060]   again, who, they're on a self-salvation project. They're saying, you know, you need
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:15.220]   to add these dietary laws, you need to add this circumcision, whatever, so it's
[00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.420]   Jesus plus something equals your acceptance with God, rather than just
[00:30:19.420 --> 00:30:25.020]   Jesus equals your acceptance with God. He's wanting to add these things to them.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:31.980]   And Paul says their destiny is final judgment. They worship themselves. That's
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:34.660]   what we're talking about. They worship their belly. They just worship
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:40.100]   themselves. Man, when I was so burdened by my own self-righteousness and just
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:44.020]   living, I was just always navel-gazing, as I like to say. I just
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:48.060]   always like, "Man, how am I doing? Am I doing good? Am I doing enough for God? Man,
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:53.580]   that's so exhausting, right? That's so exhausting." He says the things that we
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:57.380]   can do, the earthly things, the works of the flesh, they're consumed with earthly
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:06.500]   things, rather than Christ's external work, His work. Verses 20 through 21, here's
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:12.060]   another thing that the Philippians could have boasted. He says, "But our citizenship
[00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:18.340]   is in heaven." You see, Philippi, they thought they were all that, because they
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:22.380]   were a Roman colony. So they're like, "You know what? I get free taxes. How cool
[00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:27.420]   would that be, right? Free taxes." I mean, what am I saying? Free tax. That's what we
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:33.420]   get all right. No. They had freedom from taxes. They wouldn't get taxed, because
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.220]   they were a Roman colony. And so everyone there who was born there, you were a
[00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:43.460]   citizen automatically. You had this special thing. It was the status at
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:49.180]   the time. And so he's saying, "All right, your citizenship is in heaven. It's not
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:55.300]   with Caesar. It's not with Rome, right? So our identity, right? Our identity is not in
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:32:00.300]   our performance. It's not in other people's approval of us. It's our identity is in
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:06.340]   Christ, in heaven. And from there, we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:11.260]   Christ, who by the power that enables Him to bring everything under His control
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:16.620]   will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like His glorious body." So he
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:20.660]   says, "All right, there's the prize. There's the prize." He's using that imagery of the
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.140]   ancient world. They were really big into sports, just like we are today. And
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:31.060]   there was that image of a wreath that at the finish line, that they would be
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:38.140]   given this crown, this wreath. And he's saying, "All right, there's this prize you can go for
[00:32:38.140 --> 00:32:45.020]   of reaching Christ, of running the race." And he's saying, "Yeah, I know it's hard to
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:49.020]   transform your lowly bodies because right now we are dying every day, right?
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:55.260]   We're dying every day. We're fighting against sin. We're slugging it out
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:33:02.140]   and different hardships in our lives. But he says, "One day, we'll have a glorious body.
[00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:13.020]   We're gonna have a glorious body. Perfection is coming." He says, "Therefore,
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:20.220]   brothers and sisters, with you whom I love and long for," he wants to see them
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:28.900]   again, "my joy and my crown." There's that crown, that imagery, right? "My joy and my
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.660]   crown. Stand firm in the Lord in this way, dear friends." He says, "Keep on going.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:39.260]   Remain in the gospel. Remain faithful." And maybe some of you need to hear that
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:45.140]   now. You know, the uncertainty of maybe things with COVID, uncertainty maybe with
[00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:49.380]   things with your job, things with how your future is gonna be maybe after
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:54.460]   graduation, with a relationship you're in, with your family dynamics. I don't know
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:34:00.460]   what's going on with you. Just stay firm in the gospel. Just stay firm in following
[00:34:00.460 --> 00:34:08.220]   Christ because we can rejoice in Christ because His work for us, not our work,
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:14.460]   that saved us. That we are totally accepted by God. Just as Christ is
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:20.620]   accepted, He treats us the same way. We are accepted before God. That is a good
[00:34:20.620 --> 00:34:28.100]   news. I'll close with this. You know, it reminds me, we can rejoice in Christ.
[00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:34.180]   We can rejoice in knowing Him, that we know Him. It's like this. It can be
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:40.180]   like marriage. It can be like falling in love. Have any of you fallen in love?
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:49.260]   She's saying that, you know, as her husband, I think, is next door. You know,
[00:34:49.260 --> 00:34:55.180]   you'll do, you'll do. People in love are crazy. They'll do anything. They're nuts,
[00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:59.220]   right? You know what I'm saying? They're nuts. They're crazy. You'll do anything.
[00:34:59.220 --> 00:35:04.380]   They start acting weird ways, right? I just, you know, you're like, you're like,
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:08.020]   "Oh, I thought I knew him. Like, I thought he would never, you know, we were still
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:13.180]   gonna be friends. Now it's like, she came in and it's like, who are you?" You know,
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:18.580]   they start doing crazy things. You know, public displays of affection.
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:26.260]   I thought, I never thought that they would do that. People in love are crazy. You'll do
[00:35:26.260 --> 00:35:32.060]   anything for that person. You didn't care about anything else. But imagine this.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:38.220]   Imagine, each of you, you're married to Mr. Law. Imagine with me here. You're
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:44.140]   married to Mr. Law. And Mr. Law, he likes everything very particular. He likes
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:49.380]   everything very particular. So he would come home every day at 5. He eats the
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:56.660]   same breakfast every morning. He comes out at 5. He demands a kiss and dinner on
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:03.540]   the table. You always had to look just right for him. Otherwise, you'd hear from
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:10.100]   it. You could never really be real in your authentic self with Mr. Law. No, you
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:16.500]   definitely couldn't be. All the time, you just felt like you were striving to be
[00:36:16.500 --> 00:36:22.860]   good enough. You never felt good enough for him. Like, sure, yeah, he'd married you,
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:30.300]   but no matter how desperately hard you try, you always felt like you were just
[00:36:30.300 --> 00:36:36.660]   letting him down. And in fact, he would tell you that. He would tell you that. You
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.460]   were never good enough for him. You're always working on yourself. You're always
[00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:51.740]   trying to gain his approval. But then one day, Mr. Law died. And Mr. Faith
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:57.340]   Righteousness came. I sound like Pilgrim's Progress, John Bunyan or
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:03.540]   something right here. Jesus comes. Mr. Righteousness by faith. Mr. Grace. He
[00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:10.780]   comes and he sweeps you off your feet. Indeed, it seemed he always loved you, no
[00:37:10.780 --> 00:37:21.820]   matter all your deep shortcomings. He always put your needs above his.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:29.700]   Every day, every moment, he was dying to himself for you. He always took out the
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:37.620]   trash. He cleaned the bathroom. With him, you were still so very in touch with
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:43.900]   your massive shortcomings. You just felt even more like, "Man, I'm so messed up." But
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:53.940]   you knew how much he loved and accepted you. You always found yourself actually
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:59.940]   just loving him more. Loving life more. Loving other people more. And you were
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:06.020]   slowly even changing and becoming a better person. That's what Paul talks
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:10.180]   about in the letters. And I think what he's getting at here, he says in
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.420]   Romans, he writes this. He says, "Likewise, my brothers and sisters, you have
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:21.300]   died to the law." You were married to Mr. Law. You died through the body of Christ
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:27.020]   so that you may belong to another. That's marriage language. To him who has been
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:32.540]   raised from the dead that you may bear fruit for God. For a while, you are still
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:36.900]   living in your flesh. Your sinful passions aroused by the law were at work
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:41.500]   in your members to bear fruit for death. But now you're released from the law.
[00:38:41.500 --> 00:38:49.300]   You're no longer under this. You have to earn your way. But Christ earned
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:56.300]   your way for you, having died to that which held us captive. Friends, I want
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:39:01.500]   you, I want myself to know the joy rejoicing to knowing Christ. Here's how
[00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:06.580]   you do this. Paul says right here, "Rejoice in the Lord."
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:14.180]   Reject works righteousness. Remain in faith righteousness. Rest in his work of
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:18.700]   righteousness. Let's pray. Father in heaven, we thank you that you sent Jesus
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:26.540]   and we're reminded of that today. Lord, that what you do, you did what the law
[00:39:26.540 --> 00:39:32.140]   couldn't do. Lord, I pray that we would rejoice. We'd have so much joy flowing
[00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:36.980]   out of our lives because we know Jesus. That we would make our life about that.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:41.860]   That we would revel in what you've done. That we would reject any other kind of
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:46.980]   righteousness, any kind of way of making ourselves acceptable to you God, whatever
[00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:54.500]   that may look like. In Jesus' name I pray, amen.
