[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480]   - Thank you everyone.
[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.320]   Mark.
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Good morning to all of you.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.480]   And we're gonna turn to the word of God today.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.520]   And we're gonna start a new series.
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.640]   And this new series of messages
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.840]   is on new heaven and new earth.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.560]   New heaven, new earth.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.820]   If you know the Bible a little bit,
[00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.420]   you should know that the Bible has quite a bit
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.680]   to say about our future, the conclusion.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.680]   Just imagine there's a song or there's a great musical piece.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.240]   When you're playing along and listen along the song
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.240]   or the musical piece, it's going somewhere, right?
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.080]   It's going somewhere, it's going to some conclusion
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.700]   or some coda.
[00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.600]   This is what the Bible says.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.120]   The Bible, the first two chapters is on the first creation.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.420]   And the last two chapters is on the final,
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.080]   new heaven and new earth, the new creation.
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.120]   So the Bible, if you read from cover to cover,
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.600]   you should know there's a grand story.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.280]   It going from the first creation,
[00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.880]   which is our current life and creation,
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.000]   and it's going somewhere in the final destination.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.880]   It's like going on a journey.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.120]   You're taking different turns
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.260]   and different detours in between.
[00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.680]   However, there was a final destination going toward.
[00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.160]   That is what the biblical story and biblical worldview.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.200]   We need to understand this so that we know
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.800]   where our story fits into God's whole grand story.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.160]   And in the middle of it, first creation,
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.920]   and then the last creation, the new creation,
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.720]   in between is what Jesus Christ did for us.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.880]   Jesus came to human history and he died on the cross,
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.840]   sacrificed himself to redeem us
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.260]   so that we can be the people of God.
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.600]   And then he rose from the dead,
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.800]   and then he ascended to heaven
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.520]   and seated at the right hand of the Father
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.600]   and reigning as our heavenly King.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.180]   In between is Christ.
[00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.180]   And we are going toward the final conclusion
[00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.080]   of this huge, grand story.
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.360]   So the Bible has a lot to say about new heaven
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.660]   and new earth, our future.
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.920]   The Bible has many different passages
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.320]   that has valuable teaching, very good teaching,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.960]   and to remind us where are we going.
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.200]   I don't know if you've, sometimes we think about
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.080]   questions of ultimate purpose.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.740]   You know, where am I going?
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:39.580]   Where am I going?
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.540]   And where will I go when I pass away?
[00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.720]   Or some of the friends that you may know
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.440]   have already passed away and left us.
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.360]   And where are they going?
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.200]   Does the Bible have anything to say about our future?
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.040]   Right?
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.760]   Couple, in the past three weeks,
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.200]   our staff and our church have been pretty busy,
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.160]   you know, trying to get some, prepare for funerals.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.520]   And it's not a very nice thing to do.
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.920]   I mean, it's not pleasing to do,
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.240]   but, you know, we come alongside with the grieving families
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.640]   and try to help them out.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.920]   And we have couple of funerals
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   and for people who are dearest to us.
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.920]   And we were in the funerals and we kind of said goodbye
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.000]   or better, see you later to those we love,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.440]   but they passed away before us.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.480]   So, you know, I try to reflect on, you know,
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.200]   what the Bible has to say.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.200]   And why does the Bible teach us, you know, those things?
[00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.240]   What happens when you die?
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.200]   And where is the whole creation?
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.960]   Where is the whole world heading to?
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.960]   So today we're gonna turn to the first passage,
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.760]   which is in the Gospel of John, the Gospel of John.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.200]   Okay, let me read that first.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.360]   This is what Jesus said to the disciples.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.960]   He said, "Do not let your hearts be troubled.
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.360]   "Trust in God, trust also in me.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.040]   "There is more than enough room in my Father's home.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:23.080]   "If this were not so, would I have told you
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.680]   "that I am going to prepare a place for you?
[00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.120]   "When everything is ready, I'll come and get you
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.760]   "so that you will always be with me where I am.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.080]   "And you know the way to where I'm going."
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.960]   Now, Thomas said, one of the disciples,
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.680]   "No, we don't know, Lord.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.560]   "We have no idea where you are going.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.080]   "So how can we know the way?"
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.000]   And Jesus replied, he told him,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.460]   "I am the way, the truth, the life.
[00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.360]   "And no one can come to the Father except through me."
[00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.240]   Now, this short passage is actually part
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.240]   of the long passage, or long sermon,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.840]   message Jesus told his disciples.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.560]   And that long, long portion in the Gospel of John
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.920]   is from chapter 13 to 17.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.120]   Sometimes we call this long portion
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.720]   as a farewell discourse, farewell discourse.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.000]   It's Jesus' farewell discourse.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.160]   He's trying to say farewell to his disciples.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:30.440]   And you remember this was the last night
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.480]   that they had the last supper together.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.480]   And after that, in 18.1, so after chapter 13 to 17,
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.560]   many different things put together.
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.640]   All the things Jesus has said to his disciples,
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:49.360]   his last night on earth, farewell discourse.
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.440]   And then after all of this, 13 to 17, 18.1,
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.880]   it says, "After saying these things,
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.160]   "Jesus crossed the Kidron Valley with his disciples
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.920]   "and entered into a garden.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.980]   "And that garden, as we know, is Gethsemane.
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:06.960]   "And he was arrested, betrayed,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:10.880]   "and he was taken to Jerusalem, and he died on the cross."
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.880]   So the little passage that I have just read from John 14
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.040]   was part of this entire farewell discourse.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:22.040]   I think about it, when you have friends
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.520]   who are moving somewhere else,
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.860]   and you have a farewell dinner, right?
[00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.300]   What did they say, and what have they done,
[00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.960]   usually are very, very impressive to you,
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.280]   and impressive in your mind,
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:39.640]   and you probably would remember the moment
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:44.160]   or the environment that your friend
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.360]   has said farewell to you.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.240]   Or before someone passed away,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.600]   usually the moment that he or she passed away.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.480]   There are times that the last moment of his or her life,
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.760]   he or she may have said something
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.520]   or may have done something
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.520]   that you will remember the rest of your life.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.880]   Now, this is kind of the farewell discourse
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.400]   we quoted in the Gospel of John.
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.960]   And Jesus said many things to his disciple,
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:17.960]   and one of the things he said was to prepare a home
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.440]   for you and for me in heaven.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.400]   So there are a couple of points
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.480]   I wanna point out from this passage.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.600]   The first point is Jesus prepares our home in heaven.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.160]   Let's take a look at 14, one, and one, two, three.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:37.200]   Don't let your hearts be troubled.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.040]   Why?
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:42.080]   Because Jesus is about to leave them, right?
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:46.240]   But Jesus said, "Don't let your hearts be troubled.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.720]   "Trust in God, trust also in me.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.560]   "There's more than enough room in my Father's home.
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:54.480]   "If there were not so, would I have told you
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.840]   "I'm going to prepare a place for you?
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.840]   "When everything is ready, I will come and get you
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.160]   "so that you will always be with me where I am."
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.760]   Now, in the time of Jesus, 2,000 years ago,
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.960]   in the first century, usually there were
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:16.480]   not many single houses.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.120]   You know, in Chicago, you drive around
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.680]   in different streets and roads,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.560]   you see a lot of different single houses, right?
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:24.200]   How many of you live in a single house?
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:25.040]   Single house, right?
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.240]   How many of you live in a townhouse
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:29.720]   where you share a wall with other people
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:32.880]   or condo, right, or dormitory, right?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:36.600]   Not many single houses in Jesus' day.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:38.720]   Most of the houses, most of the rooms
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.160]   are connected and attached to one another.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.960]   What is happening is that usually,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.720]   according to the custom, is that when the son
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.760]   is ready to get married, usually around 18 or 19 year old
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:55.400]   or even earlier, younger, when the son is ready
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.600]   to get married and the parents will arrange the marriage,
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.040]   in those days there were no, you know,
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:04.160]   just dating and all that stuff,
[00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:07.920]   and the parents do all the things for the children,
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:09.400]   especially for their son.
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:13.200]   So when the son is getting ready to get married,
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.760]   two families or two pairs of parents will come together
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:19.720]   and they talk about the terms or bride prices
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.200]   and all that stuff, and they sort out everything
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.000]   and they arrange the marriage for the young man
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:27.840]   and young woman.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:32.840]   And the son is getting ready and he will go with the bride
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:37.840]   and he will go with his father to the village of the bride.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.440]   You know, set out all the terms and sort out
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.280]   all the arrangements for marriage,
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.040]   and then the son will return back to his father's home
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.760]   and beside the father's house,
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.200]   he will build another small house.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.880]   And usually it will take about a year.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   And then after that year, they engage for one year
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.040]   and then the son will go to the village
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:11.120]   and will receive the bride back home.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.800]   So usually the father's house,
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.720]   it has attached to the son's house,
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:16.720]   and then generation after generation,
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.480]   all these houses are connected together.
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.920]   And then in the middle of it,
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.800]   probably is a courtyard or garden or something,
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.160]   and they share space in the middle.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:31.160]   Now this is quite similar to some Asian culture, right?
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.600]   Where all the houses are connected, right?
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   You got the grandfather, you got the father,
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.200]   and then you got the son and the grandson
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.280]   and the great-grandson.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   They are all living together
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:45.160]   and sharing one space in between, in the middle of it.
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:48.000]   Now this is the same thing for the Palestinian culture.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.880]   When the son is getting married
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.360]   or getting ready to take the bride,
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.640]   he would take one year to prepare the house
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.880]   so that the bride will have a home.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.440]   Now with that kind of background,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.360]   you understand what Jesus is trying to say.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:08.800]   He said, "I am leaving you now, temporary.
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:13.520]   Just for the time being, I will not be with you.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:17.760]   However, I will come back and I will take you.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:23.800]   I will take you and I will bring you to my father's home,
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.800]   to my father's house, where I have already prepared
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.200]   a room for you."
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.640]   With that said, no, this kind of farewell discourse,
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.200]   this kind of farewell goodbye speech
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.640]   is not a matter of abandonment.
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:41.440]   Jesus is not saying, "I'm abandoning you."
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   Jesus is saying, "I am making you a promise,
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.960]   just like a groom promising a bride.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:53.000]   I will come and take you.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.520]   I will prepare a home, a heavenly home,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.120]   where nothing can destroy, a perfect home for you."
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:06.560]   Last week, I was in Kansas City and I was in seminary
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.280]   and we have an intensive seminar.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:14.560]   So I was in Kansas City in the Airbnb for four or five days
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:18.440]   and it was pretty nice, pretty nice.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.720]   We booked an Airbnb and I shared the Airbnb
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.760]   with another pastor's friend.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:29.040]   And however, everything is clean,
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.240]   but I still don't like it.
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.280]   I still don't like it.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:38.160]   A few days on, I kind of miss my home, right?
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:42.000]   I kind of miss my own bed, my own mattress.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.080]   Have you ever felt that way?
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.120]   You miss home, right?
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.960]   You're homesick, right?
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.280]   Yeah, of course you miss your family members,
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:53.200]   your sons and daughters and your wife and all that, right?
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:59.880]   This is the sense that within us,
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.000]   that we're yearning for home.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.520]   We get homesick.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:08.960]   Jesus is saying, "I am preparing a home for you."
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:11.440]   And that home is gonna be different.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.840]   It's in heaven and it's perfect.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:16.640]   And there's no pain and there's no tears.
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:20.520]   There's no suffering in that home, right?
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.600]   We feel homesick from time to time.
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:26.560]   And we know what that feeling is like.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:30.560]   A couple of weeks ago, as you know,
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:36.600]   Maui, right, Maui, the island in Hawaii,
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:41.080]   was destroyed by wildfire, big fire,
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:43.640]   displacing thousands of people.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.000]   And I was reading some news articles
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.360]   and some discussions online,
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.080]   and I ran into this opinion.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:53.320]   And the headline says,
[00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:59.560]   Maui fire shows that Hawaii paradise was a dream.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:04.080]   Have you ever been to Hawaii?
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.880]   Paradise, right?
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.400]   Paradise.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.640]   You know, a lot of billionaires,
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.200]   they just put a house there and, you know,
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:13.160]   build a house there, right?
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.400]   It's kind of like monopoly, right?
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.480]   Very nice place, I'm gonna build a house there, right?
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.560]   The fire consumes everything.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:25.040]   And the fire shows us this paradise on earth
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:26.560]   is simply a dream.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:29.200]   Where is our true home?
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:34.200]   Jesus said, "Your true home is not here.
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:37.560]   "It's in heaven.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:40.600]   "It's the home I prepare for you."
[00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:43.960]   He said to his disciples, he said to us,
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.320]   "No matter how comfortable we are in our own homes,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.080]   "they are not permanent.
[00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.240]   "They're not eternal.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:59.560]   "Your loved one will pass away and will destroy the home.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:05.000]   "Your family may last for decades.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.840]   "However, at the end of the day,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.360]   "the final enemy comes knock on your door.
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.480]   "And his name is death.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.920]   "And your home will not last."
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.320]   The home in Hawaii won't last.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.880]   Our home won't last.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:28.680]   The only home that is prepared in heaven will last.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:30.880]   And that's where my yearning is.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.920]   That's where our desire should be.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.400]   So Jesus prepares a home for us.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:41.360]   And also, second point, is Jesus is the way home.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:47.800]   He not only prepared a home for us, but he is the way.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.840]   He's not just pointing us to the right way to go home.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.400]   He himself is the way home.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.560]   Verses five.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:03.080]   Thomas, one of the best Sunday school students, I guess,
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.800]   and he was curious.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.680]   After hearing Jesus' farewell and goodbye speech,
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.040]   Thomas said, "No, we don't know, Lord Jesus.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.560]   "We have no idea where you're going.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.080]   "And how can we know the way?
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:15.760]   "How can we go after you?
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.320]   "How can we follow you?"
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:21.960]   Jesus told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:23.360]   "No one can come to the Father.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:26.440]   "No one can go home except through me."
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:31.160]   Here it says the way home, right?
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:35.080]   The journey or the route that will bring you home.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.440]   And you need to understand,
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:41.640]   it's a little bit geography here.
[00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:46.120]   People living in Israel, especially in the ancient world,
[00:16:46.120 --> 00:16:49.680]   the land of Israel is the center of everything.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:55.640]   It connects Africa, Asia, and Europe.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.520]   Canaan, Israel, is the center,
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:02.840]   the heart of the entire world, the ancient world.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.080]   And therefore, there were many different roads
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:10.000]   and highways would pass through the land of Israel.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.720]   In fact, people living in Israel,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:17.240]   when they imagine life, when they imagine daily living,
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:21.080]   they will talk in terms of walking.
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:25.000]   How you live is how you walk,
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.200]   because every day you are walking.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.120]   Every day you are living right next to
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.160]   a huge highway intersections, right?
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:37.960]   Everyone has driven through downtown Chicago, right?
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:40.520]   There's so many different highways and exit, right?
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.160]   That is what land of Israel is like.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.880]   You live in Israel, you are like living right next to
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.120]   the intersection of different highways.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:55.800]   So when they talk about living, they talk about walking.
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:00.320]   How you walk, walk in a way that is worthy of the gospel.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.560]   That means live in a way that will bring honor to Christ.
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.680]   Roads and walking,
[00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:13.200]   many, many different passages talking about that.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.880]   Especially in the gospel of John,
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.800]   there were two places that talk about the way.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.800]   The first one, what the first one is here,
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.960]   Jesus said, "I am the way."
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.080]   And then chapter one, in the very beginning
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:30.080]   of this gospel of John, Jesus or his cousin,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:32.080]   John the Baptist, the pioneer,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.120]   also talk about the way, chapter one, 23.
[00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:39.600]   John the Baptist, remember he is the pioneer
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:40.560]   of the Messiah, right?
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:43.200]   He's gonna introduce the Messiah to the world.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   And John the Baptist start baptizing people by the river.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.640]   And John said, in the words of Prophet Isaiah,
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.640]   he said, "I am the voice shouting in the wilderness."
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.760]   To clear the way for the Lord's coming.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:06.240]   So John the Baptist is kind of like
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:08.000]   rolling out the red carpet
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.200]   for this honorable guest to come in.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.480]   And he is Jesus Christ, the Messiah.
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.040]   John the Baptist is trying to clear the way
[00:19:17.040 --> 00:19:20.600]   in the wilderness so that the Lord Jesus can come.
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:25.120]   He's the hero of the gospel, the kingdom.
[00:19:25.120 --> 00:19:26.360]   Finally, the king is coming,
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.240]   he roll out the red carpet and this is him.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:35.200]   Now, he's quoting from the book of Isaiah.
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.280]   And this has happened, the book of Isaiah
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:42.360]   talks so much about the way, the way for the Lord,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:43.960]   the road for the Lord.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.080]   There are many different passages in Isaiah,
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.360]   especially the second half of Isaiah,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.760]   chapter 40 and the following,
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:52.640]   talks so much about the way of the Lord,
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.160]   the way of the Messiah.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   And one of the verses is 51, nine, Isaiah chapter 51,
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.440]   talk about wake up, wake up.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.600]   It's a prayer, a prayer that pray to the true God,
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.920]   the Lord, the God of Israel, clothe yourself with strength.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:13.040]   They're trying to wake up, wake God up.
[00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:16.120]   God, wake up, this is the time for your salvation.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.520]   And rouse yourself in the days of old.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.960]   The old days was the first Exodus,
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.560]   when the people came out of Egypt,
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.920]   God defeated the oppressor and then saved his people.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.840]   And the Israelites became his people.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:37.680]   That's when, that is the days of old.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.120]   The one who dry up the sea, you see that?
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:45.720]   The first Exodus, they crossed the Red Sea on dry ground,
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:50.720]   making a way of escape, a way through the depths of the sea
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:54.360]   so that your people can cross over.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.760]   Again, this is a prayer,
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:58.520]   prayer that God will redeem his people,
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.800]   just like in the days of old.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.760]   In the days of old, the first Exodus,
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.680]   God save his people and bring them
[00:21:05.680 --> 00:21:09.680]   and prepare the way for them, they can cross the sea.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.800]   And now this is a time, God, you need to do it again.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.360]   And John the Baptist is quoting from the book of Isaiah
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.360]   and say, I'm gonna introduce you to the salvation
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:25.520]   that Jesus the Messiah gonna bring to us.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.000]   And it's gonna like the days of old.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.680]   And finally, people will return.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:34.000]   Those who have been ransomed by the Lord will return.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.320]   And they will enter the holy city of Jerusalem
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:39.360]   singing with everlasting joy.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:43.520]   There is a way home.
[00:21:43.520 --> 00:21:47.520]   And Jesus said, amazingly, he said, I am the way.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:51.640]   I'm not pointing you the right way.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.440]   I myself is the way.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.440]   And Jesus said, he is the way, the only way we can go home.
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:07.880]   The teaching in the Bible concerning the future,
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:12.440]   concerning the new heaven and new earth,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:17.120]   is for us so that we know where we're going.
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.600]   Imagine you're on the journey.
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.000]   If you don't know your destination,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.560]   if you don't know where you're going,
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.640]   you're wasting your time, right?
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:32.560]   The more you know about your destination,
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.360]   the more you understand where you're going,
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.640]   will determine how you make choices today.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.080]   That is the biblical teaching of the final things.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.920]   Trying to reveal to us what our final destination is
[00:22:48.920 --> 00:22:52.560]   so that in the detour and the turns in our lives,
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:54.000]   we know we won't get lost.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.400]   I remember some years ago, I was driving a Mini Cooper.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:02.200]   I really like driving Mini Cooper.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.840]   I sold it because of mechanical problems and all that stuff.
[00:23:06.840 --> 00:23:09.800]   So I had a Mini Cooper for about seven years.
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:10.760]   I really enjoyed it.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:13.080]   Have you driven a Mini Cooper before?
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   No? You should try it.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.960]   It's like driving go-kart.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:18.680]   It's like driving go-kart all the time.
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.000]   So I really enjoy it.
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.200]   So I remember one day,
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.600]   well, right after we bought the Mini Cooper,
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   and we have to bring it back to the dealer,
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.600]   to the shop for oil change or something like that.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.920]   And then it took about two days,
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:37.400]   the mechanic says,
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.440]   "It will take about two days for us to fix it
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.120]   "and get it ready for you."
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:43.000]   And then here's the loaner.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:43.840]   The loaner.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.240]   And I got a loaner from the car dealer.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.480]   It's another Mini Cooper.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:51.720]   No, it's brand new Mini Cooper with turbo.
[00:23:51.720 --> 00:23:55.440]   So as I said, I really like driving Mini Cooper.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.920]   It's like you and the car, there's no distance.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.320]   I am the Mini Cooper, right?
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:03.160]   You know, if you haven't,
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:05.840]   if you've never driven a Mini Cooper, you should try it.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.120]   You know, it's really fun.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.520]   So I drove that car, I was really excited.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.000]   I got this loaner, I got this turbo, two-seaters,
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.880]   brand new Mini Cooper, and I drove home.
[00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.560]   And then I talked to my wife and said,
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:21.000]   "Hey, I got a new Mini Cooper for two days.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.720]   "And let's go have some fun."
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.960]   So I drag her to the Mini Cooper and we drove off, right?
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:28.480]   I drove off, right?
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.760]   On the highway.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.200]   So it's kind of like, it's like driving a bullet.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.440]   So much fun.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.800]   And then after three minutes, she asked me,
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.600]   "Where are we going?
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.960]   "Where's the destination?"
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:44.360]   I said, "I don't know."
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.080]   And then I thought to myself,
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.000]   "This is wasting gas."
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.280]   "Wasting money, actually."
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.360]   So then we drove back home.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:25:01.320]   Now, when you don't know where your destination is,
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:03.280]   it's no longer fun, right?
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.200]   Because your destination determines your decisions,
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:10.640]   determines the direction of your journey.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.440]   The Bible reveals to us our final home.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:19.360]   And we are all in Christ and heading that home.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.920]   No matter how comfortable we are here,
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:27.280]   this is not our final resting place.
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.640]   Our final home is in heaven,
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.560]   in the new heaven and new earth.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:38.400]   With that said, it should apply to us
[00:25:38.400 --> 00:25:40.320]   how we're gonna make choices,
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.640]   how we're going to make different arrangement in our lives,
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.560]   how we prioritize all these different choices in our lives.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:51.920]   Going to a final home.
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.160]   I remember one day, many years ago,
[00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.360]   when I was early 30s,
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:01.680]   that's some years ago, not too many.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.760]   (laughs)
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.440]   Remember, well, I told you before,
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:12.440]   in my previous church where I was serving,
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.360]   we had a lot of funerals every year.
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.360]   I remember one year I officiate 40 funerals, one year.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.720]   Almost like every single week, sometimes two times a week.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.800]   I was kind of tired
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.960]   because I have to do funerals all the time.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.920]   And not only people from my church,
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.880]   but there were many different people I needed to help out
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.320]   and to serve, they live in the neighborhood.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:43.240]   They live in the community
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:45.320]   and they want the pastor to help them out.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.520]   So there was one year I just officiated
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.000]   so many different funerals.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.840]   And you're just kind of numb at times.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:57.160]   But I remember one day, this family walked into my office
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.920]   and they said, "Pastor, can you help us
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.920]   "to prepare this funeral and officiate this funeral?"
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.880]   I said, "Of course, of course, at your service."
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.160]   And then usually in the arrangement of funerals,
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:15.440]   I will ask the family to prepare eulogy.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:17.160]   Do you know what eulogy is?
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.720]   It's a life story, right?
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:23.500]   A life story of the deceased.
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:24.920]   So I used to ask the family members,
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.320]   "Can you prepare the eulogy?"
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.160]   And you write it out and then I'll double check it
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.800]   and then we're good to go.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:37.040]   So they did write down the eulogy for the deceased.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.760]   And they hand it to me the next day.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:42.960]   And I kind of check it, spell check and all that.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.200]   And this struck me that I know the life story
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:50.200]   of this person I'm going to officiate a funeral for.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:55.160]   He was born the same year as I was.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.800]   Same birth year.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:00.680]   I was in my early 30s.
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:06.280]   And it really impacted me because it was the moment
[00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:09.120]   for me to ask the ultimate question.
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.240]   What am I doing here, right?
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:14.920]   What am I doing?
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:19.140]   If I die today, where am I going?
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.000]   Am I sure where I'm going?
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:28.160]   Remember the funeral, the deceased was early 30s,
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.280]   same year, and read his life story
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:33.160]   and officiated the funeral.
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.320]   In that funeral, it was so sad
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.680]   because there were only two family members show up.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:45.840]   Only a handful of people in the funeral.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:49.000]   No one mourned for him, no one really cared.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:53.420]   Even his daughter is not there.
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:58.820]   So I still remember that funeral happened
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.320]   in the harsh winter of Chicago.
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:08.260]   So we did the funeral and then we went out to the cemetery
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.400]   to perform the burial service.
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:14.420]   And it was a big snowstorm.
[00:29:14.420 --> 00:29:18.020]   And it was just crazy.
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:21.080]   You know how crazy the harsh winter in Chicago, right?
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:25.740]   It was snowing so much and then the workers, of course,
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.540]   stick the ground six feet below
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:32.820]   and prepared the place for his final burial.
[00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:37.820]   And then the workers had to lower the casket into the vault.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:42.520]   And it was so windy and so much snow.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.500]   And there was so much trouble trying to fit the casket
[00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:50.300]   into the vault, right?
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:52.780]   Even I and the funeral director have to help out.
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:55.540]   So we grab some two by four and try to make sure
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:58.540]   the casket will fit so they can close the lid.
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:01.580]   It was tough.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:04.500]   It was so, so sad.
[00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.820]   And the grief of the family.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:10.880]   I think the most important thing for me
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:14.820]   is that what am I doing here, right?
[00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.020]   Am I using my resources faithfully?
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.300]   Am I being faithful to the call of God?
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:25.820]   What is my vocation?
[00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.060]   What is God calling me to do?
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:31.340]   And with my limited time on earth,
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:34.120]   what am I doing with the resources he has given me,
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:38.820]   the gifts that he has granted to me?
[00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:43.060]   What am I doing with all this stuff, right?
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.180]   And someday I will be home.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.600]   Someday I will see him again.
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:49.780]   I will see Jesus, our Lord again.
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:51.900]   And how can I answer?
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:55.700]   How can I reply to him?
[00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:57.900]   What have you done with your life?
[00:30:57.900 --> 00:31:00.540]   As I told you two weeks ago,
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:05.540]   we officiate a funeral for Leah, my dearest friend.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:11.260]   I've known Leah for years, since she was in college.
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:14.280]   And it was just terrible suffering
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:19.280]   that she has gone through in the past three, four years.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.940]   She was discovered with, diagnosed with
[00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:25.880]   a fairly aggressive form of brain tumor.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:30.580]   And the last three and three plus years,
[00:31:30.580 --> 00:31:32.740]   she has been battling with cancer,
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:34.380]   you know, on and off, on and off.
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:40.200]   And it's just, can't imagine what she has been going through.
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:44.440]   But if you listen to her story,
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:51.560]   she actually prayed that, "God, can you use my suffering?
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:58.900]   "Can you use my suffering to tell your story,
[00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:02.760]   "to testify the goodness of God,
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:05.440]   "even in the midst of trouble?"
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.240]   Now that kind of prayer, I tell you,
[00:32:08.240 --> 00:32:11.560]   honestly, I cannot make that prayer, right?
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:15.080]   From where she get the strength, right?
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.820]   From where she get the strength to pray like that, right?
[00:32:18.820 --> 00:32:23.240]   It has to be a hope beyond death.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.520]   Has to be the reality of the final home.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.660]   She knows where she's going.
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:34.600]   And she has that hope anchor in her life.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.740]   And she could pray like that,
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.360]   even in the midst of most difficult trouble.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:45.040]   How can I use my time to witness to God?
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:49.340]   The future reality.
[00:32:49.340 --> 00:32:55.800]   A couple of weeks ago, it was on Monday, yeah.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.480]   So I got a call that, you know,
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:33:01.440]   Leah in her final moment.
[00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:07.600]   So I got a call and I rushed to her home.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.560]   And she passed away peacefully at home.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:16.360]   And there were different brothers and sisters were there.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:17.480]   We were with the parents,
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.840]   and actually the parents were here today, this morning,
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.720]   worshiping with us.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.200]   Very difficult time for them.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:30.660]   And that Monday morning when she passed away, we were there.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.640]   And her body was there.
[00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:38.200]   And we wait for hours for the funeral workers
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:39.200]   to pick up the body.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:43.280]   So very, very difficult.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:48.700]   But we take comfort, the fact that she's now home.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:52.780]   In her final home.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:54.880]   And that's the home we are all heading to.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:57.720]   And during those few hours we were waiting
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:00.080]   for the workers to pick up the body,
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:02.300]   one of the brothers who has been in contact
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:06.080]   with the funeral home, he was waiting outside.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:08.680]   And he took this picture.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.960]   It's actually the background of the PowerPoint.
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.600]   It's a beautiful picture.
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:20.080]   I'm sure the heavenly home is so much more beautiful
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:20.920]   than this.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:24.480]   That's what Jesus is talking about.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:27.780]   I prepare a home for you.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:31.680]   And that's where your hope is.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:35.740]   What we live according to this hope.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:39.160]   We keep in mind we are heading there.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:41.420]   And we are on our way.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:46.680]   Every moment in this life counts.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:52.100]   We are kept accountable before God.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:56.220]   Use our time, use your resources, use your gifts and talents
[00:34:56.220 --> 00:34:59.560]   to serve God.
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.260]   Because someday we're gonna give an account.
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.660]   Someday we're gonna be home.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:07.380]   Let's all pray.
[00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:09.260]   Let's all pray together.
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:17.780]   Father, we give you thanks because you prepare a home for us.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:23.200]   That our Lord Jesus not only died for us on the cross,
[00:35:23.200 --> 00:35:24.400]   only rose from the dead.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.700]   He triumphed over death.
[00:35:28.700 --> 00:35:31.280]   And he rose from the dead and give us this hope,
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:32.180]   this eternal hope.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:35.400]   And we hear his promises today.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:39.880]   That our Lord Jesus, you have prepared a home for us
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.460]   in heaven.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:43.660]   And we're all heading there.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:47.360]   And Father, may our desires and our direction
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:50.960]   are anchored toward that hope.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:54.560]   And I pray that we'll build our lives
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.740]   according to this final destination we are heading to.
[00:35:58.740 --> 00:36:03.820]   And I pray that you will help us to live in wisdom,
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.740]   to use our resources faithfully,
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:12.180]   so that in our earthly period of time,
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:14.400]   we'll bring you honor.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:17.180]   Use our lives to serve you.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:22.800]   Good time or bad times, may you reign in us.
[00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:24.900]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:28.020]   (gentle music)
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.800]   (upbeat music)
