[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   Okay, it works.
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.360]   That's good.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.980]   Looks like people are doing well.
[00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:24.560]   As always, it is a great privilege, an incredible privilege to be here to see you all this morning.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.540]   So let me first open us in a word of prayer.
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.560]   If you would bow your heads with me, let's pray.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:41.620]   Heavenly Father, our God and our Father, what is man that we can stand before you in this
[00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.420]   moment that you would hear us?
[00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:53.160]   Only by your son, Lord, can we stand before you righteous and justified, seen not as enemies
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.920]   but as friends and as children, as heirs of your kingdom.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.340]   And so, God, I ask in this moment that you would be with us, that you would make your
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:09.020]   presence known to your people here, that you would magnify yourself.
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.380]   Would you guard them against anything I say that might not be of you?
[00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.640]   Would you use what I say and help us see your word as you have spoken it to your people,
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.640]   Lord?
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.640]   This time is yours.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.520]   These people are yours and we pray all this in Jesus' name.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.520]   Amen.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.520]   Okay.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.640]   So, as many of you are aware, just looking at the slide, we have been in the book of
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.280]   James and we will be continuing our reading of the book of James, which is a letter from
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.880]   James to the Jewish Christians of dispersion.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.560]   And what we find in James is that the theme of James is followers of Jesus are to be affected
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:55.800]   by their faith, not just hearers of the word of God, but also doers of the word of God.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.200]   And this is James' call for his brothers and sisters, for them to live wise lives, lives
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.920]   that are reflective of the gospel that they have received.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.520]   Last time, we saw James address the way in which the Jewish Christians were to treat
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.960]   the poor and the needy that come into the midst of their gathering, how they are not
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.120]   to make distinctions among themselves based on outward appearance or seek to curry favor
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.720]   of those who are rich in the eyes of the world.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.680]   Instead, they are to show mercy and compassion, to love their neighbors just as God had loved
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.880]   them in their need.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.400]   Rather than seek favor from man, they are to look to God and God alone for their needs.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.320]   You see, the apostle James doesn't want God's people to live double lives.
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.320]   He wants them to be whole, perfect, and complete, to be rid of the flaws in character that come
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.640]   from keeping parts of themselves separate from the effects of the gospel, and in doing
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.400]   so become more and more like Jesus.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.440]   Yet James' instructions, okay, his instructions are not just given because he wants you to
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.440]   be more Christ-like.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.840]   That is incredibly important, but not just that.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:15.800]   He gives them because it is a matter of life and death.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.920]   Having said that, let's look at today's passage.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.200]   If you have your Bibles with you, I invite you to turn with me to James chapter 2, verses
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   14 to 26.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:34.440]   Again, that is the book of James, its second chapter from verse 14 to the end of verse
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.680]   26.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.800]   It's on the slide here, and I'll just read it for you guys, okay?
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   Here we are.
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.920]   James chapter 2, verses 14 to 26.
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.560]   What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.720]   deeds?
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.320]   Can such a faith save them?
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:57.120]   Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.540]   If one of you says to them, "Go in peace, keep warm and well-fed," but does nothing
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.040]   about their physical needs, what good is it?
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:13.840]   In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.960]   But someone will say, "You have faith, I have deeds.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:22.580]   Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
[00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:25.020]   You believe that there is one God, good.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.580]   Even the demons believe that, and shudder.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.940]   You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.420]   Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.120]   on the altar?
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.720]   You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.140]   by what he did.
[00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:49.120]   And a scripture was fulfilled that said, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.580]   righteousness, and he was called God's friend."
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.880]   You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.040]   In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:08.120]   she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.340]   As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.440]   We start here.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.680]   We start here in verse 14, with this question placed right before you.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.520]   What good is it?
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:31.480]   What good is it for someone to claim faith but exhibit no deeds?
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.960]   The scenario is given here, where there is someone who needs clothes and food.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:42.920]   James asks his audience, he asks them this question, "What good is it to pray and give
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.920]   blessing, right?
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:51.820]   Go in peace, keep warm and well fed without providing food or clothes.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:52.820]   What good is it?"
[00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.700]   And so the implication here is that it is of no good.
[00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.420]   It is not enough.
[00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:02.900]   Before the blessing was pronounced, the person was in need of clothing and food, and after
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.040]   the blessing, that person is still in need of clothing and food.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.240]   The need is unfulfilled.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:15.140]   This is, to James, something that is significantly wrong.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:19.560]   Something is incredibly wrong with the faith of someone who only says, "Go in peace, keep
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.480]   warm and well fed," and does not provide clothes or food.
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:27.120]   You can see for yourself just how wrong James considers it.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.800]   If you look at verse 14 with me, in the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.600]   by action, is dead.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:43.160]   James calls this faith dead, useless and dead.
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:48.000]   No, it is of no good if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.340]   Their faith is dead.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.680]   We see here in verses 14 to 17 a warning.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.920]   Do not confuse faith professed with faith practiced.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:04.200]   In other words, don't mistake just saying, "I have faith," with faith that results in
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.800]   action.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.680]   By itself, faith professed does not save.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.800]   For the person who says, "I have faith," will also be moved by their faith.
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.800]   They will not just be hearers of the Word of God, they will be doers of the Word of
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:19.800]   God.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.480]   And this is something James understands.
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:26.080]   Something that you and I need to understand.
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:29.120]   It is a living faith that saves.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.720]   Okay, let me repeat that for you.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.200]   It is a living faith that saves.
[00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:37.820]   Let's not miss this frightening statement from verse 14.
[00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.820]   You see this one?
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.720]   The one pretending to be a question?
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.520]   What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:47.580]   deeds?
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:49.600]   Can such a faith save them?
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:54.440]   A faith that makes claims but is without deeds, can that faith save?
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.440]   Again, it's implied, right?
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   It's implied.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.180]   No, that faith cannot save.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:02.480]   Faith without action is dead.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:08.040]   And a dead faith cannot and will not save you.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:10.160]   This I'll repeat for you as well.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.840]   Faith without action is dead.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.440]   And a dead faith cannot and will not save you.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:25.240]   17 to 19.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:31.100]   We see here that James quickly moves into an exchange between himself and a person who
[00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:33.200]   is disagreeing with him.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:38.760]   The disagreeing man tells him, "You have your deeds, I have my faith."
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.360]   And what is being said here is, "Will your deeds save you or will my faith save me?"
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.680]   He's challenging him.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.120]   And this is a very real situation, right?
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:55.520]   Because you, you having come to faith, having received your salvation, you didn't receive
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.620]   it because you earned it, right?
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.600]   This is an absolutely true thing.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.360]   And James does not dispute this fact.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:07.040]   You having come to Christ did not receive your salvation because you earned it.
[00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:12.380]   He does not dispute that salvation is in fact a supernatural work of God.
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.840]   But James does dispute something.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:18.080]   Look at his response with me, okay?
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:23.820]   "Show me your faith without deeds and I will show you my faith by my deeds.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:26.500]   You believe that there is one God, good.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.960]   Even the demons believe that and shudder."
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:40.000]   Firstly, faith is not just knowledge of what is and is not true.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.960]   It goes further than that.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.640]   Just knowing something isn't enough to save you.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.480]   Believing that there is one God does not save you.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:56.040]   In fact, look, James makes it clear that demons know even more than you do that the God of
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.760]   the Bible is the God of heaven and earth and this knowledge does not save them.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.880]   In fact, it makes them shudder.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.600]   They tremble in fear because their knowledge does not change their behavior.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.480]   All right.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:14.680]   Secondly, looking at this, there's an error in this argument that's being made against
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.680]   James.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.720]   The error made against James is separating faith and works.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:26.520]   The error is thinking that saving faith can be divorced from merciful works.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:31.420]   Action and works aren't something additional to living faith.
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.540]   Let me ask you a quick question, okay?
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.360]   You guys will ace this.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:40.200]   How many of you right now are breathing?
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.360]   Right?
[00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   All of you.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.880]   Everyone here is breathing.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.920]   And so is your breathing an addition to your living?
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:51.640]   Is breathing something extra that you are doing?
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:52.800]   No, right?
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:53.800]   No.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.720]   Breathing is a function of living.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:59.840]   If you want to continue to live, you need to continue to breathe.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:06.140]   And so when we look at works the way that James looks at works, we see that works are
[00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:10.740]   as breath to those that follow Christ Jesus.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:15.400]   The action following faith proves that it is a living faith.
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.560]   And this is not a new reality about faith.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.360]   This is the way that God has ordained living faith since the very beginning.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:33.960]   If you look with me to verses 20 to 24, you'll see that James begins to talk about someone
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:39.760]   named Abraham, the father Abraham, who is the patriarch of these Jewish Christians,
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.560]   all right, from the line of faith.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:50.600]   And we find that Abraham is considered righteous for what he did because of his interaction,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.040]   because of the interaction between his faith and his actions.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:57.540]   Abraham's faith was alive.
[00:11:57.540 --> 00:12:04.000]   It led him to obey God, to offer his son Isaac on the mountain where God's goodness and grace
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:07.080]   provided a substitute in Isaac's place.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:13.520]   And through this cooperation of his faith and his works, Abraham's faith was made complete.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.840]   It was able to fulfill its purpose.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:23.960]   Living faith is shown by its very nature.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.480]   Living faith is demonstrated through action.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:33.960]   When James writes in verse 24, look at verse 24 with me, he says like, he says something
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:37.360]   here, not by, oh, is 24 on the screen?
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   No, it's not.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.120]   Let me, yes, okay, there we go.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.520]   He says something here.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.800]   You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:54.280]   This faith that he talks about, that he refers to, is a faith that is dead with no ability
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:01.140]   to save because it's a living faith that saves, a living faith that takes action.
[00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:07.320]   Verse 25, just like Abraham, Rahab the prostitute was considered righteous because of her faith
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.640]   and her actions.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:14.280]   These figures that find themselves in the honored line of David stand before God through
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:16.760]   a living faith.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:19.240]   It wasn't a faith without action that saved them.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.480]   It was a faith completed by action.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.860]   And in the same way, faith without action cannot save you.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:32.500]   You can't just say, I believe in Jesus' death and resurrection and then carry on with
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.860]   your life as if nothing has changed.
[00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:39.620]   Action apart from faith cannot save you.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.820]   You know this to be true.
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.780]   You cannot earn your way to heaven.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:49.300]   Your actions that come out of a personal standard of righteousness will always fall short of
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.500]   God's perfection.
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:58.300]   Only a faith accompanied by action, a living faith, can save.
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:02.700]   Having said all that, like this brings us to an incredibly important question that you
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.080]   must answer.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:12.820]   Do you have a living faith, a faith that compels you to not just be hearers of the Word of
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.220]   God but also doers of the Word?
[00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:22.340]   Do you have this faith that can and will save you, a faith that lives?
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:28.600]   Consider this carefully because you are not meant to be dead.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:33.860]   My brothers and sisters in Christ, you are meant to be alive.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:35.660]   Your body is not without a spirit.
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:40.300]   You are meant to be the dwelling place of the spirit of the living God.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:45.180]   While you and I were still enemies of Christ, He looked and He saw you.
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:50.580]   He saw you in your disregard and opposition to Him and still He reached out to you.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:56.340]   While you and I were dead in our sin, the Word of God who was with God and was God,
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:15:02.220]   Jesus Christ, embraced death so that He could pull you out of death and into life.
[00:15:02.220 --> 00:15:07.460]   On a wooden cross, Jesus placed Himself under the punishment you rightfully deserved and
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:11.100]   bought forgiveness for all your wrongdoing.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:17.700]   Every sin you have and will ever commit, in glory, Jesus rose from the grave to give you
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.100]   life in abundance.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.460]   Do you see?
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.640]   Do you see here?
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:28.700]   You aren't supposed to be like you were before.
[00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.940]   You can't be like you were before.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.180]   Only the dead are comfortable in their coffins.
[00:15:36.180 --> 00:15:42.940]   You are meant to be living children of God with a living faith.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:47.900]   And James tells you up front how this is supposed to look.
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.100]   The book of James, right, as we've been going through it, it gives instruction after instruction
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:57.500]   on the way that Christians are supposed to live, the way that Christians should relate
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.300]   to those that are around them.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:04.140]   The verses right before today's passage spoke on how the Jewish Christians were to treat
[00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:08.340]   the poor and the needy that came into the midst of their gathering, how they were not
[00:16:08.340 --> 00:16:14.500]   to make distinctions based on outward appearance or to seek favor from those who are rich in
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.420]   the eyes of the world.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:22.580]   So we see in James that works of mercy are the natural and fullest expression of living
[00:16:22.580 --> 00:16:23.980]   faith.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:28.420]   Acts of love, of goodness, of charity, acts that provide.
[00:16:28.420 --> 00:16:34.400]   This is James's understanding of living faith.
[00:16:34.400 --> 00:16:42.920]   In this crowd, are you a husband, a wife, a father, a mother, a son, or a daughter?
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:49.900]   If that's you, then be merciful, compassionate to your mother, your father, your son, your
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:51.880]   daughter, your neighbors.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.500]   Be compassionate and merciful.
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.180]   I understand that none of this is easy.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:06.300]   It is not easy to be merciful or compassionate because we are not an easily lovable people.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:13.220]   Because our unmet needs, they cause the cracks and the flaws in our character to widen, and
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:17.020]   then out of that comes sin.
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:25.060]   So as we close up our time here, continue to fix your eyes on Jesus and remember what
[00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:30.980]   he has done for you, how he loved you to make you lovable, and how he redeemed you from
[00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:32.260]   the pit.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:39.780]   In that same way, look upon your neighbor, those that God has placed around you, and
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.340]   be both hearers and doers of the word of God.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.860]   Live as a living children of God with a living faith.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:52.020]   Be whole and complete.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.020]   Let me close us in a word of prayer.
