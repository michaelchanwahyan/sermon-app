1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 and I'm so glad to be invited back again.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,160
 Last time I talked about art and beauty

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,760
 and took far too long.

4
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:10,560
 And this time, I know I'm supposed to stay

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,760
 within 25 minutes.

6
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,860
 So I'm gonna do that.

7
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:17,640
 That's why I have notes and now I have a clock

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,160
 and I have all these things to help me stay on time.

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,000
 All right.

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,040
 So it's always a pleasure to be here and a delight.

11
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:31,680
 Today, I'm gonna be talking about the power of storytelling.

12
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,920
 But before we begin, I wanna make sure

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,400
 that we talk just a minute

14
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,400
 about why stories are so compelling.

15
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:45,700
 So what do we get out of stories?

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,920
 What's the purpose?

17
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:49,840
 What purpose do they serve?

18
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,680
 So, one is that it's for enjoyment.

19
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,560
 So it entertains us.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,280
 It lets us escape from our day-to-day stresses.

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,440
 Like this book, "Harry Potter,"

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,080
 which maybe some of you have read or read the sequels,

23
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,600
 watched all the films, went to the theme park,

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,080
 bought an owl and are like crazy fans.

25
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,640
 But pure fun and entertainment.

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,120
 You didn't buy an owl?

27
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,160
 Oh yeah, me too, me too.

28
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,720
 And then like a little wand and everything

29
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,060
 and a lightning tattoo.

30
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,580
 (audience member laughing)

31
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:30,180
 So other times, stories are there to educate us

32
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,940
 so we can learn something new that can improve our lives.

33
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,980
 One book that's been on the New York Times bestseller list

34
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,100
 is this one by Oprah Winfrey.

35
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,540
 So anything by Oprah Winfrey

36
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,980
 usually gets on a bestseller list.

37
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,660
 This book is about trauma and how it lives in our body

38
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:49,860
 and how we can heal from it.

39
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,420
 Another reason we love stories

40
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,020
 is that stories connect us with other people.

41
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,540
 So it helps us engage,

42
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,060
 has like an emotional attachment to it.

43
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:07,620
 Perhaps in reading someone else's story,

44
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,860
 we can see a mirror to ourselves

45
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,100
 and know that we're not alone.

46
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,660
 This book is called "Crying in H Mart,"

47
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,940
 and it's about a daughter

48
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:19,340
 who takes care of her really sick mom

49
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,060
 and is really overwhelmed.

50
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:22,500
 And one day while grocery shopping,

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,140
 can't hold it in anymore.

52
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,540
 So for those of us who have been there,

53
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,700
 we know that when we're so stressed,

54
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,720
 even the most mundane task of grocery shopping

55
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,680
 can feel very daunting or triggering.

56
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,900
 So here we have all these compelling reasons

57
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,220
 to love stories, to read stories, to listen to stories.

58
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:47,440
 But why, Rebecca, are you here talking about stories?

59
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,400
 So you've been asked to come,

60
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,500
 and as a guest speaker,

61
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,560
 I feel like it's really important

62
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,760
 that I talk about things that I know.

63
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,620
 And Pastor Mark talks about things that he knows.

64
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,380
 And I know a lot about stories

65
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,020
 because I'm an author and I self-published my book.

66
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,300
 And through that process,

67
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,180
 I learned a lot about editing,

68
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,540
 what it means to tell a story well.

69
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,620
 And I wear a lot of different hats professionally.

70
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:17,980
 So as an educator, as a workshop facilitator,

71
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:23,160
 if I think about it, story is really the common denominator.

72
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,920
 And everything we do,

73
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,800
 when there's a story attached to it,

74
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,000
 we learn so much better,

75
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,200
 and the lesson is far more meaningful.

76
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,160
 And I've witnessed when people,

77
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,560
 listeners are glued to a storyteller

78
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,000
 because they're just so good.

79
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,360
 And that's just like human-made stories, right?

80
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,340
 Like stories that we write as humans.

81
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,560
 So imagine how much better it could be

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:52,440
 when it's a God-made story.

83
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,900
 And that's what we're gonna talk about today.

84
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:59,400
 So today, the goal is really to see

85
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,080
 the power of storytelling through Jesus, who's the goat.

86
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,440
 So if you don't know what goat means,

87
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,380
 it means greatest of all time.

88
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:11,300
 And if you don't think Jesus is the goat storyteller,

89
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,400
 we're gonna go through it,

90
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,400
 and hopefully by the end,

91
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:17,140
 you're gonna see why he is the greatest of all time.

92
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:20,500
 So today's story is the parable of the lost sheep.

93
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:23,300
 Maybe it's familiar to you, maybe it's not.

94
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,920
 Regardless, I hope that you'll see

95
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,860
 that through this simple story,

96
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:32,200
 that Jesus is really compelling all of us

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,060
 to listen well and to learn.

98
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,740
 So a parable in its definition is a short story

99
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,780
 that teaches us a spiritual truth.

100
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,900
 So parable rhymes with fable.

101
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,380
 It's similar to a fable.

102
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,780
 Maybe you've read it or heard the story

103
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:52,080
 of the tortoise and the hare or the lion and the mouse.

104
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,180
 These teach a moral.

105
00:04:55,180 --> 00:05:00,180
 In a parable, it teaches through a metaphor, usually,

106
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,260
 and it's to apply to our spiritual lives.

107
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:06,940
 So if you can turn to your Bibles if you have them,

108
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,980
 or on your phone, or read along with me,

109
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:15,300
 we're in Luke chapter 15, verses one through seven.

110
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,660
 This is the NIV translation.

111
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,460
 Now the tax collectors and sinners

112
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:22,900
 were all gathering around to hear Jesus,

113
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:26,820
 but the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered,

114
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:28,780
 which means that they're grumbling,

115
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:32,760
 this man welcomes sinners and eats with them.

116
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,980
 Then Jesus told this parable,

117
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,820
 suppose one of you had 100 sheep and loses one of them.

118
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:45,020
 Doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country

119
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:48,060
 and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?

120
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,660
 And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders

121
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,500
 and goes home.

122
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:59,980
 Then he calls his friends and neighbors together

123
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:03,260
 and says, rejoice with me, I found my lost sheep.

124
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,460
 I tell you, in the same way,

125
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:11,140
 there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner

126
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,740
 who repents over 99 righteous persons

127
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,980
 who don't need to repent.

128
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,380
 So in some translations,

129
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,060
 the word parable means picture story,

130
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,780
 sort of like a comic book or a graphic novel in modern time.

131
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,660
 So I'm gonna lead you through a picture story

132
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,940
 of this very parable.

133
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:35,020
 So here we have, right, here's a pasture, grassy field,

134
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:37,980
 here's the setting, and then the owner of the sheep goes,

135
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,660
 hey, go eat some grass.

136
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:40,980
 Sheep go graze.

137
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:44,140
 They go graze, they walk around, they roam around,

138
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,820
 they come upon maybe some trees.

139
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,660
 The owner doesn't count, sort of like on a field trip.

140
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,040
 Oh no, one is missing.

141
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,180
 Where's that one?

142
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:56,540
 Maybe that one is scared, but I also have to leave the 99

143
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,980
 in order to find that one or I can't.

144
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,940
 (laughs)

145
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,400
 Maybe the sheep is calling for the owner.

146
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,720
 The owner finally finds the sheep,

147
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,520
 puts it on his shoulders, is so happy,

148
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,920
 and says, hey everyone, I found my lost sheep.

149
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,760
 Everyone, let's go party.

150
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,160
 So that's my retelling of the story in pictures.

151
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,840
 Now if we think about stories,

152
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,440
 I want us to look at this quote.

153
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,040
 It says, the best stories are the stories

154
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:30,440
 that any and everyone can understand and relate to.

155
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,240
 So it's a quote from a pretty smart person,

156
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,360
 and that person was my editor for my book that I wrote.

157
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,920
 It's called Moving in Forever,

158
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,660
 and it's a picture book about hospice care.

159
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,800
 So it's a heavy topic, and this is what she would tell me

160
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,880
 all the time when we were working on my book,

161
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,400
 because it's a book that's very personal to me

162
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,360
 about my college roommate who died.

163
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,580
 So I wanted to write every single detail down

164
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:02,040
 from my perspective, 'cause I felt that was necessary.

165
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,760
 And of course, my perspective

166
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,140
 and all those details are really valid,

167
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,380
 but if I'm to publish this book to make it meaningful

168
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:12,260
 for other people, other families, other children,

169
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,620
 I have to edit it.

170
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,820
 I have to make it so that any and everyone

171
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,160
 can understand it and relate to it,

172
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,240
 'cause otherwise, the impact will not be there.

173
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,860
 So this is what we're gonna do today.

174
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:30,660
 We're gonna do a Bible study on this parable,

175
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:35,660
 but through the lens and eyes of an editor/publisher/writer.

176
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:39,660
 So we're gonna decide as editors,

177
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,380
 if this story is up to snuff, is it gonna be a hit?

178
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:45,880
 Is it gonna be a New York Times bestseller or not?

179
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:52,320
 And how you do this is you have to look at it

180
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,700
 with some level of scrutiny.

181
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,780
 So when my editor looked at my manuscript,

182
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,560
 she made sure that I was okay

183
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,620
 with whatever she's gonna say to me.

184
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,980
 We have to look at it with some level of inspection,

185
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,300
 just like your writing teachers at school

186
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,620
 might be looking at your essays

187
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:12,260
 and your papers with inspection.

188
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,900
 What do they look for?

189
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,380
 What do editors and publishers look for?

190
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,740
 First, it's like the structure.

191
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,660
 Does it have good bones to a well-written story,

192
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,780
 beginning, middle, and end, and everything in between?

193
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:29,760
 And does it have the components of a well-written story?

194
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,300
 And it's those two parts that give you

195
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:37,280
 a story that's good enough, a good story.

196
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,520
 But we're not here in the Bible to look at good stories.

197
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,420
 We're here to look at great stories.

198
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,740
 We're here to be compelled and convicted.

199
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:50,040
 So these stories need powerful storytelling,

200
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,180
 good and strong storytelling,

201
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:55,560
 so that it's powerful.

202
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,420
 Otherwise, it's just good enough.

203
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,760
 And Jesus was never just good enough.

204
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,860
 So let's look.

205
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,380
 Let's see if this parable of the lost sheep

206
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:09,780
 survives our inspection.

207
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,460
 So does it have a structure?

208
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,860
 Does it have the bones?

209
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:16,460
 Okay, yes, as a beginning,

210
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:19,660
 we are oriented to the setting where we are.

211
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,240
 The sheep are grazing.

212
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,840
 There is an owner or a shepherd.

213
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,960
 And in every great story, there's a problem.

214
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,880
 The problem is, oh no, one goes missing.

215
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,940
 We don't leave the problem hanging.

216
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,780
 We have to do something about it.

217
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,340
 There has to be an action.

218
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,980
 What are the characters gonna do?

219
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:42,200
 In this case, they're gonna leave the 99

220
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,560
 and go find that one.

221
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:47,040
 You keep finding, you keep finding.

222
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,240
 And as listeners and readers, we want a resolution.

223
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,400
 Is there one?

224
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,880
 Yes, finally found the lost sheep.

225
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,200
 Yay!

226
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,080
 And what is the ending about?

227
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,320
 It's what do the characters do

228
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,400
 after the problem's been fixed?

229
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,160
 So now everyone celebrates with the party.

230
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,480
 Okay, the bones are there, check.

231
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,160
 Are the components there in the parable of the lost sheep?

232
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,680
 Is it a good story?

233
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,400
 Well, we have the characters, got that.

234
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,320
 And then we have the setting.

235
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,400
 The main plot really is the lost is found.

236
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:25,040
 Classic, straightforward, and the message is

237
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,720
 the lost matters even if it's only one.

238
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,560
 And the voice that Jesus uses

239
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,580
 within this parable of the sheep is pretty firm.

240
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,500
 And diction is just a fancy word to say

241
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,920
 the choice of words that the writer

242
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,360
 or the author chooses to use, or the storyteller.

243
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,360
 So in this case, Jesus uses suppose one of you.

244
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,680
 Well, doesn't he?

245
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,160
 And joyfully finds a lost sheep.

246
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,320
 So he chooses these specific words

247
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,640
 to tell this specific story to this specific audience.

248
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,040
 So we got the structure, we got the components,

249
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,160
 but do we have good storytelling?

250
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,480
 Or else it's just maybe B plus, right?

251
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,880
 And our Jesus is not a B plus student.

252
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,640
 He's like A plus, plus extra credit,

253
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,760
 plus like principles, that's like

254
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:16,680
 everything valedictorian, right?

255
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,080
 So we have to have, and those of us who are Asian here

256
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,180
 and felt that academic pressure, you would understand.

257
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,700
 Good storytelling, as my editor has told me,

258
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:32,440
 and what she has learned from the entire industry

259
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:37,240
 and profession of copywriters, are these aspects,

260
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:38,480
 these areas.

261
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,200
 So you have to have a trusted teller.

262
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,720
 So whether it's the writer, the author,

263
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,120
 or the person speaking, do people care

264
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,720
 about what this person's saying?

265
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,800
 Is this person worthwhile, right?

266
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,520
 If Oprah Winfrey were to tell you a story,

267
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,920
 I'm sure it'd be packed.

268
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,280
 But I don't know, maybe not.

269
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:58,180
 If it were someone else, I don't know.

270
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,400
 Then is there enough drama?

271
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,980
 'Cause if there's not enough drama,

272
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:06,140
 we're not gonna be captivated, we won't be invested.

273
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,440
 We actually like the up and down of all the emotions.

274
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
 Is it relatable?

275
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,840
 Can I identify with it?

276
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:17,360
 Does it matter to me personally?

277
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,760
 And does it matter to anybody else?

278
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,280
 Is it simple?

279
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,880
 So the most powerful stories

280
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,620
 are the simplest stories, actually.

281
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,800
 And every word and every sentence progresses the narrative.

282
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,120
 So we don't waste time, we don't waste space.

283
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,840
 Agency.

284
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,640
 Agency is, does the reader or the listener

285
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,100
 have the power and freedom to make meaning on their own?

286
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,200
 So when I was trained to be a teacher

287
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:53,560
 for elementary education, in class, in grad school,

288
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,560
 I was told, "He who does the work does the learning."

289
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,920
 So I could teach children all they need to know.

290
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,340
 I can tell them exactly what they need to know.

291
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:07,340
 And they only need to memorize it and regurgitate it.

292
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:09,960
 But that type of meaning, that type of learning

293
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,080
 is not meaningful to them.

294
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,660
 It's much better when they connect the dots,

295
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,760
 when they can make meaning out of it,

296
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,760
 when they can have a personal connection

297
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,400
 to whatever we're learning.

298
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,440
 Okay, so now we're gonna see,

299
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:28,440
 does the parable fit good storytelling aspects

300
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,600
 as we see it in the copywriting world?

301
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,540
 All right, so, trusted teller.

302
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,760
 Well, yeah, it's Jesus.

303
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:40,780
 People are lining up to listen to this man, right?

304
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,160
 God in human form.

305
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,420
 Yes, we trust this teller.

306
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:45,100
 We care what he says.

307
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,940
 Check.

308
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,800
 Drama, lost and found, lots of emotion.

309
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,000
 Fear, joy, worry, celebration.

310
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,300
 That's a lot.

311
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,540
 Is it relatable?

312
00:14:55,540 --> 00:15:00,540
 Now back then, herding sheep is pretty common knowledge,

313
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,140
 but just in case it's not, to these Pharisees,

314
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:08,380
 actually in the rest of the chapter in Luke,

315
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:11,840
 Jesus tells other lost and found stories,

316
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,580
 like the parable of the lost coin.

317
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,460
 Have you ever lost money?

318
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,860
 The parable of the prodigal son.

319
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,020
 Have you ever lost a child?

320
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:24,080
 So there is a lot of relatability here already.

321
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,440
 And is it simple?

322
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,460
 It's, I don't, if you count the lines,

323
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,460
 it's maybe four to five lines of the story,

324
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:32,160
 you can't get simpler than that.

325
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,180
 And every single piece moves the narrative.

326
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,140
 And is there agency?

327
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:41,740
 So here is kind of tricky, because in the Bible,

328
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,700
 we don't know if, what these Pharisees

329
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,880
 or these religious leaders said

330
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,540
 after listening to the story.

331
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,800
 The Bible doesn't say, necessarily.

332
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,740
 They didn't say if they stood up and clapped,

333
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,220
 or they stood up and left.

334
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,500
 It doesn't say.

335
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:02,100
 But that's the beauty of agency, isn't it, for us,

336
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,000
 because we have the ability to make meaning

337
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,520
 out of it for ourselves.

338
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:12,380
 So, looks like, check, check, check, we have it all.

339
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,280
 Now I'm gonna share with you another quote

340
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,120
 from a very wise person.

341
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,720
 "Sometimes we need to zoom out a bit

342
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,560
 "to see the bigger picture.

343
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:28,340
 "Perhaps this is a story within a larger story."

344
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:31,780
 You might be thinking, wow, what a wise thing to say.

345
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,220
 And you're wondering, who said it?

346
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,620
 Well, I said it.

347
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,140
 I say it to my kids all the time,

348
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:41,620
 'cause as you know, I'm a teacher, I'm an artist,

349
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:45,540
 I'm an author, so I'm pretty much like a teacher nerd mom

350
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:48,620
 to my children, and I wanted to show you

351
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:52,560
 how we at home read the Bible and read stories

352
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,860
 and look at it with inspection.

353
00:16:54,860 --> 00:17:00,880
 So on the left here, you'll see a picture of our bookshelf.

354
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,720
 And it has just a collection of Bible stories.

355
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,360
 And these are like one book of one story,

356
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:11,120
 all designed for kids.

357
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,860
 And on the right, you'll see a stack

358
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,720
 of what I call the Bible Bibles.

359
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,540
 So it's not that the other ones aren't real,

360
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,280
 but these are the Bible Bibles we use

361
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,920
 for reference and quiet time.

362
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,600
 And the very top one is mine, and I tell the kids

363
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,160
 that that's what adults read.

364
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,520
 There's no pictures in it, there's lots of footnotes

365
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,880
 and lots of words and really tiny text.

366
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,400
 And then I say that, but then actually I read

367
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,960
 all of the other ones way more frequently

368
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,920
 than I read my own.

369
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,960
 And what we do, let's say for example,

370
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,340
 on the left side, I pull out a Noah's Ark story,

371
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:52,580
 and I have a few copies of them from different authors,

372
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:56,560
 different publishers, to see how the story changes

373
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,200
 based on who's telling it.

374
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,040
 The crux of the story is the same,

375
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,440
 but maybe one is only pictures.

376
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:06,860
 Another one, maybe they take out a little bit,

377
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:10,560
 but we don't know that until we go to the right

378
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:13,760
 and pull out a Bible Bible and look at

379
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,960
 what is the bigger story, what is the bigger picture?

380
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,040
 'Cause these are not standalone stories,

381
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:23,380
 is what I wanted to make sure my kids understood.

382
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:25,840
 Noah's Ark is not a standalone story.

383
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,640
 Easter is not a standalone story.

384
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,320
 They all fit into a larger context,

385
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:35,240
 a larger story inside the Bible itself.

386
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:40,240
 And it's the same for this parable of the lost sheep.

387
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:44,720
 So it's part of a larger story,

388
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:48,400
 but it really depends on how far you zoom out.

389
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,560
 So we have the parable of the lost sheep.

390
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:55,080
 If we zoom out maybe 25%,

391
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:58,220
 there's actually another story that's being told

392
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,360
 of Jesus teaching.

393
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,800
 It's Jesus's teaching story.

394
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,040
 And if we zoom out even more,

395
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,380
 all of Jesus's teaching story are in the New Testament.

396
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:12,680
 We zoom out even more, well, it's really

397
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,400
 the huge story of the Bible from creation

398
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,260
 all the way to redemption and us reuniting with God.

399
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,760
 But how far do we zoom out?

400
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,240
 For today, we're just gonna zoom out like 25%.

401
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,600
 We're just gonna zoom out to Jesus teaching

402
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,440
 just a little bit, right?

403
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,400
 So if we zoom out, we'll see

404
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,200
 that the lost sheep parable here

405
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,200
 doesn't essentially change, but how he tells it changes.

406
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,980
 So these are the components of the parable

407
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,240
 of the lost sheep, right?

408
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,780
 We already talked about this.

409
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,460
 And if you look outside,

410
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:58,700
 like before he starts telling the parable in Luke,

411
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,380
 there's actually more characters to this story.

412
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,940
 There are religious leaders, there are sinners,

413
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:05,340
 there's lots of people here.

414
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:11,120
 And as the setting and other components add on,

415
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:14,020
 you'll see this metaphor built up.

416
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,100
 It's not just about lost and found.

417
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:19,940
 It's about addressing the leader's biases.

418
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:23,860
 It's about saying not just one sheep matters.

419
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,220
 It's saying, hey, we don't need

420
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:31,420
 to have a person look a certain way, be a certain way

421
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,700
 to be able to enter the kingdom of heaven.

422
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:37,340
 All we need is belief and repentance.

423
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:42,340
 Now, even though within the parable of the lost sheep,

424
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:48,060
 Jesus' voice is firm, I wanna say that outside of that,

425
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,700
 that storyline above it,

426
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,700
 he's actually pretty clever and witty.

427
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:58,500
 So the Pharisees and the religious leaders

428
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,740
 are basically grumbling.

429
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,780
 They're like, oh my goodness, look at that Jesus.

430
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,660
 He's like talking to sinners and like eating with them.

431
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,740
 Basically, ew, gross, right?

432
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,680
 Like how horrible, dirty.

433
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:15,020
 Jesus doesn't really like respond to that directly,

434
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,680
 but you can see by the words he chooses.

435
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,020
 He just tells them a story.

436
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,460
 He's like, well, there's just gonna be more rejoicing

437
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:25,100
 for that one sinner who repents

438
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:30,100
 than all 99 righteous people who don't need to repent.

439
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,860
 Link, link, like who are these 99 righteous people?

440
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,380
 And I found that really genius

441
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,060
 because he didn't really have to say anything.

442
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,580
 And it's like, mic drop.

443
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,420
 And it reminds me of my grandma

444
00:21:44,420 --> 00:21:46,700
 'cause she used to do that to me.

445
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:50,440
 So she used to tell me these stories

446
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:54,480
 in order to get me to do or not do something.

447
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,700
 A typical story is, it's all in Chinese,

448
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,800
 but in English it goes,

449
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:04,000
 once there was a child who swallowed a watermelon

450
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,120
 and swallowed all the watermelon seeds.

451
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:09,200
 And two days later, a watermelon grew out of his head,

452
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,540
 period.

453
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,280
 And this is what she would tell me often

454
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:17,780
 whenever I'm eating watermelon or anything that has seeds.

455
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:23,860
 But she would change this story ever so slightly.

456
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,180
 So she'll change it like this.

457
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:28,760
 There once was a little child

458
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,500
 who swallowed so many watermelon seeds

459
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
 that a watermelon grew inside of her.

460
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,060
 So there's no more room in her stomach for other food.

461
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:39,880
 Oh, and by the way, I made noodles.

462
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,520
 This is a response, an indirect response to my question of,

463
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,940
 can I have more watermelon?

464
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:54,180
 So I just find Jesus here, not exactly like my grandma,

465
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,620
 but just so clever in how he answers

466
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,980
 where I'm sitting there as a child thinking,

467
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:03,540
 oh no, I should not have the watermelon anymore

468
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,980
 'cause I want the noodles.

469
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,980
 So I wanna say that Jesus takes these stories

470
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,580
 and kinda changes them,

471
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:17,060
 but maybe not exactly like my grandmother

472
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,420
 who's just getting me to not eat more watermelon.

473
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:23,780
 And these stories are true

474
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:26,180
 'cause I've swallowed some seeds

475
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,600
 and when the watermelon doesn't grow,

476
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
 I realize the story's fake.

477
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:34,980
 But I want you to see how Jesus tells the same parable,

478
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,140
 but in a different way,

479
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,460
 and if you can spot the difference.

480
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:41,860
 So we're gonna go to Matthew chapter 18,

481
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,200
 verses one through six in IV.

482
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,580
 I am going to read them and you can read along with me.

483
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:53,260
 So at the time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked,

484
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:58,540
 who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

485
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,420
 He called a little child to him

486
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,360
 and placed the child among them.

487
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,300
 And he said, truly I tell you,

488
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:08,220
 unless you change and become like little children,

489
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,660
 you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.

490
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:14,400
 Therefore, whoever takes a lowly position of this child

491
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,380
 is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

492
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:21,440
 And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.

493
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,380
 If anyone causes one of these little ones,

494
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,920
 those who believe in me to stumble,

495
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,620
 it will be better for them to have a large millstone

496
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,020
 hung around their neck

497
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,300
 and be drowned in the depths of the sea.

498
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:36,580
 I don't know if Jesus actually said it like that,

499
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:37,880
 but that's how I hear it.

500
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,280
 Skipped a few verses, Matthew 18, 10 to 13.

501
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:48,100
 See that you do not despise one of these little ones,

502
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:51,260
 for I tell you, their angels in heaven

503
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:55,100
 always see the face of my Father in heaven.

504
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,540
 What do you think?

505
00:24:56,540 --> 00:25:00,820
 If a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away,

506
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:03,820
 will he not leave the 99 on the hills

507
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,500
 and go to look for that one that wandered off?

508
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:09,820
 And if he finds it, truly I tell you,

509
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,340
 he's happier about the one sheep

510
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:16,580
 than about the 99 that did not wander off.

511
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:20,260
 In the same way, your Father in heaven

512
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,900
 is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.

513
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,120
 So I'm getting the message here.

514
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,480
 And I've never even tended sheep.

515
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,100
 I don't even enjoy touching them.

516
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,780
 But I'll tell you as a parent,

517
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:39,280
 losing a child is one of the worst possible nightmares.

518
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,900
 And when my family were in seminary,

519
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,900
 we lived in graduate housing,

520
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,380
 I thought I lost my eldest son, Tyson.

521
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:48,660
 He was only not yet even three years old

522
00:25:48,660 --> 00:25:51,860
 and we're out in the back, up on a hill playing.

523
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:55,700
 I turned around, picked up my younger son, Ethan,

524
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,700
 who was barely one at the time.

525
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,100
 And in a split second, Tyson was gone.

526
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:04,780
 I could not see him anywhere.

527
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:07,220
 And this is in Deerfield.

528
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,580
 It's not like there's like crowds and like buildings.

529
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:12,420
 This is like Deerfield, suburban Chicago.

530
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,660
 But he's nowhere to be seen

531
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:16,620
 and it felt like time stood still forever.

532
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,220
 And I could hear my heart beating so fast

533
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,460
 and it was like coming out of my body.

534
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:26,140
 So I had to decide, do I leave Ethan to go find Tyson?

535
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,660
 Which is hard to do 'cause he's barely one.

536
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:31,940
 So I left him with other children

537
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:34,380
 and told the children to watch him like a hawk

538
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,820
 while I look for Tyson.

539
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,720
 And I'm screaming and screaming.

540
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,700
 And I'm so loud that all the other seminary students

541
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,620
 drop their books, come out of their dormitories,

542
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,820
 into the field going, what's going on?

543
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:50,660
 I lost Tyson.

544
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,640
 And then everyone's looking for Tyson.

545
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,940
 We're at the soccer field, the football field,

546
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:57,420
 the playground, inside the slides, in the tunnels,

547
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,420
 in the forest, everywhere, in the crosswalk,

548
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,940
 everywhere, no sign of him.

549
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,140
 I am starting to panic.

550
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,060
 The worst like comes to mind.

551
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,620
 Oh my goodness, he was abducted.

552
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:11,300
 I don't know by what, a coyote?

553
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,260
 I'm not sure.

554
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:16,540
 But in my head, it was like worst possible thing.

555
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,380
 I go around the apartment building and I see him there.

556
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,060
 He's just sitting on the step waiting for me.

557
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,340
 I run to him and I grab him

558
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,180
 and I'm rejoicing inside to tears.

559
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,060
 I pick him up and I just run around everywhere.

560
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,660
 I found him, I found him, I found him.

561
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,780
 And everyone is celebrating with me.

562
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:40,880
 So if you ask me, was I glad and happy

563
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,620
 that Ethan didn't wander off?

564
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,220
 Of course.

565
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:48,460
 But was I happier that I found Tyson?

566
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,740
 Most definitely, right?

567
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:52,580
 So even though I've never heard a sheep,

568
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:55,820
 a tended sheep or even one touch them,

569
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:00,420
 this story I get, I can relate to it.

570
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:01,780
 I identify.

571
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:06,020
 Because you see, the parable of the lost sheep,

572
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,460
 as told in Luke, did not do that to me.

573
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,740
 I didn't think of that.

574
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,260
 Because there was not that whole section

575
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:15,220
 about Jesus talking about how important children are.

576
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,100
 Right?

577
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,920
 It didn't hit me in the same way.

578
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:20,120
 So if we look at this,

579
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:22,920
 the components within the components of Mark,

580
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,920
 you'll see that he actually uses a different voice

581
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:30,560
 because his disciples are basically bickering.

582
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,640
 Who's better?

583
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,680
 And I experience that all the time with my children.

584
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,520
 Who's better?

585
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,340
 I'm better, I'm better.

586
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,180
 No, I'm better.

587
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,000
 No, you're not.

588
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:37,840
 Yes, I am.

589
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,160
 The point is, there's a bigger plot.

590
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,580
 He's settling the rivalry between them with this parable.

591
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:48,500
 And he's saying, all you need to do is be like children.

592
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,060
 But I wanna also highlight,

593
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:55,260
 he's pretty casual when he tells the parable,

594
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,380
 but he's pretty disciplinary

595
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,520
 when he tells them about children.

596
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,700
 And here's like the tone,

597
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,860
 unless you change, you're not gonna get this.

598
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:07,360
 And it's about my father and your father.

599
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,260
 In Luke, Jesus didn't do that.

600
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,100
 Right?

601
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,140
 He didn't say your father, my father.

602
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:15,360
 He used heavens.

603
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,460
 There was no personal relationship there.

604
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,140
 And also in Luke, he says,

605
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:24,300
 suppose one of you owned a hundred sheep.

606
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,220
 In this one, he said, suppose a man.

607
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,200
 Well, why?

608
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,460
 Why are there these differences?

609
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,500
 Because it's a different audience.

610
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:35,260
 The disciples are not wealthy people.

611
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,940
 They would never own a hundred sheep, right?

612
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,420
 But why does that matter?

613
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:42,860
 It matters a lot because within that context,

614
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,660
 it tells a storyteller how to modify the story

615
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:49,920
 to make it impactful for whoever's listening.

616
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,760
 Right?

617
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,620
 And then later he was also saying,

618
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:59,420
 you just have to be, you just have to be like children.

619
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,320
 So in that context,

620
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,320
 I don't think that Jesus is particularly condemning,

621
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,400
 but really teaching.

622
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,740
 So if we take a look at those two zoomed out storylines,

623
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:19,680
 side by side, let's compare them.

624
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:23,360
 And I wanna focus a lot on the audience.

625
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,360
 So we've talked about a bunch of these already before,

626
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,200
 but I wanna focus on the audience.

627
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,160
 In Luke, there's these Pharisees

628
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,880
 and these religious leaders, right?

629
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:39,520
 And as much as he's being clever and witty,

630
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,540
 kind of tongue in cheek,

631
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,520
 he's basically trying to show them

632
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,920
 that the gates of heaven are welcome

633
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,240
 to people they don't expect.

634
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,920
 And the leaders wanna gatekeep it,

635
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:53,280
 but Jesus is saying, no, as long as there's repentance,

636
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,080
 there's acceptance.

637
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:57,240
 And for some of us here,

638
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,840
 maybe we're grumbling about someone or something.

639
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,840
 I know I sure am a lot of times

640
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:08,160
 when I think those people can't have access

641
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,560
 to the kingdom of heaven.

642
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,580
 Those people, the conniving people,

643
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,980
 the self-righteous people, the rude people,

644
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,460
 the exclusive people.

645
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,620
 And then I'm thinking, oh, wait a minute.

646
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:25,260
 Am I being exclusive here?

647
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,820
 So there's a compelling moment

648
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:28,380
 and you're convicted, right?

649
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:33,220
 Now in Mark, even though Jesus is directly talking

650
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,220
 to the disciples and teaching them, disciplining them,

651
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:42,360
 he told them to be like children,

652
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,880
 even though they were acting like kids, ironically.

653
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,680
 But I don't think he was condemning his disciples either,

654
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:50,640
 but really helping them to solve their problem

655
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,480
 and their debate.

656
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,640
 And it's subtle, but actually not so subtle.

657
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,180
 If they're just like children,

658
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:58,320
 their father's not gonna let any of them perish.

659
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,820
 They're just chill out.

660
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:02,320
 And for some of us,

661
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,240
 maybe we think someone else is not deserving

662
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,540
 or we're competing with those around us.

663
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,440
 Because after all, that's what society tells us to do.

664
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,040
 But I wanna mark that actually,

665
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:20,040
 that in Mark, Jesus is also talking to children

666
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:22,680
 'cause he invites a child in their midst.

667
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,680
 So the children might not be the active, direct listeners,

668
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,160
 but they're listening.

669
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,840
 As you know, if you ever have kids,

670
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:32,960
 you can say one thing and they hear it

671
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:33,880
 and they'll repeat it.

672
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,480
 But you'll say 10,000 other things

673
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:37,500
 that you want them to say and they won't.

674
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,780
 Unless that's just my kids.

675
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:44,140
 And I wonder when these children are listening

676
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,220
 to what Jesus is saying to the disciples,

677
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:48,860
 if they feel comforted.

678
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,660
 Because as children, they have no power.

679
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:52,060
 They have no choice.

680
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,140
 But what Jesus is saying is,

681
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:57,860
 they're so important that all of you need to be like them.

682
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:02,340
 And maybe some of us,

683
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:05,380
 we don't relate to judging Pharisees.

684
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:09,880
 We don't relate to maybe disciples who are quarreling.

685
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,840
 Do we relate to children?

686
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,560
 Do we feel helpless?

687
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,120
 Do we feel confused?

688
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,280
 Do we feel lost?

689
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:19,480
 Do we feel inexperienced?

690
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:22,560
 But yet, our God tells us

691
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,020
 that children are the most beautiful thing.

692
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:31,380
 And what we see here is that bottom row, agency.

693
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:35,640
 We get to have that agency to look at these stories

694
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,960
 in a zoomed out way.

695
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:41,580
 So if we're to be like Jesus here on earth,

696
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,860
 healing the sick, finding the lost,

697
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:48,740
 how does this story look to us today?

698
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,500
 So who is the audience today reading this story

699
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,860
 and the story outside the story?

700
00:33:55,860 --> 00:34:00,400
 The audience, meaning you and I here right now.

701
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:05,840
 So ask yourselves, what context are you currently in?

702
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,640
 Are you in a place of a lot of turmoil, decision, chaos?

703
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:14,860
 Are you in a state of jealousy or unforgiveness?

704
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,640
 How does that affect how you hear the story?

705
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:22,640
 We're not just one of these sets of audiences forever.

706
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,400
 We can be all of them at different times in our lives.

707
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,280
 So maybe there is a lost sheep in your life.

708
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:35,280
 Maybe there's a need to reconcile that.

709
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:39,580
 Or maybe you think you deserve more than that person.

710
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,680
 Or could that lost sheep be actually you?

711
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:46,720
 Are you feeling lonely and scared or helpless?

712
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,520
 But remind yourself of what the parable says,

713
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,640
 regardless of audience and context,

714
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,160
 that each one matters.

715
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:01,160
 Every single one, you, me, every single one of us matter.

716
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:05,080
 So in summary, the goal was to help you know

717
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:09,000
 the power of storytelling, which I hope I made that point,

718
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,760
 and that you realize that Jesus is the goat.

719
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,760
 If not anything else, Jesus is the goat.

720
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,600
 But I also want you to know that this is one story.

721
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:22,320
 This is the lost sheep, one story,

722
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,320
 that is inside like a zoomed out story, right?

723
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,520
 That is inside an even bigger story.

724
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:34,640
 So I am really excited and looking forward

725
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,840
 to continuing diving into these stories with you

726
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,880
 as we move along.

727
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,040
 Next week, I'll be here.

728
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,600
 We'll talk about another story.

729
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:48,320
 And so far, that's the end for me today.

730
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,720
 But if you have any stories you wanna share with me,

731
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,200
 you wanna hear more of my stories,

732
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,360
 feel free to find me and contact me.

733
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,160
 But that's all I have for you today.

734
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:07,160
