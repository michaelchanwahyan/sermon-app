00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,360
 Hello everyone! I'm Miss Rebecca.

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,440
 Welcome back to Family Sunday School.

4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:15,760
 This week is the fifth episode.

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,680
 Do you remember what we talked about in the fourth episode?

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,080
 Yes, we get to know a lot of different animals

7
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,880
 and make a lot of different sounds.

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,880
 But what's the most important thing?

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,880
 The dog!

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,880
 What is Peter doing?

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,880
 Yes, he is rejecting Jesus.

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,880
 Did you notice that I'm wearing different glasses?

13
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,880
 Do you remember?

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:48,880
 In the last episode, I asked my parents to read other Bible verses.

15
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,880
 I asked them to see if they could relate to the story I told.

16
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:58,880
 Why do we need to see so many different verses?

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:02,880
 So that we can see them from different angles.

18
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,880
 For example, I'm wearing these glasses.

19
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,880
 I'm a little blurred when I'm looking at things.

20
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:07,880
 Why?

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,880
 Because of the eyebrows, the nose, and the nose.

22
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,880
 But if I wear glasses or wear clothes,

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,880
 will it be more clear?

24
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,880
 I'm wearing these glasses, but they are a little dirty.

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
 I can't see very clearly.

26
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,880
 I change my clothes, but I can see different things.

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,880
 This pair of glasses is so clear.

28
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,880
 When we turn our glasses, we can see different things.

29
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,880
 Sometimes it's a little blurry, sometimes it's clearer.

30
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,880
 Or something is magnified.

31
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:49,880
 Because there are many different glasses for different purposes.

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,880
 For example, when parents or elders are reading,

33
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
 they are a little blurry.

34
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,880
 They can't read when they are close to reading.

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,880
 But with glasses, they can read.

36
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,880
 So, we magnify.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,880
 Right?

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,880
 So, today, let's see if you really read other Bible verses.

39
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:15,880
 Did you find anything?

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:19,880
 Any new discoveries?

41
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,880
 Tell me.

42
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,880
 No?

43
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,880
 No?

44
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,880
 No?

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
 No?

46
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,880
 It's okay.

47
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,880
 I read it too.

48
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,880
 But, Miss Rebecca has a lot of different Bible verses.

49
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,880
 Right?

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,880
 When Miss Rebecca didn't talk about it in the last episode,

51
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,880
 she didn't mention one thing.

52
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,880
 She didn't mention the cock-a-doodle-doo.

53
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,880
 Peter looked at Jesus.

54
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,880
 Jesus looked at Peter.

55
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,880
 Oh, he really did it.

56
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,880
 Miss Rebecca didn't mention it.

57
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,880
 How?

58
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,880
 In that book?

59
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,880
 This book also mentions it.

60
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,880
 This book also mentions it.

61
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,880
 What does it say?

62
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,880
 Peter cried and ran away.

63
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:15,880
 He wept and fled the courtyard.

64
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,880
 He cried and ran away.

65
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:21,880
 So, when he left the courtyard,

66
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:27,880
 he didn't know what happened.

67
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,880
 So, this is one thing.

68
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,880
 He left.

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,880
 Right?

70
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,880
 Who did it?

71
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,880
 John!

72
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:35,880
 Right.

73
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,880
 There's one more thing.

74
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
 Miss Rebecca found it in other Bible verses.

75
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,880
 Do you remember?

76
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,880
 There were three times when people asked Peter,

77
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,880
 "Do you know Jesus?"

78
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,880
 "No, I don't know him."

79
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,880
 "I don't know what you're talking about."

80
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
 Right?

81
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
 There were two ladies.

82
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:53,880
 One lady asked,

83
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,880
 "You seem to be with him."

84
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:56,880
 "No, not me."

85
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,880
 "No, you really seem to be with him."

86
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,880
 The second lady said,

87
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,880
 "No, I don't know what you're talking about."

88
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
 Then, a little further away,

89
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,880
 there was a man.

90
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,880
 He said, "No, I heard your accent."

91
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,880
 "Accent" means "accent."

92
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,880
 Sometimes, when we come from different places,

93
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,880
 we have different accents.

94
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,880
 Even though we're speaking English,

95
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,880
 when we use English with different accents,

96
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
 we'll know where we're from.

97
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,880
 Right?

98
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,880
 So, he heard her say,

99
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,880
 "No, you're from Galilee."

100
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,880
 Because in Galilee,

101
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,880
 the way they speak and their accents are a little different.

102
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,880
 They can hear.

103
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:39,880
 Right?

104
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,880
 Ms. Birkin didn't mention that.

105
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,880
 So, there are many hints

106
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:46,880
 to let them know that

107
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
 Peter is with Jesus,

108
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,880
 but Peter is a pharaoh.

109
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,880
 What will we talk about in this episode?

110
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,880
 Jesus went in.

111
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,880
 He went into his house

112
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,880
 with the elders.

113
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,880
 These elders are the highest leaders of the Jews.

114
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,880
 Do you know that?

115
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,880
 When they went in,

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
 they had to judge him.

117
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:15,880
 Judge him.

118
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:16,880
 Trial him.

119
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,880
 See what crimes he committed.

120
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,880
 Those who arrested him

121
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,880
 thought he committed all kinds of crimes.

122
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,880
 But is it true?

123
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,880
 Today, we'll see

124
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:34,880
 what happens when Jesus is judged.

125
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,880
 But before we start,

126
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:38,880
 what do we do?

127
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,880
 Of course, we play a game.

128
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,880
 Okay.

129
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,880
 Let's play a game.

130
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,880
 Get ready.

131
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,880
 I have a musical instrument.

132
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,880
 I will play this musical instrument.

133
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
 This is called a xylophone.

134
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:59,880
 In Chinese, it's called a wood instrument.

135
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,880
 In the past, it was made of wood.

136
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
 It made different sounds.

137
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:06,880
 This one is made of iron.

138
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,880
 When I play,

139
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:10,880
 you have to throw the ball.

140
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,880
 You can find a ball or a toy.

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,880
 You can find a leaf.

142
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,880
 I play and you throw.

143
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
 You don't have to follow the order.

144
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,880
 Throw to the person you want to throw.

145
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,880
 Throw again.

146
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,880
 The object is to not hit the ball.

147
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,880
 I play the wood instrument.

148
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
 After the music,

149
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,880
 whoever holds the ball is out.

150
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,880
 Okay?

151
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,880
 We'll do four rounds.

152
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,880
 I'll do four rounds.

153
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,880
 I don't know how many people are there.

154
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,880
 Let's start.

155
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,880
 Here we go.

156
00:06:44,880 --> 00:07:08,880
 [xylophone playing]

157
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:09,880
 Done!

158
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,880
 Whoever holds the hot potato

159
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,880
 is out of the round.

160
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,880
 Okay, next round.

161
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,880
 Ready?

162
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,880
 You can switch places.

163
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,880
 You can take it away.

164
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:22,880
 You can do whatever you want.

165
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,880
 Okay, second round.

166
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,880
 Here we go.

167

168
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,880
 Done!

169
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
 Okay.

170
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,880
 Who got it?

171
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,880
 What do you do if you get the hot potato?

172
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,880
 Yes, you're out.

173
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,880
 Sorry.

174
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,880
 You can continue next time.

175
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,880
 Okay?

176
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,880
 It's not a game.

177
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,880
 Sometimes we win, sometimes we lose.

178

179
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:05,880
 Okay.

181

185
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,880
 Okay.
