[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   - Alright guys, let's turn to our scripture today.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.560]   And may I invite you to go to your phone app
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.980]   or to your Bible.
[00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.940]   We're going to continue our series on basics, okay?
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.880]   Let's master the basics.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.980]   There are so many basic exercise or habits
[00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.780]   as a question we need to master.
[00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.940]   So I introduced to you many weeks ago
[00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:28.780]   the verse of the week.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.240]   And this is the verse of last week.
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.900]   Remember that?
[00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.440]   Alright, can we recite it together?
[00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.280]   Let's do it in English.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.040]   Don't worry about anything, instead pray about everything.
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.100]   Tell God what you need and thank Him for what He has done.
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.420]   Then you will experience God's peace,
[00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.360]   which exceeds anything we can understand.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.760]   His peace will guide your hearts and minds
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.240]   as we live in Christ Jesus, alright?
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.240]   So we got the Chinese translation for many of you.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.540]   This is the verse of last week.
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.360]   And today we're going to introduce another verse.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.360]   However, we're going to go through the passage of today.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.440]   My sermon is taken, centered on this passage,
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.600]   this famous passage from the book of Romans.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.140]   Romans chapter 12, verse one.
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.600]   "Therefore I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy,
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.400]   "to offer your bodies as living sacrifices,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.720]   "holy and pleasing to God."
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.360]   This is your spiritual act of worship.
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.160]   "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world,
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.840]   "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.920]   "and you will be able to test and approve
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.560]   "what God's will is, His good and pleasing perfect will."
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.840]   And that is the first two verses,
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:52.140]   and we continue, verse three.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.020]   "For by the grace given me, I say to every one of you,
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.120]   "do not think of yourself more highly than you ought,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.180]   "but rather think of yourself with sober judgment,
[00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.460]   "in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you,
[00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.460]   "just as each of you has one body with many members,
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:15.380]   "and these members do not all have the same function."
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.900]   So in Christ, we who are many form one body,
[00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.300]   and each member belongs to all the others.
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.220]   "We all have different gifts,
[00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.700]   "according to the grace given us.
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.140]   "If a man's gift is prophesying,
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.020]   "let him use it in proportion to his faith.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.100]   "If it is serving, let him serve.
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.100]   "If it is teaching, let him teach.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.940]   "If it is encouraging, let him encourage.
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.720]   "If it is contributing to the needs of others,
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.100]   "let him give generously.
[00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.600]   "If it is leadership, let him govern diligently.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.480]   "If it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully."
[00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.780]   Now that is from the book of Romans, chapter 12.
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.540]   And that is, as I said,
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.940]   is one of the well-known passages in the Bible,
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.860]   especially in the New Testament.
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.100]   And there is some background we need to understand
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.780]   as we read this passage.
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.340]   Now, all of the Bible passages were written
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.340]   to a specific context or specific need of a congregation.
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.700]   This is not new to us,
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.260]   but as long as we get more familiar
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.180]   with the background of the Bible,
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.660]   then we understand what God is saying, right?
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.460]   Then we understand what this passage is all about.
[00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:35.740]   So some of the background.
[00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.300]   This letter is written by Paul, the apostle Paul,
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:42.780]   the pastor Paul, a missionary,
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.620]   founding churches in many cities in the Roman Empire.
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.540]   And this letter is written by him, by Paul,
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.240]   to the Romans, so-called the Romans,
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.100]   because those are the Christians
[00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.500]   and house churches in the city of Rome.
[00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.500]   And as you know, Rome was the center of Roman Empire,
[00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.860]   of the center of the world in Paul's day.
[00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.860]   And the relationship between Paul and the Roman Christians,
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.580]   the Christians, the house churches in Rome
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.580]   are somewhat interesting because Paul did not establish,
[00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.900]   did not plant the church in Rome.
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.460]   In fact, he had never been to Rome
[00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.420]   until the end of the Book of Acts.
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.340]   And when he wrote this letter to the Roman Christians,
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.420]   he had never been there.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.620]   He said he wanted to visit Rome someday on his way to Spain.
[00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.100]   Well, we don't know whether Paul
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:39.880]   has traveled to Spain or not.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:42.960]   However, he wrote this letter,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.200]   and at that time, he did not come to Rome,
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.440]   and he never planted the church in Rome.
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.360]   But there are Christians,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.580]   there are house churches in Rome nonetheless.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.980]   And we don't know who brought the gospel
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.220]   to the people in Rome,
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.780]   and why there were some house churches
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:05.820]   being established in Rome.
[00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.560]   So who brought the gospel to Rome in the first place?
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.960]   Remember chapter two of Book of Acts,
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.120]   very familiar chapter, Pentecost, right?
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:21.120]   When the Holy Spirit descended on the apostles,
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.440]   and they began to preach the gospel,
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.480]   and Peter begins to preach to the people,
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.000]   and 3,000 people came to faith, right?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.760]   And they were baptized by water,
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.320]   and they became Christians.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:38.440]   And on the day of Pentecost,
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:43.360]   there were many Jews in Jerusalem.
[00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.640]   And the Book of Acts tells us
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.360]   there were many Jews come from other places
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.120]   of the Roman Empire.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.840]   Some come from today's Turkey,
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.000]   some come from today's Egypt,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.040]   some come from even Rome,
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:00.600]   because in Acts 2.10, it tells us
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.000]   there were some Jewish people coming from the city of Rome,
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.720]   from the capital city of Rome.
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:10.000]   And they were visiting Jerusalem for the festival,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.360]   for Pentecost, and for Passover before Pentecost.
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.580]   And they just happened to be there.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.020]   And the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles,
[00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.120]   and they began to preach the gospel,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.880]   and many of them became Christians.
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.540]   And I think surely they also came to faith,
[00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:33.240]   and they brought the gospel back to their home city in Rome.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   So I think they found the house churches in Rome.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.040]   And in the very beginning period of the church in Rome,
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:52.340]   we can imagine the Jewish people
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:57.340]   and their Gentile Christians gathered together, right?
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.480]   So that was the picture,
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.720]   the reality of house churches in Rome.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.520]   Again, it's by some sort of lay Christians,
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:07.360]   white Jewish Christians,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.400]   they brought the gospel back to Rome,
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.860]   and they probably attract other people,
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.480]   and some of the Gentile Christians.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.200]   And they gather together in different houses in Rome,
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.200]   and that's how house churches in Rome began.
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.400]   But, but, but in AD 49, AD 49, okay?
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.760]   So in your mind, imagine there's a timeline, okay?
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.880]   There's timeline.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:40.880]   You put cross there, it's about AD 30, AD 30, all right?
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:44.640]   And Jesus died and rose again,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:46.680]   and he ascended to heaven, right?
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:49.480]   And the Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:54.480]   Now, that was around AD 30.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:58.080]   But in AD 49, everything changed,
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.320]   especially in the city of Rome.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.160]   Why?
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.160]   Because at that time, Roman emperor named Claudius,
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.680]   and he issued a decree to ban all the Jews
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.320]   from the city of Rome.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.040]   So, so Claudius, the emperor,
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.660]   kicked out all the Jewish people from the city of Rome.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.160]   And as you can imagine,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.000]   some of them are being kicked out of Rome
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.960]   were definitely Jewish Christians,
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.600]   and they originally belonged to the house churches in Rome,
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   right?
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:34.080]   And actually we find that in the book of Acts, chapter 18.
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:38.680]   Here, the map clearly shows where Rome is, right?
[00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:43.680]   And Paul is writing the letter to the Romans from Corinth,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.880]   right?
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.480]   And there were house churches
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.700]   mixed with Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome,
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.020]   but AD 49,
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:09:00.900]   Claudius commanded all the Jews to leave Rome.
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.960]   And we find that in Acts 18.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:05.760]   Acts 18, what happened here
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.960]   was that Paul was doing mission in different cities,
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.540]   and he came to Corinth,
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:15.020]   and he found a Jew there named Aquila,
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.260]   and he was a native of Pontus.
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.260]   Pontus was today's Northern Turkey.
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.700]   And this guy is called Aquila,
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.040]   and he was a Jew,
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:31.600]   and Paul met him because he come from Italy
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.700]   with his wife Priscilla.
[00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.720]   So this couple was being kicked out of Rome,
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.240]   and they were in Corinth,
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.200]   and they met Paul,
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:43.640]   and Paul preached to them.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.560]   And Acts 18 explains,
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.040]   because Claudius, the emperor,
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:55.040]   had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome, okay?
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.860]   So that's pretty interesting, AD 49, right?
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:00.780]   Remember, the house churches in Rome
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:04.540]   were mixed with Jewish and Gentile Christians, right?
[00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:06.400]   They were all calling the name of Jesus,
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.420]   and they worshiped together.
[00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:13.160]   But AD 49, after Claudius kicked out all the Jews
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:15.100]   out of Rome,
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.300]   overnight, the church in Rome
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.820]   became virtually 100% Gentile.
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:24.660]   Right, it's not hard to imagine, right?
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:25.720]   Kick out some of the Jews,
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.020]   and then what you left in the house churches in Rome
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.960]   were Gentiles.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.140]   And the Gentile Christians, naturally,
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.320]   would take over the leadership of the church.
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.200]   And so they were minority,
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.660]   and now the Jews are being kicked out.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.300]   The Jewish Christians left the city.
[00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.220]   They became the majority.
[00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:52.900]   And by the time Paul writes from Corinth,
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:56.020]   writing the letter of Rome,
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:59.980]   it was about AD 57, eight years later,
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.500]   and some of the Jews were allowed
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:05.540]   to go back to their home city, Rome.
[00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:11.220]   But when the Jewish people came back to the church,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.660]   and they find that the church was dominant by Gentiles,
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.500]   right, now before AD 49,
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:21.060]   the Jewish Christians were the majority.
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:25.340]   After AD 49, they became the minority.
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:27.300]   And you can imagine the tension,
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:30.100]   the social tension, or the leadership tension
[00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.880]   created by such a situation.
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.020]   And by and large,
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:39.160]   Paul is writing the letter to Romans
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.420]   to address some of the problems or tensions
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:43.180]   that happened in the church.
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.060]   You got that?
[00:11:44.060 --> 00:11:46.100]   All right, it's very easy, right?
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:47.900]   Now, you wanna do a pop quiz?
[00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:52.820]   All right, so remember, AD 49 is the watershed
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.100]   for the house churches in Rome.
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.820]   And all of a sudden, the Gentiles became
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.380]   the dominant people, and they take over the leadership,
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:04.220]   and they despise the Jews who came back.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.220]   And Paul is writing this letter
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.380]   to address some of the issues
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:13.140]   or some of the tensions and debates inside the church.
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.660]   There are two points we can find in this passage.
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:20.980]   So the letter to the Romans
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.100]   is the longest letter in the New Testament,
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.420]   the longest letter.
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:30.700]   And Paul used the first 11 chapters to explain,
[00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:35.700]   to emphasize that Jesus came to save Jews and Gentiles alike.
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:38.780]   At the foot of the cross, the ground is level,
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:42.180]   and all have sinned, Paul said, chapter three.
[00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.500]   Everyone falls short of the glory of God.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.740]   But in chapter 10, Paul proclaims,
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:52.020]   everyone who calls on the name of Jesus will be saved,
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.260]   whether you're a Jew or you're a Gentile,
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.460]   because the ground at the foot of the cross is level,
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.940]   and that is the mercy of God, right?
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.780]   We never deserve the grace of God, right?
[00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:08.700]   Only because what Jesus has done for us,
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.260]   and that is the mercy of God.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:13.780]   And in Christ, Paul reminds us,
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:17.020]   we are one new people now, right?
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:23.140]   Now, you may center your identity on your ethnicity.
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:27.920]   I am a Jew, I am a Gentile, right?
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:31.340]   I am from a certain ethnic group.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.820]   But Paul is saying, when you come to the cross,
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.180]   when you receive the mercy of God,
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:40.580]   undeserved, and in Christ, we are now one people,
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:44.900]   and we have the new identity in Jesus Christ.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:46.700]   And that is the most important identity.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:49.660]   And that's why the church is the new people of God.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.580]   And we come to chapter 12 of the book of Romans.
[00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:57.780]   Paul is saying, I urge you, brothers,
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:00.800]   in view of God's mercy, right?
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:05.780]   Now, you have heard me explain for 11 chapters
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:09.700]   of the mercy of God on Jews and Gentiles alike.
[00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.820]   And Paul is saying, chapter 12 verse one.
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:16.540]   Therefore, I urge you, brothers, right?
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.260]   Or brothers and sisters, siblings.
[00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:24.100]   You know, this is one of Paul's most favorite term
[00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:25.860]   to describe Christian relationship.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.100]   He could have used the temple,
[00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:31.260]   he could have used the people,
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:34.340]   but the most favorite term Paul uses
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:38.100]   to describe our relationship as Christians
[00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:42.540]   is siblings, brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.260]   And so often, we see each other
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:47.080]   based on our common background, right?
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:52.080]   Common language, race, or interest.
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.380]   And sometimes we fail to see each other in the church
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:00.420]   on the sole basis of God's mercy and grace, right?
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:02.980]   We come here, we call each other
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:04.780]   sisters and brothers in Christ
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.620]   because God has done something in your life, in my life.
[00:15:08.620 --> 00:15:11.020]   God has created something new.
[00:15:11.020 --> 00:15:13.100]   And look around, right?
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.460]   This is something new, this is something unheard of,
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.220]   or you have never thought about,
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.020]   that God is putting you and me together
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.540]   in this new society, right?
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:25.540]   New people.
[00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:27.420]   He created a new society of siblings,
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.140]   our people from all walks of life, right?
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:35.140]   We're so different, we're so distinct, right?
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:38.140]   But God is calling everyone in Christ,
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:39.700]   Jews and Gentiles, right?
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:44.260]   All kinds of people, East and West, right?
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:47.020]   Coming together to be a people, right?
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.260]   I have been to different churches.
[00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.620]   I've always been amazed by, you know,
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:59.460]   how the people are so different,
[00:15:59.460 --> 00:16:01.820]   but God put us together, right?
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.860]   I'm so thankful I'm not the only guy there,
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.820]   and no one looks like me, right?
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:09.500]   Everyone looks different, right?
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.620]   Everyone comes from a different walks of life,
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:13.580]   so that is the mercy of God.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:15.780]   And Paul continues to tell us,
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.620]   because of the mercy of God that we receive
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.100]   as brother and sister, we need to offer your bodies
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:25.060]   as living sacrifices to God.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:27.540]   And Paul, I think he has in mind
[00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.500]   a different and new sacrifice, right?
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:33.300]   A living sacrifice, right?
[00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:35.380]   All the sacrifices are dead, right?
[00:16:35.380 --> 00:16:36.860]   Dead animals.
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.300]   And Paul is saying, as we come together,
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.180]   as we receive the mercy of God,
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.460]   it is not offering animals anymore.
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.180]   We offer ourselves, right?
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.940]   And we offer ourselves as living beings,
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.940]   living bodies, how we live and how we think,
[00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:59.940]   how we speak, how we act, how we relate to each other.
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:02.460]   It's like a sacrifice to God, right?
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:04.860]   How we build our family, how we guide our children,
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:07.940]   how we serve, how we participate in fellowship and worship
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:09.820]   is also a sacrifice.
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.060]   It's like a worship to God, right?
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:15.220]   And here the English says spiritual act of worship.
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.860]   I think a better translation is a reasonable,
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.020]   reasonable act of worship.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:24.420]   Or even a better translation is gospel field.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:27.940]   Gospel shaped act of worship.
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.900]   We come here and it's not because it's convenient to come.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.300]   We come here because of Jesus Christ, right?
[00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:37.500]   And he continues to say, do not conform any longer
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:39.780]   to the pattern of this world.
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:43.340]   The way of life in this world
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.940]   means the way of life in the Roman empire, right?
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.900]   The Roman way is I dominate you, right?
[00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:53.580]   I have power, you have no power.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:57.140]   So the powerful is ruling the powerless.
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:18:01.340]   The strong is ruling against the weak, right?
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:04.100]   And I think this phrase, do not conform any longer
[00:18:04.100 --> 00:18:05.540]   to the pattern of this world,
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:10.380]   I think the best paraphrase is from a very,
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:16.740]   is from an older English paraphrase Bible called J.B. Phillips.
[00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:20.700]   So J.B. Phillips was a pastor and translator of the Bible
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.540]   and he translated New Testament in contemporary English.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.580]   He translated this phrase, do not conform any longer
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.940]   to the pattern of this world as, listen up,
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:36.060]   do not let this world around you squeeze you
[00:18:36.060 --> 00:18:41.060]   into its own mold, but let God remove your mind from within.
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:47.380]   J.B. Phillips, yeah, pretty good, right?
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:51.700]   Do not let this world squeeze you into its own mold, right?
[00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:55.540]   Do not let the pattern of the world,
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.220]   the Roman way or the secular way to mold you.
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:04.100]   Don't let it squeeze into the worldly mold,
[00:19:04.100 --> 00:19:10.300]   but let God shapes your mind and mold your mind from within.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.940]   There's constant pressure in this world to shape us,
[00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:18.180]   to squeeze us, to be like the world.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.740]   But as Christians, as we receive the mercy of God,
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.740]   the true way of life is conforming to Jesus Christ himself.
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:30.660]   So point number one, I have it is we,
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:33.140]   each and every one of us together,
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.460]   we are living sacrifice to God.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:38.260]   We are worship.
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.260]   We are like an act of worship,
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:44.420]   not only by singing in the first 15 minutes, right?
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.300]   We sing, how many songs do we sing today?
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:50.540]   Three, right?
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:51.380]   Three.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.580]   We sing the songs and we follow the PowerPoint.
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.940]   It's not just that.
[00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:57.860]   Worship is not just that.
[00:19:57.860 --> 00:19:59.780]   Worship is our whole being.
[00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.580]   We live together.
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:06.060]   We act together as a pleasing sacrifice,
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.980]   as a pleasing worship to God.
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.060]   And let the word of grace shape us
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:15.620]   instead of the words from the world, right?
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:18.220]   That's the two verses in the beginning.
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:21.700]   And three to eight, Paul reminds the church,
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.300]   reminds us who we are and what we are to do.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:29.780]   Basically, he said, we are the body of Christ.
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:32.300]   We are the new body of Christ.
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.660]   So he said, "By the grace given to me,
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.900]   "I say to every one of you,
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.600]   "do not think yourself more highly than you are,
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:42.000]   "but rather think of yourself with sober judgment
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.580]   "in accordance to the measure of faith God has given you."
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.040]   So God has given us different levels of faith,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.820]   different levels of maturity, different levels of abilities.
[00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.060]   Verse four, "Just as each of us has one body
[00:20:55.060 --> 00:20:56.980]   "with many members,
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:21:00.160]   "these members do not have the same function."
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.640]   And the analogy goes that in Christ now,
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:08.640]   we form one body and each member belongs to all the others.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.600]   That's a wonderful verse, right?
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.160]   In the body of Christ,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:19.080]   our relationship to each other has changed.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.700]   It's defined by God,
[00:21:20.700 --> 00:21:24.440]   none other than God.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.900]   And God defined our relationship with each other.
[00:21:27.900 --> 00:21:31.920]   And God has given us different measures of faith gifts,
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:34.160]   right, some special abilities,
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:36.180]   some special calling to all of us,
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:38.140]   whether we are Jew or Gentiles,
[00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:42.160]   whether you are high up in the social status
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.820]   or low in the social status,
[00:21:43.820 --> 00:21:45.760]   with status or without status.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:48.500]   Christ has redefined our relationship.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:51.840]   To the Romans, to the first audience of this letter,
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:56.020]   body, when they say body,
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.880]   it was a political term
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.440]   because politicians in the Roman Empire
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:04.040]   and in the Greek world,
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.040]   they like to use the analogy of body
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   to describe the citizens of the city
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.640]   or citizens in the empire.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.280]   You belong to body, to one body,
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.240]   the politician would say.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.120]   That's why you need to be united
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:23.160]   and you have to vote for me, right?
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.660]   You have to support me.
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:27.560]   That's how the Roman politicians would say
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.840]   when they use the term body.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.120]   They're talking about political unit,
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:33.900]   body of citizens.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:36.080]   To the Romans, as I said,
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:39.300]   the rulers were dominant over the ruled.
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:41.720]   The slaves need to obey the leaders.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.400]   The men are above, on top of women, over the slaves.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.240]   And that will be peace.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:52.440]   To the Romans, this is Roman peace.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.920]   But Paul is using the same term in a subversive way.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.280]   He's using the same term, body,
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:03.560]   and to tell us, hey, in here,
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:06.300]   in this new community, this new society,
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:11.160]   relationship is defined and configured differently.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:13.120]   Verse four, he says,
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:17.120]   "One body with many members and different functions.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:18.840]   "Each member of the church,
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:24.600]   "each member here is gifted in some way."
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.320]   Aren't you amazed, you know,
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.740]   some people are gifted in very different ways, right?
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:37.840]   You may be gifted in cooking, right?
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.480]   I'm certainly not gifted, right?
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:42.200]   I'm certainly not gifted.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.080]   Before, my son is spending the summer here,
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.420]   and because of him, we have good food.
[00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:50.640]   You know why?
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   Because I approach food in a very practical way, right?
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.120]   I don't care whether it tastes good or not, right?
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:00.600]   As long as it fills my stomach,
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:02.360]   and I continue to work, right?
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.680]   I approach food, it's a very, very, very
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:06.800]   despising way to him, right?
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.200]   But he makes good food,
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.220]   and he's so gifted in that way, right?
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:14.720]   And some of people are gifted in leading,
[00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.880]   and some of us are gifted in teaching.
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:21.440]   Some of us are gifted in caring.
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.440]   And many different abilities, many different gifts
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   that the Bible says has different function, right?
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:35.020]   And the word function, in verse four,
[00:24:35.020 --> 00:24:39.200]   you see that these members do not all have the same function.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:43.240]   The Greek, the original Greek term is praxis.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:49.200]   Praxis, that's how we get the English word practice, right?
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:54.380]   So Paul is saying members do not all have the same praxis,
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:57.940]   do not all have the same practical function.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:59.460]   And this word is telling us
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:02.140]   not only we receive some spiritual gifts,
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:04.220]   we have to use them.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.620]   Spiritual gifts or spiritual abilities
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.540]   are not to be owned or possessed by the individuals.
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.780]   Each one of us needs to discover our spiritual gift.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.060]   We discover our spiritual gifts,
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:19.340]   and we need to develop,
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:22.300]   we need to grow our spiritual gifts
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.140]   and use them in praxis, in practice,
[00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:28.580]   to use it for the good of the church,
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.620]   for the good of others.
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:35.620]   No one, no one, no question in the church is an audience.
[00:25:35.620 --> 00:25:39.900]   Every one of us is performing something.
[00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.060]   Every one of us is doing something
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.300]   and performing our practical function.
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.460]   And that's what Paul meant when he continues to say,
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:50.180]   "We have different gifts," verse six,
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:52.180]   "according to the grace given to us."
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:56.660]   A man may be gifted in prophesying, right?
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:58.100]   Now again, let me remind you,
[00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:00.980]   prophesying in the Bible, in biblical terms,
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.700]   is not predicting whether it will rain tomorrow
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.980]   at 3.30 p.m.
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:07.260]   It's not predicting.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:09.740]   Prophesying is proclaiming the word of God,
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.780]   the authoritative word of God.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.340]   That's what the prophets did in the Old Testament.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:17.100]   And that's what people who are gifted
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.100]   in prophesying will do.
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:22.860]   They would preach according to scripture
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:25.820]   and let him use it in proportion of his faith.
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:30.100]   Verse seven, "If you're gifted to serve, let him serve."
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:34.500]   By the way, this church is so blessed
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:37.540]   to have many people who are gifted in serving.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:39.300]   You know what it means?
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.580]   You know what it looks like?
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.500]   People always work in the background, right?
[00:26:44.500 --> 00:26:47.060]   Putting things together, setting things up, right?
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.900]   And they don't talk, right?
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:53.660]   But they use their hands and feet to serve the church.
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:57.500]   If it is serving, if it is the spiritual gift of serving,
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.020]   let him serve or let her serve.
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:02.260]   If it is teaching, let him teach.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.500]   If it's encouraging, let him encourage.
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:10.500]   Contributing, let him give generously.
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.180]   If it's leading, let him lead diligently.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:18.780]   Showing mercy, let him do so cheerfully.
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:23.940]   And that is the beautiful picture of the church.
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:28.940]   And, you know, Olympic Games has been showing on TV, right?
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:35.220]   I hope you have been watching the Olympic Games, right?
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:36.300]   Yeah, you just can't help it.
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.740]   You have to watch it, right?
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:39.900]   Yeah, it's 'cause you're bombarded by, you know,
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.060]   different games and replay, right?
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:46.140]   And I spent some time watching the Olympic Games,
[00:27:46.140 --> 00:27:49.380]   and I'm just amazed how people get gifted so differently,
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:50.220]   right?
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:54.300]   Some are great swimmers, right?
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:57.900]   You can't tell them to climb, right?
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.460]   They are created, they're made, they're gifted to swim, right?
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.900]   Some are good at track and field.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.060]   Some are good at gymnastics, right?
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:10.820]   You can't tell them to do something else, right?
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:14.060]   And that is the picture Paul is trying to paint to us.
[00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:19.060]   'Cause he says, in Christ, we are a new people,
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:22.540]   and we are gifted in many different ways.
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:27.540]   And you and I are called to build up the body of Christ,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.860]   the church.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:31.860]   Use our gifts, right?
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:34.140]   You have to find your own gift.
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.340]   And you discover your own gift, praise God, right?
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:43.180]   That does not mean you don't need to do your lessons.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:47.740]   You still need to improve, you still need to develop, right?
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.180]   You still need to use them.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:54.980]   I remember in the early years of my Christian walk,
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:01.700]   I started to discover the gift of teaching, right?
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.660]   Because, you know, that's one of my passions, right?
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:08.100]   I like to study the Bible, I like to know more about God.
[00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.820]   And I wanna tell other people, right?
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:14.460]   I remember the early years, I stumbled.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.860]   I stumbled a lot, because I don't know how to put
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.660]   the information or the materials together in a helpful way,
[00:29:21.660 --> 00:29:23.540]   to help the church, to help our fellowship,
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.620]   to help our brothers and sisters, right?
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:28.340]   And it took me some time to practice it.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:30.380]   It took me some time to take the opportunity,
[00:29:30.380 --> 00:29:33.420]   seize the opportunity to help other people.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.220]   And that's what I'm saying, discover your gifts
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:41.220]   and develop them and deploy them and to use them, right?
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:46.300]   Paul is saying to us, we are a new people of Christ.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:48.900]   We are gifted in many different ways.
[00:29:48.900 --> 00:29:51.780]   Let's build up the body of Christ, right?
[00:29:51.780 --> 00:29:54.020]   If you find that you are not gifted,
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:58.140]   you need to tell yourself, that's not true.
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:02.260]   You are always gifted in some ways, right?
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:05.940]   Our church is blessed by many people
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:08.300]   who thought they are not gifted,
[00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:12.780]   but what they do, what they practice is so important to us.
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:15.860]   And that is praying for the church, right?
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.220]   There are some elderly members in our community,
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:23.100]   they faithfully pray for us.
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:25.860]   They faithfully uplift the church
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:28.780]   and pray and support the church, right?
[00:30:29.980 --> 00:30:32.900]   You have the gift and you have to use it.
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:37.940]   You have to use a gift to build up the body of Christ.
[00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:40.060]   That brings us to the verse of the week.
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.220]   And let me conclude with this verses
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:48.220]   taken from the Book of Romans 12, verses four and five.
[00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.620]   Why don't we read this verses together, right?
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:57.340]   Just as each of us has one body with many members
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:01.060]   and these members do not all have the same function.
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.700]   So in Christ, we who are many form one body
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:09.420]   and each member belongs to all the others.
[00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:11.700]   Let's all pray together.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.860]   Father, we wanna give you thanks
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:15.560]   for each and every one of us here.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:18.780]   Yes, we come from different walks of life
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.180]   and we speak different languages,
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:24.700]   we have different interests and we have different passions.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.580]   And yet in Christ, we are one body.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:30.660]   And yet in Christ, in the mercy of God,
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:32.620]   we belong to this new family.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.540]   We can call each other siblings,
[00:31:35.540 --> 00:31:38.940]   siblings in Christ, sisters and brothers in Christ.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.940]   What an amazing reality that we can live in.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:50.460]   Thank you for the brother and sister in this room,
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:54.780]   for the siblings in this church,
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:32:00.700]   that we are being called into this community,
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.260]   this family to be one, to be one body.
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:10.860]   And God, we just pray that you will help us
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:15.020]   to break down all the walls that separate each one of us
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:21.420]   and help us to be united, united in Christ Jesus.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.660]   And thank you for the gifts you have given to us.
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:30.660]   Help us use them for the benefit of others,
[00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.900]   to pray for the church, to build up the church,
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.060]   to serve other people.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.900]   Thank you for this new identity
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:42.300]   and may this new identity continue to remind us
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:44.820]   that we belong to the body of Christ.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.180]   What a glorious truth.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:49.660]   And we can use our gifts to serve,
[00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:51.300]   use our gifts to worship.
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:55.500]   Again, we wanna give you thanks and praises
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:56.460]   in Christ and pray.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:33:00.820]   Well, may God's peace be each and every one of you
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.420]   and I wanna see you next week, 11.30
[00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:05.700]   and let's continue to worship God.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.540]   God bless.
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.120]   (gentle music)
