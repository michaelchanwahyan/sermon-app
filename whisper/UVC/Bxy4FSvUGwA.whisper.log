[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   Hey guys, happy Father's Day to all of you.
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.040]   And I'm sure today's Father's Day,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.120]   you probably want to hear something about some Father's
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.800]   Day story, right?
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.640]   Anyone?
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:14.320]   OK, all right.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.600]   A couple of Father's Day stories.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.760]   Again, it's not about-- as preachers,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.720]   sometimes we use our children as our [INAUDIBLE]
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.360]   and without their permission.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.880]   But here, I give you a couple of stories.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.520]   It's not about them, OK?
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.720]   So it's not about them, it's about me.
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.760]   It's about me.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.600]   As a father, you probably would realize
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.840]   that we are broken as well, right?
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.440]   We are broken as much as anyone else.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.760]   And we need the grace of God.
[00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.160]   So I've got a couple of stories of brokenness
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.160]   to share to you on this Father's Day.
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.920]   I shared a couple of stories in the 10 o'clock service,
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.480]   so maybe I should just do this right here, right?
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:12.320]   The first story, when my daughter was about one year old,
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.880]   I remember there was one afternoon I was working really,
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.520]   really hard.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.720]   It probably was a Saturday.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.280]   And as you know, as a pastor, the most busiest day
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.840]   of the week is Saturday, right?
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.440]   It's Saturday.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.760]   You're getting ready for today, right?
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.840]   So I was preparing sermon.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.520]   And for some reason, the little girl
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.160]   was making some weird noise.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.920]   And for 10 minutes straight, I don't know,
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.440]   she was not crying, was not in pain or anything like that.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.840]   But she was just in the crib, and she was just
[00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.840]   making some noise.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.920]   I don't know why.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.840]   So I was kind of--
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.960]   if you know me enough, I can be an angry man.
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.480]   I can be very, very angry in moments of weaknesses.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.880]   I can unleash my anger.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.920]   So that's the broken part of me, right?
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.680]   So I went into the room, and I started pushing to her.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.080]   So I had a 10-minute impromptu sermon, right?
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.240]   I forgot what I preached, but I think the central idea was
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.000]   that you cannot be selfish, right?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.680]   You need to care for other people.
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.760]   We have needs, too, right?
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.140]   I need to get things done, right?
[00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.760]   So I unleashed that angry sermon for 10 minutes straight.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.880]   So I will remember that.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.480]   And then I came back to my room and kind of calmed down.
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.280]   And then I said to God, dude, that was my broken moment.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.760]   I shouldn't do that, right?
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.960]   So I confessed my sin and went back to the room.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   I said, I'm sorry.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.520]   I was angry, right?
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.560]   My anger was not checked, right?
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.600]   And of course, I don't think she remembered that.
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.720]   But that's OK.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.480]   I think fatherhood is vocation, right?
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.800]   You know what vocation means?
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.200]   Vocation means calling, right?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.520]   Calling.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's a calling that God has on us
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.640]   as fathers for a certain period of time in our lives,
[00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.200]   sometimes shorter, sometimes longer.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.280]   But we are being called to be a father, right?
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.480]   But I want to tell you, if you're a father,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.360]   or you have a father, we're not perfect.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.480]   And we don't need to be perfect.
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.080]   We all need the grace of God, right?
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.200]   Amen?
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.800]   We all need the grace of God.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:07.520]   And believe it or not, fathers, daddies, God loves you, right?
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.920]   God accepted you.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.480]   Entirely.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.280]   Not because you're perfect.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.400]   Not because you're better.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.040]   Just because who you are, right?
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.280]   We're sinners.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.000]   First story of Father's Day.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.240]   Second story is about my son.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:32.960]   This I also vividly remember.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.760]   I think he was about five to six years old.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:45.200]   And as Asian families, we want our kids to learn instruments,
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.200]   right?
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.080]   A lot of Chinese and Asian families,
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.840]   they don't really appreciate music.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.680]   But they just want their children to learn music, right?
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.840]   That's very ironic.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.080]   But I'm not one of those.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:03.800]   But I have my daughter and son go through piano lessons.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.480]   I remember one afternoon before the piano teacher arrived,
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:14.920]   and he was practicing some very simple song, right?
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.880]   Very simple song.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.000]   But for some reason, he didn't get it.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.040]   He didn't get it.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.000]   He just have that note wrong, right?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.160]   Well, if you know me, I'm quite a self-disciplined person,
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:27.920]   right?
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.280]   I know if I put myself into doing something,
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.680]   I will get it done, right?
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.640]   A lot of fathers are like that, right?
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.640]   And that's a good thing.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:39.880]   That's also a bad thing, right?
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:42.160]   Because if you know me as a friend,
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:48.160]   you probably would not think I'm too imposing, right?
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:53.800]   But in my family, everyone else knows that I'm kind of--
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.240]   I want to impose.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.920]   I demand, right?
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:04.680]   And to live with me is quite an experience.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.200]   It's quite--
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.040]   For real?
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.120]   For real, yeah.
[00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:14.200]   People suffer because I have high demand on other people,
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.400]   especially family members.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.560]   So he was practicing piano, and he was doing this chord,
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.920]   and something like this, right?
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.960]   [PIANO PLAYING]
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.520]   Yeah, and he kept doing it wrong.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.440]   And to me, this is unacceptable, right?
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.400]   And at that moment, it was a broken moment.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.400]   It was a moment of weakness.
[00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.520]   I unleashed my anger again.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:41.480]   So I'm yelling at him, right?
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.440]   Yelling at him.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.680]   I said, there's no way you cannot do this.
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:53.280]   If you repeat that phrase, that measure, for 50 times,
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.440]   then you will do it, right?
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:01.960]   And then I forced him to repeat that once and twice and third.
[00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.800]   After quite a few times, I realized
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:09.760]   that there was something wrong with me, right?
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:10.760]   And it just dawned on me.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.880]   What I want him to do, does it really
[00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.240]   matter compared to what God wants him to do?
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.920]   Do you know what I'm saying?
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:31.680]   It's not that important what I want.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.080]   It's what God wants, right?
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.960]   So after that heated moment, it was really heated.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.360]   Again, he doesn't remember that.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.520]   God is good.
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:52.480]   After that piano lesson, I walked again.
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:55.840]   I prayed, and I confessed my sin.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:03.440]   And I said, God, give me courage to apologize.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.640]   You know how that goes?
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:12.960]   A 37-year-old man, you need to apologize to a five-year-old?
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.080]   Like a real apology?
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.320]   It's not like, I'm sorry.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.880]   No, it's a real apology, right?
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:24.600]   So I walked up to him and I said, I'm sorry.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.120]   I was angry.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:31.000]   Can you forgive me?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.840]   It was a humbling experience.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:36.880]   Humbling experience in the sense that we are all broken.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.800]   I'm broken.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.520]   I need the grace of God, right?
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.360]   We all need the grace of God.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.200]   Now I'll share these stories to you on Father's Day,
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.880]   because of course, some of us are fathers.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.040]   And some of you have fathers, right?
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.560]   They're still alive, right?
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:58.000]   Living with your father, living with your daddy.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.800]   We are broken.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.920]   We need to share the grace of God.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.960]   So that's the first I want to share with you before we
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.800]   go to the Apostles' Creek.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.760]   And no matter where you are in your life stage,
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.400]   our fathers are broken.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.800]   We, as fathers, we are broken.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:21.680]   And we need the love of God.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   And the love of God is there.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:26.360]   1 John 3, verse 1.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:31.320]   "See what great love the Father has lavished on us,
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:34.800]   that we should be called children of God."
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:38.880]   And that is what we are.
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:45.480]   The great love of our heavenly Father has lavished on us.
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:48.480]   So that is a happy Father's Day to you.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.960]   But I want you to know that God loves you.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.840]   God's grace is always sufficient, right?
[00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:00.640]   Great love, lavishing on us.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:03.160]   Well, let's come to the loving presence of God.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.560]   Let's pray.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.360]   Father, we give you thanks because you love us so much.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.800]   You love us so much that your Son, your only Son,
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:14.200]   died on the cross for our sins, for our brokenness.
[00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:15.680]   And we thank you.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:17.640]   Thank you for your loving presence.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:19.800]   Thank you for this relationship that we have,
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:25.160]   that we are called your children, children of God.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:32.040]   In our brokenness, in our humbleness, in our sinfulness,
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.880]   we meet your grace.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.040]   We experience your love.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.960]   And thank you for the cross.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.160]   Thank you for what you have done for all of us.
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.160]   I especially want to pray for the daddies and fathers
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:48.640]   in our congregation.
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:55.200]   I pray that your grace will be lavishing on them,
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.720]   that it is not easy to be a father, especially
[00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.400]   in this generation.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:02.480]   I pray that your grace will be sufficient for them
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.600]   to meet those challenges.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.000]   And even though they are not perfect,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:13.240]   even though we are broken, we know that you love us fully.
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:17.480]   You accept us at the foot of the cross.
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.400]   And we thank you for this grace.
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:20.720]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.840]   Amen.
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:26.080]   All right, so the end of Father's Day sermon.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:27.640]   OK, all right.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.720]   So we go back to the Apostles' Creek.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.880]   All right, I'll cut it short.
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:38.600]   And I'll make sure we get out after 1225.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:45.720]   OK, we come to this section, the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.080]   The Apostles' Creek, again, is 12 statements.
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.000]   It's like a road map of what Christianity is all about.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.560]   And here it says, "I believe in Jesus Christ as only Son,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:55.120]   our Lord.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.080]   He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.240]   and born of Virgin Mary."
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:05.480]   Jesus' birth is a miracle birth.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.800]   Now, as modern people, we hear miracle birth, all right,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.160]   virgin birth.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:15.480]   We automatically think in scientific terms, right?
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:18.320]   Have you ever asked the question,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.640]   what's the DNA of Jesus?
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:22.920]   Right?
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.840]   Now, definitely not from Joseph, right?
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.360]   But where's it from, right?
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.720]   What does it look like?
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:32.600]   Now, we come to the virgin birth or miracle birth
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:35.880]   with the scientific thinking.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:41.480]   But I think for the biblical readers of this first audience,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:45.040]   they would not think in terms of scientific DNA
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.520]   and all that stuff.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.880]   They would be thinking along the line of the Old Testament.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.440]   The Old Testament, if you remember,
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:56.440]   there were tons of miracle birth stories, right?
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:58.560]   Can you name some of them?
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.080]   Isaac, right?
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.760]   Jacob and Esau.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.560]   And there are many other miracle births.
[00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:09.400]   If you track the miracle birth stories
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.160]   of the entire Old Testament, every time there's
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.880]   a child miraculously birth, it is
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:20.760]   because God is advancing another chapter in his redemption
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.680]   plan for mankind.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:29.080]   Isaac was born, opened another new chapter in Abraham's story,
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:30.600]   in the story of Genesis.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:34.920]   And then Esau and Jacob was born as the twin brothers,
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:36.480]   miracle birth again.
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:39.000]   And another chapter was open.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.480]   So they would be thinking about God is doing something new.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:47.680]   So when the Bible talks about the virgin birth of Mary,
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.120]   when Jesus was birthed, the Bible
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.240]   is talking about finally God is fulfilling his promises.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.560]   Whatever he has said in the entire Old Testament,
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.400]   the covenant with Abraham, the covenant with David,
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.520]   and all this stuff, God is faithful.
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:06.840]   And only God can do that.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:12.280]   That is why the birth of a child is a miraculous birth.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:18.600]   Virgin birth, of course, is the miracle birth, right?
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:22.320]   So again, we don't come to the Bible always
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:24.080]   with our modern mindset, right?
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.600]   I think I have talked about it in the past few parts
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.800]   of the sermon series.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.840]   I think it's sad.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:36.680]   It is really sad that even today, in 21st century,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:44.840]   we always think that faith and science are in disharmony.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.880]   They don't go together.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.760]   And they must be being polarized.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.320]   Again, when we come to the miracle birth of Jesus,
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.440]   virgin birth of Mary, we don't need
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:57.440]   to think in scientific terms.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.920]   There is no contradiction between miracle
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:05.880]   and how the natural world works.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.360]   They can be in harmony.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:14.480]   I was born-- I grew up in a very conservative church.
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:18.040]   And I remember back then in the Bible studies
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.520]   and in Sunday schools, we always have
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:23.800]   to feel the tension, the huge tension,
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:29.000]   between faith and reason, faith and intellect.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.160]   We opened the Bible, the first few pages, Genesis.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.000]   There's always this harmony, kind
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.720]   of a tension between what Genesis 1
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:41.640]   has to say about the beginning of the universe
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.520]   and then what natural science has to say.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.120]   Now, I want to tell you, I want to emphasize this.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.040]   I think this is really, really sad that we have
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.360]   to pitch one against the other.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.600]   There's no such thing, because the Bible is not
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:55.160]   a scientific textbook.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:01.440]   It doesn't tell us what the early history
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:03.320]   of the physical universe.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:06.240]   The ancient people, the biblical world,
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:09.240]   does not concern with scientific questions
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.340]   that we concern about.
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:16.200]   So there has to be some way we can bring the two together
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.160]   in harmony.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   Again, as I said before, Genesis 1
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:24.320]   is answering the who question, not the how question.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:29.720]   The how question is answered by scientific enterprise.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:32.160]   The who question, the theological enterprise,
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:34.840]   is what scripture is trying to do,
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.760]   trying to tell us who behind the universe
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.960]   and who we should worship.
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:45.340]   In 2020, I mentioned this before,
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:51.440]   Dr. Francis Collins accepted Templeton Prize.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.640]   It was during COVID.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   It was a huge concern, so it was a private kind of event.
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:00.040]   It was live streamed on YouTube.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:06.080]   And Collins said, as a medical doctor, in his whole life,
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.080]   he has been atheistic.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.320]   He doesn't believe in God.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.720]   And then one day, he was challenged by his patient.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:21.320]   And then it just dawned on him that science did not help much
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:25.440]   with the profound question of meaning.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.200]   What do you live for?
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:30.560]   The meaning of life, the value, right?
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:32.760]   Science cannot offer much help.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.760]   And Collins said, at that time, he
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:41.560]   realized his atheism is dangerously thin.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:47.920]   He was quoting Chesterton, one of the great theologians
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:50.280]   in the 19th century.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:55.560]   He said, atheism is the most daring of all dogmas
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:18:00.720]   because it is the assertion of universal negative.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.760]   There's no God.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:09.880]   So he became a believer in two years,
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:12.840]   something written by C.S. Lewis and talking to other people.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:17.560]   And then finally came to faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.320]   Take notice of the acceptance speech.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.840]   The title is "In Praise of Harmony."
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:31.160]   Harmony between science-- he's a top-notch scientist--
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:36.760]   and faith, an evangelical Bible-believing question,
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.600]   these two can go together.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:49.600]   So these two, faith and reason, can go hand in hand.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:52.320]   And I hope this is your experience as well.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:58.880]   There's no need to just deny human reasoning when we come
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.840]   to faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:07.760]   So virgin birth is beyond our finite human reasoning.
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:09.120]   It is beyond.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.800]   But that does not mean it's unreasonable.
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.960]   That does not mean it's irrational.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:22.320]   When something goes beyond our finite reasoning,
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:26.040]   we do not need to conclude that this is irrational.
[00:19:26.040 --> 00:19:28.440]   It can be-- probably the best term
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:35.120]   is trans-rational, beyond our rationality.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:36.360]   Our brain is finite.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.200]   Our mind is finite.
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   But God can go beyond all of this,
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:46.880]   surpassing our finite rationality.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.120]   In fact, when the angel announces the virgin birth
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:55.400]   to Mary, how did Mary respond?
[00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.920]   Luke 1, 29.
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.320]   "Mary was greatly troubled by what the angel said to her
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:05.520]   and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.
[00:20:05.520 --> 00:20:09.400]   But the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary.
[00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:11.680]   You have found favor with God.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.960]   You will be with child and give birth to a son.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.280]   And you are to call his name Jesus.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:21.840]   He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:26.800]   The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.520]   And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:31.560]   His kingdom will never end.'
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:35.800]   And Mary responded by saying, 'How will this be?
[00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:41.080]   How will this be since I am a virgin?'"
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:43.280]   The angel continues.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:48.920]   "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, will have power on you.
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:53.080]   So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.120]   Even Elizabeth, your relative, is
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.160]   going to have a child, another miracle child,
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.280]   in her old age, which is John the Baptist.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:07.920]   She who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.040]   For nothing is impossible with God.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:14.000]   I am the Lord's servant, Mary answered.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.040]   Finally, she obeyed.
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:24.040]   And she said, 'May it be to me as you have said.'"
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:28.600]   Mary's faith, Mary's obedience, the first step
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:32.920]   to take in what the angel has said to her,
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.360]   what God is going to do through her life.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:44.200]   Now, here's the first takeaway, the doctrine of virgin birth.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:50.360]   First, Jesus came to this world in a humble manner.
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.200]   That's why we come to God.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:55.440]   We come to Jesus.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.200]   We need to be humble as well.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:01.760]   Now, I don't have a picture here in Israel,
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:03.600]   in the town of Bethlehem.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:10.680]   Today, there is a church called Church of Holy Nativity.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:17.520]   Holy Nativity, meaning remembering the birth of Jesus.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.440]   You walk in that church, it used to be a really, really big door
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.840]   to welcome people.
[00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:26.640]   But century after century, there's renovation,
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.680]   there's changes to the door or the structure of the church.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:33.240]   Now, it became a really, really small door.
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:36.400]   And you have to duck to go in.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:44.440]   And the door is called the door of humility.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:48.840]   You come to see the birth of Jesus, the place he was birthed,
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:50.880]   according to traditions.
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:57.000]   And your first action you need to do is to be humble.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.280]   And that's the first takeaway.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.360]   And God is infinite, and he's beyond our finite mind.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.200]   Yes, we cannot understand how it works,
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.960]   but God demands our humble trust.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:16.360]   So there's nothing irrational about Jesus' birth.
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:19.440]   Yeah, it's trans-rational.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:24.200]   But I think the second takeaway is from another passage
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.840]   talking about the virgin birth of Jesus
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.520]   in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 2.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.080]   Now, you know what happened here is that Joseph and Mary,
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.720]   they're traveling from their workplace in Nazareth
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.120]   in the north and all the way to Bethlehem
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.280]   while Mary was still pregnant.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:45.520]   What happened was the Roman Empire
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.280]   imposed some sort of taxation census.
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:54.120]   So everybody has to go to their hometown to register.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.880]   It's kind of an imperial policy.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.840]   So those who are being oppressed by Joseph and Mary,
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:02.680]   the normal, typical Judeans, they
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.560]   have to go back to the hometown.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:08.240]   This is how the story goes, chapter 2, verse 4.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:12.880]   So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.360]   to Judea, to Bethlehem, his hometown, town of David,
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.320]   because he belonged to the line or house of David.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:22.960]   He went there to register with Mary, who
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:27.920]   was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:31.320]   While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:36.440]   And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.
[00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:42.600]   She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in the manger
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:47.360]   because there was no room for them in the inn.
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.520]   Or I guess the better translation is the guesthouse.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:24:56.520]   No matter how you understand it, maybe there's
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.160]   a Motel 6 in Bethlehem, and it was full.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.240]   There was no vacancy for them.
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:07.000]   Or they couldn't book the Airbnb at Bethlehem
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.360]   or whatever that is.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:12.680]   I think it can be translated properly as a guesthouse
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:16.200]   because in the typical Palestinian house, even today,
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:20.640]   sometimes-- so often, they have two floors.
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:24.920]   And the upper floor, as you can see in this reconstruction,
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:29.400]   is the guest room, the bedrooms.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.200]   It's up there.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.200]   Down there, the lower level, is where the manger is,
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.520]   where the production happens.
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:41.400]   They would cook, or they would have the animals in there,
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:42.600]   especially in wintertime.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:45.240]   They would keep them warm.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:52.280]   That's how a typical Palestinian house looks like.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:57.320]   And the guest room, the Gospel of Luke says, has no room.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:26:01.080]   Now, you can imagine in that sort of census
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.080]   across the Roman Empire, everybody
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.960]   is going to their hometown.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:06.760]   And it's so crowded.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:08.120]   There were other relatives, there
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.560]   were other friends who were staying at the so-called Airbnb
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.760]   on the second floor.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.960]   And Mary showed up with Joseph.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:20.120]   And he was about to give birth, right?
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.640]   So she went down to the first floor.
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.920]   However you want to interpret it, in or guest room,
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:32.760]   it really doesn't matter because the message is the same.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:40.880]   He was born in the manger, down there, where the animals are.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:43.080]   Not in the palace.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.960]   That's another takeaway.
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:50.200]   The Son of God came to our world, our broken world,
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:52.440]   in the manger.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:56.400]   We draw close to God every Sunday.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:02.240]   We better check our attitude when we come to worship.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:08.840]   Sometimes we come to worship as if we come to a concert.
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:15.960]   Sometimes we come to worship as if we are watching a show.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.400]   There's always customer reveal at the end,
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.600]   because I'm the center.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.680]   I come to be entertained.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:26.040]   I come to be--
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.120]   somebody has to satisfy me, right?
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:32.160]   Well, we go to a restaurant after worship service,
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:34.920]   go to a restaurant if the service is bad, right?
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.040]   What do you do?
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:39.240]   You walk away, right?
[00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:40.200]   What do you do?
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.400]   You give them one star, right?
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:47.560]   But not so in the church.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:49.520]   Not so in worship.
[00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:55.000]   Worship is all about exalting God.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.840]   And we come and we bow.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.400]   We need to learn the lesson of humility,
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:10.200]   because the Son of God came as a lowly, lowly man,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.440]   born in the manger.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:18.600]   Next, we should consider what the Catholic tradition has
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.160]   to say about Mary.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.800]   That's another takeaway.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:25.120]   Now, the Apostles' Creek, as you can tell,
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.360]   is different from creeks or statements
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.200]   issued by the Catholic tradition.
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:39.960]   In the Catholic tradition, in the general official teaching
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:46.320]   of the Catholic church, Mary is the co-redeemer.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:51.840]   Mary is the co-redeemer who brings the Messiah
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.560]   into the world, right?
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:59.240]   And Mary, accordingly, was sinless.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.760]   The perpetual virginity of Mary--
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.800]   you've probably heard of that--
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.160]   she remains pure in the rest of her life.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.520]   And some traditions in the Catholic teaching,
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:13.520]   Mary never died.
[00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:19.560]   She fell asleep, and she was taken up to heaven.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:23.240]   Now, all of this are unfortunate,
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:29.160]   because as you can see, there's no biblical warrant
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.920]   for all this teaching or all this concept.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   There's nothing intrinsically special about Mary.
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:43.520]   Now, in Jesus' day, Mary was probably a high school girl--
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:47.240]   16, 17, or even 15, 14-year-old, right?
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:53.000]   This is a young girl, young Hebrew faithful girl.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.040]   The angel told her, Messiah will come through you.
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:02.880]   And she responded with obedience, with faith.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:08.400]   So there's nothing intrinsically special about Mary.
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:13.240]   It's not about Mary's status.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:19.840]   What is praiseworthy about Mary is not about herself.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:25.520]   What is praiseworthy is about her faith.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.840]   It's her obedience.
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.520]   That is special.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:35.560]   Luke 1, 45-- Elizabeth was meeting with Mary.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.800]   Both of them are pregnant.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:40.400]   And Elizabeth, you remember, was pregnant with John the Baptist,
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:41.440]   the cousin of Jesus.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.760]   And then Mary was pregnant about to give birth to Jesus.
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:49.000]   Both mothers met together.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.200]   And Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist,
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.560]   speaks about Mary in this manner--
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:59.360]   45-- "Blessed is she who believes."
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:07.760]   Blessed is she who believes.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:11.800]   It's her faith that matters.
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:15.320]   It's her faith that is our example.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:20.920]   Now, I don't know your relationship with God recently.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:25.400]   Maybe God is calling you to do something,
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:30.200]   to witness to someone, to serve in a certain capacity.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:36.200]   No matter what God is calling you, maybe you're struggling.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.120]   Maybe you're waiting.
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:40.680]   I'll tell you this.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:50.160]   God is advancing His plan through you.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:50.660]   God will.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.880]   But you're called to obey.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:32:00.680]   You're called to respond.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:03.160]   It's your faith that matters.
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.120]   Sometimes we struggle with the calling of God.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:08.080]   Well, this is mundane, right?
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:12.320]   Mundane stuff I'm doing, maybe in my workplace,
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:15.040]   maybe in my family.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:18.480]   Just go through the routine day after day and day after day.
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:22.120]   Nothing is really happening, right?
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.080]   But think about it.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:31.040]   She who believed, she said yes to God.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:34.320]   Yes, your will be done.
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:39.920]   And God-- only then God can use us in our neighborhood,
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.400]   in our church, in our workplace.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:46.360]   We just say yes to God.
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:48.760]   All the details, God will figure out.
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:51.720]   But you need to trust in Him, right?
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.760]   Whether you're moving away, whether you're
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:33:02.960]   serving or stick to some sort of commitment, trust in God.
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.200]   And God will work out the details.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:08.120]   All right, let's pray together.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.520]   Father God, we give you thanks for you
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.560]   are working in this world.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:15.760]   Sometimes we cannot see it.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:20.280]   And most of the time, you seem invisible.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.760]   But in scripture, story after story, page after page,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.400]   you tell us you are faithful.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:32.920]   And you are actively doing something.
[00:33:32.920 --> 00:33:35.760]   And you want to do it through us.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:39.800]   And we pray that no matter what we are struggling with,
[00:33:39.800 --> 00:33:41.080]   give us faith.
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:46.240]   Give us the-- just to fully trust in you,
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:52.160]   that you will be working out your purposes in our lives.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:57.040]   You will be fulfilling your plan in our lives.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.520]   We pray that we will learn to be faithful.
[00:33:59.520 --> 00:34:02.120]   We will learn to trust in you.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.720]   Thank you for being our faithful, faithful father.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:07.720]   Thank you for being our loving God.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:09.120]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.600]   Amen.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.440]   Well, God bless you.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.680]   And remember, happy--
