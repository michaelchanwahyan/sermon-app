1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 And here is it, let's welcome Pastor Mark for today's sermon.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hey, good morning guys.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 I had a really good Thanksgiving week and we ate a lot in Toronto.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 We spent five, six days, right?

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 From Monday to Saturday.

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 Right, how many days?

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 And we ate a lot of good food and we spent a great time there.

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 Nine of us went there.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
 So we did a lot of shopping.

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 I started to think in the third day or fourth day,

11
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 I started to think my main job is actually just driving and paying,

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 using my credit card to pay all the good stuff, right?

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 So, you know, it just got so good, right?

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 So Thanksgiving is just over and it's a holiday

15
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 or it's a time of the year to remind us God has been good to all of us,

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 you and me, and we need to give thanks, right?

17
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 There are some calendar markers along the year to remind us

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
 what God is doing in your life

19
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 and when to respond positively to God's good work.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 And today we continue this series to talk about the festivals,

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 the special days in the Bible.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
 And we talk about Passover, we talk about Sukkot,

23
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 now we talk about Pentecost, what we call Shofoot.

24
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Shofoot simply means weeks in plural, so many weeks.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 So in the Old Testament calendar, it's seven weeks,

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 seven Sundays after the Passover.

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 So it's the 50th day is the day of Shofoot, the day of Pentecost.

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 That's why we call it Pentecost in Greek, 50, right?

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 It's a day that is special in the sense that there is nothing

30
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 related to God's miracles in the history of His people in Israel.

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 We talk about Sukkot, right?

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 Tabernacles, it has to do with God's miracle works

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 in the wilderness, right?

34
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 God is guiding His people out of Egypt and through the great

35
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 and fearful wilderness for 40 years and giving them manna, right?

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 Giving them food and water, miracle works, you know, for 40 years.

37
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 That's why they celebrate Sukkot and they make temporary shelters

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 and they live in it for a week to remember what God has done

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 in their history, in their lives.

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 And then the second example I give you is that most of the

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 biblical calendar, most of the biblical festivals have to do

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 with God's miraculous work in the lives of the people.

43
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 And Sukkot is one of them, Tabernacle is one of them,

44
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 and Purim is another one.

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Purim, if you remember, is a holiday that is set aside

46
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
 by the end of the book of Esther, right?

47
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 When the Jews were separated or scattered across the Persian Empire,

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 they were persecuted and God, you know, saved them and rescued them, right?

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And then the third one is mentioned in the Gospel of John,

50
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 chapter 10, is called Hanukkah, right?

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Hanukkah is around the time of Christmas.

52
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 Sometimes we call it Festival of Lights.

53
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 It has to do with the Jewish people in the year of 160-something BC

54
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 when they fought against the Greek Empire who persecuted them,

55
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 oppressed them, and they won.

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 They won the battle and they gained their political independence.

57
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 That's why they cleansed the temple and they rededicated the temple.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 They call it Hanukkah, right?

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 The fourth festival we talk about is the Passover.

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 Passover, it has to do with Exodus, right?

61
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 The 10 plagues, God defeated the oppressor Pharaoh

62
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 and saved his people out of Egypt.

63
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 Now, all these examples have to do with God's great works.

64
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 You know, he has done some signs and wonders to save his people.

65
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But Pentecost almost has nothing to do with miraculous work of God.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Now, let's take a look at this verse from Leviticus 23.

67
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 It says, "From the day after Sabbath,"

68
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 now, the previous context was talking about Passover, Passover.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 "When Passover is done, from the day after the Shabbat,

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 count off seven full weeks and then keep counting until the day after Sabbath,

71
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 which is 50 days later.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Then present your grain offering to the Lord,

73
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 whatever your harvest is, your first fruit, you present to God in the temple."

74
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 So, it has no miracles.

75
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 It has to do with farming, harvest, you know, agricultural festival.

76
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 50 days after the Passover, the Pentecost,

77
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 they bring in the wheat harvest and being reminded God is the provider.

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 God is faithful.

79
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Now, as I said, there's nothing to do with the saving works of God.

80
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 No exodus, no wilderness, no miracles in the Bible, but they celebrate it.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Now, between the Old Testament and the New Testament,

82
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 there are about a few hundred years in between.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 We call it intertestamental period.

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 After the Old Testament, before Christ came in the New Testament,

85
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 there were about a few hundred years.

86
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 The Jewish people in the land of Palestine,

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 they would merge some of the dates of festival together.

88
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 So, in between the Old Testament and New Testament,

89
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 the Jewish people would take the day of Pentecost to Sheffield

90
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 as remembrance of God's giving the law to His people.

91
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 Now, it's about the same time, right?

92
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 Because if you remember the people of Israel,

93
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 they came out of Egypt at the twilight of Passover,

94
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 and then exactly two months later, they arrived at Mount Sinai,

95
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 and God gave them the law, right?

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
 Part of the law is Ten Commandments.

97
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 So, it's two months after Exodus, they came to Mount Sinai,

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,000
 they received the law, right? They became a covenant people.

99
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 They became people of the law.

100
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 And then the Sheffield O is 50 days after Passover,

101
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 so they kind of merged that, right? It's around the same time.

102
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 So, they would use this time to remember God giving them the law,

103
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 the revelation.

104
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 That's why in Pentecost, in between the Old Testament and New Testament,

105
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 they sometimes call it Pentecost, but also called the Festival of Revelation.

106
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 God is giving them the law, His regulations, His will to His people.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 So, it makes sense around this time they merged these things together.

108
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 But there's one note we need to make.

109
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 What is the law? What is the Torah?

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 Now, this becomes problematic for us,

111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 because in modern translations, usually we translate the word Torah,

112
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 which is Hebrew, into law or regulations in English, right?

113
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 Or, you know, in some other modern translations.

114
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 You get the sense that law has nothing to do with relationship, right?

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 You see a stop sign, you ran a stop sign, right?

116
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 And then you got pulled over.

117
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 There's nothing relational about it, right?

118
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 The police officer will give you a ticket, right?

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Or it hurts your wallet, right?

120
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,000
 You got fined, but there's no relational dynamics involved, right?

121
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 You just violate some regulations.

122
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 You see the speed limit, 55 miles per hour.

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,000
 You know, you went over it, and too bad if you got pulled over.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 You know, it hurts financially, but there's nothing relational about it.

125
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 But in the Bible, Torah is not impersonal.

126
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 It is relational.

127
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
 It has everything to do with your relationship with God, right?

128
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 A few weeks ago, I was in Kansas City, and I was taking one of the seminars.

129
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 So we were talking about how we should translate the word Torah,

130
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 because definitely it does not mean the modern sense of law.

131
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 How do you translate Torah?

132
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 I think one of the examples given by the instructors, the professors,

133
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 is really appropriate.

134
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 He says, you know, Torah in the Bible, law and regulations in the Bible,

135
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 is like how, you know, if you're a parent, you tell a child,

136
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 "Don't touch the stove," all right?

137
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 "Don't touch the stove."

138
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 You know, one-year-old, two-year-old, "Don't mess with the stove," right?

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 Now, this is like the law, right?

140
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 For a two-year-old, that makes sense, right?

141
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 You don't touch it.

142
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 But when the child grows up, if it's simply,

143
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,000
 "Remember, just stay away from the stove," for the rest of his life,

144
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 I think he obviously does not understand what it means.

145
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 When the parents tell the child, "Do not touch the stove,"

146
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 what does it really mean?

147
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 It means use the stove properly, right?

148
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 So when the child goes up, when the boy goes up,

149
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 he knows how to cook, right?

150
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 He will approach the stove and cook a good meal, right?

151
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 That's what it means.

152
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,000
 That's the essence of don't touch the stove, right?

153
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 So as you grow up, you understand, you know, so-called the Torah.

154
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 Actually, you have to interpret it and apply it with wisdom.

155
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 As you grow up, you need to understand this is the essence of the law.

156
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 Now, think about Ten Commandments.

157
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 Ten Commandments.

158
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 I'll give you examples.

159
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,000
 "Thou shalt not murder," right?

160
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Well, what does it mean?

161
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 Does it mean, "Okay, I just don't kill anyone," right?

162
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 "I don't murder anyone, so I'm fulfilling the law," right?

163
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 No. No.

164
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 That's not what it means

165
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 because it means to nurture a life-giving society,

166
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 a life-giving culture.

167
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 That's why in other regulations,

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 when they unpack what it means "Thou shalt not murder,"

169
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 they will say you have to protect, you know, the innocents.

170
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 You have to protect other people who are weaker than you

171
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 because God loves every life, every human being.

172
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 "Thou shalt not commit adultery."

173
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 What does it really mean?

174
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 You cannot imagine a husband going home every night and say,

175
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 "You know, I did not commit any extramarital affair.

176
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 I love you," right?

177
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 No. That's not what it means.

178
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 It means culturing or nurturing a good relationship,

179
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 a good family, a good marital relationship, right?

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 That is what the commandment means.

181
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 It's relational.

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 "Thou shalt not steal."

183
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 That does not mean, okay, I don't take anyone else's goods

184
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 or I don't take their stuff.

185
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 No, it means to promote generosity.

186
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 What I have is not just fulfilling my needs and my wants.

187
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 I will give. I will give back to God

188
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 because God is giving you abundantly.

189
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 That's why you make your offering.

190
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 That's why you want to use your resources to bless other people.

191
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 That goes beyond just calculating, okay,

192
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 "Oh, it has an offering, you know, 10% and all that stuff."

193
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:18,000
 You know, that simply means that we do not understand the Torah.

194
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Just like the example, "Don't touch the stove."

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So if you think about the Torah,

196
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:31,000
 you think about the law of God given at the time of Pentecost.

197
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 You understand there is something we need to, you know,

198
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 interpret and we need to understand, right?

199
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 It's relational and there is some essence you need to understand.

200
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 That's why today in Jewish synagogues,

201
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 during the festival of weeks, the Pentecost,

202
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 they will read two passages from the Bible.

203
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Now, one of them, of course, is what I have already explained,

204
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 is 10 Commandments.

205
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 They will read this portion of Scripture

206
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 to remember God has revealed Himself.

207
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 God has revealed His character by His law.

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 That's why as the people of God, we need to follow

209
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 and to understand and apply the law of God in their lives

210
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 to live out the life of God.

211
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 That's why they recite the 10 Commandments in the synagogues.

212
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 And another passage they will recite during this festival,

213
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 festival of Pentecost or Shavuot,

214
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 they will recite the Book of Ruth.

215
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 The Book of Ruth.

216
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 And why?

217
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 If you remember the story of the Book of Ruth,

218
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 it was the time of judges

219
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 when the Israelite society was in chaos.

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 And Ruth was a Moabite.

221
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 And she left her own country

222
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 and confessed faith in the true God Yahweh.

223
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 And she lived in the land of Israel.

224
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 And she was poor, right, with her mother-in-law.

225
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 They went through a lot of difficulties

226
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 trying to settle down in a foreign land,

227
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 in the land of Palestine.

228
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 Now, what does it have to do with Pentecost or Shavuot

229
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 or, you know, the time of harvest?

230
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Well, it happened that in Chapter 2,

231
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Ruth the girl met her future husband, Boaz,

232
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 in the time of Shavuot, in the time of harvest.

233
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Chapter 2, "One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi,"

234
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 her mother-in-law, "Let me go out to the field,

235
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 the harvest field, right, that people are harvesting, right?"

236
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 This is the time of Pentecost. This is the time of Shavuot.

237
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 "Let me pick up the stocks of grain

238
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 left behind to anyone, anyone who is poor,

239
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 and is kind enough to let me do it."

240
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 So she went. And Naomi said, "Yeah, go ahead."

241
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 And as it happened, by chance, by God's providence,

242
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 she found herself working in the field that belonged to Boaz,

243
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 the relatives of her father-in-law.

244
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 So it just happened she ended up in the field of Boaz

245
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 in the time of harvest, in the time of Pentecost.

246
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 So the book, Ruth, the story of Ruth,

247
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 is actually a harvest story, kind of in late spring,

248
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 you know, in our calendar, May or April,

249
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 for a foreigner to be able to settle down

250
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 because of Boaz's generosity.

251
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 He is good to her and to her family.

252
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 He's generous enough to let her pick up the crops

253
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 so she can live, she can flourish.

254
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 That is why the Jewish synagogues will recite the book Ruth

255
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 in times of the festival of weeks,

256
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 festival of Pentecost,

257
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 because one of the most important themes in this season,

258
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 in the festival, is how to practice generosity.

259
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Remember, that's about the time

260
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 the people of Israel had their harvest.

261
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 They got their paychecks.

262
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 It is right at this time they remember a story like this,

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 to be generous because God is generous,

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 to be good to others,

265
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 to be kind to others.

266
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Now I told you I spent a week in Toronto, right?

267
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Now people ask me, "What did you do in Toronto?"

268
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 It's the same thing, right?

269
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 Typical stuff, right?

270
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 We just eat, eat, eat, and eat, right?

271
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 And then shop, and shop, and shop, right?

272
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 I spent some time with some of the friends.

273
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 Some of them I've known for years, for years.

274
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 I met this--I had dinner with one of my friends from Hong Kong.

275
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:24,000
 I haven't seen him for almost 30 years, almost 30 years.

276
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 So he just moved with his family from Hong Kong,

277
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 moved to Toronto.

278
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 He got a job there.

279
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 And you probably know some of the politics of today, right?

280
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 Canada has this lifeboat programs,

281
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 you know, for people from Hong Kong.

282
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 They kind of like a refugee status

283
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 because of the political change or political hardship in Hong Kong.

284
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 So this friend of mine is part of that wave of immigrants,

285
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 wave of people that left Hong Kong.

286
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 They went to Toronto a couple months ago

287
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 and tried to settle down, you know.

288
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Now, so often, we visitors, we are travelers,

289
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 you know, especially we are holding U.S. dollars.

290
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 We go in Toronto, "Wow, everything is so cheap.

291
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 Everything is so cheap."

292
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 Every meal is like, "Dude, I can eat 10 meals here.

293
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 I'm using U.S. dollars because U.S. dollars is so strong, right?"

294
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And we go buy stuff, right?

295
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 We go to the shopping mall or the outlet.

296
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 "Wow, everything is so cheap.

297
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 Oh, man, this is such a great trip," right?

298
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 But you talk to the locals, you hear their stories.

299
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 It's the other side of the coin.

300
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 They had difficulties.

301
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 With all the inflation after COVID,

302
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 with all the financial hardship they are going through, you know,

303
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 I think as we spend good time in Toronto,

304
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 spend good time as a traveler, as a tourist,

305
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 I think we need to open our ears at least to know some stories, right?

306
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,000
 To listen to their stories.

307
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Can you imagine someone who has been his whole life in Hong Kong

308
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 and he and his family has to be re-rooted in a foreign land, right?

309
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 It's a tough life, you know?

310
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 You use U.S. dollars in Toronto, it's a good deal, right?

311
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 But for those who earn money, try to settle down there,

312
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 it's a totally different story, right?

313
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 It's kind of like a story of Ruth, right?

314
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 You know, I was talking to a couple who just spent a couple weeks in Hong Kong

315
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 after the service, the previous service.

316
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 They were talking to me.

317
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 They spent two weeks in Hong Kong.

318
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 They said the whole society has changed.

319
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 It's not the one they used to know.

320
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 They told me they stayed in an area near a university in Hong Kong

321
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 and they go to the subway every day, right?

322
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 And the police officers were picking on all the college students,

323
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:38,000
 all the young people, for no reason.

324
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 They said everything has changed because of politics, right?

325
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 Think about people like this.

326
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 They have to leave.

327
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 It's not because it's a better life out there.

328
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 They got to go, right, for the kids or for the family or whatever reason.

329
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 They just can't stay there.

330
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I was talking to someone in the morning.

331
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 He was updating me about what's going on in China.

332
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 You cannot imagine living in a place like this, you know,

333
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 where COVID is almost over, but the government is not willing to step down.

334
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 It's not willing to change the policy, right?

335
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 I just Googled, you know, BBC News, China COVID,

336
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 protesters, you know, from Beijing to Chengdu, Chengdu,

337
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 protesters openly urged Xi Jinping to resign over the COVID policy.

338
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 All over the place, you know, people are protesting.

339
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 You cannot imagine living in a place like this, and you have to go.

340
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 You go to somewhere else, right?

341
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 So I met some friends in Toronto.

342
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 They have the same stories, right?

343
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 Yeah, we have a happy time, but, you know, they have a tough life, you know.

344
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 That's why in the Torah, when it mentions Shavuot,

345
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 the time of harvest, the time when you get your paychecks, right,

346
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 it continues to talk about how we should live with all we have.

347
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 So we read part of the passage from chapter 23,

348
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 the book of Leviticus.

349
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 Let's continue.

350
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 Verse 22.

351
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 Now it's talking about Shavuot, right, Pentecost.

352
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 You have to bring your grain offering to the Lord.

353
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And then verse 22, it says, "When you harvest your crops of your land,

354
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 do not harvest the grain along the edges of your fields,

355
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 and do not pick up what the harvesters drop.

356
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 Live it for the poor and the foreigners, the aliens living among you.

357
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 Be kind to them. I am the Lord, Yahweh, your God."

358
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Now, listen to this law, this Torah.

359
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 It is essentially relational, right?

360
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 It flows out of your relationship with God

361
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 because God is giving you good things.

362
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Now you can harvest, you can get your paychecks, right?

363
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And then from your blustered life,

364
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 you flow out the kindness of God to other people who are needy around you.

365
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
 Who is the first reader of this Torah, of this regulation?

366
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 It's not the poor.

367
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 It's not the needy.

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 It's written for those who have a lot, right?

369
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Who has land, who has harvest, who has workers working in the field, right?

370
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 23, 22, when you harvest your land, right?

371
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 So you own the land, right? You have a farm.

372
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 You have harvest, you got your money, you got your paycheck, right?

373
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Don't just think about, "Okay, I want to buy this," or "I want to buy that."

374
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Just fulfill my needs and fulfill my wants, right?

375
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 After Thanksgiving, after Black Friday, and then we think about,

376
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 "Okay, Cyber Monday, what should I buy? What do I want?"

377
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
 This regulation is telling you, as the people of God,

378
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 we need to think about those around us who are in need.

379
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Leave them.

380
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 The edges of your field, you know, when you cannot harvest everything,

381
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 just leave it there.

382
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
 Share with some other people, right?

383
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Leave it there.

384
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 When you drop something, leave it there

385
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 so the people following you, behind you,

386
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 just like Ruth, the girl, the moorbyte,

387
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 leave it for the poor and the foreigners living among you.

388
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 Be kind to them.

389
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 Always think of when you harvest, when you get your paycheck,

390
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 how can I be generous to those in need?

391
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 Everything has to do with relationship.

392
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 Torah, the law, is imitating God.

393
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 God is generous.

394
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 Look at the universe around us.

395
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
 God is generous.

396
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:32,000
 He made a huge universe for us to explore, for us to enjoy.

397
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 This is the life of God.

398
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 That's why the life of God's people

399
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 needs to be generous and gracious

400
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 to imitate the character of God.

401
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 The last verse I want to share with you is Acts 2.1.

402
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 Now when we think about Pentecost,

403
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 when we think about the festival weeks, the harvest,

404
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 we always think of Pentecost,

405
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 what happened was the Holy Spirit

406
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 descending into the lives of people,

407
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 and then there were signs and wonders, right?

408
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 People speaking in tongues and all this.

409
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 Miracles happening in the early church.

410
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 Now listen to what it says, 2.1.

411
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 2.1.

412
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 When the day of Pentecost arrived,

413
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 first phrase, first sentence.

414
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 A better translation is actually

415
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 when the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled.

416
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 It's being fulfilled.

417
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 What is being fulfilled?

418
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 It's the spirit, the essence of the festival,

419
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 the harvest, and being generous.

420
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 Now we often, as I said,

421
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 we often pay attention to the signs and wonders, right?

422
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 But if you trace the story of Pentecost

423
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 up to chapter 4, 4.34,

424
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 it describes the life of the early church,

425
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 the early Christians, the early Jewish Christians.

426
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 In the day of Pentecost, when it is fulfilled,

427
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 when the Holy Spirit came upon His people,

428
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 and they shared their things with one another, right?

429
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
 Those who were well-off,

430
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 they shared their own properties.

431
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 They shared their own goods

432
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 with those who are in need around them.

433
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 4.34, there were no needy people among them.

434
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 That is the miracle.

435
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 That is the true sign and wonder.

436
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 It's not speaking in tongue.

437
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 It's not just enjoying,

438
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 okay, we have a high worship time, high life, right?

439
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 It's the fact that they are being generous to one another, right?

440
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 If you check the phrase, "no needy people among them,"

441
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 this phrase is in the book of Torah,

442
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 the book of Deuteronomy.

443
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 When the people of God is really applying,

444
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 you know, the Torah of God,

445
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 being generous, living the life of God together,

446
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 there's no needy people among them.

447
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 That's what the early Christian church experienced.

448
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 No needy people among them.

449
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 So I invite you to go back to the Bible

450
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 as we check the--as we study the festival of Shavuot, Pentecost.

451
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 Think about how God has blessed you so much, abundantly,

452
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 and how you can bless other people,

453
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 and you can be generous to other people, right?

454
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 Look around the world, you know, pray for those who are in need.

455
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 Pray for those who are under oppression.

456
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
 You know, I hope you understand I'm not talking about early politics.

457
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 I'm talking about the kingdom of God,

458
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 full of justice, compassion, and righteousness.

459
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 That's what God wills, right?

460
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 That people will respect one another, to love one another,

461
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 under the Torah of God, to participate in the life of God.

462
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 I'm talking about that.

463
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 I'm talking about heavenly politics,

464
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 justice, and compassion, right?

465
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Think about, you know, past week,

466
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 we spent a great time, Thanksgiving,

467
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:41,000
 we ate a lot, we probably threw out a lot of food.

468
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 Just learned plenty.

469
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 How we can bless other people and exercise generosity.

470
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:54,000
 Let's operate together.

471
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 Father, we give you thanks because you have blessed us abundantly.

472
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 Thank you so much for your blessing.

473
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 The life that we have, the stuff that we have, is more than enough.

474
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 Thank you for being our good God and faithful God.

475
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 And most of all, thank you for giving your son, Jesus Christ,

476
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:30,000
 to give us eternal life, give us forgiveness of sin.

477
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 And boy, we pray for not only being thankful,

478
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 pray that we can be kind and generous and compassionate toward other people.

479
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 Those who are heartbroken, those who live in places of oppression,

480
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 those who are struggling with settling down in a foreign land,

481
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 the needy people around us.

482
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,000
 Open our eyes, God, that we don't just see and so focus on our needs and our wants.

483
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 Because you have indeed blessed us so much.

484
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 Open our eyes so that we can see the needs around us.

485
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 No matter if it's churches, it's ministries, it's other people that we know,

486
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 help us to be generous.

487
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 Help us to give.

488
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 Help us to bless other people.

489
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 And we pray that we will be a people living under your Torah

490
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 to know your will and apply your will in our lives.

491
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 And we pray that you will send us off this week

492
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 so that we will go to our corners, go to our own places,

493
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 our situation in our lives, that we can be a blessing to other people.

494
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 And what a privilege we can participate in the life of God.

495
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 What a privilege we can share your grace, share your blessing to other people.

496
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,000
 May our lives be an instrument of your grace.

497
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 In Christ's name we pray. Amen.

498
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Well, God bless you, and we'll see you next week,

499
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 and continue to worship and learn about God.

500
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 All right, God bless.
