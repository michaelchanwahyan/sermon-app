1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 - Pastor Mark, thank you very much, welcome.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,400
 My name is Tommy Lee,

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,960
 and I'm born and raised here in the city of Chicago.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,060
 So 44 years old, been here,

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,100
 living here on the South side of Chicago,

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,500
 graduate from Washington University in St. Louis

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,560
 over at business school.

8
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,680
 And then for about 10 years, I built cell towers.

9
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:19,040
 But during that period of time, I said,

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:21,400
 Lord, what is it that you want me to do?

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,040
 Is it to be a pastor?

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,440
 Because I've always wanted to do full-time ministry

13
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,400
 and serve you.

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,880
 And so at night, I went to seminary.

15
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,000
 I went to Moody Theological Seminary for about four years.

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
 And then after that, I graduated

17
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,840
 and I was a pastor for about three years.

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,420
 And through that, I realized,

19
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,000
 God, you did not call me to be a pastor.

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,040
 That just was not my skill.

21
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:47,320
 That was not how you've gifted me to do it.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,340
 And so now in the last 12 years,

23
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,240
 I get a chance to utilize some of my strengths,

24
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,760
 utilizing some of my experience in the business world,

25
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,840
 in the ministry world.

26
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,840
 So I get a chance to lead four different organizations,

27
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,720
 whether it's at Resource Global and at the Growth Center

28
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,640
 and different other organizations

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,760
 to continue to integrate how God has gifted me.

30
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,480
 And that really is the whole idea,

31
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,180
 the theme today that we're gonna talk about

32
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,680
 for those who are in-person,

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,600
 those who are watching online.

34
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,120
 What does it mean for us to be Christ in the world?

35
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,120
 God is giving you a story.

36
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,960
 All of us have a unique story.

37
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,560
 Our stories are different.

38
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,880
 But within those stories,

39
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,600
 there's chapters of the whole idea

40
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,000
 of chapters of a role that God leads all of us.

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,760
 And there is a journey that he uses

42
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,000
 as he continues to develop our passions

43
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,480
 and our strengths to ultimately follow him.

44
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,040
 And today we're gonna look at a specific story today.

45
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,920
 The story of David and Solomon.

46
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,360
 That as David dies,

47
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,520
 he leaves him with three simple words,

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,880
 three simple phrases that Solomon needs to understand

49
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,240
 in order to be a successful king.

50
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,120
 And that's what we're gonna look at today.

51
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,120
 And so before we turn on,

52
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,000
 you know, the last,

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,280
 I've been with you all for three times already.

54
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,760
 And the last three times I've talked about the history

55
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,200
 and life of David.

56
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,000
 And the whole story started,

57
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,200
 which leads us to this point.

58
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,320
 David is a young shepherd boy.

59
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:27,320
 Samuel is told by God that Saul is no longer the king

60
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,360
 and Samuel, I need you to go to Bethlehem.

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,520
 And I need you to choose the next king.

62
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:39,400
 Samuel goes to Bethlehem and there he meets Jesse.

63
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,720
 And Jesse parades his son

64
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,200
 and Samuel looks at his oldest son comes in

65
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,240
 and the Lord tells him,

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,520
 do not look at the outward appearances,

67
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,600
 but the Lord looks at the heart.

68
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,800
 None of the brothers,

69
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,960
 the older brothers are suitable to become king.

70
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:58,560
 Samuel then asked Jesse,

71
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,520
 is there someone else?

72
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,920
 He ushers in the youngest boy.

73
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
 David is in the shepherd field.

74
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,040
 He's in the sheep,

75
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,920
 tending the sheep in the field.

76
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,240
 So he brings them in.

77
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:12,000
 And there he is anointed as king.

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,960
 If you are on the side,

79
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,560
 now, if you ever get a chance,

80
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,360
 there's this lady by the name of Dr. Laverne Tolbert.

81
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,000
 And she wrote this nice little pamphlet that says,

82
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,160
 the title, I serve you just as my mother did.

83
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,440
 And it looks into the Jewish history

84
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,440
 of why David is so faithful to God.

85
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,520
 And he makes one phrase in the Psalms.

86
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,960
 He says, I serve you just as my mother did.

87
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,960
 And we talk and we look at the faithfulness of David

88
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
 all throughout scripture.

89
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,640
 And that's what God is using him.

90
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,840
 That's what God has seen in his life.

91
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,880
 Story goes on.

92
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,480
 Another sermon that I did with you guys,

93
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,800
 David and Goliath.

94
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,120
 All of you guys are familiar

95
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,360
 with the story of David and Goliath.

96
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,400
 David battles the giant because he is sent,

97
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,120
 he wasn't even chosen to be a soldier.

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,360
 He is sent by his father to go deliver food

99
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,080
 over to his brothers.

100
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,880
 And there he sees Goliath.

101
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:09,120
 And he sees the Philistines coming against the Israelites.

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,680
 And as we talked about,

103
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,400
 the reason why the Philistines are attacking the Israelites

104
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,520
 is the Israelites control the passageway

105
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,560
 to the Jordanian Valley.

106
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,360
 In order for them to get past the Jordanian

107
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,000
 and control the passage,

108
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,840
 they have to get rid of the Israelites.

109
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,800
 David is the only one brave enough

110
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,440
 to fight the Goliath the champion.

111
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,080
 And ironically, Saul, who is the King of Israel,

112
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,000
 is a Benjamite.

113
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,560
 And one of the things that we talked about is

114
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,080
 what do Benjamites do?

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,040
 They're experts in the slingshot.

116
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,200
 But Saul did not think of the slingshot.

117
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,560
 Saul is afraid of Goliath.

118
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,600
 And so David kills him with the slingshot.

119
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,200
 Now, you all think that the story after that is

120
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,560
 happy ever ending, right?

121
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,840
 And as a result, David ascends to become King

122
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,800
 and story is over.

123
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,680
 No, it actually doesn't.

124
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,840
 The story of 1 Samuel tells us then

125
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,440
 David is now chased by Saul because everyone loves David.

126
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
 Songs are written about David.

127
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,280
 Messages, everything.

128
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,160
 Everyone is a fan of David, except Saul.

129
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:19,360
 And Saul ends up whining to kill David.

130
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,360
 And so as a result, from 1 Samuel all the way to 22,

131
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:29,360
 about 17 to 22, it tells us the story of David running.

132
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,760
 David runs to his wife or actually more so before that,

133
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,360
 David loses his job.

134
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,440
 Because Saul no longer wants him to work for him.

135
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,720
 He tries to kill him.

136
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,720
 He runs to his wife, Michal.

137
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,200
 Well, Michal is married to Saul's,

138
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,600
 is married, Michal is a daughter of Saul.

139
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,520
 So he can't stay there.

140
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,080
 He runs to his mentor, Samuel.

141
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,960
 Well, eventually Saul finds him there and he has to leave.

142
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,960
 He runs to his best friend, Jonathan, who is the son of Saul.

143
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,680
 Well, eventually he can't go there.

144
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,840
 Everything he could depend on from his job,

145
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:10,240
 from his wife to his mentor, to his best friend,

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:14,120
 things that he could depend on are all gone.

147
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:17,160
 All these crutches are taken away from him.

148
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,200
 You know where he ends up?

149
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,480
 He ends up in the city of Gath,

150
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:25,400
 the home of the Philistines, the home of Goliath,

151
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,960
 who he just killed.

152
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,800
 And he ends up pretending to be a crazy man.

153
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,360
 After that, he can't stay there.

154
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,360
 He ends up in 1 Samuel 22, in the cave of a dulem by himself.

155
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:44,760
 Everything is gone.

156
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,880
 All the stories, all the songs,

157
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
 all of his crutches are all gone.

158
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,960
 That's where David is.

159
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,680
 And he writes, if you guys have a slide,

160
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,600
 he writes Psalm 57 and he writes Psalm 142.

161
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,760
 And there in 142, if you get a chance,

162
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:04,760
 let's take a look at 142, extra 142, is this.

163
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,600
 Next slide.

164
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:12,440
 Psalm 142, I cry out to you, O Lord.

165
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,600
 Yeah, I cry to you, O Lord.

166
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,640
 I say you are my refuge,

167
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,360
 my portion in the land of the living.

168
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,400
 Attend to my cry, for I am brought very low.

169
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,720
 Deliver me from my persecution,

170
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,680
 for they are too strong for me.

171
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,560
 Bring me out of the prison,

172
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,600
 that I may give thanks to your name.

173
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,200
 The righteous will surround me,

174
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,320
 for you will deal bountifully with me.

175
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,160
 All his crutches are gone,

176
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,800
 and he has no one else to depend on,

177
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,640
 but the Lord, as he wrestles by himself

178
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,400
 in the cave of Doolam.

179
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,880
 The Lord needed him to learn that journey

180
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,320
 of what it means to depend on him.

181
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,760
 That David, when all the crutches are gone,

182
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,560
 when all the people that you could depend on are gone,

183
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:02,320
 can you still have faith and trust in me?

184
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,520
 David had to learn that lesson.

185
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,680
 Once he learns that lesson,

186
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,360
 God brings a community around him.

187
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,680
 He now then becomes king.

188
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,320
 And not only does he become any king,

189
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,440
 he becomes one of the greatest kings in history.

190
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,640
 The greatest king Israel has ever seen, second to Jesus.

191
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,480
 But yet, everything doesn't go well, does it?

192
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,720
 He makes a serious mistake.

193
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,680
 The man after God's own heart makes a serious mistake.

194
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,040
 The biggest mistake that he makes is Bathsheba.

195
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,080
 He has an affair with Bathsheba.

196
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,920
 A son is born through Solomon.

197
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:40,040
 He ends up killing Bathsheba's husband, Uriah the Hittite.

198
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,080
 He doesn't make a lot of good decisions.

199
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,600
 And he has to learn to deal with the consequences

200
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 and the repercussions of his sin.

201
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,720
 And that will affect his legacy.

202
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,080
 That will continue to affect his kingdom

203
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,360
 and what history writes about him.

204
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,120
 And so now the story ends.

205
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,280
 And now we are over in 1 Kings 2.

206
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,560
 David is now an old man.

207
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,480
 Solomon, his youngest son,

208
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:08,200
 who is the son of Bathsheba and David,

209
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,600
 is gonna become king.

210
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,000
 And we all know about Solomon.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,280
 One of the wisest kings in history.

212
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,640
 David sits down with him.

213
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,880
 And he gives him these three phrases.

214
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,840
 When David's time drew near,

215
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:26,200
 he commanded Solomon, his son, saying,

216
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,840
 "I am about to go the way of all of the earth.

217
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,740
 "Be strong and show yourself a man.

218
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,720
 "And keep the charge of the Lord."

219
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,240
 Be strong, show yourself a man,

220
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,920
 and keep the charge of the Lord,

221
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,480
 walking in his ways and keeping his statues,

222
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,760
 his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies,

223
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,600
 as it is written in the Law of Moses,

224
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,400
 "That you may prosper in all that you do

225
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:57,440
 "and wherever you turn."

226
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,840
 And that's what we're gonna talk about,

227
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,280
 is three simple phrases.

228
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,320
 Not gonna spend too much time breaking out the verse.

229
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,280
 I wanna talk about what those verses mean

230
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,400
 in our culture today,

231
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,080
 not only for those who are sitting here

232
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,400
 in Chicago, Illinois,

233
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,560
 but those who are watching it

234
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,000
 from different parts of the world.

235
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,280
 What do the phrases, be strong,

236
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,580
 show yourself a man,

237
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,000
 and walk in his ways,

238
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,540
 mean for us as Christ followers,

239
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,360
 each and every single day?

240
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,800
 What does it mean in our work?

241
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,280
 What does it mean in our family life?

242
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:28,920
 What does it mean in our personal life?

243
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,380
 And that's what we're gonna talk about today.

244
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,520
 Be strong, show yourself a man,

245
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,120
 walk in his ways.

246
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,800
 First one, be strong.

247
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,880
 One of the things, a couple months ago,

248
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,520
 or actually probably about a month ago,

249
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,000
 my wife is a first grade teacher

250
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 here in Chinatown in Chicago Public Schools.

251
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
 About, man, about one o'clock,

252
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,800
 I'm on the Zoom call doing interview.

253
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:58,400
 And I get a text from my wife saying,

254
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,860
 "Our school is on lockdown.

255
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:03,820
 "There is a shooter somewhere inside the school

256
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,520
 "or outside the school, no one knows."

257
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,560
 That's it.

258
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,320
 And so I'm on this Zoom call,

259
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,960
 and I call her back right away.

260
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,040
 Nothing, get nothing.

261
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,480
 I go back to my work at three o'clock,

262
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,400
 she calls me up,

263
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,720
 and she says to us,

264
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,400
 "There was somebody killed right outside our school.

265
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,840
 "And Tommy, I think the person who was killed

266
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,880
 "is the father of our closest friend.

267
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,640
 "The Lamb family who are pastors

268
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,280
 "right next door to this church,

269
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,760
 "their father and father-in-law were killed,

270
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,320
 "was killed and shot 22 times

271
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,220
 "by an individual for no reason at all,

272
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:46,180
 "but just driving down Chinatown,

273
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:47,920
 "sees them, shoots them,

274
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,920
 "gets out and shoots them in their 20-something times.

275
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,480
 "And now that pastor and his family,

276
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,380
 "the pastor and his family who had to counsel people

277
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,820
 "all the time about how to deal with grief,

278
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:03,500
 "talk to them about how to deal with trials and tough times,

279
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:07,740
 "they are now the ones dealing with that grief.

280
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,240
 "They are now dealing with that tragedy."

281
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,580
 In the weeks ahead, in the weeks now,

282
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,300
 I've gotten the chance to spend a lot of time

283
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,980
 with the family.

284
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,380
 I sit with the daughter a lot,

285
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,700
 and we sit there on Friday nights,

286
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:22,340
 I see them quite a lot on Friday nights.

287
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:25,120
 And she tells me about how life is now,

288
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,500
 that her father has now been murdered.

289
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,020
 Her mother is now dealing,

290
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,380
 because literally her husband went to get a newspaper,

291
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:35,220
 walked three blocks to get a newspaper.

292
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,780
 On his way home, he never returned home

293
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:39,520
 because he was shot.

294
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,900
 And she's dealing with the grief.

295
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,100
 And the daughter tells me, "Tommy, every day,

296
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:49,100
 "I remember the last conversation I had with my dad.

297
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,560
 "I just replay the conversation over and over

298
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,580
 "and over again.

299
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,940
 "And you know what makes it hard?

300
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,760
 "I'm trying to figure out and deal with not being angry,

301
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,020
 "not being bitter against certain cultures

302
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,640
 "or certain things that are happening.

303
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,520
 "I'm trying to choose not to be angry at God."

304
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,500
 One of the things of being strong in our faith

305
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,260
 is that we continue to embrace compassion and love,

306
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,140
 and that we never, ever allow anger

307
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:27,060
 and resentment overcome us.

308
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,400
 Whether it's the problems that we see in our world,

309
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
 or whether it's in our personal life,

310
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,840
 we continue to make a choice to embrace compassion and love.

311
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:40,860
 And you never allow anger and resentment to overcome you.

312
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,900
 And in today's society, that's a hard time, isn't it?

313
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:47,580
 For some of us who are sitting here as Asians,

314
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,780
 I can understand that you see some of the Asian violence

315
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,260
 going on in today's society as well, too.

316
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:55,260
 Recently, I was driving down 35th Street.

317
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:57,140
 Many of you guys come down 35th Street,

318
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,380
 you get off the highway.

319
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:00,860
 I live about five minutes away from here.

320
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,540
 I'm driving down 35th Street,

321
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,000
 and there's a car weaving in and out, in and out,

322
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,420
 and it gets right behind me and wants to turn.

323
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:13,580
 But well, I have a no turn on red, so I am not turning.

324
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,880
 A guy comes in, again, it's an African American guy.

325
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:20,240
 And he comes right back to me, he rolls down his window,

326
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:25,240
 and he says to me, "This is why we effing shoot you people."

327
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,420
 And I was shocked, and I said to the Lord,

328
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,100
 and he drives off, and I left wondering,

329
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,700
 Lord, what does it mean to love

330
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:35,840
 the people who are hard to love?

331
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:40,860
 What does it mean for us to learn to forgive

332
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,980
 as you forgave, because you had to deal

333
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,860
 with the ultimate sacrifice.

334
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:50,380
 Learning what it means to have compassion and love

335
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:53,260
 does not mean that we're a stepping stool for everyone.

336
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:55,820
 It does not mean that people get to do whatever they want.

337
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,740
 As Christians, we say, oh yeah, that's fine,

338
00:14:57,740 --> 00:14:59,120
 we forgive them.

339
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,500
 Being strong means that we love and have a compassion

340
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:06,980
 for everyone, but we do fight the injustices in our life.

341
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:10,420
 That we do stand up and call out those injustices

342
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,260
 in our life.

343
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:13,700
 I love, we just celebrate Dr. King, right?

344
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,860
 I love the words of Dr. King, and if you guys

345
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:18,700
 could put that quote on the screen as well, too.

346
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,100
 Dr. King says this, I'm sorry about this,

347
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,860
 I should've made the font a little bit bigger,

348
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,460
 but I'll read it over to you.

349
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,820
 He says this, "Wherever the early Christians

350
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:31,380
 "entered a town, the power structure of God disturbed

351
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,260
 "and immediately sought to convict them

352
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,700
 "for being disturbers of the peace and outside agitators.

353
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:40,100
 "But they went on with the conviction that they were,

354
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:44,860
 "it was a colony of heaven, and they had to obey God

355
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,740
 "rather than men.

356
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:50,380
 "They were small in number, but big in commitment.

357
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,660
 "They were too God intoxicated to be astronomically

358
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,220
 "intimidated.

359
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,860
 "They brought an end to such ancient evils

360
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,660
 "as infanticide and gladiatorial contest."

361
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,700
 Being a Christ follower means that we continue to love

362
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,180
 every single death, people with despite their skin color,

363
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:13,140
 despite their sexual orientation, despite all of that.

364
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:16,820
 It means that we love people as Christ would love them.

365
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,740
 But what it does mean is that we do stand up

366
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,500
 to those injustices that we see, that we continue

367
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:25,580
 to make a difference in the cities and structures

368
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,620
 that we make, that as Christ followers,

369
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,900
 that we make it a better place.

370
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,460
 That our workplaces, our homes, our cities,

371
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,020
 our communities, whether it's in Chicago,

372
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,300
 whether those who are watching from other parts

373
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,460
 of the country, that you are integrating your faith

374
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,180
 into all that you do.

375
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:49,060
 But you choose to do it with the spirit of love

376
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,860
 and compassion, and that you never make decisions

377
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,620
 out of anger and resentment.

378
00:16:56,620 --> 00:17:00,300
 And that's hard to do, isn't it?

379
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,660
 That is hard to do.

380
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,980
 I recently had the board meeting

381
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,020
 for my organization Resource Global.

382
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:05,900
 We just sat here.

383
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,620
 And the board sat down with me and says,

384
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:10,940
 "Tommy, how's your family?"

385
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,980
 Great, great, great.

386
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,980
 But they said, "How are you doing spiritually?"

387
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:18,900
 And I said to them, "I'm struggling spiritually."

388
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:21,420
 You know why I'm struggling spiritually?

389
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,700
 It's been hard to love people.

390
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,860
 Because the more I sit in ministry,

391
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,900
 it's been now 15 years now,

392
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,620
 and the more I get involved in ministry,

393
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,940
 the more I deal with pastors,

394
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,620
 pastors that I've read in books,

395
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,780
 pastors that I've listened to on podcasts,

396
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,140
 the more I interact with Christians,

397
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:42,220
 they're hard to love.

398
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:45,780
 They take advantage of you every single time.

399
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,940
 They find ways to cheat you every single time.

400
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,780
 And I've been so surprised by that.

401
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,100
 And I said to the board,

402
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,460
 "I've grown disenchanted.

403
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:57,340
 I have to choose to see beyond that

404
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,020
 and see Christ in everything I do.

405
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:02,260
 And it's a choice that I have to make.

406
00:18:02,260 --> 00:18:04,460
 And it has not been easy."

407
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,940
 So for us, one of the things is be strong.

408
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,100
 To really be able to continue,

409
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,780
 to really be able to love the Lord,

410
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,580
 to have compassion in all that we do,

411
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,700
 and never lead out of anger or resentment.

412
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,020
 Secondly, show yourself a man.

413
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,860
 Two things I'll say about that.

414
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,140
 Show yourself a man is number one example,

415
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,740
 is be willing to take ownership

416
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:30,660
 of your mistakes and sins in a very humble way.

417
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,940
 One of the ways of showing yourself a man

418
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,500
 is that we are all grown up.

419
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,020
 It's not like my two-year-old daughter

420
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,380
 who doesn't like to share,

421
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,260
 and now I have to sit here and talk to her

422
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:40,500
 about what it means to share.

423
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,340
 She's two years old.

424
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,180
 She's learning.

425
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,180
 All of us are adults.

426
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,140
 It's being willing to take ownership

427
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,380
 of our mistakes and sins in a very humble way,

428
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,420
 knowing that we're not perfect,

429
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:53,780
 knowing that we're gonna make mistakes.

430
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,660
 But when we make those mistakes,

431
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,220
 are we willing to take ownership of it?

432
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:03,980
 We look at David all throughout scripture.

433
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,380
 A man after God's own heart,

434
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:08,300
 and he made a lot of mistakes.

435
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,460
 And he had to take ownership of those mistakes.

436
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:16,860
 Peter was always putting his foot in his mouth all the time.

437
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,540
 Paul had to deal with the fact

438
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,580
 that he had to sit there and deal with Christians

439
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,140
 when he was a Gentile,

440
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:26,500
 and he messed with them all the time,

441
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,980
 and he persecuted all the time.

442
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:30,340
 He had to live with that guilt

443
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,580
 after he became a Christ follower.

444
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:36,140
 I have two friends, two very successful individuals,

445
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,700
 and these two individuals,

446
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,580
 married couple, husband, wife, they were Chinese.

447
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,060
 They were extremely successful in the sense

448
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,500
 that they graduated from a prestigious university

449
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,380
 over in California.

450
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,180
 Then they worked for a tech company.

451
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,460
 Many of us used their computers.

452
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:56,100
 They worked for a very extremely influential tech company

453
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,300
 and was very successful.

454
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:03,180
 They then went to get their MBAs over here at university.

455
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:07,660
 Again, and then from that point, after their MBAs,

456
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,900
 they got hired for an athletic shoe company

457
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:14,340
 that many of us wear their shoes,

458
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:19,020
 and also was in a very prestigious position.

459
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:23,620
 The wife specifically oversaw all of the marketing

460
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,100
 for the World Cup,

461
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,100
 and eventually she was gonna be promoted

462
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:31,180
 for vice president of marketing in Asia.

463
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,140
 Right, great story.

464
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:36,100
 It all came crashing down.

465
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:37,900
 Why?

466
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:42,300
 The husband got caught selling shoes on eBay.

467
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:48,620
 A guy who earned over $300,000 a year

468
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,820
 thought it would be exciting

469
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,380
 to make a little money selling shoes on eBay,

470
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,380
 and after a while, you get caught,

471
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,900
 and he got fired right away.

472
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,580
 The wife who worked with them, HR called her in,

473
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,260
 and he said, "Did you know any of this

474
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,820
 "was going on with your husband?"

475
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:08,020
 "Yes, I did."

476
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:12,620
 "At any point, did you actually report this to HR?"

477
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,980
 "No, I didn't."

478
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,620
 "Hey, she had just gotten promotion.

479
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,700
 "She just got all her papers get promoted,

480
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,140
 "vice president of marketing for Asia.

481
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,540
 "They were gonna move to Hong Kong."

482
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,900
 He said, "You didn't report it.

483
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,180
 "You're fired as well, too."

484
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:30,380
 Instantly overnight, everything that they had worked for,

485
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:31,220
 gone.

486
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:34,540
 They struggled through their marriage.

487
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,540
 They struggled with identity.

488
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,700
 They struggled with the decisions they had to make,

489
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:41,820
 but they had to rebuild their life.

490
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,220
 One of the things I've appreciated

491
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:45,660
 about this particular couple is they admitted

492
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:49,060
 with the husband, "I made some mistakes, some bad mistakes."

493
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,340
 How do we then rebuild our life?

494
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:55,140
 How do we humbly make amends for our mistake,

495
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,300
 and those were dumb mistakes,

496
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,900
 but rebuild our life and continue to go on?

497
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,620
 All of us are gonna make mistakes.

498
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,740
 Are we humble enough to take ownership of our mistakes

499
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,780
 and sins in a very humble way?

500
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,860
 The other thing to be strong is this one.

501
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,620
 Be willing to listen to voices around you

502
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,180
 because you're not perfect,

503
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,620
 and we all need accountability.

504
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,060
 For Solomon, if he was to be strong,

505
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:25,780
 to show yourself a man,

506
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:28,940
 Solomon was the brightest of all the kings.

507
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:32,540
 Solomon knew, and he called the shots.

508
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:35,540
 Was he willing to listen to the voices around him

509
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,780
 because you're not perfect,

510
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,580
 and we all need accountability?

511
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:46,220
 I travel a lot for my work,

512
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,940
 and during the fall, I was gone a lot

513
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,380
 for about six weeks straight.

514
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,540
 When I got home, I noticed a distance

515
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,940
 between I have a two-year-old daughter

516
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,740
 and a seven-year-old daughter,

517
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,660
 and I noticed that they were always going to their mom

518
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:01,100
 all the time, and they kinda ignored me.

519
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,100
 My wife says to me, "Hey, Tommy,

520
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,100
 "you've been gone quite a lot,

521
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,540
 "and when you're at home, you also have meetings.

522
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,500
 "You're out early in the morning.

523
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,060
 "You have evenings, all that stuff.

524
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:13,180
 "Have you noticed that the girls

525
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,060
 "aren't coming to you anymore?

526
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,540
 "You need to spend more time with your girls."

527
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,140
 You know what the easy, justifiable thing is?

528
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,340
 I've been to Nairobi.

529
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,780
 I had to come back and do this and this and this.

530
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,700
 When I come home, I have a late-night meeting

531
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,180
 with Jakarta and all that stuff.

532
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,820
 Do you not know how hard I work?

533
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,220
 You have to deal with it.

534
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:34,700
 Was there truth in what they had to say?

535
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,100
 Was there truth in what they had to say?

536
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,180
 I come back, and I meet with my team,

537
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,100
 and now we've gotten to a point with Resource Global

538
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,620
 where over 30 people, big, they sat down with me

539
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:48,740
 and says, "Tommy, as this organization continues to grow,

540
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:52,020
 "we need more structure, and you don't provide

541
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,860
 "that structure that we need."

542
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:57,860
 Again, you know what the temptation is, right?

543
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:59,260
 I'm the boss.

544
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:02,820
 Guys, do you not realize I'm trying to make money?

545
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:05,140
 I'm out there meeting with donors,

546
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:07,980
 and I'm trying to make this thing survive.

547
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:11,100
 Is there truth to what they have to say?

548
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,660
 Are they speaking any truth?

549
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:17,700
 Can I be humble enough to listen to them?

550
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:21,340
 And so as a result, I had to make changes.

551
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,820
 I had to bring in different people

552
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,900
 and change their position and admit

553
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,100
 that there are certain areas I wasn't good at.

554
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:31,380
 And be okay with that.

555
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:36,900
 I say this all because sometimes it's hard

556
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,740
 for us to listen to voices.

557
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:41,300
 And I will say this, for those who are older

558
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:45,340
 who are sitting there, sometimes the Chinese culture,

559
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:47,140
 the Asian culture, especially if you're older,

560
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,660
 says you've gotta respect your older elders,

561
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,660
 you gotta listen to your elders.

562
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:54,700
 I encourage you, if you're older sitting there,

563
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,860
 learn to listen because when you work

564
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,980
 with that younger generation, they will actually respect

565
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,820
 and honor you more when you take time to listen.

566
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,740
 I sit there and talk to my mom all the time,

567
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:08,460
 and she says, "Well, I want everyone to respect me."

568
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,500
 But her idea of respect is everyone just listens

569
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,100
 and does whatever she says.

570
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,340
 But I tell her all the time,

571
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,140
 respect is that you communicate.

572
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,100
 Respect means that you dialogue

573
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,020
 and be willing to admit you're wrong,

574
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,220
 that you're not always right.

575
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,620
 And so for all of us sitting here,

576
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,940
 one, be willing and humble to make mistakes,

577
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,540
 but also be willing to listen to the hard things

578
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:37,060
 in your life, the times when you don't want to hear

579
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:40,420
 what people have to say, but is there truth

580
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:44,460
 to what they're saying about you and your character,

581
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,980
 even though it's hard to hear?

582
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:49,820
 Solomon had a hard time hearing that.

583
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:53,100
 You know, eventually what was the downfall of Solomon?

584
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,060
 He got caught up too much in the love of women.

585
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:00,420
 That became ultimately, his ego became so big

586
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,060
 that he stopped listening.

587
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:06,500
 The one of the wisest kings who actually had an opportunity,

588
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:10,700
 I believe because of his talent, surpasses his father, David,

589
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,180
 but he refused to listen.

590
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:17,140
 He refused to admit mistakes,

591
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,140
 and soon eventually gave in to sin as well too.

592
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:24,580
 Last thing, be strong, show yourself a man,

593
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,620
 walk in his ways.

594
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,620
 We have a couple minutes left.

595
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,580
 I wanna show you a couple of slides here.

596
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,660
 I show one slide here.

597
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:36,900
 My friend Andy Crouch talks about this.

598
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:40,460
 He says that as individuals, as human beings,

599
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:44,820
 we approach life with the exploitative attitude.

600
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,020
 Our method in life is we wanna take all you can get.

601
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:52,580
 Our attitude is I win, you lose.

602
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,860
 We've been taught about that all our life, right?

603
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,300
 You gotta take care of yourself.

604
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,540
 I hear that quite a lot.

605
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,740
 You gotta take care of yourself.

606
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,300
 And then once you take care of yourself,

607
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,180
 take care of your family.

608
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:06,020
 Then whatever you have left over,

609
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,980
 then take care of everyone else.

610
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:11,380
 And so we approach life with this method of,

611
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:12,940
 we're gonna take all you can get.

612
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,740
 We gotta think about ourselves.

613
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,420
 I win, you lose.

614
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,940
 But Andy says this, and let's show the next slide.

615
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:20,980
 He approaches life with this.

616
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:23,980
 He says, as Christ followers, here's our attitude.

617
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:28,900
 All right, oh, yes.

618
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,260
 With the ethical attitude,

619
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:35,780
 the approach is do things right.

620
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,300
 That our attitude is you win, I win.

621
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,060
 Guys, let's keep that up there.

622
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,500
 That we approach things with the whole idea

623
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,700
 is that you win, I win.

624
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,460
 It is not a matter is I take everything I can.

625
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:54,460
 It is the attitude of, it's always others first.

626
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:58,300
 It is always about Christ loving other people.

627
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,340
 It is always about you and I being a steward

628
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,300
 of what God gives me.

629
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:06,980
 It's a choice that we make every single day

630
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:10,020
 to make sure that the other person wins,

631
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,220
 the other person succeeds,

632
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,940
 the other person is successful

633
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,020
 in everything they do at our expense.

634
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,420
 But it's a choice that we have to make.

635
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,900
 Solomon had to make a choice.

636
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,420
 David had to make a choice.

637
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,660
 David made a choice when he chose Bathsheba

638
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:34,260
 when he should have been out with the army battling,

639
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,420
 but he chooses himself

640
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:40,100
 and has a fatal mistake with Bathsheba.

641
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,820
 Solomon chooses pleasure

642
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,500
 as a result destroys his kingdom as well too.

643
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:49,460
 As Christ followers, being Christ in the world

644
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,620
 means you approach life with the ethical attitude.

645
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:57,300
 That it is never about other, I mean yourself,

646
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,460
 but it is always about others.

647
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,620
 It is a decision that you make, not only your heart,

648
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:05,820
 but with your mind to choose that

649
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:09,380
 in every single decision that you make,

650
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,380
 it honors God and glorifies God in every single way.

651
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:17,060
 I would say this, and I say this with the young people.

652
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:19,940
 If you're in your mid-20s

653
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,860
 and you're just graduating and working in a job,

654
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,860
 the decision that you're gonna have to make

655
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:30,060
 for those who are in their young mid-20s to early 30s,

656
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,860
 whose life do you belong to?

657
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,740
 Before you become rich

658
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,060
 and before you start ascending into the corporate world

659
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,460
 and all that stuff, whose life do you belong to?

660
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:42,260
 Are you gonna make a decision

661
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:44,020
 that in every aspect of your life,

662
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,300
 from your money to your career, to your dreams,

663
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,940
 your family life, is all given to the Lord?

664
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:54,060
 Because if you wait until you're successful,

665
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:58,540
 if you wait until things get stabilized,

666
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:01,260
 you'll always give in to the temptation

667
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,340
 of choosing yourself.

668
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:07,500
 Being a Christ follower means that we make decisions

669
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,540
 that never benefit us.

670
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,580
 We make decisions that glorify God in all that we do,

671
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,900
 that we are a steward of what God has given us

672
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:21,740
 at our expense, and it's a choice that you have to make.

673
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:25,460
 One last illustration, and I'll wrap up.

674
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,540
 I get a chance to travel a lot, all the time.

675
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:31,060
 And one of the countries that I travel to is Nairobi.

676
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,340
 I think I've shared a little bit of this illustration,

677
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:35,860
 but let me just build out this illustration at all.

678
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:38,980
 When you go over to Nairobi, there are a lot of streets,

679
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,540
 everything is all remodeled, airports, streets, roads,

680
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,860
 highways, overpasses, everything.

681
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,980
 It's all being funded by the Chinese.

682
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:52,020
 The Chinese are giving so much money to build roads

683
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:54,260
 and infrastructures and technology.

684
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:58,260
 But in the process of that,

685
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:01,340
 they are bribing other people, officials,

686
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:05,580
 and paying them so much money that those who are from,

687
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,020
 the Chinese are getting rich,

688
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:10,340
 but the African politicians are also getting rich

689
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:13,380
 at the expense of the people,

690
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,900
 because there are still a lot of people who are poor.

691
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:19,780
 What you need is Christ followers in the workspace,

692
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,900
 Christ followers in the government,

693
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:24,060
 Christ followers integrating their faith,

694
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,180
 choosing others first, never about how much it can make me.

695
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,260
 To make a decisions that benefits the country

696
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:35,180
 and our societies and our communities as a whole.

697
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:38,300
 And that's what we need for all of you who are sitting here,

698
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:42,620
 Christ followers that makes a difference in a community.

699
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:45,780
 That when you walk away, wherever you are,

700
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:49,180
 that in your workplace or in your home or in your cities

701
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,740
 or in your community,

702
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:54,420
 that community is left in a better position

703
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:58,900
 because you made decisions that didn't benefit you,

704
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,860
 but benefit them.

705
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:05,220
 That's what it means to be Christ in the world.

706
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:09,060
 That's what it means to make a difference in the world.

707
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,940
 The cross of Christ brought us to where we are.

708
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,860
 Christ died for our sins.

709
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:17,380
 Christ is our example in all that we do.

710
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:20,140
 Our job now is to continue to glorify,

711
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:24,540
 to be a steward of what he has given us.

712
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,940
 Let's pray.

713
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:28,460
 Father, thank you for all that you do.

714
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,660
 Thank you for your words.

715
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,020
 Thank you for your leadership.

716
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,140
 Thank you for the cross.

717
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,500
 Thank you for your grace.

718
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:37,820
 As we remember the words that David gave to Solomon,

719
00:32:37,820 --> 00:32:41,620
 be strong, show yourself a man, walk in his ways.

720
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:44,420
 May we take those words and apply that

721
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,780
 in our life as well too.

722
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,340
 Christ we pray, amen.
