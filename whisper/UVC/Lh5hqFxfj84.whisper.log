[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   Good morning family. It's good to be with you again virtually. We're going to be back in Matthew
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:11.760]   chapter 6 this morning and continuing to talk about what Jesus is focusing on at the beginning
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:20.000]   of this passage and that is this theme of hypocrisy and how we as his followers, as subjects of the
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.920]   kingdom, as believers in Jesus should seek to avoid hypocrisy in our lives. And Jesus gives us some
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.880]   very challenging and convicting illustrations to help us see how we fall into hypocrisy.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:42.400]   And he lays out in the first half of this chapter three different illustrations and he points out
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:50.240]   how we can fall into religious hypocrisy in our giving or our good works, in our prayer,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:56.000]   and in our fasting. And so he really covers a wide range of what we would think of as our
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.160]   devotion to God and how it shows us that it has to be from a right heart, from a right motivation,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.680]   or it can become hollow and it can become something that is empty and something that is even
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.400]   full of hypocrisy, something that's pretending to be something that it's not. Last week we kind of
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.320]   just did an introduction. We looked at Matthew chapter 6 verse 1 where Jesus says, "Beware of
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.360]   practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.480]   have no reward from your Father who is in heaven." And we just kind of introduced this concept of
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.120]   hypocrisy and what it can look like in our lives. And we began to define hypocrisy in a biblical
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:43.280]   sense as the act of pretending to be something that we're not or acting as if we're something
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.200]   that we're not. We're pretty familiar with that definition. Actually the word hypocrisy that we
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.440]   use in English has roots all the way back in a Greek word that was the word for an actor or someone
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:03.840]   on stage. And so it carries that connection, that meaning of pretending or acting to be something
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.560]   that you are not. And that's a part of the word. But the other way we defined it biblically is that
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.480]   hypocrisy is when we deceive ourselves into thinking that we are meeting God's standards
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.760]   when we aren't and we can't and we don't. And hypocrisy is when we begin to think that we are
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.240]   satisfying God's standards, that we are righteous on our own, that we are right with God on our own,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.600]   that we are doing everything that we should be doing in life apart from God. And we cannot do
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.440]   that. We cannot live rightly with God apart from God's help. We've talked about that so much over
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.480]   the past few weeks that Jesus wants to live through us and that's the only way that we can
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.000]   live rightly before God is when Jesus is living through us. And when we forget that and begin to
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.680]   think it's us who are going to make ourselves right with God, that we're going to earn something or
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.360]   that we're going to be full of good works on our own, then we begin to walk in hypocrisy. We begin
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.280]   to deceive ourselves into thinking we can meet God's standard when we can't and we don't.
[00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.320]   Today we're going to continue on and look at verses two to four that kind of fill out this
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.240]   first illustration that Jesus gives us of hypocrisy. We'll read verse one again. He says,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.000]   "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.040]   then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. Thus, when you give to the needy,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.480]   sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:43.760]   may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.600]   give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, so that your giving
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:57.360]   may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you." Jesus is calling out
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:04.720]   our hypocrisy here and calling out the fact that we do so many things to be seen of others and to
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.600]   impress others. We discussed that a little bit last week that Matthew 5, 16 talks about letting
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.200]   our light shine before men. But what is the focus in that verse? It's so that others may see our
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.720]   good works and glorify our Father which is in heaven. That verse is talking about that light
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.600]   that shines. That is Jesus living through us. It's saying that as Jesus lives through us,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:33.760]   it will draw people's attention to us and it will cause them to see God and to glorify Him.
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.120]   But these verses are describing something totally different where we do what we think are good works,
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:44.000]   but they're selfishly motivated and they're selfishly focused and they ultimately put the
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.880]   focus on us. When people look at our selfish good works, they don't see Jesus, they see us. God is
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:56.800]   not glorified, we are glorified. And that's what Jesus is pointing out here when He says
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.880]   that in verse 1 that if we do things just to be seen by others, that that's not going to honor
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.000]   God. There's not going to be any reward from God. He says that in verse 2 that the hypocrites do
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.800]   things so that they'll be praised by others, so that other people will recognize them and say
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.520]   good things about them. And He says that they've received their reward, that the only reward
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.120]   they're going to get is the hollow praise of other people. And He says when you're giving,
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:30.240]   just to remove that temptation, do it in secret. Don't even let others know what you're doing to
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.240]   give away or what you're doing to care for someone else or what you're doing to share with someone
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.600]   else, because it's not about what other people see and perceive and think about you, it's about
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:46.880]   your heart before God. That's what Jesus is calling us to. We're going to be talking more and
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.760]   more about hypocrisy over the next few weeks because Jesus gives us so much time in this passage, so
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.040]   much time in this Sermon on the Mount. So as we talk about it, we're going to kind of break it
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:03.040]   out into a few different sections. And the topic that I want us to think about this week is how
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:10.640]   hypocrisy, and specifically religious hypocrisy, how maybe that has affected us and how maybe that's
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:16.400]   hurt us and how we can deal with that in our lives. So I want us to consider that today.
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:23.600]   And I think when we consider religious hypocrisy and hypocrisy that we've encountered,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.960]   maybe if we grew up in church or even if we didn't, just in some connection that we had to
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:35.200]   church or to people of faith, maybe we saw something that didn't quite line up where
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.800]   someone's words and their actions didn't agree. Maybe we saw something where someone asked us to
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.600]   live up to a standard that they weren't living up to. Or maybe we saw an even worse form of hypocrisy.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:52.080]   But the point is, those things may have hurt us, may have affected us in some way. And probably
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:57.440]   all of us have dealt with that in our heart on some level or another. And when we think about
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:04.800]   those things, we have to see that it starts with a misplaced standard. That humans, we misplace
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:12.400]   our standards of righteousness. We misplace what the source of truth in our lives is. And that can
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.520]   lead to really dangerous and disastrous consequences. You know, some people do practice a self-righteous
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.840]   and dishonest religion. And that's what the Pharisees were doing. They were practicing a
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.480]   religion that was not honoring to God. And I'm using the word religion intentionally because
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.680]   the Pharisees were not living out a relationship with God. They were practicing a ritualistic
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:38.400]   religion. And it was not honoring to God and it was self-focused and it was ultimately
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.440]   self-righteous. It was a way for them to make a distinction between themselves and others and to
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:47.920]   try to show people that they were righteous and somehow better than other people. And to try to
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.240]   earn favor with God and to try to do good works that they felt like would get them into God's
[00:07:54.240 --> 00:08:01.200]   favor and also ultimately into heaven. And that's not what Jesus calls us to in the scripture.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:08.320]   And unfortunately, a lot of people and even people in the church still try to relate to God in that
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:14.560]   same way. They try to live out a self-righteous ritualistic religion whereby they try to do a
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:19.120]   bunch of good works that they think will please God and do good works that they think will make a
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.920]   distinction between themselves and someone else and make them better than someone else and give
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:29.920]   them a sense of pride and righteousness in their goodness. And that's not what Jesus calls us to.
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:36.160]   Jesus actually tells a story about this and it's recorded in Luke chapter 18. In verse 9, it says
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:42.400]   this, "He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.760]   and treated others with content." That verse right there could be a great definition of religious
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.480]   hypocrisy. Trusting in ourselves that we're righteous and treating others with content.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.960]   Jesus goes on to say this, "Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.480]   a tax collector. The Pharisee standing by himself prayed thus, 'God, I thank you that I'm not like
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:10.880]   other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week,
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:16.640]   I give tithes of all that I get.' But the tax collector standing far off would not even lift
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:23.920]   up his eyes to heaven but beat his breast saying, 'God, be merciful to me, a sinner.' I tell you,
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:29.280]   this man went down to his house justified rather than the other. For everyone who exalts himself
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:36.160]   will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted." Jesus gives us a perfect picture
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:42.400]   of religious hypocrisy here. He gives us this picture of this man who is doing a lot of
[00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:49.840]   external good works. From the outside he seems like the perfect guy. He's praying, he's fasting,
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.600]   he's giving tithes, but it's all for his own pride. It's all for the image that he puts forward to
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.760]   other people. It's not because his heart is in a place of humble devotion to God. And then there's
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:08.480]   this other man, this tax collector. In the first century Jewish culture, the tax collectors were
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:15.040]   hated people because they were people who were cooperating with the Romans to oppress their own
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:20.880]   people. So they were some of the most hated people in the society. They were considered
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:27.280]   totally corrupt and totally bad people. Jesus is saying, 'This guy who everybody thinks of as one
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:33.920]   of the worst people in culture and in society, he is being honest before God and he's saying, 'God,
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:39.600]   I can't even lift my eyes to look at you. I know how guilty I am. I know how broken I am. I know
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:46.880]   how much I need you.' And he's crying out in humility and that God actually hears and responds
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:55.680]   to this prayer and this cry of humble brokenness instead of this show of spiritual pride and
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:02.720]   self-righteousness that the Pharisee gives. And that still happens today. There are still people
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:07.440]   in the church, and maybe we've been those people at different times, who think that we've done
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.960]   something good and we've done a few right things in our life. And whether it's our church attendance
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.600]   or whether it's something that we've been a part of, we feel like it makes us better than someone
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.840]   else and we begin to operate in a hypocritical, self-righteous way. And that's wrong. That is not
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:30.320]   what Jesus wants for us. That is a misplaced standard. God's standard of holiness is a standard
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:36.800]   that applies to our heart, not a standard that applies to our external good works. Yes, when our
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:41.200]   heart is in the right place, beautiful good works flow out of that. It's not that our works don't
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.040]   matter, but it doesn't start with our works. It starts with our heart. And as humans, we can so
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:53.760]   easily fall into a self-righteous religion where it's all about the works. It's all about keeping
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:59.840]   the law. It's all about ticking the boxes. It's all about the external things that we do and say
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:05.760]   and don't do and don't say. And that's not what Jesus is calling us to. Another area that we see
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:12.320]   our misplaced standards is sometimes there are people put forward hurtful standards, impossible
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.600]   standards that are not God's standards. And we see that in the Pharisees. Clearly, that was one of
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.760]   the things that they were very good at. And Jesus calls them out for that multiple times in the
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.320]   Gospels. They were telling people to keep certain laws and customs and rituals and traditions that
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   God never asked anyone to keep. And yet they were getting onto people for not keeping those laws or
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.680]   those customs or those traditions. And that happens today sometimes in the church. Sometimes people in
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:44.800]   the church choose to put a really strong emphasis on things that God never put an emphasis on.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:50.640]   And they call people out for maybe the way they dress or some type of other cultural influence.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.240]   They say, "Oh, you can't be a Christian and do this." Or, "You can't be a Christian and do that.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:01.360]   You can't be a Christian and listen to this music or that or whatever." And people get really caught
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:07.440]   up in these external emphasis. And they ask people to adhere to standards that are not God's
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:13.120]   standards. And that's another misplaced standard. We need to go to Scripture to find out what God
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:20.800]   says are the standards of His kingdom and not take standards from the culture around us and not allow
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:27.840]   even good and well-intentioned things in our lives to become standards that we try to enforce on
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.880]   someone else. God may call us to a standard of holiness or righteousness or to a specific
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:39.360]   action or to avoiding a specific thing in our life in order to be right with Him. But if that
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:43.920]   standard is not in the Scripture and if He didn't call everybody else to it, then we don't need to
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:48.400]   try to enforce it in other people's lives. And that's another way that we sometimes have misplaced
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:53.200]   standards in the church is trying to make people keep standards that are not God's standards.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.960]   And sometimes in the church, maybe we've experienced hurt from trying to keep an impossible
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:03.600]   standard. We talked about that a few weeks ago, Matthew 5, verse 48, where Jesus says we're to
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:08.880]   be perfect as our Father is perfect. We cannot keep that standard. And if we try to live up to
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:14.880]   that in our own strength, if we try to just be perfect and good and do everything right through
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:20.880]   trying really hard and through working at it as hard as we can, we will ultimately be disappointed
[00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:26.480]   and frustrated and crushed because we will not be able to do it. And yet some of us have done that.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.600]   And that's a part of the hypocrisy that sometimes happens in the church. People misunderstand and
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:37.040]   they forget about God's grace. Or maybe they never understand God's grace in the first place.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.880]   And they think that they're actually supposed to attain holiness through effort and through
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:49.920]   trying hard and through being something that they think they can be. And that was never what Jesus
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:54.960]   called us to. It's always been about God's grace. And Jesus made that clear in the beginning,
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.920]   that we couldn't keep that impossible standard of holiness, that it was only through Him,
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:05.040]   through His sacrifice, we can be forgiven, we can be cleansed. And as He lives through us,
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:11.440]   as we've been talking about, we can begin to live out the good works of the kingdom. And that's how
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:17.680]   the gospel works in our lives. But sometimes we forget that or we misunderstand it, and we try to
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:22.720]   live up to a standard that we cannot meet. And we get so frustrated and so hurt. Sometimes that
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:27.440]   leads to us walking away from faith or from church or from God and saying, "It's impossible.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:33.440]   It's too hard. It can't be done. I'm done with it." Jesus never asked us to live up to an impossible
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:39.920]   standard. He asked us to repent and be forgiven and let Him live through us. Sometimes our misplaced
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.960]   standards are in our understanding of God. Sometimes we're hurt because we misunderstand
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:52.160]   God. Maybe we think God is just some angry deity that is just looking to judge and condemn and
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:58.480]   hurt us. That's a misunderstanding of who God is. And obviously, that will cause us to behave in a
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:04.320]   way towards other people that is hypocritical and out of balance. Or maybe we think God is just some
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:10.080]   type of Santa Claus God that He just rewards good behavior. And if we just do the right stuff, then
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:15.600]   we get what we want in life. And He gives us the relationship we want and the job we want and the
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.200]   house we want and the financial situation we want. That's a wrong perspective of God. And if we start
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:28.000]   to believe that, even in small ways in our mind, then we fall into hurt because we say, "Wait a
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.600]   second. I did what I thought I was supposed to do. I lived out the 'good behavior,' and then I didn't
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:39.680]   get the present that I wanted. I didn't get the present I wanted for Christmas. I didn't get the
[00:16:39.680 --> 00:16:43.520]   relationship I wanted. I didn't get the job I wanted. I didn't get into the school I wanted
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:50.080]   to get into. I didn't get the house I wanted." But that's not who God is. And if we thought that was
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:56.320]   who God was or someone else told us that was who God was, if someone told us that God was just
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:01.280]   rewarding good behavior, if someone told us that God was just all about health and wealth and
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:08.640]   prosperity, if someone told us that God was just trying to give us everything we want, then that
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:14.880]   hypocrisy can hurt us. Because we could say, "Well, I thought God said my life was going to be easy.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.000]   I thought God said nothing bad would ever happen to me if I followed Him." That's not what God said.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.960]   Jesus said that He came that we would have life and have it to the full. And having life to the
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:30.880]   full sometimes means experiencing joyful blessing from the hand of God. But having life to the full
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:37.680]   sometimes also means experiencing loss and adversity and difficulty and allowing that to
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:43.360]   shape us and to grow us and to form us and to mold us. And God uses those things in our life.
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:47.600]   And so sometimes the misplaced standard is that we have gotten some weird idea of God. And maybe
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:52.720]   we got it from someone in the church, maybe from a preacher or from a leader in the church who
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.320]   said something or taught something that wasn't really true to the scripture, and it caused us
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:05.600]   to get this wrong idea about God. And that form of hypocrisy caused us to be hurt. There are so
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.000]   many different ways that we can be hurt by hypocrisy in the church, by religious hypocrisy.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.560]   Another one maybe is just spiritual abuse. Maybe there was a leader in the church that we observed
[00:18:16.560 --> 00:18:25.440]   or that we were a part of or someone that we read something that they had written or we heard some
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.640]   of their teachings online or whatever that they were just wrong and they were abusing people.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:37.200]   Maybe they were manipulating people or maybe they were using people for financial gain or
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:43.520]   something else. There are those terrible things that happen in the church. There's stories of
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.640]   sexual abuse even in the church. And those things are terrible and they're completely wrong and they
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:54.240]   totally dishonor Jesus. But they do happen. First of all, there are people in the church who don't
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.760]   actually know Jesus. They're not actually followers of Jesus. They're not subjects of
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.400]   the kingdom. The Bible talks about that, that there are wolves among the sheep. There are
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:06.880]   people in the church who aren't truly in a relationship with God. And obviously people
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.960]   like that are going to abuse people and they're going to take advantage of things and they're
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:16.400]   going to try to take money from people or manipulate people. That's going to happen.
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.320]   But there are even people in the church who are followers of Jesus but they're
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:24.560]   misunderstanding God's word or they're misinterpreting scripture in some way and
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:29.760]   that's causing them to do things that are damaging to others. Or there are people in the church who,
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:33.920]   maybe they're a follower of Jesus but they are in bondage to sin and they haven't gotten free
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:40.400]   from sin the way they should have. And because of their captivity to sin, they are taking actions
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:47.280]   that are wrong. And that happens in the church. There is hypocrisy in the church and it doesn't
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:53.920]   help us as believers to try to hide it or to try to cover up or to try to ignore it or to try to
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:58.560]   pretend it doesn't exist. That actually makes it worse. We need to be honest about it and we need
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:04.320]   to do what Jesus did and say, "Hey, this is not right. This is not the heart of the gospel for
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.720]   people to do things to be seen by others, for people to hide who they really are, for people
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:14.080]   to pretend to be something they're not, for people to stand up one day and act righteous and tell
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.640]   other people to be righteous and then turn around and do sinful or hurtful things to people. Those
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:23.600]   things are wrong and we need to be clear about that in the church. We need to call those things
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:28.720]   out. We need to lament over those things and mourn over those things and repent and turn away and
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:35.120]   turn our eyes back towards Jesus and towards following Him. Hypocrisy is so damaging and
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:42.080]   that's why Jesus is calling it out. So I want to encourage you if you've encountered hypocrisy in
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:46.800]   the church and if it's been hurtful to you, I want to encourage you. I want to say sorry. I
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.760]   want to apologize for that. I want to say as I just did that those things are real. They do happen
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:57.120]   in the church and it's wrong and it shouldn't happen and I'm sorry if that's happened to you.
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:21:03.360]   But I also want to point you towards Jesus. You know, one of the things that we can have misplaced
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.680]   when we encounter hypocrisy is misplaced expectations. Sometimes we have an expectation
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.640]   of a leader or another person in the church and we kind of put them on a pedestal because we think
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:18.640]   they're going to do everything right. We think they'll never let us down and we think they're
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:24.640]   really close to perfect. And when we do that, when we have misplaced expectations, we will at some
[00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:31.920]   point encounter disappointment. People will always fall off of those pedestals that we put them on
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.440]   and so we shouldn't do that. We should understand that even followers of Jesus who are genuine and
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:42.240]   who love God with all their heart and are seeking to follow Him, they are still human and they're
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:48.320]   still going to make mistakes too. We shouldn't put them on a pedestal. Only Jesus is perfect. Only
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:54.080]   Jesus is never going to disappoint us. Only Jesus is always going to be with us and never leave us
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:01.360]   or forsake us. Humans cannot take that place, cannot take that role that only Jesus can be in.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:07.440]   And so we shouldn't put other people on a pedestal. Another way that our misplaced expectations
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:12.800]   express ourselves is sometimes we get caught up in the hypocrisy, right? Sometimes we maybe
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:18.480]   drink some of the Kool-Aid that someone else is drinking about how righteous they are and we start
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:24.320]   to drink some of our own Kool-Aid and say, "Yeah, I'm pretty righteous too. I think I'm really
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:30.880]   getting this figured out and I think I'm really becoming a really great Christian and I'm doing a
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:36.080]   fantastic job. I know I'm doing way better than the people around me so I'm in pretty good shape."
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:43.360]   We can start to feel that way and we can misplace expectations in ourselves. And when we do that,
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   we're going to experience deep hurt and frustration because sooner or later we are going to fall off
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.240]   that pedestal and we're going to see our own brokenness and our own sin. And we can't hide it
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:00.080]   from ourselves because it's in our heart. We may hide it from someone else. We may act and pretend
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.800]   in front of others that we don't have any struggles but we know our own struggles and
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:10.640]   we'll feel ourselves falling away from God and we'll say, "I'm not who I want to be." And we'll
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.720]   be crushed by that misplaced expectation in ourselves. We were never supposed to expect
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:22.960]   ourselves or anyone else to live the perfect life. Jesus is the only one who can do that.
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:28.240]   What we should expect of ourselves and others, including leaders in the church, is to live a
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:33.280]   life that is surrendered to the rule and reign of God. To live a life that is surrendered to Jesus
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:38.480]   and to let Jesus live through them. That's what we can expect. And to be someone who is willing
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.120]   to repent when they make mistakes and who is willing to be forgiven by Christ and to be
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:48.720]   cleansed. That's what we can expect. But we should not expect ourselves to be on some pedestal of
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:55.360]   perfection because if we do, we will fall off and we'll be hurt by that fall. So how do we deal
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:03.200]   with the pain of hypocrisy? If we have been hurt in some way by self-righteous religion and we've
[00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:08.080]   experienced the pain of that, how do we deal with that? And how do we deal with that in a way that
[00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:14.160]   allows us to continue to have a soft heart towards God and a soft heart towards relationship with God
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:19.840]   and a soft heart towards God's church? I think one of the first things that we need to think about
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:28.560]   and understand is that hypocrisy often causes us to have a misplaced pain. What I mean by that
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.200]   is that sometimes we are hurt by things that happen in the church. We are hurt by things that
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:39.920]   other Christians or people who profess to be Christians may inflict on us. And we misplace
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:46.240]   that pain onto Jesus or onto God and assume that we've been hurt by God or we've been hurt by Jesus.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:52.960]   And that's simply not true. Jesus is not the source of self-righteousness and hypocrisy.
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   Jesus is not the source of our pain. Jesus loves us and desires good for us. But so often in our
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:07.520]   culture and in our own minds, we create these caricatures of Jesus where we think Jesus is
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:12.560]   something that he's not. We have an image of Jesus that's different from the reality of who Jesus is.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:20.960]   You know, in our culture, people blame Jesus and Christianity and God for basically every evil of
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:27.040]   our culture, right? People sometimes think Jesus is some type of agent of European imperialism,
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:33.200]   or they think Jesus is a source of discrimination, or that Jesus didn't care about women, or that
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:40.800]   Jesus promotes tribalism, or that Jesus promotes conflict between people groups. And people accuse
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:46.240]   Jesus of all these different things. Those are caricatures of Jesus. Those are images that are
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:52.640]   created that are not true to the reality of who Jesus is. And if we want to know the true Jesus,
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:58.640]   we need to look at the Word of God and see who Jesus actually was and what he actually said.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:06.240]   And when we do that, we see something very different from the caricatures of Jesus that
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:13.840]   we see in our culture and that sometimes exist in our mind. Jesus was not European. He was Jewish.
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:19.760]   He was from the Middle East. Jesus was not pursuing political power in any way. He was
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:25.600]   full of spiritual power and he was pursuing the healing of human hearts. Jesus deeply cared about
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:30.560]   women and elevated them to the place that God originally gave them, which is equal in worth
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:37.840]   and essence and value to men. Jesus was clear about that. Jesus actually called people out for
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:43.600]   their prejudice and their racism and their discrimination. Jesus spoke against it. Jesus,
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:49.280]   as he is in this very passage we're looking at today, called people out for their hypocrisy
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:54.400]   and their pride and the distinctions that they made between themselves and other groups of people.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:27:00.880]   Jesus called people out for their ethnocentrism. Jesus did all of these things. Jesus was not who
[00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:08.560]   we often make him out to be in our mind. And Jesus was certainly not some type of angry or unkind God
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:15.120]   that wanted to inflict pain on people or condemn them or kick them out. That's not who Jesus was.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:19.600]   But sometimes when we've experienced that in the church or we've experienced that from
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:25.680]   other people who are Christians or profess to be Christians, we think that that came from God or
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:31.920]   it came from Jesus. And that's simply not true. If we go back to the Word and examine who Jesus is,
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:38.560]   what he said, what he did, we find that he loves us and his message was one of grace, forgiveness,
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:44.720]   and calling us to live in right relationship with God, with the one who created us.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.800]   Now, yes, God has standards and those standards are clear in the Bible, but it's also clear in
[00:27:50.800 --> 00:27:55.200]   the Bible throughout the Bible, but especially in the ministry of Jesus, that those standards
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:28:02.160]   are for our own good. Those standards are not to hurt us or to restrict us. They are to protect us
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:09.120]   and to care for us. Jesus is the good shepherd. He is caring for us and he loves us. And it's clear
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:16.160]   throughout the ministry of Jesus that the grace of Jesus is the only hope that we have for meeting
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:22.320]   God's standard. We are never supposed to try to be perfect and work it out and try hard enough and do
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:30.080]   it all on our own. That was never the emphasis. We are supposed to come to Jesus in humility and say,
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:35.680]   "God, I can't do this. I ask you to forgive me. I ask you to cleanse me. I ask you to live through
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.960]   me and make me into something better than what I am." That's the design from the very beginning.
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:46.240]   That's the gospel. We were never supposed to turn into some self-righteous super person who's better
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:52.000]   than someone else. That's a caricature that we've made in our own minds. John 1 is clear that Jesus
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:59.200]   is full of grace and truth. And I love that about Jesus. Jesus never lied to us and told us we were
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:05.360]   any better off than we actually are, but he also never offered anything less than complete redemption
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:11.920]   and restoration to a perfect relationship with our Father in heaven. That's who Jesus is. He always
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:18.320]   loves. He always cares. He always heals. And so if you've experienced hurt and you felt like maybe
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:24.400]   that was coming from God, it wasn't. If you felt like that was coming from Jesus, it wasn't. Jesus
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.520]   cares for you. He wants to heal you and he loves you. So I would encourage you, if you have
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.960]   experienced that hurt, to understand that that wasn't coming from God. It was probably coming
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:40.480]   from an imperfect person who inflicted that hurt on you, probably because of some hurt in their own
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:45.840]   life. Or maybe because they completely misunderstood God's grace. Or maybe they completely
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:52.240]   misinterpreted God's truth in the scripture. And their own confusion, their own hurt, and their own
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:59.040]   pain caused them to communicate something to you that simply wasn't true. That did not come from
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:05.680]   God. And then I would encourage you also to seek to practice forgiveness. Forgiveness is a totally
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:10.960]   radical kingdom value that Jesus taught us. And if you've experienced hurt because of hypocrisy,
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.280]   it can be really hard to forgive someone who has been a hypocrite, who has pretended to be
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.200]   something that they're not, and pretended that they were better than someone else. That can be
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:25.200]   really hard to forgive. But that's what Jesus calls us to. Jesus calls us away from the old
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:32.320]   human way of vengeance and getting people back, and calls us to forgiveness and to love. And so
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:37.280]   I would encourage you to seek that. Even if you've experienced something difficult, like spiritual
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:42.640]   abuse in some way, or some other type of abuse at the hand of a hypocritical person, that's
[00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:47.920]   something that you can seek forgiveness for. You may need to do some counseling and deal with that,
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:53.040]   especially if it was something serious. And there may be consequences of that. Maybe that
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:57.040]   relationship with that person will never be repaired. Or maybe that person, if it was serious
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:02.080]   enough, may actually suffer other consequences in some way. Some people have to actually suffer
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:08.320]   legal and civic consequences because of the wrong things that they've done. But that doesn't mean
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:13.760]   that you can't forgive someone. And that's what Jesus calls us to. To understand that that pain
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:20.000]   was not inflicted by God. It was not inflicted by Jesus. And that even the person who inflicted that
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.240]   pain was full of their own brokenness and their own sin. And we need to forgive. And that can be a
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:33.600]   difficult thing. It can be hard for us to do, but it gives us freedom as we forgive hypocrisy in
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:41.360]   others. Let's pray. God, thank you that you are so honest with us about our brokenness as humans.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:48.320]   And God, I pray for anyone who has been hurt by hypocrisy in the church, God. God, I pray that
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:55.440]   you would help us not to ignore it or to act like it didn't happen or to try to explain it away. God,
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:01.360]   help us to be honest about how wrong it is and how devastating it can be. And God, if we've been
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:06.160]   hurt by it, God, I pray that you would help us to see that that did not come from you. It came from
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:14.800]   another human who was hurt and broken in their own life. And God, help us to not place that pain on
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:20.960]   you and understand that you love us and you want healing for us. God, help us to take that pain to
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:28.080]   you. It is real pain. Help us to take it to you and let you heal and restore in our heart. And God,
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.840]   help us to find forgiveness. Give us the power to forgive. Even if someone has hurt us deeply,
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:39.600]   God, even if there are consequences of that hurt that may not change, help us to forgive
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:48.800]   and be free of that load of bitterness or hurt or frustration or pain that we carry around. God,
[00:32:48.800 --> 00:32:55.760]   God, I pray that you would help us to more and more move away from pretending to be something
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:00.960]   we're not, pretending that we meet your standards when we don't, and move towards a place of
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:07.040]   honesty over our own brokenness, our own need for you. Move us towards a place of poverty of spirit
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:12.400]   where there is no hypocrisy in us, where we are transparent and open and honest, and where we let
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:19.280]   you live through us in a way that shares your love and your grace with the people around us.
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:21.440]   In Jesus name, Amen.
