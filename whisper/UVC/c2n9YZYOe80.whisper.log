[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.520]   Alright family, we are back and we are once again in Matthew chapter 6.
[00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:11.680]   Continue to look at this kingdom values study that we've been going through for a while.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:16.680]   Looking at the values of the kingdom of heaven that Jesus wants us, if we are his disciples,
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.760]   his followers, if we are subjects of the kingdom, then he wants us to live out these values.
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.960]   In the past few weeks we've been talking about hypocrisy and how Jesus in the first part
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.640]   of Matthew 6 is calling us to avoid hypocrisy.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.520]   He's pointing out how damaging and devastating it is in our lives.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.920]   He's also pointing out a little bit just how silly and foolish it can be for us to live
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.760]   as hypocrites and yet it's clearly something that all of us as humans do.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.700]   And as we talked about a few weeks ago, as humans we're all experts at it.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.160]   We all are hypocrites.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.320]   That hypocrisy can also easily come into our life as followers of Jesus.
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.360]   It can easily come into our faith and when it does it can have absolutely devastating
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.660]   consequences.
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.520]   And last week we talked some about that.
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.720]   How if maybe we've been hurt by hypocrisy in the church, maybe we've been hurt by someone
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.960]   else who treated us with hypocrisy or someone who lived hypocrisy in front of us and maybe
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.720]   it damaged our faith in Jesus or maybe it just hurt us in some way.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.800]   We talked about ways that we can get past that.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.840]   We can redirect our focus back to Jesus and we can begin to experience forgiveness even
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.560]   for those who have hurt us.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.920]   We can begin to take those misplaced standards and misplaced expectations and misplaced pain.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.600]   We can see that Jesus is not the source of our pain.
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.560]   Jesus is not the source of hypocrisy or self-righteousness.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.000]   That's never something that Jesus called his people to live out.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.560]   Jesus wants us to live out the opposite.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:56.520]   He wants us to live out authenticity and transparency and honesty and love for one another.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.400]   And we can learn to walk in forgiveness.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.660]   And this week we're going to talk about something that's probably going to be a little bit more
[00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.880]   convicting for us, a little bit more challenging.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.360]   It's going to hit a little bit closer to home for us and that is the hypocrisy that we exhibit
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.160]   in our own lives.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.120]   Last week we were more talking about hypocrisy that someone else has exhibited and how that
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.360]   might have affected us.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.240]   But this week we're going to focus on our own hypocrisy and how we live it out and how
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:27.680]   we are dishonest about the fact that we're living it out and how much it hurts us and
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.320]   hurts the people around us.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.160]   So let's jump into this here.
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.800]   We're looking specifically at verses five and six of Matthew chapter six today, but
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.200]   we're going to go ahead and read the first four verses as well just to give us kind of
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.560]   a big picture of what Jesus is saying here.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.680]   So it says this, "Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.320]   to be seen by them.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.000]   For then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you as the hypocrites do, in
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.120]   the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others.
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.320]   Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.800]   But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:14.280]   doing, so that your giving may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.360]   you.
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.480]   And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.360]   in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:29.440]   Truly I say to you, they have received their reward.
[00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.840]   But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.920]   secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.600]   Now as we've discussed hypocrisy the last few weeks, we've kind of defined it out of
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   this passage.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.880]   And we've defined it in a few ways.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.520]   We've defined it as pretending to be something we're not, or acting as if we are something
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.880]   that we're not.
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.040]   And we've defined it as deceiving ourselves or others into thinking that we can meet God's
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:03.400]   standard of holiness, that we can be who God wants us to be, when we can't meet that standard
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   and we don't.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.680]   Not on our own, not without Christ.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.880]   With Christ living through us, we can, because Jesus lived the perfect life.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:11.880]   But on our own, we can't.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.360]   And when we deceive ourselves into thinking we can, that's hypocrisy.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:20.640]   And then another great definition of hypocrisy that we pull straight out of scripture is
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.320]   from Luke chapter 18, verse 9.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.020]   And this is Jesus telling a parable, and it says, "He also told this parable to some who
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.960]   trusted in themselves that they were righteous and treated others with content."
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.760]   And I think that's a great definition of hypocrisy as well.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.440]   Trusting in ourselves that we're righteous and treating others with content.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.040]   And we've also defined it as putting the spotlight on us, wanting to glorify ourselves instead
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.040]   of glorifying God.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.140]   We talked about the distinction between Matthew 5, 16, where Jesus tells us to let our light
[00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:57.200]   shine before men so that they will see our good works and glorify our Father in heaven.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:03.440]   And then here in Matthew 6, 1, where he says that don't do things to be seen by others.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.920]   God doesn't want us to do things to glorify ourselves, to put the focus on us.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:13.560]   He wants us to do things to glorify him and put the focus on him so that people will see
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.040]   him, so that Jesus will be seen through our lives and that God will be glorified and people
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:21.680]   will be drawn to Christ.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.360]   And today I want us to think about a few different aspects of what we're actually doing when
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:31.360]   we live dishonestly, when we pretend that we're something that we're not, when we pretend
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.600]   to be more righteous than we are, when we pretend that we're the ones who are going
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.080]   to fulfill God's standard.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:41.400]   When we do that, we're living out hypocrisy.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.400]   But sometimes we think it may not be that big of a deal.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.140]   It's okay if people think I'm a little bit better than I am.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.100]   And we don't see how serious that can be in our life.
[00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.320]   We don't see what's actually at the root of it and what's actually taking place.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.520]   So we're going to talk about that today.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:03.080]   And the first thing I want us to see is that when we live out hypocrisy, there is a matter
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.360]   of stolen glory involved.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.560]   Stolen glory.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.600]   Because we know if we understand the scripture that all glory belongs to God.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.000]   God is the creator.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.440]   God is the redeemer.
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.280]   God is the one who loves us and gave himself for us.
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.200]   That's what the scripture tells us.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.560]   The glory belongs to him.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:29.480]   And yet we as humans have a desire to steal some of that glory for ourselves.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.720]   We want the focus to be on us.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:33.860]   We want the attention to be on us.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.320]   We want to glorify ourselves.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.320]   That's our pride.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.200]   We talked about that the first week that we spoke about hypocrisy.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.860]   How pride is the root of our hypocrisy.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.280]   And that pride causes us to want to steal some of God's glory and redirect it at ourselves.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.760]   And that was the sin of the devil in the beginning.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:58.880]   Remember he wanted to be like the most high and that's why he rebelled against God.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.300]   That's what he tempted Adam and Eve with in the garden.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:06.880]   He said, "Hey, don't you want to be like God and know good and evil?"
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:12.160]   And that's a core temptation for us in our life every day.
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.800]   And it's certainly the root of hypocrisy is that temptation to say, "I want to be like
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.800]   God.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:19.440]   I want to be the center of attention.
[00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.400]   I want to steal some of His glory.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.960]   I want to be full of pride and focus everything on myself."
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:32.640]   And that's what we're doing when we begin to live in a way where we're pretending to
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.000]   be something that we're not.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.900]   We're stealing the glory that belongs to God and trying to direct it on ourselves.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:45.280]   We see this in this verse here where Jesus says that the hypocrites love to stand and
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:51.040]   pray in the synagogues and at the street corners that they may be seen by others.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:54.360]   And all of us have that in us.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.120]   We want to do our good works.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.040]   We want to do things to be seen by others.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.240]   We want others to see what we're doing.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:04.880]   We want to do it in front of others.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.760]   We want to do it before others so that they will see us and regard us as good and regard
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.840]   us as special, regard us as righteous, and in some way glorify us.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.400]   That's what we want.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.240]   That's at the root of our hypocrisy.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:23.360]   We want to do those things before others.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.000]   Now some of us may say, "Well, I don't do that."
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.120]   You know, the examples that Jesus gives us here are pretty over the top, right?
[00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:35.640]   When He talks about someone giving to the needy, He says that they're sounding a trumpet
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:41.320]   in the street to draw attention to themselves so everybody will see it and to amplify what
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.320]   they're doing.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.400]   When He talks about people praying, He says they're standing and praying on the street
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:49.240]   corner loudly so that everybody will look.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.600]   We may say, "Okay, wait a second.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   I don't do that.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.360]   You know, when I help someone out, I don't sound a trumpet.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:59.000]   I don't go out and pray in the middle of the street so that people will see what I'm doing."
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.880]   But Jesus is pointing out not just the specific situation.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.040]   He's pointing out the heart behind it.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:07.560]   And we definitely share that heart behind it.
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.560]   I mean, let's be honest.
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:13.360]   Probably none of us have ever gone out and sounded a trumpet before we did something
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.000]   to help someone else.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.880]   But I can't think of very many ways at all to more powerfully and visibly focus attention
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:26.040]   on ourselves than to use some of our modern technology, right?
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:27.200]   And we do it.
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.020]   We go out to serve.
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:34.480]   We go out to help at the soup kitchen or the shelter or this place or that place.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:41.840]   And we use our social media or some other form of technology to let everybody know what
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:43.000]   we're doing.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.320]   That's really the modern equivalent of sounding the trumpet, right?
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:52.080]   And again, I'm not saying that it's wrong for us to let other people see our good works.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:56.640]   Matthew 5:16 says we should let others see our good works, but they should see it in
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.960]   such a way that the glory is focused on God.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.720]   So I'm not saying it's wrong for you to take a picture of something you're doing and share
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   it with other people.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:05.160]   That's fine.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:10.760]   But if your heart motivation in doing that is to focus people on yourselves, to glorify
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.960]   yourself, then you're sounding a trumpet.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.440]   You're doing it in order to glorify yourself.
[00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.640]   And that is wrong.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.440]   That's what Jesus calls out in this passage.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:26.320]   And we see this replete throughout our culture and our society.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.320]   Think about it.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.520]   The celebrities, all of the politicians, all of the people in our culture and society,
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:34.880]   that they won't even show up to help.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.720]   They won't even do something unless the cameras are going to be there.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:41.720]   If it's not a photo op, then to them it never even happened.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.840]   It's not worth doing if no one's going to know about it.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.160]   And sometimes we live that way ourselves.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:52.440]   We think, "Well, yeah, I kind of want to be a part of this, but I'm so busy.
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:56.240]   Oh, but someone else is going to be there and they're going to see me doing it.
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:58.360]   Yeah, that makes it a lot more appealing to me."
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:01.600]   Or, "I'll have an opportunity to share it with other people and they'll know what I'm
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.600]   doing."
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.680]   Yeah, that makes it a bigger deal.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:06.560]   And that shouldn't make it a bigger deal.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:11.600]   We should be committed to doing the right and to living in obedience to God and to living
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:15.960]   out what God wants us to do, whether or not it gets noticed by anybody.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.320]   And we should be committed to the fact that if it does get noticed by someone, we should
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.080]   direct that attention towards God, not towards ourself.
[00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:30.600]   But that's a difficult thing to do because we all want to do our good works before others.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.040]   Now some of us might say, "Well, wait a second.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.320]   I'm not even sure that I even try to do good works.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:40.520]   I don't even know what that means or what that is or that I'm even interested in that."
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.640]   Now we've talked about this in the past few weeks, that as believers, as followers of
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.720]   Jesus, as subjects of the kingdom, that God is interested in the condition of our heart.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:51.400]   We don't do good works to earn favor with God.
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.360]   We don't do good works to please God.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.640]   We don't do good works to get to heaven.
[00:11:55.640 --> 00:11:56.780]   None of that.
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:11:59.600]   We do good works because God is changing our heart.
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.560]   If we really have relationship with God through Jesus, God is at work changing our heart.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.120]   And out of that change, out of that transformation, good works come and beautiful good works come.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:13.040]   But the good works are not the starting point.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.280]   God's change in our heart is the starting point.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.400]   And the good works flow from that.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:19.200]   They come from that.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.320]   But some people may say, "Well, I'm not interested in good works.
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.200]   I'm not interested in trying to be a good person.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.040]   I'm not out there trying to please anybody.
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.600]   I'm just doing my own thing and I don't even care what people say about it."
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.360]   And that sounds good for a moment.
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.880]   It might sound like, "Okay, yeah, I mean, that kind of gets rid of some of the hypocrisy
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.320]   and pride, right?
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   If you don't care, then you're not going to be a hypocrite."
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.440]   But that's not even really true.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:46.800]   The reality is all of us have some standard of morality that we live by.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.960]   We all have some things that we think are good as opposed to other things that we think
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.520]   are bad.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:57.440]   Even if you say, "Okay, I'm an anarchist, so I don't think there should be any rules
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:01.880]   about what's good in society and I don't think there should be anything that should be a
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.800]   good work in society."
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:09.760]   Well, the reality is you have in that position defined a good work, right?
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:13.840]   Because you said that it's good to have no rules and that that's what's best.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:19.400]   And that if you do try to have rules in society and enforce those rules on other people, then
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.400]   that's bad.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:25.200]   So if you've, from your position, defined a good work and a bad work, even if you say
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.560]   that you're an anarchist and you don't care and you don't want any rules and you want
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.800]   chaos, you still believe that some things are good and some things are bad.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.000]   All of us do.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.600]   So we can't hide behind the fact that we may say, "Well, I'm not as interested in religion
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.880]   or I'm not really caught up in Jesus and so I don't really care, so I'm not a hypocrite."
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.680]   That's actually not true.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:53.080]   All of us have some system of morality, some things that we think are good and some things
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.000]   that we think are not good.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.400]   And the reality is whatever that system is for whoever you're talking about, all of us
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:05.120]   as humans want to do the things that we define as good in front of other people so they will
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:07.380]   see them and praise us.
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:12.700]   Even the anarchist wants to go out and create anarchy for other people to see so that other
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:15.000]   people can praise what they're doing.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.040]   All of us do that as humans.
[00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:19.560]   All of us live in hypocrisy in that way.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.640]   We want to steal God's glory and direct it to ourselves.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:31.060]   Another way we really see our hypocrisy in stealing God's glory is in this human nature
[00:14:31.060 --> 00:14:36.040]   of always seeing the problem in someone else and not seeing our own issues.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.640]   We always excuse ourselves and our sin and our injustice and we see the problems of others.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:45.080]   Jesus talks about this later in the Sermon on the Mount when he talks about the fact
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:51.140]   that we as humans see the little specks of dust in someone else's eye and overlook the
[00:14:51.140 --> 00:14:54.640]   giant log that's in our own eye.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:57.200]   And he makes that illustration for us.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.480]   But we do that all the time.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:00.120]   We say, "Oh, not me.
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.240]   I would never do that.
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.720]   I would never be a hypocrite.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:05.360]   I would never do good works in front of others.
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.000]   I would never sound a trumpet.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.800]   That's just not me at all."
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.800]   And yet we turn around and see what everyone else is doing and point out what they're doing
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.920]   and get frustrated about what they're doing.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:21.040]   We see this so much in our culture all the time.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:26.840]   You know, right now we're just weeks away from a big election and this is so heavy in
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.560]   our politics.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.360]   Hypocrisy is so heavy in our politics.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.760]   It's so heavy right now that you could literally cut it with a knife.
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:37.880]   It's so thick in the air.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:41.440]   Every other commercial on TV is a political commercial.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:47.200]   And if we use our definition from Luke 18, 9 where Jesus says that hypocrites are those
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:51.120]   who trust in themselves that they're righteous and treat others with contempt, man, that
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:56.340]   would be a great definition of every single political commercial we see.
[00:15:56.340 --> 00:16:02.780]   Every commercial you see is a candidate demonstrating by their words and the pictures of themselves
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:08.480]   why they are righteous and why the person they're running against is contemptible.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.320]   And that's exactly what our politics is full of.
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:14.080]   And our politics is full of this "not me" attitude.
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.840]   The reality is throughout our politics in both parties there are things that are deeply
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.800]   dishonoring to God.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:25.800]   And yet both parties are full of people who are convinced that they are completely righteous
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:29.200]   and that all the hypocrites and all the sinners are in the other party.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.200]   And that's how everybody acts.
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:33.400]   But the reality is it's not just in our politics.
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.180]   That's how we all act as human anyway.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.300]   We are all convinced that the problem is with everybody else.
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:41.300]   It's not me.
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.280]   I'm doing right over here, God.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:44.780]   It's not me.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:48.960]   Because we have stolen God's glory and we have said, "You know what?
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.000]   I'm doing it right.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I'm getting it right.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.080]   I'm being obedient.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   I'm righteous."
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.960]   It's all those other people who are deserving of guilt or shame or punishment or something
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:16:59.960]   like that.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.080]   But I'm the good person over here.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:04.580]   We've stolen God's glory.
[00:17:04.580 --> 00:17:09.120]   The other thing that we steal in our hypocrisy is we want to steal God's throne.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:10.580]   We want to steal God's rule.
[00:17:10.580 --> 00:17:12.720]   We want to steal God's control.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.600]   We want to take control of our image.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:17.840]   We want to take control of how other people perceive us.
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:21.720]   We don't want to admit that we could have a weakness or a failing in any way.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:25.660]   We don't want anyone to think or imagine that we could ever have a problem.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.700]   So we try to hide it.
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:28.480]   We try to pretend we're something that we're not.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.760]   We practice hypocrisy because we're trying to control our image.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:36.320]   We're trying to steal God's rulership, God's throne.
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:42.680]   We try to control our success and not by defining success in the way that God has defined it,
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:48.740]   but defining it according to our own definition, which is how other people view us, how much
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.000]   we can accomplish and achieve here on the earth in this life.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.580]   And we try to control our success by controlling what other people see of us.
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.940]   We try to make sure that we're successful because we give this tightly controlled image
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:06.880]   and perception of ourselves to other people.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.080]   And we are taking away God's control over our life that rightly belongs to God.
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:17.100]   We try to control our righteousness and we do that by trying to redefine what is actually
[00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.100]   right and wrong.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:21.600]   Like I said earlier, everybody has a standard of morality.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.200]   The only distinction is where that standard comes from.
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.800]   Now Christians are unique because our standard comes from beyond ourselves.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.280]   It doesn't come from within us.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.040]   It comes from God's Word.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:34.120]   It comes from God Himself.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.520]   That's our standard of morality.
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:40.880]   And Christians also are unique because we understand that we can't live up to God's
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:46.160]   standard, that we all fall short and only through Christ can we achieve rightness with
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.280]   God.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.440]   But for most people, their standard of morality comes from within themselves.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.880]   They want to be in control of what righteousness is.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.720]   They want to be in control of what right and wrong is.
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.640]   And they try to do that by defining it for themselves.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:02.920]   And they're stealing that throne from God.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.440]   God is the one who says what is right and wrong.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.000]   God is the one who defines righteousness, not us.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.640]   We try to define those standards for ourselves and as we do that, we are stealing away the
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.720]   authority that only belongs to God.
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:21.160]   The other thing that we try to steal is our destiny.
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.440]   The reality is that Jesus is the only way to God.
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:30.200]   The reality is that the grace of Jesus Christ is the only way to satisfy God's standards.
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:33.240]   Those things are so clear in the Bible.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.440]   There is no other way that we can have relationship with God except through Jesus.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:42.740]   There's no other way that we can achieve holiness and that we can be right except through Jesus
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:43.740]   Christ.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.880]   And we don't achieve that holiness through our good works.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:51.680]   We achieve it when we surrender to Christ and His righteousness washes over us and covers
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:52.680]   us.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:58.360]   And there's no other way apart from that for us to be righteous and to be right with God.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.080]   And yet we don't want that to be true.
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:03.560]   We don't want Jesus to be the only way to God.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.760]   We want to make a way on our own.
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:10.080]   We don't want to believe that we might have to rely on the sacrifice and forgiveness of
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.660]   Jesus for righteousness.
[00:20:11.660 --> 00:20:16.440]   We want to somehow prove ourselves righteous apart from God.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.560]   And as we do that, we try to take control of our eternal destiny in a way that we cannot
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.200]   because it only belongs to God.
[00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.940]   Jesus is the only Redeemer.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:34.200]   And Jesus is the only way for us to experience health and shalom and healing in this world.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.120]   And yet we try every other way.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.520]   And we try to fix things in every other way.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:45.080]   And it doesn't work, but we keep trying and keep wanting to pull destiny away from God
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.880]   and the future of what it means to be human.
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:52.080]   We want to pull that away from God and define it ourselves.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:54.720]   And we keep failing.
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:00.760]   You know, Jesus in Matthew 5 and 6 and 7 throughout the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus is giving us
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:06.360]   this new way to be human, this way of love, this way to love God and love those around
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.360]   us.
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:09.800]   And it's really a new way because it's been around since the beginning.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:13.960]   It's the old way that God called us to in the beginning that we never lived out.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.280]   And so it seemed like a new way when Jesus was expressing it in Matthew 5.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:24.360]   It seemed like a new way because what people had been living out was their own way.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.160]   And that way was the way of vengeance and retribution.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.120]   Ever since Cain, the first siblings, Cain and Abel, Cain decided, "You know what?
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:37.840]   The way to fix my problems is to take revenge on my brother, is to get him out of the way,
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.440]   is to make him hurt.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.160]   And that's what's going to fix things."
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.800]   And ever since then, that has been the cycle of humanity.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.880]   People have tried to fix problems with revenge, with retribution, with war, with fighting,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:53.580]   with violence, with oppression, and with hurt.
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:56.760]   And when someone hurts someone else, people say, "Well, the way to fix that is to hurt
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:57.760]   them right back."
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.720]   That's been the story of humanity since the beginning of time.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.600]   That's what we as humans have chosen again and again and again.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.200]   And Jesus has said clearly in the Sermon on the Mount, "No, there's another way.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:15.360]   I want you to choose the way of love, the way of peace, the way of relationship with
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.120]   God, the way of caring for one another."
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.280]   Jesus is calling us to that.
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.480]   But we don't want that destiny for ourselves.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:28.020]   We say, "No, God, I want to go back to my way, which is revenge, retribution, getting
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.020]   even.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:32.120]   It's taking my revenge on someone else."
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:37.280]   We try to steal destiny, and we don't have that authority.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.700]   And when we try to do that, it ends in disaster every time.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:46.540]   And sadly, even though we've seen it end in disaster a thousand times before, we still
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.840]   think we're going to try it one more time, and this time it'll actually work, and it'll
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.800]   actually come out right, and it'll actually make us feel better.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.200]   And then it doesn't.
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.440]   But we still try it again, and we turn back to it again and again.
[00:22:58.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   We want to pull destiny away from God and try to pull it down to ourselves and think
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.160]   that we're going to fix our lives, we're going to fix our future, we're going to fix the
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.280]   world, we're going to fix everything.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.280]   And we can't.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:17.920]   Now, what Jesus is pointing out to us in this passage is that hypocrisy is so damaging,
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:20.280]   it's so devastating, it's so wrong.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:25.240]   It's ultimately, as we discussed today, a direct attack on God's authority and on who
[00:23:25.240 --> 00:23:26.800]   God is.
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:32.200]   It's trying to steal from God, and that is completely wrong.
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:38.180]   And what Jesus is pointing us towards is the fact that we have got to avoid it as subjects
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:43.720]   of the kingdom, as followers of Jesus, because it is a powerful and constant temptation to
[00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:48.300]   us as human beings, and we've got to strive to avoid it.
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:54.080]   So I want us to think about how we can avoid it as we close out today, how we can avoid
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:55.080]   these things.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:59.460]   We've talked before about the best way that we can avoid pride is by living in a place
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:04.900]   of poverty of spirit, living in a place of seeing and admitting our own spiritual bankruptcy
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:10.680]   before God, seeing and admitting our need for God and saying, "God, I understand that
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:17.400]   I am broken, that I am full of sin in my heart, that I'm full of selfishness, that if I just
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:23.200]   had my own way, I would be hurting other people, I would be trying to glorify myself, I would
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:25.480]   be trying to do all this stuff."
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:30.240]   And when we're able to be honest and transparent before God and see our own brokenness, our
[00:24:30.240 --> 00:24:36.840]   own need, then that gets rid of that pride and it gets rid of that hypocrisy.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:42.280]   We've got to do what Jesus suggests in this passage, which is to hide our good works.
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:47.000]   That's actually a really good thing to do, is as much as possible, and this isn't like
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.960]   a law, you don't need to try to make it into some hard and fast rule that you have to follow
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:58.320]   in every instance, but as much as possible, when you go out to obey God, just do it in
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.680]   a way that other people aren't going to see or aren't going to notice, so that that temptation
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:05.920]   to glorify yourself doesn't take hold.
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.720]   When you go out to obey God, you should go out to obey God with the motivation of pleasing
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:12.920]   God and God alone.
[00:25:12.920 --> 00:25:17.000]   You should go out to obey God because it's the right thing to do.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.800]   You should obey God in your life, whether it's in the privacy of your home or whether
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:24.600]   it's serving in your community in some way, you should do that because it's the right
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.240]   thing to do because you want to love God, you want to love others, you want to glorify
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.240]   God.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:32.920]   Don't do it because other people are going to see it and notice it.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:35.280]   As much as you can, do it in secret.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:37.560]   Do it so that other people don't know.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:41.800]   If you're going to go serve in your community, maybe you don't need to take all those pictures
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.360]   and post them online.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:47.520]   Again, that doesn't mean it's wrong to do that, but just think about that.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:53.680]   Just ask yourself, "Hey, can I do this in a way that the focus is not on me?"
[00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.520]   If someone does notice what you're doing, if someone does notice you serving and obeying
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:02.080]   God, then direct that attention towards God.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.440]   Don't let people just say, "Oh, you're a great person.
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.320]   You do such a great job."
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:10.380]   That feels good and there's a part of us that is like, "Yeah, it doesn't really hurt for
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:16.480]   someone to glorify me a little bit, for me to get a little praise, but hey, it's going
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:19.040]   to be damaging to you and to them.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.040]   It's damaging for others to glorify us and to think we're something we're not, and it's
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   really damaging for us to think we're something we're not."
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:31.200]   So when you get a little bit of that praise, redirect it to God and be honest and say,
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.760]   "Hey, I'm just as broken as anybody else.
[00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.280]   I'm only here doing this because of God's work in my life.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:38.280]   It's not me.
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:39.280]   I'm not a great person.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.280]   Don't glorify me.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:42.360]   It's because of God."
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.720]   Redirect that praise to Him.
[00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:46.440]   Don't steal God's glory.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.920]   Don't steal God's throne.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:51.760]   Don't try to steal God's control or God's rule in your life.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.360]   Don't try to steal the destiny that God has for you.
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.400]   Don't try to redirect it into your own will.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:02.120]   Remember Jesus, here in just a few verses, He gives us the Lord's Prayer.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.040]   What does He pray at the end of the Lord's Prayer?
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.240]   "Father, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.400]   Don't try to make that into, "My kingdom come and my will be done."
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:16.800]   That's dangerous and that has devastating consequences.
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.760]   Don't steal the control of destiny from God.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.040]   That belongs to God and God alone.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.720]   The throne belongs to God and God alone.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.200]   Glory belongs to God and God alone.
[00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:33.360]   If we will do these things, if we will seek to live in poverty of spirit, if we'll seek
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:40.720]   to take our hands off of God's glory and God's throne and the destiny that God has for us
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:45.760]   and let God be in control of those things, if we'll be honest and transparent about our
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.480]   own weaknesses and our own struggles and our own failings with the people around us, we
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:54.160]   will find ourselves living in a much more authentic way.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.240]   We will find ourselves with very little hypocrisy in our life.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.480]   And that's what Jesus is calling us to in this passage.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:02.480]   Let's pray.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.160]   God, I pray that you would give us poverty of spirit.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:12.520]   You would help us to be aware of our own need for you, to be aware of our spiritual bankruptcy,
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:17.160]   the fact that we have nothing before you, the fact that we can't do anything on our
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:18.480]   own apart from you.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:23.720]   God, I pray that you would help us to be honest about our own sins and our own struggles.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.300]   Help us to be honest with the people around us.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:30.680]   Help us not to cover things up or to hide things, but help us to be able to be honest
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.520]   and say, "Hey, I struggle as well.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:33.680]   I'm imperfect as well.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   I've messed up too.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.600]   But I need to repent too.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.320]   I need God's help in my life."
[00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.800]   Help us to be honest and transparent with our struggles, God.
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:46.960]   Help us not to operate from a place of pride, but from a place of authenticity, God.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.880]   God, help us not to steal any of your glory.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:55.520]   Help us not to redirect any of the glory that should go to you towards us, God.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:00.240]   Help us to always point to you and always live in a place of humility.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:04.380]   God, help us not to steal your throne, your control, God.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:08.520]   Help us not to grab that and try to act like we are going to be in charge when we cannot
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   be in charge.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:13.120]   What a disaster that would be if we were in charge, God.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:19.640]   God, help us not to steal the destiny that you have for us and our world and try to think
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.200]   that we should direct that.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:23.720]   Help us not to think that our will should be done.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.240]   Help us to always desire for your will to be done, God.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:31.000]   Help us not to put ourselves in a place that we should not be in.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.040]   Help us not to pretend to be something we're not.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:37.320]   Help us not to think we are righteous and treat others with contempt.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:43.800]   God, help us to avoid hypocrisy and to live honestly and openly as your disciples in a
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:50.000]   way that glorifies you, God, and that causes people to see you and to desire you and to
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.560]   want to know more of who you are because of what they see in our lives, God.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:30:00.720]   May you be glorified by the testimony of our lives, and may people see more and more of
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.800]   you in us. In Jesus name, Amen.
