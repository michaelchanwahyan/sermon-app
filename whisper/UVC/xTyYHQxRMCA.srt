1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
 Yeah, do let me know if you're interested,

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:05,680
 join the retreat and it's gonna be a fun time

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,360
 and if there are enough people going,

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:10,920
 we're gonna make this happen, okay?

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,960
 Why don't we say hi to your neighbors, okay?

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,480
 Just say hi, you know, yeah.

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,300
 Say good morning and welcome,

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:21,560
 some of those friends in our midst.

9
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,800
 We continue with our series on worship

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,000
 and we learn how to be better worshiper.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 And this pretty long series, this is part seven already.

12
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,520
 And remember the list of things that I present to you

13
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:42,560
 from the Bible, if we try to summarize

14
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,800
 what worship is all about and all the elements

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,420
 or aspects of worship.

16
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:52,160
 This list, by the way, is not an exhaustive list

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,840
 of things we do in worship

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,400
 and should not be used mechanically

19
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,320
 because the Bible lays down general principle,

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,240
 basic principles for us to practice our worship together,

21
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,660
 but not the details.

22
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,080
 And so often the details are dictated

23
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,580
 by the local community or local faith, family,

24
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:13,960
 churches or even generation.

25
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,320
 But we need to learn how to become a better worshiper

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,640
 and that is a central question for the entire series.

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,960
 And let me ask you this question,

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,240
 are you becoming a better worshiper?

29
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,040
 Are you becoming a better worshiper?

30
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:33,760
 Week after week, you know, Sunday is our Shabbat, right?

31
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:38,360
 Sunday is kind of our big day and the first day of the week.

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:42,200
 We come to give God our worship and our offering.

33
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,960
 And are we becoming better worshiper?

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,400
 And that's the central question we need to ask ourselves.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,040
 And today we need to learn how to sing songs, okay?

36
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,760
 How to understand songs.

37
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,760
 There are so many elements we can add

38
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,440
 to the list of worship here.

39
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:59,400
 However, I think the main thing,

40
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,680
 there's a main element that we cannot miss

41
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,800
 in our weekly worship, in our Sunday worship

42
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:10,280
 is the songs, the poems, the lyrics,

43
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,280
 the hymns that we use to sing to God

44
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,520
 and to offer our worship together.

45
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,680
 And let me tell you my personal story.

46
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,960
 I'm quite surprised that many churches today,

47
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,640
 or at least some of the churches,

48
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,680
 you know, a good number of churches

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,240
 are still struggling with using old hymns

50
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,000
 and new praise songs, right?

51
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,880
 And many churches are still debating this issue.

52
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,280
 And I'm pretty surprised because, you know,

53
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,120
 I'm quite old, okay?

54
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,240
 I'm quite old compared to many of you guys.

55
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:53,960
 I remember back in the '80s, 1980s, can you believe that?

56
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
 1980s, where are you?

57
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,200
 Probably not born, right?

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,080
 Right, but you know, I've been going to churches

59
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,000
 for many decades.

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,360
 1980s is 40 years ago, right?

61
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,360
 The 1980s when I was so much younger, so much younger,

62
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,840
 churches had huge debates on the use of songs, you know,

63
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,880
 especially use of new songs,

64
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,760
 contemporary praise songs, so-called.

65
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,760
 When the praise songs were first introduced in 1980s,

66
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:26,560
 early '80s or even late '80s,

67
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,720
 and those of you who are old enough

68
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,440
 or comparatively older,

69
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,160
 you still remember a music ministry called Marilyn Arthur.

70
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,440
 Remember that?

71
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
 Yeah?

72
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
 No, right?

73
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,760
 I'm one of the older guy here.

74
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:47,080
 You know, some of the songs are still around.

75
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,280
 Some of those songs written and composed

76
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,520
 by Marilyn Arthur Music Ministry are still around.

77
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,480
 One of those songs we have used before,

78
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,160
 or we have used a lot of time,

79
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,520
 is called "As the Deer."

80
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,280
 As the Deer.

81
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,840
 And you know the lyrics, right?

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,240
 "As the deer panted for water,

83
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,880
 "so my soul longed after thee."

84
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,280
 Right, "You alone are my heart's desire,

85
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,840
 "I long to worship thee."

86
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,160
 And "You alone my strength, my shield, and so on,

87
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,800
 "I long to worship thee."

88
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,440
 You see, this is the first,

89
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,400
 so-called first generation praise songs

90
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,240
 that have been composed and used by churches

91
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,000
 since the 1980s and late '80s, early '90s.

92
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,200
 And it became very, very popular.

93
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,200
 You know where this song comes from?

94
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,340
 The lyrics, the content?

95
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,360
 Which song from the Bible?

96
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,260
 No?

97
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,280
 Psalm 42, right?

98
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,520
 42, exactly like that, okay?

99
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,440
 Psalm 42.

100
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,200
 And even the lyrics is using some old King James English,

101
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,200
 right, "thee."

102
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,440
 Some of those words are old English words,

103
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,320
 older English words.

104
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,640
 It became very, very popular,

105
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:08,880
 and there were people who don't like this kind of songs.

106
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
 You know, and I'll tell you why.

107
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,880
 And because these kind of contemporary words,

108
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:19,400
 contemporary worship songs are simple, repetitive,

109
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,040
 and sometimes too short, right?

110
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,800
 And look at this song, you know, you have one verse.

111
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,400
 Of course you have verse two,

112
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,120
 somebody add verse two later,

113
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,280
 and then a chorus, right?

114
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,640
 "You alone my strength, my shield," and all that.

115
00:05:35,640 --> 00:05:39,920
 But there's not much you can tell from the song itself.

116
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,520
 Therefore, there are people who think

117
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,520
 that contemporary worship songs dumbed down worship.

118
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,760
 Overly simplified worship, right?

119
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,280
 Because the songs that we use,

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,440
 or some of the songs that many modern churches are using,

121
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,040
 like Melanother, first generation,

122
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,620
 are very short and repetitive,

123
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,960
 and they don't cover a lot of content.

124
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,840
 They don't cover, definitely they don't cover

125
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,240
 a lot of theological or biblical content, right?

126
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,440
 So there's still a debate in the church,

127
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,680
 and some people who are like me, or even older than me,

128
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,960
 they would prefer the older hymns, right?

129
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,720
 The hymn books, traditional hymns.

130
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,600
 And if you check out some of the traditional hymns,

131
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:23,040
 they do present a lot of content,

132
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,760
 or a lot more content than Melanother,

133
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,720
 or contemporary praise songs.

134
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,480
 And check this out.

135
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,040
 Oh, this is one of the, if you know Mandarin,

136
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,900
 this is also the first generation,

137
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,640
 so-called first early generation of praise songs, right?

138
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

139
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,080
 Okay?

140
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,140
 This is actually the first one.

141
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:49,640
 The first one they wrote, and became so popular,

142
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,240
 and this ministry, Stream of Praise,

143
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,800
 has been around for, boy, for decades.

144
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
 Yeah, for decades.

145
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,700
 I remember my wife used to buy the CD.

146
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,200
 Each year they have a new album, right?

147
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,960
 And she would go to a Christian bookstore

148
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,080
 and pick up a new CD, all right?

149
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,080
 Every single year, and no matter if she likes the songs

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,440
 or not, she will buy a new CD, right?

151
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,880
 But you know what CDs are?

152
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,680
 You don't even know, right?

153
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,640
 I give you a CD, you can't even play it today, right?

154
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:25,200
 So we use Spotify, and Apple Music, and all that.

155
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,440
 iTunes or something.

156
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,440
 But this is a first generation praise song,

157
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,400
 and some people don't like it, because it's too simple.

158
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,320
 Look at the lyrics.

159
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,480
 There's not much there.

160
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,240
 It's very focused, though, right?

161
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,760
 Now if you check out some of the traditional hymn,

162
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,240
 like this one, this is a very, very popular classic

163
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,220
 Christian hymn, Amazing Grace.

164
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,400
 There are four stanzas, right?

165
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
 Four verses.

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,800
 Actually, there are six verses.

167
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,520
 Some versions have six verses,

168
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:00,160
 and here I present to you four verses.

169
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,400
 And you see how rich, in terms of content.

170
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:06,800
 These kind of traditional hymns are very, very rich,

171
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:09,420
 and teach you a lot of things.

172
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:12,640
 Verse one, Amazing Grace.

173
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,260
 How sweet the sound, save a wretch like me,

174
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:17,960
 was once lost, but now I'm found,

175
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,960
 was blind, and now I see.

176
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:25,840
 What kind of doctrine is verse one presenting?

177
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,020
 Forgiveness, right?

178
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,700
 Forgiveness in grace, right?

179
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,240
 My sin is forgiven.

180
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,800
 And then second verse,

181
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,640
 grace taught my heart to fear,

182
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,920
 my fears relieved in grace,

183
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,680
 and how precious did that grace appear,

184
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:46,180
 the hour, the moment I first believed in Christ.

185
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:51,180
 So stanza two present to you the doctrine of salvation,

186
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,120
 right, and that is salvation in grace.

187
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,680
 And verse three, it talks about,

188
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,280
 this is one of my favorite verse in the entire hymn,

189
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,720
 is through many dangerous toys and snares,

190
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,440
 I have already come, and God is leading me,

191
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,520
 safely in grace, and leading me home.

192
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:10,840
 And that's my life journey,

193
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,400
 because full of the grace of God.

194
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,960
 Ups and downs in my life journey, in your life journey,

195
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:20,040
 and when you sing it, when you sing stanza three,

196
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:24,920
 you realize that the song is trying to tell you

197
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,220
 the providence of God, right?

198
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,720
 The guidance of God in your life journey.

199
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,240
 And you are kept safe because of the grace of God.

200
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,800
 And then the last verse,

201
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,420
 talks about the future.

202
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:41,520
 The future, the eternity that we share in Christ Jesus,

203
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:44,000
 and the glorious future, right?

204
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,880
 Someday God will appear and his kingdom will come on earth,

205
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,440
 and I will be God's.

206
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,420
 And I say to God, forever,

207
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:57,640
 I am yours and forever you are mine.

208
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:01,680
 So, it's eschatology, it's the doctrine of last things,

209
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,680
 right, it's something that will happen in the future,

210
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:06,700
 according to the promises of God,

211
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,340
 the promises of the Bible, the new creation,

212
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,600
 the heaven, right?

213
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,720
 Our true home, and we are heading there,

214
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,360
 and there will be forever praise.

215
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,480
 And as I talk through this song, this hymn,

216
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,440
 you see, each verse, each stanza,

217
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,240
 has some sort of profound theology to tell us.

218
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,760
 So that's why there are some people who would prefer

219
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,540
 using theologically rich songs,

220
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:37,200
 and the contemporary worship songs,

221
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,520
 they are too simple to be used in worship.

222
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,600
 But we have to ask the question,

223
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,880
 is that a biblical argument?

224
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,360
 Is there really no place for simple songs

225
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,660
 in worship services?

226
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,240
 Is there a place for shorter, simple songs,

227
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,880
 simple praise songs, like the contemporary praise songs,

228
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,600
 that kind of song?

229
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,440
 Do they have a legitimate place,

230
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,600
 legitimate role in our liturgy, in our worship?

231
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,080
 Let's turn to some of the Bible verses,

232
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:14,600
 and one of those is found in the last book of the Bible,

233
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,760
 the book of Revelation, chapter four.

234
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,000
 Chapter four, verse eight, the angels are praising God.

235
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,280
 You know, the apostle John who wrote the book of Revelation,

236
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:29,220
 he is being lifted up to another realm,

237
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,840
 you know, the heavenly realm.

238
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,760
 And what he sees is the heavenly worship,

239
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,120
 what worship truly is in eternity.

240
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,400
 And he found the angels are praising God,

241
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:45,280
 you know, day and night, day after day, night after night.

242
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,880
 They keep on saying, they keep on praising God

243
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,880
 with one song, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God almighty,

244
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:59,360
 the God who always was, who is, and who is still to come.

245
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,440
 How long is that song?

246
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,700
 Only two lines, right?

247
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,360
 And how many times are they singing it?

248
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,000
 Many times, day and night, right?

249
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,680
 They sing it 24/7, right?

250
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,840
 And it's very simple, very focused,

251
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,480
 praising God for his holiness.

252
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,120
 And by the way, what is holiness?

253
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,880
 Holiness is separate, you know,

254
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,080
 it's totally different from us.

255
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,040
 Separate from us, set apart from us,

256
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:33,480
 that is the basic meaning of holy, or holiness.

257
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,860
 So they're praising God being holy God,

258
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,000
 because he is sinless, he is separate from us.

259
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,280
 However, he has come to redeem us so that we can praise him.

260
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,920
 That's what the angels are talking about.

261
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:48,520
 The content is clear and is glorifying God.

262
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,200
 And then the next chapter, chapter five,

263
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,520
 again in the heavenly realm, you know,

264
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:57,360
 in God's realm, in God's domain,

265
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,520
 and the people and the angels are singing praises

266
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,560
 to the lamb that was slain.

267
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:08,240
 If you remember our set of worship in the beginning,

268
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,960
 and Josh led us to read this part of scripture,

269
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,800
 the angels are praising God in front of the throne

270
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:18,240
 of the lamb of God who was slain.

271
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,920
 And they said, they're saying,

272
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,960
 "You are worthy to take the scroll

273
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:26,400
 "and break a seal and open it."

274
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,140
 Now what does it mean breaking the seal of the scroll?

275
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,560
 You know, in the ancient time,

276
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,680
 when they write important documents,

277
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,680
 they would roll it up, you know, roll it up.

278
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,040
 In animal skin or in papyrus,

279
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,560
 they roll it up and then they tie it up

280
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,880
 and then they will have a lump of clay

281
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,740
 to stamp on it to seal the document.

282
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:48,620
 So whoever has that stamp, whoever has the signature,

283
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,840
 has the authority to open up the scroll.

284
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:53,560
 And the scroll is all about the future,

285
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:56,300
 about the future of creation.

286
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,720
 And who is ruling the entire creation,

287
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,740
 the entire timeline of history,

288
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,640
 from past, present, and future?

289
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,140
 Who is worthy to open the scroll?

290
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,700
 Who is it?

291
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,000
 For you were slaughtered, your blood has ransomed people

292
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,640
 for God from every tribe, language, people, and nation.

293
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:21,120
 And you have caused them to become a kingdom of priests

294
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,340
 for our God and they will reign on the earth.

295
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:26,520
 Who is worthy to open the scroll?

296
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,640
 Who has the authority, the sovereignty

297
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,200
 to control your future, to control the future

298
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,000
 of the entire creation?

299
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,800
 It's the lamb who was laying on the cross.

300
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,820
 The lamb who suffered and died but rose again.

301
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,140
 He is the living God in Jesus Christ our Lord.

302
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:45,420
 He is worthy to open that scroll.

303
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,800
 And this is actually the song the angels were using

304
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,940
 to worship the lamb in front of his throne.

305
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,840
 How long is this song?

306
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,340
 Not too long, right?

307
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,900
 Short enough I can put it in one slide, right?

308
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,500
 And that's what they were singing

309
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,540
 and they were using to worship God.

310
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,340
 So these are very, very short,

311
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:13,320
 kind of like contemporary worship songs, right?

312
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,980
 So they're legit.

313
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,500
 We can use those because they're focused.

314
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,480
 They don't tell a lot of content

315
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,540
 but the focus is very, very sharp.

316
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:28,340
 Now are there long praise psalms in the Bible?

317
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:31,700
 Psalm 119, right?

318
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,500
 It's a Torah psalm.

319
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,400
 Appraising the word of God, the value of the word of God,

320
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,500
 the honor of the word of God.

321
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,140
 And it's very, very long.

322
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:46,380
 But again, there are many psalms that are shorter

323
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,060
 and much shorter and sometimes even shorter

324
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,260
 than the contemporary praise songs.

325
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,260
 Like Psalm 1, right?

326
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:55,180
 You remember Psalm 1?

327
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,300
 Blessed is the man who does not walk

328
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,540
 in the pathway of the sinners and all that.

329
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
 And Psalm 1, how many verses are there?

330
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,800
 Six, six verses.

331
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:12,920
 Psalm 23, and many of us know how to recite Psalm 23, right?

332
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,280
 The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be want.

333
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,760
 The Lord is my shepherd.

334
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,060
 How many verses are there?

335
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:24,000
 Six, six verses only.

336
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 121, I lift up my eyes and where my help come from.

337
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,840
 121, eight verses.

338
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:36,520
 133, behold how good the brothers,

339
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,600
 how beautiful the brothers are living together,

340
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,680
 staying together.

341
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,980
 133, three verses only.

342
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,980
 So there are shorter songs, many shorter songs

343
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:51,240
 in the Bible for worship.

344
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,820
 And also there were filled longer,

345
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:58,620
 theologically rich songs that can be used

346
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,400
 in worship services.

347
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:05,120
 You know, if you check out some of the traditional hymns

348
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,360
 that one of the examples I showed you, Amazing Grace,

349
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,200
 they try to squeeze major doctrines into one song, right?

350
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,320
 I went through with you, Amazing Grace,

351
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,240
 there are at least four kinds of,

352
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,080
 or four aspects of theology being squeezed into one song.

353
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:27,080
 Now I don't think, I think there's a legitimate way

354
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:32,580
 to do it and it has been done so well in Amazing Grace.

355
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:37,240
 But I don't think we should expect a song to be like

356
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:42,640
 a systematic theology textbook, right?

357
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,080
 I know a lot of you don't read, right?

358
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,980
 You don't read books anymore, right?

359
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,240
 We all go TikTok, right?

360
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,160
 Short videos, right?

361
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,720
 If you pick up some of the books from our library, right?

362
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,940
 From our library corner, you pick up one of those

363
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:00,500
 systematic theology books, how many pages are there?

364
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,240
 500 pages.

365
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:06,220
 That's crazy, right?

366
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,840
 If you take one of the courses in seminary,

367
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:12,460
 systematic theology, that's one of the textbooks

368
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,940
 that you're gonna read, right?

369
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,340
 There's only one.

370
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:18,100
 There are probably 10 books you have to read.

371
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:21,860
 And you just, you pick up one of those books,

372
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,700
 you know, it's like weapon, you know?

373
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:27,440
 You can bang people on the head and it's gonna hurt, right?

374
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,740
 You know, if you squeeze the entire book,

375
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:35,040
 systematic theology book, into one song,

376
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:38,480
 which is about five minutes long, three minutes long,

377
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:43,800
 it may be counterproductive at times, right?

378
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,140
 Right?

379
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,740
 Because you go through so many, so many different types

380
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:51,940
 of teachings, so many different types of content

381
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:56,140
 in one medium, one short medium,

382
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:59,520
 that may not be the best way to do it, right?

383
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,380
 And in worship service, as you can tell

384
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,660
 from the list that I gave you,

385
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,940
 all the elements of worship service,

386
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:11,940
 I think in terms of conveying content,

387
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,400
 you know, offer you materials, information,

388
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,900
 I don't think songs are the best way to do it, right?

389
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,440
 Do you agree?

390
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,540
 Probably preaching, 25 minutes, 30 minutes,

391
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,800
 is the better way to convey content.

392
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,800
 So again, I can understand why some guys like me,

393
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,180
 who are older, would prefer traditional hymns, right?

394
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:41,900
 But, you know, there was legitimate role

395
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:45,260
 for shorter, you know, simple songs,

396
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,780
 so that our praise and our worship would be focused.

397
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:53,780
 And some people in the discussion or debate

398
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,940
 would prefer traditional hymns over contemporary music

399
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,900
 because of quality, because of quality.

400
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:08,740
 And contemporary pop music sometimes is rejected

401
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,360
 because of lower music quality, right?

402
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,200
 Do you agree?

403
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,660
 Those are the songs that we use today, week after week,

404
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,140
 they are lower music quality, right?

405
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,620
 And of course, right, musically speaking,

406
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:27,100
 you know, classical music is of better quality, right?

407
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,580
 In terms of harmonization, in terms of sophistication,

408
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:33,920
 right, you know, Handel's Messiah,

409
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:37,620
 I mean, it's so complicated, it's so rich, right?

410
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,340
 And the harmonization and the arrangement is so rich,

411
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,100
 you know, Mozart, Beethoven, you know,

412
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,060
 those kind of music, traditional classical music

413
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,120
 is of better quality in terms of musicality.

414
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,860
 So arguably, they are better music quality.

415
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,140
 And some people would prefer the traditional hymns

416
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:02,880
 because of that, because of the better quality.

417
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,880
 But as I explained to you in the entire series,

418
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,860
 I asked the question, is it the church mission

419
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,500
 to preserve traditions?

420
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,540
 Is it or not?

421
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,340
 Is it the mission of a church to preserve music or art

422
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,700
 of highest quality?

423
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,200
 Is it our mandate?

424
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,020
 Partially, I think so, right?

425
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,880
 Cultural mandate, Genesis one.

426
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,020
 However, one can arguably say

427
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,300
 that this is not the church mission, right?

428
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,300
 Some of the music that we use in the entire long history

429
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:50,300
 of Christian history only serve for one generation

430
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:54,060
 because that generation understand

431
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:56,260
 that kind of language of worship.

432
00:21:56,260 --> 00:22:00,420
 And I told you, I learned some Hebrew songs, right?

433
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,580
 And those songs are particularly understandable,

434
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,900
 intelligent to that particular culture.

435
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,220
 And it would not be, it would not have the same effect

436
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,180
 for us, right?

437
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:19,180
 And so, there are people who say

438
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:24,580
 that music, church music, has to be good enough

439
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,940
 to be preserved beyond its own time.

440
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,080
 Otherwise, we should not use it in worship service.

441
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:34,260
 Now, I appreciate the basic intent,

442
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:38,940
 but I don't think this is totally biblical

443
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,260
 because remember the principle of Paul

444
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:43,980
 in 1 Corinthians 14.

445
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:47,260
 He said, "No matter what we do, we need to do it

446
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:52,100
 "in such a way that we can edify the entire family,

447
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,860
 "the church, the local church.

448
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,900
 "The church can be strengthened."

449
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,860
 Even new visitors come in and they can feel God's presence.

450
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:04,180
 They can understand the lyrics without much difficulty.

451
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,980
 And that is what Paul is going after

452
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,420
 in terms of quality, right?

453
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,020
 Because there are many different kinds of quality

454
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,220
 in the world.

455
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,700
 And Paul is saying to the Corinthian church,

456
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:20,540
 "And please, do your worship and engage in worship

457
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,180
 "in such a way that is good for everybody."

458
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:29,180
 Even it is effective for new believers or non-believers.

459
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,260
 And they come in, what is best in music

460
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:34,740
 in terms of what Paul is saying

461
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:37,940
 is that the music that will communicate

462
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:41,300
 with people today, right?

463
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,100
 And certainly there are musics that I've used

464
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:49,260
 or my worship life has used in the past.

465
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:52,180
 They are bygone.

466
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,140
 You know, we don't use it anymore

467
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:57,980
 because it spoke to the previous generation

468
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:02,060
 but no longer speaking to this generation.

469
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:06,820
 So I think there are place for all kinds of music.

470
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:11,260
 There are place for all kinds of worship songs

471
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:15,220
 including contemporary modern praise songs.

472
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,140
 And again, we need to understand what song is all about.

473
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:25,180
 Song or poem is not the ideal medium for content, right?

474
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:30,220
 As I told you, it's only five minutes long, right?

475
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,500
 You can't say much.

476
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:36,060
 You can only focus on one thing at a time.

477
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,700
 And we have to understand and ask the question

478
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,980
 how we can become a better worshiper

479
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:47,180
 by understanding what worship songs is all about.

480
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:51,000
 You know, if you have come to church for quite some time,

481
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,260
 you understand worship songs are like prayers.

482
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:59,660
 They are directed toward God, right?

483
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:04,980
 They are prayer-like songs and directed to God, right?

484
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,300
 Most of the songs that we use.

485
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,500
 And as such, worship songs or worship poems,

486
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:16,500
 the songs that we sing, are written for expression,

487
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:20,300
 emotional expression, emotive impact.

488
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,580
 And in order to create that kind of emotive impact,

489
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:29,580
 it has to be somewhat reparative, right?

490
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,420
 The contemporary worship songs,

491
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:34,700
 even the traditional hymns, are reparative in some way

492
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,340
 because that is the nature of worship songs.

493
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,660
 I would like to use the analogy

494
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:44,820
 that worship songs are like love songs, right?

495
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,840
 You know, you sing some of the love songs,

496
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,700
 even secular love songs, right?

497
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,340
 Those are very good songs, right?

498
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,620
 They are reparative in some way.

499
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:00,620
 Or worship songs are like love songs and national anthems.

500
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,100
 National anthems.

501
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:06,300
 Has to be repeated, right?

502
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,320
 It is kind of reparative.

503
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,380
 You do it one time, two time,

504
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:13,540
 repeatedly, regularly, right?

505
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:18,540
 Every NFL game start with national anthem, right?

506
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:20,260
 And we're gonna sing together

507
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:24,020
 because national anthem are pretty much like love songs.

508
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,160
 They are emotional expression

509
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:29,540
 to declare allegiance to the country, right?

510
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:33,900
 Are there any reparative songs in the Bible?

511
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,220
 There are.

512
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:40,540
 One of the example is Psalm 136.

513
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:44,100
 Here I give you the first five verses.

514
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,620
 Give thanks to the Lord for he is good,

515
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:49,420
 for his standfast love endures forever.

516
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,820
 Give thanks to the Lord, give thanks to the God of gods

517
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:56,620
 for his standfast love endures forever.

518
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:59,340
 Give thanks to the Lord for his standfast love

519
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,420
 endures forever.

520
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,740
 To him who alone does great wonders

521
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:05,400
 for his standfast love endures forever.

522
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:08,880
 To him who by understanding made the heavens

523
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,760
 for his standfast love endures forever.

524
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,300
 And it keeps on repeating the same chorus again and again

525
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,220
 and tells you why do we praise God,

526
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:19,820
 why do we give thanks to him.

527
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,580
 And this Psalm 136 is very, very long, right?

528
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,700
 It's very, very long.

529
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,380
 And it actually recites the entire history of Israel.

530
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:34,540
 How God told his people, talk about Exodus,

531
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:37,980
 talks about signs and wonder God has done in the midst,

532
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:41,580
 talk about wilderness, talk about how God provides for them.

533
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:45,540
 And that's why God is praiseworthy.

534
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:50,860
 Now, this is a very emotive expression.

535
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,940
 Repetitive, repeat again and again,

536
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:55,460
 for his standfast love endures forever.

537
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:58,580
 Yes, amen, it endures forever.

538
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,820
 That's why we praise him.

539
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:02,620
 And every time the chorus repeats,

540
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,340
 it talks about different aspects of God

541
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:08,220
 and what God is doing in your life, right?

542
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,220
 God has certainly provided for you,

543
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,220
 God has certainly sustained your life,

544
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:16,660
 God has certainly guided through your life journey,

545
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,940
 and that's why he is praiseworthy

546
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:23,020
 for his standfast love endures forever, right?

547
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,280
 These are emotions, right?

548
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,260
 Just like my wife would prefer me to say I love you.

549
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:34,180
 For how many times?

550
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,820
 Many times, right?

551
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,540
 I can't tell my wife, you know,

552
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:42,740
 I told you five years ago, right?

553
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,260
 It's done deal, right?

554
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:47,700
 There's no more content I wanna express to you, right?

555
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:51,540
 But you understand this emotive expression, right?

556
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:56,540
 It has to be spoken or verbalized from time to time, right?

557
00:28:57,060 --> 00:29:02,060
 You know, when my kids were younger,

558
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:07,340
 we try to intentionally do that, you know,

559
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,060
 we try to teach our kids, you know,

560
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:12,620
 as you know, kids don't talk these days, right?

561
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:16,300
 They're often with their phone, right?

562
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:19,500
 So when they were so much younger,

563
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:24,500
 we tell them, you know, you have to express your feeling.

564
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,140
 You know, you have to verbalize it.

565
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,180
 When you see a sunset is beautiful,

566
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:32,980
 you should say it is beautiful, right?

567
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,940
 It is awesome, right?

568
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,860
 They need to learn how to find the right word

569
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:40,020
 to describe their feelings.

570
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,240
 And we intentionally do that at home.

571
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:48,700
 I will tell them I'm happy because what happened, you know?

572
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:53,860
 I'm happy, I'm excited, I'm sad, I am kind of depressed,

573
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:55,700
 I'm exhausted.

574
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,860
 You know, these kind of vocabularies

575
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:00,180
 are emotional vocabularies, right?

576
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,660
 I tell my kids, "Love you," right?

577
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:06,100
 And they tell me, "I love you."

578
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,980
 And this sort of expression has to happen,

579
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:11,980
 you know, linguistically, I mean, verbally,

580
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,060
 it has to be described, right?

581
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:19,580
 And I want to bring this analogy to worship as well,

582
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:23,020
 because worship is an emotional language.

583
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,140
 And I want to tell you from my own life journey,

584
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:30,260
 my own cultural heritage, right, Asian Chinese, right?

585
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:34,180
 We have lack of emotional vocabularies.

586
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,300
 We have none, okay?

587
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,780
 We have no emotional vocabularies in our dictionary, right?

588
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,620
 Don't you agree?

589
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:44,100
 How do we express love to our children?

590
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:48,940
 Chinese parents, we do, "Eat some more."

591
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,220
 (audience laughing)

592
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,140
 Have you eaten?

593
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,540
 Go eat, right?

594
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,340
 Oh, eat some more, right?

595
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,980
 This is how we do it, right?

596
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,140
 This is pretty sad.

597
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,260
 One time I was visiting a family,

598
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:07,060
 and they have one of their loved one passed away.

599
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,540
 It's very tragic.

600
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,300
 So I went to visit the family,

601
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:16,300
 and they just have no vocabularies to describe the feelings.

602
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:20,220
 In the entire visitation, almost an hour,

603
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,580
 I stay there an hour, and I pray with them,

604
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:24,300
 you know, I care for them.

605
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:29,300
 All they say is, "Pastor, eat."

606
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,420
 (audience laughing)

607
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,740
 Or, "You have to eat," okay?

608
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,020
 I said, "I had dinner."

609
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,700
 "Oh, no, you have to eat."

610
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,300
 "Oh, you have to drink some more," okay?

611
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,060
 And then we talk for about 10 minutes,

612
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:42,580
 and then later on, you know, the family members come,

613
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:46,540
 and we found the dish, and come, "Hey, eat," okay?

614
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,340
 I mean, can we say I'm sad?

615
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:55,300
 Can we say I'm depressed, and I wanna cry,

616
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,060
 and I can lament, right?

617
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:59,460
 This is a legitimate emotional expression

618
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,120
 that we need to use.

619
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,420
 This is a love language, right?

620
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,020
 And we need to learn that.

621
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,620
 And in order to be better worshiper,

622
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,660
 we need to learn that kind of language as well.

623
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:15,260
 So I wanna suggest to you, we need to do that.

624
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,460
 Not just for parents, okay?

625
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:19,580
 Not just for family relationship.

626
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,780
 You know, all kinds of relationship

627
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:28,780
 have to be emotionally related, emotionally expressive, right?

628
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:36,100
 I, as a father, I need to learn how to use those words, right?

629
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:42,020
 And there are difficulties I need to overcome, right?

630
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:45,760
 At first, I was quite uncomfortable to say that, right?

631
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:48,400
 To say to my wife, "I love you."

632
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:51,140
 Say to my kids, "Love you," right?

633
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,780
 And I kind of, along the way,

634
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,700
 I find some cool way to say it, right?

635
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,540
 "Love you."

636
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,620
 (audience laughs)

637
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,620
 And then I get used to it.

638
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:03,380
 I get more comfortable to express it.

639
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:07,040
 But my main point is we need to learn that, right?

640
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,260
 Even between friends.

641
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:14,180
 You know, how do we get closer and closer, right?

642
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:21,080
 It has to be emotionally expressive, right?

643
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,320
 You gotta have some emotional connection.

644
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:27,840
 And worship is an emotional response to God, right?

645
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,400
 Like this psalm.

646
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,280
 "God has saved us and redeemed us,

647
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,740
 "created us and sustained us.

648
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,440
 "And we feel good," right?

649
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,100
 We wanna give thanks.

650
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:43,880
 Even giving thanks itself is an emotional response, right?

651
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,560
 And we respond to the goodness of God

652
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,800
 and ultimately the salvation that we have in Jesus Christ

653
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,920
 because we sinners, we're separated from the holy God.

654
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,920
 Only Jesus came to bridge the chasm

655
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,760
 between the holy God's totally separate from us,

656
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:04,440
 alienated from us, and us, broken sinners.

657
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,280
 And Jesus died on the cross and rose from the dead

658
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:12,280
 so that we can be bridged back to God, related to God.

659
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:16,120
 So how can we be a better worshiper?

660
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:19,440
 And may I suggest to you three more things

661
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:22,140
 as your take-homes.

662
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,620
 First, be intentional.

663
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,940
 We have to be intentional.

664
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,600
 Our weekly Sunday worship service,

665
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,720
 we have to be intentional.

666
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:36,400
 And you realize how much time we devoted

667
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,640
 to prepare for worship service,

668
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:40,400
 no matter how many people show up?

669
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:46,440
 I think we practice, this practice, today's rehearsal,

670
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:51,440
 I think it took us two plus hours, right?

671
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,640
 And with the preparation and all that,

672
00:34:54,640 --> 00:34:59,640
 number of hours, we do, we rehearse

673
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,440
 in order to craft our worship, right?

674
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,360
 Of course, it's not the best of the world, right?

675
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,560
 We're not professionals.

676
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,520
 But we try to do our best, right?

677
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:15,020
 So what I'm saying is, first point is be intentional

678
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,700
 if we want to become better worshipers.

679
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,240
 Arrive a little bit earlier.

680
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:25,240
 I told you many times, my best practice is come in

681
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:30,440
 and find a seat, find some space, and I can pray to God.

682
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,780
 I can meditate on God.

683
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,220
 Remember, worship is a relational encounter, right?

684
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,500
 And today is Father's Day.

685
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:42,360
 God is our true Father, right?

686
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,960
 We early fathers are broken.

687
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,460
 We are sinners, and we need redemption of Christ,

688
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:50,860
 just like our children do.

689
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:55,580
 But God is our true and perfect Father.

690
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,680
 And Jesus died on the cross to redeem us

691
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,920
 from sin and from death, so that our relationship

692
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:04,640
 with God is a reality now in Christ.

693
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:08,520
 So be intentional, because God is relating to us, right?

694
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:12,960
 God is not an ideal or a concept, or even not a philosophy.

695
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,360
 God is a living God.

696
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:17,280
 He's a person, and we have a personal relationship

697
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,300
 with our Creator, with our Redeemer.

698
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:24,280
 Secondly, I would suggest to pray.

699
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:26,100
 Learn how to pray.

700
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,680
 What do I mean by that?

701
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:32,680
 You know, in prayers, we don't just make a list

702
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:39,340
 of needs and wants in front of God.

703
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,700
 That is not the essence of prayer.

704
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,100
 Prayer is to come before God with an open heart,

705
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:52,100
 be honest, and be open, and tell God how you feel today,

706
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,940
 how you feel this week.

707
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,240
 Maybe you're so tired this week.

708
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,720
 Yes, open to God, right?

709
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,980
 Tell God that you are tired.

710
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,340
 Tell God that you are exhausted.

711
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,260
 I need your help.

712
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:07,540
 Tell God you feel frustrated.

713
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,980
 You feel anxious.

714
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:11,940
 You worry about things.

715
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:16,940
 You present those emotional feelings to God,

716
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,340
 and even tell God you are joyful today.

717
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:23,220
 Tell God you're excited, right?

718
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:28,120
 Did you listen to the words that we use?

719
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:32,300
 Emotional, expressive terms, right?

720
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:34,380
 God, I'm exhausted, I'm frustrated.

721
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:37,380
 God, I'm happy, right?

722
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,820
 I'm joyful.

723
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:41,900
 All kinds of emotions are found in the book of Psalms.

724
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,740
 All kinds of emotions are found

725
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:46,900
 in the worship elements in the Bible.

726
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,940
 I remember September 11th.

727
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:55,180
 September 11th, I think it happened on,

728
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:00,180
 of course, it happened on September 11th, 2001, right?

729
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,100
 And I think it happened on Monday or Tuesday,

730
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,860
 yeah, if I'm not mistaken.

731
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:10,860
 And I remember after September 11th happened,

732
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:15,440
 I was serving in the church,

733
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,540
 and the worship leaders called me up and say,

734
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,580
 how should we respond, right?

735
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,700
 You know, the original worship set,

736
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,780
 we have chosen some songs, right?

737
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:31,660
 And we have to change every one of them, right?

738
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,140
 And I suggested to them, you know,

739
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:36,580
 we don't have to come to worship

740
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:39,700
 always feeling joyful and excited.

741
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:43,920
 We can come before God with our laments, right?

742
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,580
 Lamentations.

743
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,740
 Those are legitimate worship response

744
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:48,940
 and emotional response.

745
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:50,460
 We can lament before God.

746
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,300
 And the book of Psalms contains many, many psalms

747
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:56,180
 that are laments, community laments,

748
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,660
 or individual laments.

749
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:03,100
 Those are sad songs, but we can present those to God.

750
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:06,740
 So I suggest to you to pray, to learn how to pray.

751
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:10,340
 Think for a minute how you would respond

752
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,580
 if God actually appeared to you right now.

753
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:17,460
 If God all of a sudden, (mimics God's voice)

754
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,680
 appeared before you, how would you respond, right?

755
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,420
 You know, in the Bible, there were many encounters like this

756
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,500
 in the book of Job.

757
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:31,340
 Job was suffering, right?

758
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:33,500
 He's a righteous guy and suffered a lot.

759
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:38,260
 And he demanded God to answer his questions.

760
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:42,020
 He has so many questions about suffering, right?

761
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,940
 Why am I suffering, right?

762
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,220
 An innocent man suffering a lot.

763
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:50,460
 Job demanded God to answer his questions.

764
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:54,500
 However, at the end of the book, God did show up.

765
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:56,020
 God said, "Yeah, you wanna interview me?

766
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,460
 "Yes, here I am."

767
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,260
 But when God met Job,

768
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:06,380
 God in turn asked him a lot of questions, right?

769
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:09,080
 Do you have the wisdom?

770
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,340
 Do you have my transcendent wisdom

771
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:15,820
 to govern the entire cosmos?

772
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,260
 Do you have that kind of wisdom?

773
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,540
 Can you understand that kind of wisdom?

774
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,980
 And Job was silent before the Creator.

775
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:27,340
 And he encountered God in such an awesome way, right?

776
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:33,260
 Moses and Isaiah, they encountered God in worship.

777
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:37,580
 And they realized God is holy and sinless.

778
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,500
 And they were unworthy.

779
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,660
 And they begged for mercy,

780
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:44,620
 that we need your grace, God, to come before you.

781
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:48,060
 Otherwise, we are undone, right?

782
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:50,760
 We are over because we are sinful.

783
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,820
 And God is so bright and so glorious, so pure.

784
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,140
 How can we approach God?

785
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:56,580
 There's no way we can approach God,

786
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:59,720
 except on the ground of grace.

787
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:02,740
 And maybe we can come before God

788
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,460
 and prepare ourselves in prayer,

789
00:41:04,460 --> 00:41:09,300
 knowing that only Jesus made forgiveness possible for us,

790
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:11,900
 so that we can worship God, we can come before God,

791
00:41:11,900 --> 00:41:14,760
 because Jesus first loved us.

792
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:18,740
 And number three I wanna suggest to you is to learn, right?

793
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,380
 We have to learn.

794
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:22,940
 No matter how long you have been to church,

795
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,820
 no matter how long you've been a Christian,

796
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,100
 no matter how long you have followed Christ,

797
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,180
 we need to learn how to worship,

798
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,000
 how to worship better.

799
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,000
 Because worship is not about passively watching a show.

800
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:42,200
 It's not Saturday night life, right?

801
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:45,060
 It's not just come in and you just absorb something.

802
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:48,540
 It's not passively engaging.

803
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:52,680
 It's about actively, proactively, we participate.

804
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,640
 Because we believe in Jesus and we are God's people.

805
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:59,160
 And God is calling his people to worship him.

806
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,580
 And worship flows out of our living relationship

807
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,680
 with God himself.

808
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:10,860
 Today, even I've been worshiping for many decades,

809
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,100
 I'm still learning new songs, right?

810
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:17,380
 Because I understand when God does new things in history,

811
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,220
 there are new songs of worship.

812
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:23,340
 And I'm trying to learn those new songs, right?

813
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:25,860
 Try to learn and try to concentrate.

814
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,740
 Try to direct our attention to God

815
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,940
 so that God is totally pleased in your worship,

816
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,580
 in my worship, in our worship.

817
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,380
 Let us all pray and pray that God will help us

818
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,420
 to be better worshipers, to be a better church.

819
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,180
 Heavenly Father, we call you Father because you are perfect

820
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:54,160
 and you are holy and sinless and pure.

821
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,180
 Yes, we can come before you today

822
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:00,220
 only on the ground of grace.

823
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:05,940
 Because of the grace of God expressed to us,

824
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,960
 demonstrate to us on the cross of Jesus.

825
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,880
 Thank you for first loving us so that we can love you back.

826
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:17,020
 Thank you for this living relationship

827
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,140
 that we have with you.

828
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:23,420
 Our prayers are not talking to empty air.

829
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:27,440
 Our prayers are directed to you.

830
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,120
 And you are our loving Father.

831
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:34,740
 Thank you for sustaining us, providing for us.

832
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:38,020
 And God, we come before you, we are sorry.

833
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:43,340
 Forgive us, forgive our shortcomings.

834
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:45,820
 Sometimes we come before you to worship

835
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:50,020
 as if this is a job, as if this is one of the things

836
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,300
 that in our checklist, we wanna get it done

837
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:55,860
 and get it over with.

838
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:58,660
 Father, forgive us.

839
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:01,900
 Bring us into true worship.

840
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:04,940
 Help us to be better worshipers,

841
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:10,980
 to learn languages that will express our thanks to you,

842
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:15,820
 to learn songs and poems that we can say to you,

843
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,260
 you are our awesome God.

844
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:22,220
 Thank you for being our loving God.

845
00:44:22,220 --> 00:44:24,540
 Thank you for saving us and redeeming us

846
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,340
 from sin and from death and darkness.

847
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,340
 Bring us into your light.

848
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:35,400
 Help us to be renewed because we understand your grace.

849
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,780
 So transform our lives this week

850
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,000
 so that our lifestyle will honor to you.

851
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,120
 And as we come week after week to worship you,

852
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:49,360
 may our worship be pleasing to you

853
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,000
 for you are worthy of our praise.

854
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,160
 In Christ name we pray.

855
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,520
 Well, God bless you all and please stay behind

856
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:01,200
 for a little time of fellowship together

857
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,120
 and there was some refreshment out there

858
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,280
 and say hi to some of our new friends

859
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:07,760
 and say hi to your neighbors, okay?

860
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,600
 God bless.
