1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,520
 All right, guys, we will continue our series on worship.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,840
 And remember we read and studied Psalm 8.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,440
 Remember that?

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:10,600
 Psalm 8?

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,100
 No?

6
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:16,280
 Okay, you guys need to improve, okay, in your learning.

7
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:18,060
 Okay, Psalm 8, I know you know, right?

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:18,900
 I know you know.

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:20,960
 Psalm 8 is a creation psalm,

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,240
 and teaches us how to worship God.

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,160
 And last time, in this series,

12
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,760
 we were at Genesis 2, one and two,

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:35,000
 and we were talking about the Garden of Eden, right?

14
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,600
 And we say Eden is like a sanctuary,

15
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,440
 it's like a temple, right?

16
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,080
 Where is the entrance facing?

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:43,920
 Which direction?

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,160
 Yes, east, yeah, there you go.

19
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:47,480
 And who is guarding the entrance?

20
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,120
 Who is that guy?

21
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,280
 Cherubim, right?

22
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,180
 Cherubim, right?

23
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,120
 Cherubim, couple of cherubim.

24
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,720
 And by the way, cherubim is plural.

25
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:57,760
 So two, at least two,

26
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,680
 they're guarding the entrance of the sanctuary, all right?

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,960
 And Eden was like on mountaintop,

28
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,000
 because rivers are coming out of Eden

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,720
 to cultivate the lands nearby.

30
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,360
 And also, there are some wordings

31
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,160
 in chapter two of Genesis, or chapter three in Genesis,

32
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,560
 that reminds us this is a sanctuary.

33
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,960
 Because whenever the Bible talks about a sanctuary,

34
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,140
 a temple, these wordings appear.

35
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:31,880
 Three, eight, this is after the fall of humankind,

36
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,580
 after Adam and Eve rebelled against God.

37
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:37,920
 And it says three, eight,

38
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,240
 when the cool evening breezes were blowing,

39
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,040
 the man, humanity, representing the whole humanity,

40
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:51,040
 and his wife heard the Lord God walking about in the garden.

41
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,440
 Okay, so they were hiding from the Lord God

42
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:56,440
 from the tree, in the trees.

43
00:01:56,440 --> 00:02:01,440
 And hear the wording, walking about, walking alongside,

44
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:04,320
 walking in the midst of them.

45
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,800
 That is a special vocabulary in the Bible

46
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,720
 that describes God's presence.

47
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,360
 God is walking in the midst of His people.

48
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:18,160
 And that kind of wording appears so many times

49
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,720
 in the Old Testament that talks about the temple

50
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,200
 or tabernacle or wherever you find the presence of God.

51
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,200
 So you can see from the opening chapters of the Bible,

52
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,120
 Genesis one, two, and three,

53
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,820
 you see worship is a main theme.

54
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,760
 People worship God in the presence of God.

55
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,840
 People can walk with God, can have fellowship with God.

56
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,480
 And that's what worship is all about.

57
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,520
 The presence of God is with His people.

58
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:54,520
 God is walking about, walking in the midst of them.

59
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,560
 So Eden is like a sanctuary.

60
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,840
 So if you have time, you can flip to,

61
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,040
 turn to the last chapters of the Bible.

62
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,960
 The last book of the Bible being,

63
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,280
 what's the name of the last book of Bible?

64
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,320
 Revelation, yes, Revelation.

65
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:14,360
 The last chapters, chapter 21, 22,

66
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,220
 talks about new creation.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,440
 It talks about future, our ending.

68
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,000
 You know, we are heading toward that future.

69
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,800
 And that future is gonna be a glorious future.

70
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,840
 And I wanna thank George

71
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,840
 for preaching a very good sermon last week,

72
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,040
 reminding us the whole creation is going forward.

73
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,120
 That direction, God is gonna renew everything.

74
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,400
 God is going to renew the whole cosmos.

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,920
 And the theme of worship appears again.

76
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,000
 Like 21, three, the book of Revelation.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,560
 John, the apostle, being lifted up into heaven,

78
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,560
 and he saw or he heard something that is otherworldly.

79
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,000
 I heard a loud shout from the throne saying,

80
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
 "Look, God's home, the home of God,

81
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,840
 "is now among His people."

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,340
 God's home, by the way, this is new living translation.

83
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:12,140
 I guess it's easier for most of us.

84
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,960
 The home of God, the presence of God, is among His people.

85
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,320
 He will live with them and they will be His people.

86
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,360
 God Himself will be with them.

87
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,720
 Again, that kind of wording,

88
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,240
 walking in the midst of them, live with them,

89
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:28,400
 dwell with them, and God will wipe every tear

90
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,640
 from their eyes and there will be no more death

91
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,160
 or sorrow or crying or pain.

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:35,660
 All these things are gone forever.

93
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,880
 Talking about the new heaven and new earth,

94
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,000
 the new cosmos, the new creation.

95
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,600
 That's where we are going.

96
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,380
 That's where we're looking forward to.

97
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,020
 That gives us hope.

98
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:48,120
 But again, if you look at the wordings here,

99
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,040
 worship is the goal.

100
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,360
 The new creation is full of worship.

101
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,800
 The new creation is full of worshiping God

102
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,480
 and living in His presence.

103
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,480
 So as you realize, the Bible is bookended

104
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:08,840
 by two portions, the opening chapters

105
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,080
 and the closing chapters, and it's all about worship.

106
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,040
 Bookend by the theme of worship.

107
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,460
 So the Bible, you read from cover to cover,

108
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,020
 is from worship to worship.

109
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,880
 Now, of course, if you trace the grand story of the Bible,

110
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:30,260
 after the fall of humankind,

111
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:33,100
 after the rebellion of Adam and Eve,

112
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,620
 the humankind rebelled against God,

113
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,140
 they lost the presence of God

114
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,980
 and they are kicked out from Eden, right?

115
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,020
 Got it?

116
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,280
 Kicked out from Eden.

117
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,220
 However, those who know God and those who believe in God,

118
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,820
 they continue worship.

119
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,620
 So these kinds of wording are going to describe

120
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,960
 some of those people who continue to be faithful to God,

121
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,180
 even though they were the minority.

122
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:04,100
 523 Genesis, Enoch.

123
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,200
 There's a guy called Enoch and he lived for 365 years.

124
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,180
 By the way, 365 is a symbolic number, okay?

125
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,760
 All right, he's not like a tree, all right?

126
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,200
 Never die, all right?

127
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,580
 So you have to read the Bible according to its own term.

128
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,100
 It's written not to us, but for us, right?

129
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,340
 It's written to ancient people

130
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:27,060
 and they use symbolic numbers, okay?

131
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,380
 But they are real numbers, okay?

132
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,540
 Real symbolic number, but they have some symbolic meaning.

133
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,760
 So Enoch lived 365 years.

134
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:39,700
 Verse 24, walking with God, right?

135
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,620
 In close relationship, in close fellowship with God.

136
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,820
 And then one day he disappeared, God took him away.

137
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:47,580
 All right, how cool is that, right?

138
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:53,540
 Anyways, and then at the end of the book of Genesis,

139
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:58,900
 when Jacob was blessing his children, all right?

140
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,840
 His end of, come to the end of his life

141
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,620
 and Jacob blessed his children.

142
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:08,620
 He blessed Joseph and said, look at how he described God.

143
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,500
 May the God before whom my grandfather, Abraham,

144
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,780
 and my father, Isaac, walked.

145
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,500
 He walked before them, right?

146
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,460
 Abraham walked before them, or walked before God.

147
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,100
 Isaac walked before God.

148
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,160
 And Jacob also walked before God.

149
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,940
 So these people who worship God, who are faithful to God,

150
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,620
 they are always described as walking with God

151
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,980
 and God is walking with them, right?

152
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,880
 So the God who has been my shepherd

153
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,280
 all my life to this very day, right?

154
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,980
 So even though mankind was being kicked out of Eden,

155
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:46,140
 kicked out of the presence of God,

156
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:50,500
 but God is still walking alongside of them

157
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,540
 for those who are faithful to him,

158
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,220
 for those who still believe in, right?

159
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:59,380
 So it's described them in such verdicts, right?

160
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:03,620
 And then we're gonna trace the Bible from the book of Genesis.

161
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,840
 Remember where the people of God end up

162
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,060
 by the end of book of Genesis?

163
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:08,900
 Where were they?

164
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,100
 They were not in Chicago.

165
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,940
 Where were they?

166
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,680
 They were in Egypt.

167
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,060
 Got it?

168
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,740
 All right, so many things happen,

169
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:21,100
 but they end up in Egypt for many years.

170
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,580
 And then some days ago, or some day later,

171
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,400
 God appeared to Moses.

172
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:33,780
 So you got Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and the 12 tribes,

173
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:36,860
 and then you come to Moses.

174
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,620
 Many years later, Moses.

175
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,780
 Moses was in exile,

176
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:45,220
 and he was shepherding his flock in the wilderness

177
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:49,860
 in the book of Exodus chapter three.

178
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,820
 It's a long passage,

179
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,940
 but we're gonna take a look from the perspective of worship.

180
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:58,800
 One day, Moses was tending the flock of his father,

181
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:01,100
 and we're gonna skip to into the wilderness,

182
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,620
 and into where?

183
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,620
 He came to Sinai, right?

184
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,260
 You got that word?

185
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,620
 Sinai or Horeb, okay?

186
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:11,980
 Both referring to the same mountain,

187
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,900
 the mountain of God, right?

188
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,940
 Mountain of God.

189
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,420
 Again, sanctuary.

190
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:18,460
 There, the angel of the Lord appeared to Moses

191
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,460
 in blazing fire from the middle of a bush,

192
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,980
 and he stared in amazement.

193
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,380
 How cool is that, right?

194
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:28,580
 Because the bush was engulfed in flames,

195
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,400
 and it did not burn up.

196
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,800
 Do not come any closer, the Lord warned him.

197
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,500
 Take off your sandals.

198
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,340
 Take off your sandals,

199
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,340
 for you are standing on the holy ground, right?

200
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:47,640
 So this place is holy because God's presence is there.

201
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,900
 Take off your sandal, and I will be with you,

202
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,300
 and this is the sign that I'm the one who sent you,

203
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:59,000
 sent you back to Egypt to bring my people out of Egypt,

204
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,180
 and what's the goal?

205
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,720
 What is the destination?

206
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,940
 You will worship God in this very mountain,

207
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,820
 Mount Sinai, right?

208
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:09,640
 To do what?

209
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,540
 To worship God, right?

210
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,780
 So God saves his people from the land of slavery,

211
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,080
 from Egypt, for the purpose of serving him

212
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:21,860
 and worshiping him, and as you know,

213
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,380
 the book of Exodus, there were tons of things

214
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,940
 happened there, 10 plagues, right?

215
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,620
 And all this crazy thing happened,

216
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,620
 and God judged Pharaoh and the nation of Egypt,

217
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,260
 and saved his people out of Egypt.

218
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,540
 So they crossed the Red Sea,

219
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,340
 and they crossed the great and fearful wilderness,

220
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,460
 and they finally, they arrived at the foothill

221
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,020
 of what mountain?

222
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,460
 Mount Sinai, right?

223
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:52,340
 Mount Sinai.

224
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,180
 To do what?

225
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,820
 To worship him, right?

226
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,580
 God saved his people out of Egypt

227
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:01,420
 in order for them to worship him,

228
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:05,500
 and there at the foothill of the Mount Sinai,

229
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,620
 God gave them the 10 commandments.

230
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,220
 God gave them the 10 commandments,

231
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,460
 and the 10 commandments is kind of like

232
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:16,080
 the constitution of ancient Israel,

233
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,380
 just like the United States Constitution.

234
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:22,900
 Those are the basic principle, lay out 10 principles

235
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,860
 that how they are going to conduct their lives.

236
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,820
 Now they are the new people of God,

237
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,180
 how are they going to live?

238
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,700
 How are they going to live according to the principles

239
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:33,780
 God has given them?

240
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,040
 So that's the 10 commandments.

241
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:42,140
 And then at that moment, God told Moses,

242
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,100
 I'm going to live and dwell among my people.

243
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,260
 And the symbol I'm using so that they can see

244
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:52,180
 I'm living among them is tabernacle.

245
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,340
 Tabernacle, right?

246
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,380
 Heard that word, right?

247
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,220
 Tabernacle.

248
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,660
 What is tabernacle?

249
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:01,740
 And this is the topic of the day.

250
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,460
 I'm going to talk to you about tabernacle,

251
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,680
 and what is the tabernacle for,

252
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,840
 and what does it mean, right?

253
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,020
 So let's begin by understanding the word tabernacle.

254
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,060
 Okay, tabernacle.

255
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,580
 Various translation, but it comes from Hebrew,

256
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:21,340
 meshkan, all right?

257
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,140
 Tabernacle is English, of course.

258
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:28,140
 And it translates the Hebrew word meshkan, meshkan.

259
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,680
 And meshkan is a noun, comes from a Hebrew verb, shakan.

260
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:37,620
 So Hebrew is a very funny language.

261
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,520
 You add something in the front,

262
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,600
 or you add something at the end,

263
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,560
 and then it becomes another form, right?

264
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,680
 Here's one of the example.

265
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:50,920
 Shakan is living, dwelling, right?

266
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,920
 And you add an M, meshkan, right?

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,460
 Did you get it?

268
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:00,040
 Meshkan, it becomes a noun.

269
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:03,080
 Means a tent, all right?

270
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,760
 It means a tent.

271
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,400
 Living in the midst of its people.

272
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,080
 Is it really difficult?

273
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
 It's not that, right?

274
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,440
 It's not that difficult.

275
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,880
 So shakan and meshkan, right, sound the same,

276
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,240
 and that means tabernacle, right?

277
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,960
 God is making his tabernacle among his people, right?

278
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,960
 Recently I learned that there is something called cramping.

279
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,660
 You heard that?

280
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,980
 Have you ever been to camping, camping trip?

281
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,300
 Do you like it?

282
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,020
 Do you enjoy it, camping?

283
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,460
 Like pitching a tent, right?

284
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:38,300
 Yeah.

285
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:41,620
 And then nowadays they have this glamorous camping

286
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,900
 called glamping, right?

287
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,460
 So they sound the same, right?

288
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,800
 Camping and glamping, right?

289
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,740
 So that's what I just learned.

290
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,820
 You know, I didn't know that.

291
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:55,020
 I used to just go camping, right?

292
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,280
 And it's pretty, pretty tough

293
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,960
 because you have to go for a public bathroom.

294
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,500
 You have to share the bathroom together,

295
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,740
 and it's very dirty and filthy and all that, right?

296
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:06,180
 So nowadays, you know, people are so spoiled.

297
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,140
 We are so spoiled.

298
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,540
 Americans are so spoiled.

299
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:13,700
 And we invented this glamping, right?

300
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,540
 What is that?

301
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,680
 Glamorous camping.

302
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,660
 That means you have your own bathroom.

303
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:21,540
 You live in a container.

304
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,220
 It's very, very comfortable.

305
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:29,060
 There's AC, air conditioning, and all that, right?

306
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,620
 It's just living in, like living in a hotel, right?

307
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,440
 But you live in nature

308
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,860
 because the container is in the nature.

309
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:40,980
 So this is camping, all right?

310
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,180
 It's rain and very dirty, right?

311
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,180
 This is glamping, right?

312
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:53,580
 You know, it's a luxury kind of camping, right?

313
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,220
 Which one do you prefer?

314
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:58,940
 Do you prefer camping or you prefer glamping?

315
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,160
 Glamping, you know, you gotta pay more, right?

316
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,540
 What I'm saying is camping and glamping

317
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,820
 is like Mishkan and Shakan, right?

318
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:09,100
 They sound pretty much the same.

319
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:13,700
 But what it means is that God is pitching his tent,

320
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:18,380
 glamping, God is glamping in the midst of his people, right?

321
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,700
 It's a tent of God, right?

322
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,740
 It's the tabernacle, right?

323
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:26,700
 And in Southern Israel, there's a place, a national park,

324
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,420
 and you can drive there in Southern Israel, in the Negev,

325
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,940
 and you can visit this park and you can walk around.

326
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:37,860
 And in this park, there's a one-to-one replica

327
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:41,220
 of tabernacle, one-to-one ratio.

328
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,940
 As you can see right there,

329
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,680
 it's a rectangular shape, glamping, right?

330
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,820
 A tent, kind of a boundary,

331
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,140
 two-to-one ratio,

332
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:58,620
 rectangular boundary.

333
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,860
 And inside there, there's also

334
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,740
 an other smaller rectangular shape,

335
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,260
 you know, with the curtain on top.

336
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:11,300
 And then inside is a square, it's the Holy of Holies.

337
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:14,780
 So what you see here with all the curtains

338
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:19,740
 blocking off the boundary is the outer court of tabernacle.

339
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,700
 And inside the court of the tabernacle,

340
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,700
 there's another, you know, smaller rectangular shape area,

341
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,860
 and you can go into, it's also two-by-one,

342
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,220
 it's called Holy Place.

343
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,500
 And inside Holy Place, there's a square, perfect square,

344
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,220
 Holy of Holies.

345
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,020
 So let's walk inside, right?

346
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,520
 So you walk inside, you're standing inside the court,

347
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,500
 inside the courtyard of tabernacle,

348
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,220
 and you see the altar, right?

349
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,580
 The altar where you burn the sacrifice, right?

350
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:57,380
 Now, altar, practically speaking, is a barbecue place,

351
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:00,420
 and you burn all the sacrifices, right?

352
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:04,740
 And you also see the round thing, the round dish, right?

353
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,220
 You see that?

354
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,580
 It contains water, it's a water basin,

355
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:11,820
 and for priests to, you know, wash themselves

356
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,960
 and make sure they're cleansed before they enter

357
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:19,940
 or doing some rituals in the tabernacle.

358
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,600
 So we are in the courtyard.

359
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,740
 Now you wanna go inside?

360
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:30,940
 You go inside, this is a two-by-one smaller rectangular,

361
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:33,180
 and you see two guys here.

362
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,540
 You know, that guy leaning in the back

363
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,200
 should be one of the priests,

364
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,280
 and he was doing something here.

365
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,260
 And also another guy in blue robe,

366
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,180
 he's the high priest.

367
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:48,500
 You see the brass plate in front of him?

368
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,020
 There was 12 stones, right?

369
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,860
 So the priests, you know, they can go into the holy place.

370
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:59,860
 And then you see three different kind of furniture items.

371
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:03,820
 On the left is the menorah, all right?

372
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:08,820
 It's a seven-branch menorah, looks like a tree of life,

373
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,600
 looks like a tree.

374
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,000
 On your right is a table called the showbread table.

375
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,400
 So every day they would bake some new bread,

376
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:22,200
 and they can put it on the table.

377
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,720
 You know, that symbolize God is hosting his people, right?

378
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,360
 You are being invited into the home of God.

379
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,040
 This is the clamping home of God.

380
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:36,160
 You come in and you see on the left is light

381
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,600
 from the menorah, on the right is the hospitality

382
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,440
 provided by the king of the universe, showbread.

383
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:47,040
 In the middle of it is another order

384
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,280
 called the incense order.

385
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,840
 The incense order where they burn the incense,

386
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,680
 and the incense, the smoke will go up, right?

387
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,920
 That will represent the prayers of the people, right?

388
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,440
 That's the holy place.

389
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,440
 So being right there, right where you are standing now

390
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,440
 is inside the home of God himself, the tabernacle.

391
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
 And then you see the curtains?

392
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,900
 Those figures on the curtain, who are they?

393
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,360
 Who is guarding the holy place?

394
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,800
 Yeah, yeah, cherubim, there you go, cherubim.

395
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,240
 They are supposed to symbolize cherubim.

396
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,400
 Do you wanna go inside?

397
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,020
 No?

398
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,220
 You can't go inside, right?

399
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:35,260
 Because when the tabernacle was in the midst

400
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,940
 of the ancient Israelites,

401
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:41,020
 no one can go into the holy of holies.

402
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,000
 No one can go behind the curtain.

403
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,100
 You can go in only one day per year,

404
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:53,380
 and it's represented by the high priest, Aaron,

405
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,920
 and his descendants.

406
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:59,920
 The high priest will go in one day a year on Yom Kippur.

407
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,000
 Day of Atonement.

408
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,080
 And he's gonna represent the whole people of Israel

409
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,600
 and go into the holy of holies and to atone the people

410
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,780
 so that the people will find forgiveness of sins.

411
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,920
 So only the high priest can enter into the holy of holies,

412
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,000
 which is a square, perfect square,

413
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,720
 meaning holy of holies is a perfect place.

414
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,520
 Do you wanna go inside?

415
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,160
 For this model, you can go inside, all right?

416
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:29,840
 All right, so you kind of go through the curtain

417
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,680
 and inside there's only one furniture item,

418
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:36,460
 and that furniture item is called the Ark of the Covenant.

419
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,560
 All right?

420
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,520
 It's plated with gold, real gold, all right?

421
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:46,520
 The Ark of the Covenant is actually a box, a chest box,

422
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:51,640
 and they store one of the items inside the box.

423
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,160
 And on top of it, there are two creatures, and who are they?

424
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,240
 The cherubim, yes, the cherubim.

425
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,280
 There's gotta be cherubim everywhere, right?

426
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,760
 Cherubim.

427
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,640
 So they're guarding the holy of holies.

428
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:09,360
 Now the Ark of the Covenant is actually God's throne.

429
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:10,200
 He sits on it.

430
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:14,400
 That is his chair, that is his oval office, right?

431
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,680
 It's right at the center of the White House.

432
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,160
 That's where the president is.

433
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,080
 That's where the king of the universe is, right?

434
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,600
 Of course, there's no idol,

435
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
 there's no visible symbol for God

436
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,120
 because God is invisible, right?

437
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,120
 But inside this box, you find two copies of stone tablets.

438
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,920
 All right?

439
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,960
 And what is written on it should be,

440
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,880
 part of the words should be the Ten Commandments, right?

441
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,320
 There are two copies.

442
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,140
 And you know why?

443
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,320
 Because in the biblical time,

444
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,520
 when two nations are making covenant together,

445
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,840
 when two parties are making covenant together,

446
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,880
 they will come together and talk about

447
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,800
 the terms of the covenant.

448
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,360
 And once they agree with the terms of the covenant,

449
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,960
 with all the blessing and curses for obeying it,

450
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,000
 you get the blessing.

451
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,400
 If you disobey, you get the curse.

452
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,560
 And that is gonna protect the covenant relationship

453
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,500
 between two nations, two parties.

454
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,880
 When the two parties agree with the terms of the covenant,

455
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,240
 they will make two copies in stone

456
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,660
 or in some doable material.

457
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:28,660
 They will write down or engrave the terms on the tablet.

458
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:32,880
 So you get a copy, I get a copy.

459
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,440
 It's an exact copy, right?

460
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,880
 And you're gonna bring your copy back to your country,

461
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,300
 and you're gonna deposit the tablet

462
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,300
 into your main sanctuary, your main temple.

463
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,680
 So you're gonna put your copy in your main temple,

464
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,280
 in your holy of holies,

465
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,340
 and I'm gonna put my copy in my sanctuary,

466
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,680
 the biggest temple of my country.

467
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,980
 I'm gonna put it there in my holy of holies.

468
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:05,420
 And year after year, we're going to renew the covenant,

469
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,520
 and we're gonna read the covenant terms,

470
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,980
 and make sure we're gonna obey it

471
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,740
 and maintain our relationship.

472
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:13,460
 Now, for Yahweh, for God, and Israel,

473
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,700
 when they make covenant together,

474
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,960
 for the people of Israel, where is their sanctuary?

475
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,780
 It's a tabernacle, right?

476
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:26,220
 And that's why you find one copy in the holy of holies,

477
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:28,740
 in the Ark of the Covenant, right?

478
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,700
 And for Yahweh, for God himself, where is his temple?

479
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,780
 Also in tabernacle, right?

480
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,420
 Also in tabernacle, the earthly temple is in,

481
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,820
 it's a tabernacle.

482
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,700
 So Yahweh's copy, God's copy, and Israel copy

483
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:49,220
 are being deposited into this same box.

484
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,300
 So you find two exact copies.

485
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:56,100
 That means God and Israel, God and his people

486
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:59,560
 have a covenant going on, right?

487
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,160
 And that covenant will protect their relationship.

488
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:06,040
 And the people are being called to worship God

489
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,620
 because they are his people, and God is their God.

490
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,460
 And they are going to honor God and worship God

491
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:19,260
 and serve God with God in their midst.

492
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:22,840
 Now we can come, this is the end of the tour, all right?

493
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,520
 This is the end of the tour.

494
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:27,640
 But we're gonna go to the text, go into the Bible,

495
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,860
 and see how the Bible describes

496
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:33,240
 the building of the tabernacle.

497
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,880
 In the book of Exodus, chapter 25 to 40,

498
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,480
 is the long portion of the text,

499
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:43,400
 talking about the plan and the building of tabernacle.

500
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,400
 From chapters 25 to 31, God gave Moses the plan.

501
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:53,080
 It's an architectural blueprint, how to build a tabernacle.

502
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,020
 Like how long it is, how wide it is,

503
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,480
 and what you're gonna use.

504
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,680
 You're gonna use gold and silver

505
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,520
 for all the things that you're gonna put together.

506
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,160
 That is the architectural plan, 25 to 31.

507
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,920
 And then 35 to 40, the ending chapters,

508
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,040
 describes the actual building of the tabernacle.

509
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:17,880
 All right, so we're not gonna read it.

510
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,060
 But here's the interesting things.

511
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:24,720
 From 25 to 31, talking about the blueprint of tabernacle,

512
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,800
 you expect the Bible will continue

513
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,560
 to talk about the actual building of tabernacle, right?

514
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:37,560
 However, in between 32 and, 32 to 34,

515
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:41,400
 you find an episode, a very sad episode.

516
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,800
 The people of Israel in the wilderness,

517
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,920
 they worship a different God.

518
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,400
 They worship their own idol, golden calf.

519
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,120
 However, at the end of this episode,

520
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,600
 God is saying, "I'm gonna still dwell among you."

521
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,440
 And that is a lesson of grace.

522
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:05,200
 We don't deserve the presence of God in the midst of us.

523
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,220
 Only because of God's grace,

524
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,480
 that God is going to have his presence among us,

525
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,400
 so that we can worship him.

526
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,280
 Have you ever thought of that?

527
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,760
 We can worship God, it's not because we deserve it.

528
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,160
 It's not because we earn it.

529
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,340
 It's God made a way that is possible

530
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,740
 for us sinners to worship him, right?

531
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:32,740
 So it's very interesting how the design of the chapters.

532
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:36,840
 After the blueprint, the Bible stops right there.

533
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,840
 Hey, remember, God can live among us.

534
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,020
 It's not because we earn it.

535
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,100
 We're sinners, we don't deserve it.

536
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,820
 God, by his sheer grace, he can make his presence among us

537
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,780
 and we can worship him.

538
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:55,580
 And then you see the building of the tabernacle.

539
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:01,080
 The tabernacle represents the presence of God

540
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,940
 in the Old Testament.

541
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,660
 That God is living in the midst of his people

542
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,900
 and his people will worship him.

543
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:11,080
 And I wanna bring out two points

544
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,620
 about worship and tabernacle.

545
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,320
 And there are two main points.

546
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:22,260
 When the people, when Moses received the plan,

547
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,080
 the blueprint of tabernacle,

548
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,080
 look how the people are being commanded to do.

549
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:29,200
 The Lord said to Moses,

550
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,460
 "Tell the people of Israel to bring me sacred offerings.

551
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:38,060
 Accept a contribution from all those hearts

552
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:40,580
 are moved to offer them."

553
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,180
 And here's the list of sacred offerings

554
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,420
 you may accept with them.

555
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:49,420
 Gold, silver, bronze, all sorts of expensive items.

556
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:54,460
 You're gonna bring them as offerings

557
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:56,280
 to build the tabernacle.

558
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,400
 Verse eight, God said,

559
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:03,280
 "Have the people of Israel build me a holy sanctuary

560
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,020
 so I can live among them."

561
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:09,140
 You must build this tabernacle and its furnishings

562
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,540
 exactly according to the pattern I will show you.

563
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,740
 God is saying, "I will have the people

564
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,820
 to build me a sanctuary, build me a camping tent

565
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:22,820
 so that I can camp among them, I can live among them

566
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:27,820
 so that they can worship me and I can be their people."

567
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,820
 And you're gonna do so according to the plan

568
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:32,540
 that I have for you.

569
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,520
 Here, "Tell the people of Israel to bring me,"

570
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,820
 not the second best, not the leftover,

571
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:42,260
 "Bring them the best things that they have."

572
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:45,600
 They have gold and silver because when they left Egypt,

573
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,700
 they plundered Egypt, they conquered Egypt,

574
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:54,700
 and the Egyptians gave them all these good things, right?

575
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:57,380
 Treasures, gold and silver.

576
00:28:57,380 --> 00:29:01,240
 So they're carrying all those gold and silver items

577
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,020
 with them out of Egypt.

578
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:08,500
 And God is saying, "You need to offer them to me

579
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,740
 to build this tabernacle so that I can build,

580
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:14,180
 I can live among you."

581
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:16,700
 You see the principle here is generous offering.

582
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:23,300
 How blessed we are that we can build the presence of God

583
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,620
 in the midst of us.

584
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,340
 God does not need the people of Israel

585
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,540
 to build him a tabernacle.

586
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,820
 God doesn't need that.

587
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,320
 God can send angels to build a tabernacle,

588
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:39,440
 but he wants his people to participate

589
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:40,660
 in the act of worship.

590
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:45,340
 God want his people to participate in worship.

591
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:48,440
 And that's why we come to worship,

592
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,240
 not because we deserve it,

593
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,380
 but God is willing to live among us

594
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:57,180
 and give us the opportunity to sing praises to him,

595
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,140
 to worship him and to serve him.

596
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:03,380
 God does not need you or need me to worship him.

597
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,960
 It's all by grace.

598
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,720
 And that's why when we build our church,

599
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:12,760
 when we build the body of Christ,

600
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,260
 the presence of God,

601
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,460
 we are called to make offerings, generous offering.

602
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:26,360
 Have you ever thought why we don't do offerings?

603
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 Sometimes we just don't believe that God is good, right?

604
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,160
 Sometimes we just don't believe God is generous, right?

605
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:43,160
 But the Bible show us once and again, God is generous.

606
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:46,360
 God is so good to you and to me.

607
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:50,080
 And that's why we can offer our generous offering

608
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:52,900
 to build his presence, to build the tabernacle.

609
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,960
 Just like those days, the people of Israel were called

610
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:59,440
 to bring in the gold and silver and all these good things.

611
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,920
 They can build the tabernacle

612
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:03,720
 so that God will live among them.

613
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:07,960
 And secondly, is to be holy.

614
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:12,960
 Leviticus 28, God said, "Keep all my decrees

615
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,840
 "by putting them into practice,

616
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,880
 "for I am the Lord who makes you holy."

617
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,040
 Now, what does it mean?

618
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,640
 Holiness or being holy means separated,

619
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,720
 that you're different, right?

620
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:28,660
 That's what the basic meaning of holy is.

621
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:33,840
 Be holy means be different, be separated

622
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,880
 from all the nations, from all those people

623
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,000
 who don't worship God himself.

624
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,080
 And you are different, you got to be holy,

625
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,480
 and you got to keep the words of God

626
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:48,280
 and put them into practice.

627
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,540
 And that is the principle of worship.

628
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:55,740
 We come to worship, it's not just about singing praises.

629
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,700
 We got to conduct our lives according to the will of God.

630
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,700
 Because God is living among us when we observe his law,

631
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:09,620
 when we follow his words willingly.

632
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:14,160
 Two principle out of tabernacle.

633
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,340
 Now, of course, you're gonna say,

634
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,840
 "Okay, we don't need a tabernacle today," right?

635
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:21,300
 You can go to southern Israel

636
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:26,300
 and visit the one-to-one replica.

637
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,700
 Do we need a tabernacle?

638
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,180
 We don't.

639
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,000
 Why?

640
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,900
 Because we are in the era of New Testament.

641
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,580
 Christ has come, Christ has come.

642
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,500
 And Christ is the perfect priest.

643
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,140
 He is the perfect high priest,

644
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,820
 and he offer himself as the perfect sacrifice.

645
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:48,340
 That's why we don't need the lamb,

646
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:51,700
 offer the sheep as burnt offering today.

647
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,700
 Because the Old Testament era is gone,

648
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,500
 and the way of worship is different.

649
00:32:56,500 --> 00:33:00,820
 In the Old Testament, people worship God

650
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,320
 in the tabernacle or around the tabernacle.

651
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,760
 In the New Testament, we worship God in Christ.

652
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,100
 It's not in a place, it's not in a spot on the map,

653
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,880
 but in Christ.

654
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:17,780
 So in the New Testament, there was no more animal sacrifices.

655
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:20,060
 There was no more Aaron the high priest.

656
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:22,700
 There was no more tabernacle, physical tabernacle,

657
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:24,260
 because Christ has come.

658
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,220
 But I wanna show you this verse, John chapter 1, 14.

659
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:31,900
 Now, as I read John chapter 1, 14,

660
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:35,300
 you try to guess which word is related to tabernacle.

661
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,860
 All right?

662
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,840
 John 1, 14.

663
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:42,460
 So the word, speaking of Jesus,

664
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:46,220
 became human and made his home among us.

665
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:52,300
 He was full of unfailing love, grace, and faithfulness.

666
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,660
 And we have seen his glory,

667
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,560
 the glory of the Father's one and only Son.

668
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:02,120
 Where you see the word related to tabernacle here?

669
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,700
 Home, right?

670
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:08,960
 Made his home among us.

671
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,140
 The word became flesh.

672
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:15,020
 Jesus Christ came as God incarnate.

673
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:18,860
 Made flesh and made his home among us.

674
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,860
 Actually, the original Greek term is tabernacle.

675
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:28,660
 God made his tabernacle among us,

676
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:31,200
 or God tabernacle among us.

677
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,960
 God's glamping among us, camping among us,

678
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,940
 living in the midst of us.

679
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:39,500
 So that when we see Jesus, when we see the record of Jesus,

680
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:44,500
 we see the glory of the Father, the glory of the true God.

681
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,420
 And that is the beginning of the Gospel of John,

682
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,100
 chapter 1, 14.

683
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,900
 And then at the end of Gospel of John, chapter 17,

684
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:57,060
 after the Last Supper, Jesus prayed a prayer,

685
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:00,940
 and we call that prayer the High Priest Prayer.

686
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:03,820
 He was like a high priest.

687
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:08,220
 And one of the verses that describe

688
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,860
 Jesus' High Priest Prayer was 1722.

689
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,660
 And Jesus said, "I have given my disciples

690
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:20,660
 "the glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one.

691
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:25,740
 "I have given them the glory, I have shown them the glory,"

692
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,860
 which is the glory of the cross,

693
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:30,220
 that he was willing to die on the cross

694
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,020
 to redeem all of us.

695
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:35,380
 "I have given them the glory, I have shown them the glory,

696
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,140
 "so that they may be one as we are one."

697
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,580
 He's like the high priest,

698
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:43,340
 bring in the glory of God

699
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:48,860
 to his disciples, to us, to the church, right?

700
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:53,420
 Now, we don't need the tabernacle because Christ came.

701
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:57,220
 Christ is the tabernacle, that's why we worship in Christ.

702
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,800
 That's why we pray in Christ.

703
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,140
 Now, however, there are all sorts of sanctuary terms

704
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:08,580
 or temple terms to describe the people of God

705
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,340
 in the New Testament.

706
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:12,100
 And I wanna close with this verse,

707
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:16,460
 1 Corinthians 3.16.

708
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,140
 Now, you know the letter of 1 Corinthians

709
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:20,940
 is written to the church in Corinth.

710
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,340
 And we know the home churches in Corinth

711
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,060
 had a lot of problems.

712
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,400
 They have divisions among them,

713
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,340
 they have separation among them,

714
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,580
 they have arguments in the midst of them,

715
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:35,060
 and they are fighting for different things.

716
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,740
 And it's a very problematic church.

717
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:41,260
 And the pastor, Paul, wrote this letter to them

718
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:43,180
 to warn them and to teach them

719
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,700
 how to live as a worshiping community.

720
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,540
 In chapter three, verse 16,

721
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,020
 he reminds the Christians in Corinth,

722
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,900
 he said, "Don't you realize that all of you together

723
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,140
 "are the temple of God?"

724
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:02,140
 Wait, I thought the temple of God is stone building.

725
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:07,280
 No, Paul said, "Because Christ lives in you.

726
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,740
 "You guys, you together, when you meet together,

727
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:14,820
 "when you are a family of God, you are the temple of God."

728
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,660
 And what is the temple of God?

729
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:19,380
 What is the sanctuary of God or tabernacle of God?

730
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,140
 It's God's home, right?

731
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,140
 God is living in the midst of the temple, right?

732
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,220
 The temple is God's home.

733
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:33,220
 And Paul is saying, "You guys are the home of God.

734
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:38,220
 "You guys are the embodiment of the presence of God.

735
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:41,040
 "You together are the temple of God

736
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,720
 "and that the Spirit lives in you."

737
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,720
 And you have to realize that.

738
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:49,160
 When we congregate together, when we meet together,

739
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,280
 no matter what size of your congregation,

740
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,440
 if you call on the name of God,

741
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,040
 if you pray to the name of Jesus,

742
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,980
 we are the community of faith, we are the church.

743
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:02,000
 At the same time, we are the temple of God.

744
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,300
 God is living in the midst of us.

745
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,720
 In 17, it's a huge warning.

746
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:13,740
 He warns the Christian in Corinth,

747
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:17,500
 "God will destroy anyone who destroys his temple.

748
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:22,600
 "For God's temple is holy and you are that temple."

749
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,640
 Let me read that again.

750
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:30,180
 "God will destroy anyone who destroy this temple."

751
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,980
 And who is, what is this temple?

752
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:35,900
 The church in Corinth, right?

753
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,460
 The church people.

754
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:39,460
 We are the temple.

755
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:43,020
 "And God will destroy anyone who destroy this temple.

756
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,020
 "For God's temple is holy and you guys are the temple."

757
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,820
 Do you realize what, it's so great of God's grace.

758
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:58,300
 God lives, choose to live in the midst of us, right?

759
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,420
 Not that we deserve it, right?

760
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:05,500
 We are all broken and sinners, right?

761
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:07,980
 We all have our own flaws.

762
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:12,660
 However, God chooses to live in the midst of his people

763
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,140
 who call on the name of Jesus.

764
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:17,020
 And that's why we need to do everything

765
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:19,260
 to build up this temple.

766
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,740
 That's why we need to do everything

767
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,940
 to build up this community, this church.

768
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:25,740
 Because we understand the New Testament,

769
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:29,220
 the Bible tells us that we are the embodiment,

770
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,820
 the presence of God.

771
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,080
 When someone walk into our church,

772
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:39,980
 let's say that that person is not a Christian yet.

773
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,300
 It's not a believer yet.

774
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,300
 He walked in.

775
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:45,560
 How can he see the presence of God?

776
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,560
 He see the presence of God through us, right?

777
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:53,940
 Paul is saying to the Corinthian Christians,

778
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,940
 "If you are fighting against each other,

779
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,540
 "people cannot see God, right?

780
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,860
 "People cannot see the holy presence of God."

781
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,460
 He warns them, "If you destroy this temple,

782
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,900
 "God will destroy him."

783
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,580
 Because God's temple, God's home is holy, right?

784
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:19,060
 In the same way, that is a reminder for all of us,

785
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:24,220
 not to destroy, but to build up, build up the temple,

786
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:28,900
 build up God's home so that God will be glorified, right?

787
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,380
 And that is the essence of worship.

788
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:34,860
 And brothers and sisters, I pray, I pray that

789
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,620
 we will be faithful, we'll be faithful

790
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,020
 to build up God's temple, God's church.

791
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,500
 Now, you have to see it by faith.

792
00:40:47,500 --> 00:40:48,900
 You have to see it by faith.

793
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,980
 You cannot see with your flashy eyes.

794
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,060
 You have to see it by faith.

795
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:57,940
 We see each other, the sister and brother in Christ.

796
00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:00,380
 We have to see it by faith that God is living

797
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:01,860
 in the midst of us.

798
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,580
 When we pray for one another, when we worship together,

799
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:07,260
 God is living and dwelling in the midst of us

800
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:12,300
 so that our worship can bear the witness to the world,

801
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,660
 to tell other people God is real

802
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:16,980
 and God is worthy of our worship.

803
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,220
 Let us all pray together.

804
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:22,780
 Father, we come before you and ask that you will forgive us.

805
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:28,700
 At times, we just trivialize worship.

806
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:34,900
 And we thought we'd just come together and sing some songs.

807
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,900
 No, it is not.

808
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,780
 By your grace, you dwell among us.

809
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,700
 And we are your people, and we are your temple, holy temple.

810
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,740
 And God, I pray that you will renew our faith,

811
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:52,100
 renew our commitment to you,

812
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,580
 that we'll be your real people,

813
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:57,340
 knowing that you live among us.

814
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,940
 And thank you for being our God, and we can be your people.

815
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:06,060
 Let our worship be holy and pleasing to you.

816
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:09,100
 Let our worship be a witness to the world,

817
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:11,300
 to other people, that you are real

818
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,940
 and you are worthy of our praises.

819
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:17,460
 So pray that you will renew our spirit of worship,

820
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,500
 our sense of wonder, wonder of your grace,

821
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:25,460
 all and so awesome of your grace,

822
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,900
 that we can be called to worship you in your presence

823
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:30,900
 in Christ, and pray.

824
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:36,220
 Well, God bless all of you, and next week, okay,

825
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:40,780
 we're gonna do our act of worship together, all right?

826
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:42,260
 Let's do it faithfully.

827
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:44,540
 Let's do it in a way that is pleasing to God.

828
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,100
 All right, see you next Sunday.
