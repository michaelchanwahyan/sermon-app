[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   you up to the service. Thank you guys. Oh, Mark.
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:14.520]   I want to say hi to one another. Give a handshake or a high five, you know, to your
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:19.120]   neighbors. What a blessing to be here and to worship together.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:25.080]   That's it. That's it. OK.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.400]   As you can tell, I'm suffering from a very mild form of coming cold, so I usually
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.960]   don't wear a mask, but, you know, I wear a mask.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.800]   So people are pretty surprised this morning and asked me why I'm wearing a mask.
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.960]   You know, as you can tell, you know, I don't want to spread germs.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.400]   So but it's very mild form of coming cold.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.200]   I'm coming to the end of it.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.840]   So so praise God for for the opportunity to to worship together because, you know,
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.880]   showing up here, you know, not being sick, not being sick enough to be to be absent.
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.160]   It's a blessing, right?
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.920]   It's a blessing to sit with, you know, brother and sister in Christ to worship
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.280]   together and to think about the word, especially in this coming weeks as the
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.760]   Holy Week approaches us.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.480]   The Good Friday, the Palm Sunday, next Sunday and then Good Friday and Easter
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:25.200]   Sunday is the best time to reflect and to think about what the love of Christ
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.520]   really means for us.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:35.160]   And there's nothing that is better is to go into the word of God, to come to the
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:40.200]   scripture. And last week, as you remember, we were talking about the last days of
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.480]   Jesus, the last week of Jesus.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:45.840]   And we were at chapter 12 of the Gospel of John.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.080]   And we brought out a couple of points when we studied the story in chapter 12 of
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.280]   Gospel of John, the Mary of Bethany.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.760]   He annoyed the feet of Jesus with the most expensive perfume and she broke the jar
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.360]   and just started to annoy Jesus.
[00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.440]   And the purpose of it is to prepare for the death of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:22.960]   So, in the perspective of Mary, she knew the cross was necessary.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.560]   So, there was the first point.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.000]   The first point is a big point.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.320]   The necessity of the cross.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:35.720]   She saw that Jesus had to die, had to die to pay for the sin, for sinners to
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.400]   accomplish the work of salvation on the cross.
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.880]   So, the cross was necessary.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.440]   Jesus has to die.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.360]   That's why she prepared Jesus' body ahead of time.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.000]   And then, in the same story, we see another character, Judas, who betrayed
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.520]   Jesus, and we see the foolishness of the cross.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.560]   And certainly, for Judas, he could not see any wisdom from the cross.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.760]   And he was following a leader, the Messiah, for his political need to provide
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.920]   some sort of practical solution to his issue, to the issue of his day.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.640]   It's the political problem.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.880]   The Roman Empire was the political problem for the Jewish people.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.160]   So, they were looking for a political Messiah.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.720]   Of course, for Judas, this Messiah, Jesus, does not fit the profile that
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.760]   they were looking for.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.080]   So, there he goes.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.440]   He only saw the foolishness of the cross.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.040]   So, now we are on chapter 13.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.720]   Chapter 13.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.240]   Let me read the scripture.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.120]   It's a familiar story.
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.760]   I'm sure you heard about it.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.920]   So, let's read John chapter 13.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:54.160]   "Before the Passover celebration, Jesus knew that his hour had come to leave
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.240]   this world and return to his Father.
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.360]   He had loved his disciples during his ministry on earth, and now Jesus loved
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:04.520]   them to the very end.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:10.600]   It was time for supper, and the devil had already prompted Judas, son of Simon
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   Zechariah, to betray Jesus.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.680]   Jesus knew that the Father had given him authority over everything and that he had
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.600]   come from God and would return to God.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:30.200]   So, he got up from the table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel around his waist.
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.520]   He poured water into a basin, and he began to wash the feet of the disciples,
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.600]   drying them with the towel he had around him.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.120]   When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, 'Lord, are you going to wash
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.360]   my feet?'
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:51.640]   Jesus answered, 'You don't understand now what I'm doing, but someday you will.'
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.880]   'No,' Peter protested, 'you will never, ever wash my feet.'
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.200]   Jesus replied, 'Unless I wash you, you will not belong to me.'
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:06.720]   Simon Peter exclaimed, 'Then wash my hands and head as well, not just my feet.'
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.600]   Jesus replied, 'A person who has bathed all over does not need to wash except for
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.200]   the feet to be entirely clean.
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:19.120]   And you disciples are clean, but not all of you.'
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.240]   For Jesus knew who would betray him.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.480]   This is what he meant when he said, 'Not all of you are clean.'
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.240]   After washing the feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked,
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.440]   'Do you guys understand what I'm doing?
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:42.680]   You call me teacher and Lord, and you are right because that is what I am.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.560]   And since I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet,
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.320]   you ought to wash each other's feet.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.240]   I've given you an example to follow.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.120]   Do as I have done to you.'
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.640]   This is the word of God.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.680]   Pardon my extra bass voice.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.200]   I know it's sexy, but...
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:08.680]   Yeah, I struggle whether I should preach today, but, you know, I got a little bit better.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.440]   So thank God for answering my prayer.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.040]   Otherwise, I will call on some of you to substitute the preaching today,
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.400]   especially you, Moody students.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.680]   I'll call on you Saturday night and say, 'I cannot preach, okay?
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.720]   You should preach.'
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.520]   All right.
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.800]   So God bless you today.
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.880]   All right.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:28.560]   Now, back to the story, okay?
[00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.560]   The story.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.120]   Jesus washing the feet of the disciples.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.800]   Very familiar, right?
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.440]   There are two major points here I want to point out.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:42.200]   First one is that when we talk about foot washing,
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.800]   so often we can think of is this iconic painting, all right?
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.400]   What is the name of this painting?
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.760]   Last breakfast, lunch, or supper?
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.920]   Supper, right?
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:56.760]   Supper.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.240]   Da Vinci's.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.080]   So it was back in the 1600, I think.
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:05.200]   Yeah, he drew this iconic picture.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.320]   And as you can see in this picture, 15th century painting,
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.440]   one long dining table, and Jesus is at the center.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.120]   Can you see Jesus?
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:21.160]   He's right at the center, and six disciples line up on his left,
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.200]   and then six others on his right.
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.120]   So this painting reflects the dinner setting at the time of the painting,
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.920]   15th century, 16th century, the time of Renaissance.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.480]   European setting, European dining table, right?
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.760]   Something we are more familiar with, the dining setting.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:54.120]   But as you know, in Jesus' day, the setting of supper is quite different.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.360]   And you remember, as we read the story,
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:02.280]   this is probably the last evening of Jesus' spend with his disciples.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:04.960]   And as we know from the storyline,
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.720]   John 13 is the last evening, last dinner with his disciples.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:17.160]   And it was probably on Thursday evening, Thursday evening.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.640]   And the next day is so-called Passover and the Shabbat.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.200]   And Jesus and his disciples gathered together,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.920]   probably in a pretty big room.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.280]   And the Bible says it's an upper room.
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:31.960]   It's an upper room.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:33.640]   It's on the second floor.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.800]   So it's a big dining area.
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:42.920]   And they set up for their last supper, Jesus' last supper.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:49.160]   And it was probably a formal Passover meal of Jewish people.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:52.480]   At this time, it's the Passover season,
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:59.680]   and people were getting ready in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover meal.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.560]   The setting of Jesus' day is different.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:06.600]   What we call, when they sit together to have dinner,
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.640]   it's not a long dining table.
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:14.320]   It's actually something called triclinium.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.440]   As you can tell from the word, triclinium is to recline.
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:27.160]   And there are three tables or three couches reclined, forming a U-shape.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.360]   Now, back in the days of Jesus, under Roman occupation,
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:37.240]   many of the Jewish people actually welcomed some of the Roman lifestyle.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.760]   And this is one of them.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.800]   This is one of them, triclinium.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.800]   So one day, one meal a year, the most important meal, the Passover meal,
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:49.320]   they would dine in the Roman style.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.000]   And that is the Roman style they would imitate.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.200]   Triclinium is to have all the guests, all the people dining together.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.080]   They will recline together.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.120]   And then the food would be in the center.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:10.640]   You would recline on your left side, lying on your left side,
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.640]   and your right hand would be free to reach out to the food in the center.
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:16.360]   All right?
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:22.160]   So it's a U-shape, and then the center is for the waiter or waitress or the busboy.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:23.240]   Right?
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.720]   They will serve the food, and then you ask for refill.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:27.480]   The servant will do it for you.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:34.280]   And your legs, as I explained before, your legs will be sticking out.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:34.880]   Right?
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:39.160]   So your legs, your feet, away from the food.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:45.000]   And you stick your feet out there as you enjoy the feast.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.440]   And then the servant in the midst of them will do the foot washing.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.920]   Will do the foot washing.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.680]   Now, something more about the triclinium.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:00.240]   Something more about the Roman way of dining.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.760]   Is that the seating arrangement, where you sit,
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:15.320]   where you sit around the triclinium, there's different levels of honor.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:20.880]   This is pretty much the same as a traditional Chinese or Asian culture.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.560]   I remember years ago, I visited southern China,
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.440]   and then we were meeting with some church leaders and city officials.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.240]   So I remember one evening, we went out to a restaurant,
[00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.520]   to a private room, a dining room.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.520]   And then we went to the dining hall, and there was a big round table, right?
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:45.320]   The Chinese table, usually round, right?
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.560]   So we went into the room, and back then I was a young guy.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.400]   Right?
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:54.320]   So I still remember I walked into that room with a bunch of elders
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.280]   and people who are much older than me, right?
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:01.880]   And do you know what you should do and how you should behave?
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:04.240]   You do not sit.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:08.160]   You are told where to sit, right?
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.480]   So the city officials, the big guys, right?
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.120]   They are probably the oldest person in the room, the elder.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:19.720]   He will sit first, and he will assign a seat, right?
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:22.480]   So, you know, beside him, right or left,
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:29.720]   you know, probably other governors or city officials or government workers.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:36.000]   And then come alongside, and then the last one being probably the youngest one.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.240]   So it is a culture of honor and shame.
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:48.040]   So even where you sit, where you sit, it is a matter of honor or shame.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.480]   This is the same way in the Roman triclinium arrangement.
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:58.360]   Every seat is prearranged from the elder to the least,
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.320]   from the greatest to the least, from the eldest to the youngest.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:06.400]   It's a culture of honor and shame.
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:12.880]   So if we map out the triclinium, the host, okay, the host,
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:17.200]   probably a little bit small, the font, but that's okay.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:25.120]   The host will be on the left, sitting second to the left.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.160]   And the guest of honor on his left.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.720]   And the trusted friend, another guest of honor,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:36.280]   usually the youngest, on the right side of the host.
[00:13:36.280 --> 00:13:41.640]   And then the seating will continue in a clockwise direction,
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.880]   often from the older and then all the way to the youngest.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:51.800]   And then on the lower right, on our lower right,
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.080]   would be the seat of the least honor.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:01.120]   And usually the youngest person or the servant
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.280]   would be sitting in the lower right.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.120]   Now as you can tell, triclinium in the Roman culture
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:13.760]   is a symbol of political power.
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:15.880]   It's all about domination.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:19.120]   It's all about who's going to sit at the highest honor,
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.240]   who's going to take the least honor.
[00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:26.640]   The ruling class, the leaders, would exercise their right
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:29.800]   and their power over other people.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:33.560]   So you come into the dining room of Roman triclinium,
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:37.600]   you will feel that this is not just a meal.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.800]   You know, it's politics.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.160]   It's all about power.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.480]   It's all about dignity and about honor.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.600]   Now if you map this out in such a way
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.520]   that Jesus is the host,
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.480]   he would be sitting on the second to the left, right?
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.640]   He's the host, Jesus there.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:06.200]   And then probably on Jesus' left is Judah.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:10.680]   And then on his right is the youngest of the 12,
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:12.520]   Apostle John.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.040]   And then on the other side of the dining hall
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.600]   is Peter himself, Simon Peter.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.320]   Now why did I say that?
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.560]   Because there are different details
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:26.520]   in the Last Supper stories from all four Gospels.
[00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:28.960]   There are different details that tell us
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:33.920]   actually this is how they arrange the seating positions
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:35.480]   in the Last Supper.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.440]   Let me give you an example.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.240]   Now remember this map, right?
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.640]   This is where you sit.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.200]   This is where Jesus is.
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:44.640]   If you're Simon Peter, where are you?
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:46.480]   You're on the list, right?
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:47.880]   By the door.
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.480]   So, you know, he is in the position of servanthood.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.160]   John, probably the youngest among the 12,
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.880]   and we know John died the last among the 12, right?
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.600]   He was also the author of the last book of New Testament,
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.080]   the Book of Revelation.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.360]   So naturally we would think that John is the youngest guy.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.160]   Judah is right next to Jesus and sharing the same bowl,
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.120]   dipping food into the bowl and enjoy the food together.
[00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:21.920]   So Jesus and Judah's probably are very close to each other.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:24.320]   So if you remember this map,
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.400]   you remember this seating arrangement,
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:32.680]   let me turn to one of the verses in chapter 13,
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.920]   talking about the Last Supper.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:39.800]   You would immediately understand,
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:43.280]   all details here would immediately make sense.
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:50.400]   The story goes, when Jesus says, "Someone will betray me."
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:55.600]   He said, "Among you 12, someone would betray me."
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:17:00.520]   Verse 22, the disciples look at each other,
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.520]   wondering whom he could mean.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.560]   The disciple Jesus loved,
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:08.760]   probably John himself, right?
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.360]   He's the beloved disciple.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:12.600]   He wrote the Gospel of John.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.560]   He's the youngest guy.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:17.680]   Now, how is he being described?
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.720]   The disciple Jesus loved John,
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:21.720]   was sitting next to Jesus at the table.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:27.600]   Simon Peter motioned to him, motioned to John and asked,
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.400]   who is Jesus talking about?
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:35.400]   But why didn't Peter go ask Jesus himself?
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:38.960]   Well, the only reason is because in the triclinium,
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.280]   he's the farthest guy away from Jesus.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.480]   He could not ask Jesus personally, individually.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.600]   So he has to motion to John.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.160]   John is right next to, actually in front of,
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:55.160]   on the right side, reclining in front of Jesus.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.320]   So he motioned to him and asked,
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:58.680]   who is Jesus talking about?
[00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:03.880]   So that the disciple leaned over to Jesus,
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   remember they're reclining,
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:09.240]   and asked, "Lord Jesus, who is it?
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:11.720]   "Who is it going to betray you?"
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:15.560]   Jesus respond, "It is the one to whom I give the bread
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:16.720]   "I dip in the bowl."
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.480]   And when Jesus had dip it, he gave it to Judas,
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:24.120]   not Peter, right?
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.520]   If he had to give it to Peter, he has to throw it over,
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:30.520]   right, give it next to Judas.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:33.320]   So immediately you understand,
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.560]   the gospel description reflecting the local Roman,
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:44.240]   or Roman Jewish, you know, high class triclinium dining,
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.480]   you know, fashion.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:49.680]   They're sitting around the U-shape, reclining,
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.720]   feet sticking out, right?
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.680]   And then the background give us, you know,
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:01.680]   some more, you know, some more ways to understand
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:03.920]   some of the biblical descriptions.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:07.760]   And I think this background brings about
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.160]   some of the surprises in the story.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:14.360]   Some of the big surprises.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:17.120]   Perhaps the story is too familiar to us,
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:21.000]   and that sense of surprise, that sense of, you know,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.840]   ha-ha, you know, it's gone.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.520]   But let's revisit.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:29.520]   You know, in those days, everybody wear sandals.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.360]   Everybody wear sandals.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.680]   Anyone wear sandals today?
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.320]   Open toes.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.960]   You wear sandals and you go to the dining hall,
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.040]   from your home to the dining hall,
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.040]   your feet bound to pick up some dirt, right?
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.880]   Stinky feet, dirty feet.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:51.640]   And foot washing in those days
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:56.400]   is a necessary part of dinner arrangement.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:02.200]   You gotta have someone do the foot washing for you, right?
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:07.200]   Usually people of lowest ranking class,
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:12.400]   servants, slaves, women, or widows,
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   they are being tasked to do such things.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.760]   They are the waitress, they are the busboys,
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:21.560]   or they are the servers.
[00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.080]   So they are the foot washers as well.
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:26.720]   Now, then you can understand why
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.000]   in some of the gospel stories,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.480]   talking about in the Last Supper,
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:35.440]   the disciples were arguing against one another,
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.120]   who is gonna be the greatest,
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.400]   and who is gonna be the least, right?
[00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:41.160]   Remember some of those stories?
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.080]   You know, why did they argue about it?
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.960]   Well, there's a practical need to argue about it.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.440]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:49.560]   Someone has to do foot washing, right?
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.920]   Now, Jesus is the host, He arranged the entire dinner.
[00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:58.600]   What He missed doing, He didn't do one thing right.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.400]   Jesus didn't do one thing right.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:04.360]   He did not arrange a servant among them.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.120]   He did not hire a servant, right?
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:10.160]   He did get the Airbnb and get the dining hall ready,
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:12.200]   but nobody's gonna serve, right?
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:16.000]   So all the 12 disciples show up in the dining hall,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:17.720]   what food is being served,
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.680]   but there's no one among us
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.360]   to do the most necessary part, right?
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:24.200]   Because our sandals, our feet,
[00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.560]   when we took off our sandals,
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.480]   our feet are full of dirt, right?
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:30.960]   And part of the manner of dining in Trichilium
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.400]   is to have your feet washed, right?
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.200]   Think about our culture, the dining custom.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:44.440]   When we sit down in, say, a Chinese restaurant, right?
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:48.480]   What's the first thing that is necessary
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:49.400]   when you sit down?
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:52.600]   Tea.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:57.040]   Somebody has to bring tea or ice water.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.160]   Somebody has to do that, right?
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.600]   You expect that.
[00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:03.320]   It's kind of our cultural expectation or cultural values.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:07.800]   In Jesus' day, around the Trichilium,
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:11.320]   people would expect the first thing.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:14.680]   We come in, a servant will wash our feet, right?
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.320]   That's why they argue against one another.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.240]   Who's gonna do it now, right?
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.120]   Oh, Jesus didn't, forgot probably,
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:26.000]   forgot to book a maid servant, right?
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.720]   And nobody would be so disrespectful
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.000]   and say, "Teacher, you missed something."
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.280]   Nobody would do that.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.200]   That's why among the 12, they would have to argue.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.160]   They have to figure out,
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.560]   "Hey, when we got to have our feet washed,
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.000]   "who's gonna be the one, right?"
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:49.040]   And then as they come to the table, surprise, surprise, right?
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.320]   Jesus put all the 12 in a clockwise position.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   On this right is youngest disciple, John.
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.680]   On his left is Judas.
[00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:04.600]   And then clockwise, and then to the last one,
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:05.920]   is Simon Peter.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:07.240]   Now that's a surprise,
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:10.920]   because Peter has been the head among the 12, right?
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.040]   He is the best Sunday school student, right?
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:15.520]   He always answer the questions often wrong,
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.520]   but he's the most active student among the 12.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.040]   And he's actually the one of the closest to Jesus.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.640]   And surprise, surprise to Simon Peter.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:32.640]   He's sitting right next to the door, the least position.
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:39.720]   The surprise is, Jesus is doing the foot washing.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:45.080]   Jesus got up and he did it.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.440]   And look at what Jesus did.
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:50.120]   Jesus knew that the Father had given him
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:51.560]   authority over everything,
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.400]   that he had come from God and would return to God soon.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   So Jesus got up from the table, from the triclinium.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.880]   He took off his robe,
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.080]   wrapped a towel around his waist,
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.000]   and poured water into a basin.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.160]   There, then he began to wash the feet of the disciples,
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:21.240]   and then dry them one by one with towel around him.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.680]   Now, as you can tell, I highlight all the verbs here.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.440]   If you read the Gospel of John from chapter one
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.040]   all the way to this chapter, chapter 13,
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.880]   you understand the narrator or the author,
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.120]   it's like a cameraman.
[00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.440]   It's like a cameraman.
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:41.720]   At this point, it was pretty fast
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.760]   from chapter one to chapter 12.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:46.240]   Boom, boom, boom, miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles.
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:47.680]   And talking, talking, talking.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:50.240]   All the controversials about Jesus,
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:52.000]   all the teachings about Jesus.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.960]   One chapter after the other, pretty fast, pretty fast.
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:59.520]   And then come to chapter 13, it comes to a slow-mo.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:04.400]   You know, just zoom in to the actions, right?
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:05.360]   You know, all the verbs, you know,
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:07.960]   just two verses, four and five.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.760]   He rose, he lay aside, he took up a towel,
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:15.840]   he wrapped around his waist, poured water out,
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:22.080]   and then washed their feet, and wiped dry their feet.
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.600]   It is not domination.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:29.000]   It is not Roman politics.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.880]   It is servanthood.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:35.480]   The greatest becomes the least.
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.680]   It's all about serving.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.840]   Now, do not miss, please do not miss
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.720]   the significance of this story.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:47.440]   It's not just a nice, warm story about servanthood,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.400]   about Jesus washing the feet of a disciple.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.080]   It's not just an act of servanthood.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.640]   It foreshadows something else.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.200]   It foreshadows something that's gonna happen soon,
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:03.080]   which is the crucifixion of Jesus.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:08.560]   He took off his majesty.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.960]   He stood up, he took it off,
[00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:16.000]   and he took on the form of servant,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.120]   and then he died on the cross.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.200]   He poured out his blood this time, pretty soon.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:27.480]   On Calvary, not water, but like water,
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.960]   he poured out his blood to be the least.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.120]   And remember in one of the seven words,
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.960]   one of seven last words of Jesus on the cross,
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.240]   one of them in the Gospel of John
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:45.280]   is that Jesus said, "I am thirsty."
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:50.880]   The living water become thirst.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.280]   So foot washing is not just about serving.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.440]   It points us forward, or what we call foreshadows,
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:01.160]   the cross.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:05.360]   Jesus washing the feet of disciples is to prepare them
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:10.400]   what is he doing ultimately on the cross.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.680]   That's the first point.
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.640]   The second point is that foot washing points
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.920]   toward the way of disciples,
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.320]   the way of how disciples should live.
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.720]   Now why do I say that?
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.400]   I mean, I think the point is obvious
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:30.040]   because in washing the feet of disciples,
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:35.040]   Jesus demonstrates so clearly the true meaning of service,
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.680]   or better, the better way to put it,
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   is the true meaning of using his power.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.400]   We all have power.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.160]   We all have our rights, our privileges.
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:53.200]   You know, especially in American culture,
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.080]   we emphasize power.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:00.000]   We emphasize our rights.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.440]   Nothing wrong with that per se,
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:04.480]   but as we follow Christ,
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.000]   Christ gives us another way of using our power,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.040]   using our rights.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.680]   There are a few points we should point out
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:15.560]   in the last supper,
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:18.280]   especially in the triclinium arrangement.
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:23.280]   First, is that Jesus puts Judas in the seat of honor
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:29.080]   on his left, on his left.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.360]   He took a piece of bread,
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.520]   dip it in the bowl,
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.800]   and give it to Judas.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:40.400]   Judas is not sitting just on his left
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:44.160]   in the seat of honor,
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:45.800]   but for the very first time,
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:47.680]   or very last time,
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:51.200]   Jesus gives him one less reason to betray him.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.040]   One less reason.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.960]   Loving the enemy.
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.840]   Demonstrate clearly.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.160]   Second point.
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:03.840]   I said John should be the youngest among the 12, right?
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.880]   Jesus put him first on his right.
[00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:13.160]   The youngest, the least, is put on the first.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:19.160]   Third, Peter, far right, lower right,
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:23.080]   has been head of the 12,
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.920]   but now Jesus put him last.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:29.120]   The entire Jesus triclinium arrangement
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:36.160]   is some sort of anti-Roman political story.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:41.600]   Jesus said, "This is how you work in the Roman world,
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:45.400]   "but when you come around my table,
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:46.920]   "when you be my disciples,
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:51.080]   "we work in quite different ways."
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.640]   It's an upside-down world, right?
[00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:56.880]   Jesus turned the whole world upside down.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:30:00.640]   The head would be the last, right?
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.800]   The first would be the least.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:05.840]   The oldest would be the servant.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.600]   You know, what does it talk about, discipleship?
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:13.200]   What does it talk about our church, right?
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:18.200]   We have a short series on being a healthy church, right?
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.360]   I think the most healthy church,
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:23.400]   most healthy church culture
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.120]   would be a culture of Jesus' triclinium,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.560]   the Last Supper.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:31.960]   When we come together,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.960]   all powers are being reconfigured.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:40.320]   Everything has changed.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.280]   The configuration of structure,
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:47.160]   social, political power, spiritual power, or whatever.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:51.800]   When you come to the table of Jesus, everything has changed
[00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:58.120]   because He came to serve, not to be served.
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:04.000]   There's a book, a very good book,
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.320]   written by Scott McKnight.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.720]   He used to be a New Testament teacher
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:12.400]   at Northern Seminary, not too far away from us.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:17.240]   He said, the title of the book is "A Church Called Tov."
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:18.840]   Okay, what is it?
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:22.120]   Tov is actually a Hebrew word, means good, goodness.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.400]   All right, good, tov.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:30.040]   So the book talks about a healthy church culture,
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:33.760]   a tov culture, a goodness culture.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.640]   How do we form a goodness culture,
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.880]   especially in our generation?
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.760]   When people look at church
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:45.200]   or established religion,
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.400]   organized religion,
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.480]   they often look at church in a negative way.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:55.560]   There's just so many horrible stories
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.800]   done in the name of God, in the name of the church.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.560]   It's just sobering to hear all the stories.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:04.240]   And Scott McKnight wrote this book,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:07.040]   and he lays out four ways of power.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:11.280]   He said the first way is power over.
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:14.600]   You have domination over other people.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:18.400]   You're in charge, and other people listen to you.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:22.320]   The second way is power to.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:26.720]   You have the power to influence other people.
[00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:29.960]   And the third way is power with,
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:33.880]   to share the spotlight,
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:38.600]   to share power and your platform with other people.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.080]   Let other people speak, let other people lead.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.280]   Empower another person, right?
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:47.760]   Power with.
[00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:52.760]   But the ultimate form of, but but call, exercise of power,
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.080]   Jesus' way, is power for.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.960]   That's what Jesus did.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.680]   He demonstrated to his disciples,
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.960]   to serve, but not to be served.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.960]   The greatest shall be the last.
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.360]   Greatest shall be the least.
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.920]   Now, some of the homework that I wanna give to you.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:17.840]   What does it mean to apply,
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:22.120]   to use our power and use it for, you know, power for?
[00:33:22.120 --> 00:33:25.960]   Couple of points.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.520]   First, forgiveness.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:33.720]   Have you ever thought about forgiveness as an act of power?
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.240]   You decide to forgive someone who has wronged you.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.640]   It is an act of power.
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:45.800]   And biblical forgiveness is an exercise of power for.
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:49.120]   You decide not to retaliate.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:53.640]   You decide to forgive, just like Jesus did.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.320]   Forgiveness.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.960]   Second, giving.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.320]   Giving is also exercise of power for, right?
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.640]   Instead of taking.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:09.760]   Taking, accumulating, is power over.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:14.200]   But in the biblical lifestyle, in discipleship,
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:19.200]   we ought to exercise and continue to exercise power for.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:24.800]   To give is an act of power for other people,
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.760]   for the church, for other ministries.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.120]   Third, serving.
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:35.680]   Serving definitely, ministry definitely, is powerful.
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:39.600]   Let me ask you a question, a very quick question.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   Have you ever done anything to serve other people lately
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:44.920]   without telling anyone?
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:50.400]   Without telling anyone, even your wife or husband,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.680]   your best friend, nobody knows.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:57.840]   You give, you do something for other people, you know?
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:00.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.000]   Powerful.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:05.200]   That is the way of discipleship.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:07.280]   That's how we should act.
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.280]   That is the whole point of Jesus' foot washing
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.640]   for the disciples.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.080]   Let me close with one very short quote, okay?
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:18.920]   Very short quote.
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:24.920]   Back in the 1700s, 1700s, 200 some years ago,
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:28.160]   there was a German missionary.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.080]   His name is Sensendorf.
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:34.600]   It's not very well known.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.760]   Nobody would have interest to know about his life
[00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:40.720]   or what he did.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:43.800]   But there's one saying that he said
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:48.720]   that has been echoed
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.800]   or has touched so many lives.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:58.520]   To remind people what it means to follow Jesus Christ,
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:01.160]   what it means to be his disciples,
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:03.760]   what is the purpose of our life
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:06.680]   as we commit our life to Jesus Christ himself,
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:07.720]   to be Christ's follower.
[00:36:07.720 --> 00:36:08.560]   What does it mean?
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.440]   What is the ultimate purpose?
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:13.240]   And I wanna end today's sermon with this quote.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:14.440]   It's a very short quote.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:21.080]   The quote said, "Preach the gospel, die, be forgotten."
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.560]   Be forgotten.
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:30.080]   That is the ultimate goal of Christian discipleship.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:33.040]   Now, we don't have any problem
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:35.920]   with preaching the gospel usually, right?
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:39.480]   Probably we are afraid of doing so,
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:43.120]   but that's not a big issue, preaching the gospel.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.440]   And we usually have no problem dying, right?
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.520]   Someday you die, someday I die, right?
[00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.480]   You have to die, you know, someday.
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:56.200]   Usually you have no problem with the second part.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:59.840]   Usually we have problem with the last part, the third one.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:00.680]   Be forgotten.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:02.680]   You wanna do something
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.040]   and you wanna prolong so-called your name, right?
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:08.400]   Your reputation or your power.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:14.680]   But this story in John 13
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:19.680]   tells the ultimate purpose for discipleship.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.080]   Follow Christ.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:22.120]   It's not about us.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.200]   It's not about us being served
[00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:28.640]   or us being, you know, feeling good.
[00:37:28.640 --> 00:37:33.560]   It's about us doing something to respond
[00:37:33.560 --> 00:37:38.560]   to the grace of God with our life
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:40.080]   and ultimately be forgotten.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:42.120]   And that's okay.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.320]   Let's work on it.
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.600]   Give our life back to God,
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.320]   God who save us, who redeem us.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.200]   And let's work for His glory,
[00:37:53.200 --> 00:37:56.720]   for God's name, not my name, not your name,
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:01.200]   not even our church's name, not our ministry's name,
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.240]   but for the name of God.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:05.800]   Let God's name be glorified.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.120]   Let Him get glory and we be forgotten.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.320]   Let's pray.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.080]   Father God, we give you thanks
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.880]   because you have demonstrated your love to us.
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:22.080]   You are the one who is greatest
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:27.760]   and you willingly, sacrificially lay down your majesty
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.320]   to come into our midst,
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:34.200]   took on the form of humans,
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:38.440]   took on the form of servant, slave.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.480]   You pour out your life to save us, to redeem us,
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.440]   to bring us back to our Father.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.680]   And we want to give you thanks.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.240]   I pray that this is our prayer,
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:56.080]   to do the work, to preach your gospel.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:01.120]   Then we die and it's okay to be forgotten
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:06.480]   because ultimately your name is what matters
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.960]   in Jesus' name.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
