[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.120]   It is great to be here, to be with you guys, and I want to thank all of you last week for
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:11.320]   covering the operation here and we can continue to worship God.
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.320]   And thank God for a safe journey to serve the churches in Toronto.
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:25.040]   And I want to thank the team of people that came with me and they took care of a lot of
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.400]   things for me, setting up the booth for the Bible conference and that includes Andrea
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.880]   and Sam and Brenda and Amanda.
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.480]   So they came with me and took care of a lot of stuff.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.200]   Originally I thought I could take care of it by myself but actually they helped me a
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200]   lot.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:56.760]   So it was a blessing to be able to serve other churches and other Christians in other areas.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:05.760]   But again we come back and we have a very interesting development in the presidential
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.520]   election and everyone has their attention on this.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.960]   And now that it doesn't settle, we have the President-elect Donald Trump.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.680]   He's going to be in the White House in the next term.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.400]   And it was a big question when I was in Canada.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.040]   Everyone is asking me, "Hey, who's going to be elected?"
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.440]   And it's like I can foretell the future.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.000]   But there's a lot of discussions about who's going to be in the White House.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:43.840]   But in any case, every four years we have this change of who is in power and which political
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.760]   party and political figures are going to be in the White House.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:56.800]   That's why we have this mini-series I want to inject into our thinking and our reflection
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.680]   on the Bible.
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.200]   This series is called "Who is Your Lord?"
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080]   And the Pagan Kings in the Bible.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:09.640]   And I would like to take some of the samples from the Bible, especially from the Old Testament.
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.380]   As you can see from the biblical history, from the pages of the Bible, you have a lot
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.160]   of different kings and kingdoms and empires rise and fall in the entire biblical history.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.800]   All the way from the left you get the Roman Empire, and then Greek, and then Hittite,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:33.560]   and Assyrian Empire, Babylonian Empire, Persian Empire, and down in the south is the Egyptian
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:34.800]   Empire.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:40.400]   And then in the middle of it, that is the center of the ancient world, the land bridge,
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.880]   the land of Israel and Palestine, you got different small kingdoms.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.080]   The Arameans and the Philistines, and of course Israel and Judah right in the middle, in the
[00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.200]   shadow of all the empires.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.200]   As you can tell from this map, and you can get the sense from the Bible, that kingdoms
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.960]   rise and fall, empires rise and fall, and kings do rise and fall.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.760]   Because God is the Lord of history.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.880]   So we want to do this.
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.360]   We want to go through some of the kings, secular kings, pagan kings in the Bible and see what
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.600]   the Bible has to say.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.680]   So this is our procedure.
[00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.640]   Our procedure is first introduce the pagan king found in the Bible, recorded in the Bible,
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.520]   or even named in the Bible, and get their secular profile, you know, like documents
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.560]   outside of the Bible, what do they say about this and that pagan king, and then we go back
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.840]   to the Bible and see what we can reflect upon.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.840]   So this is our procedure.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.040]   We first get the secular profile of the pagan king in this series, and then we go into the
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.040]   Bible.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:50.360]   And the first one I want to choose is, you see the picture there?
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.040]   Cyrus the Great.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.360]   So ring any bell?
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.520]   You know, this king is named in the Bible, in the book of Isaiah, even before he existed.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.400]   So Cyrus the Great.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.760]   This timeline, let me go through this timeline for you.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.000]   You see the purple center spectrum?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.240]   All the way from the left to right is 700 BC, before Christ, 700 years before Christ,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:21.940]   all the way to 500 BC.
[00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.980]   So this period of history, there were a lot happening, as you can tell.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.120]   Let's go through one by one.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.280]   First of all, it's the red one on top.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   You see that?
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.280]   What is that kingdom called?
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   What is that empire called?
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.280]   Assyrian, right?
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:44.960]   From 911 BC to 605 BC, and then it declined.
[00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:53.680]   And what happened here during the Assyrian Empire was that the fall of the northern Israel
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.700]   kingdom Samaria, the fall of Samaria in 722.
[00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:08.260]   So Assyrians, they attacked the land of Israel and they defeated the northern kingdom Israel
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:14.500]   and the capital Samaria fell in 722 BCE.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.940]   And all the way down to go south to the southern kingdom, Judah, it was year 701 BC.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:28.140]   And that was when Hezekiah was reigning in Judah.
[00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:36.180]   And the Assyrians blocked all the exits and entrances to the capital Jerusalem, and they
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.080]   lay siege of the capital, but they failed and they returned.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.780]   So that was 701 BC.
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.700]   So as I said, Assyrian Empire rise and fall.
[00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:57.820]   At the end of 7th century, about 600 something, it begins to weaken.
[00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:02.660]   And then there were two other superpowers in the Middle East that rise up.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.900]   The first one is the blue one, the Median Kingdom, the Median Empire.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.660]   And then south of the Median Empire is the Babylonian Empire.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.380]   And what happened here is that Babylonians continued to attack and continue to expand
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:23.180]   and they came all the way to the southern small kingdom of Judah and they defeated Judah
[00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:29.980]   and fall of Jerusalem happened in 586 BC.
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:38.580]   That's when Assyrians fell and then Babylonians took over the entire world, almost the entire
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.500]   world of the Middle East.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.860]   And then the Median Kingdom, there was something interesting happened.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:48.340]   It fell to the Persian Empire.
[00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:54.620]   Now what happened to the Persian Empire when it rises was that it's because of Cyrus the
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.620]   Great.
[00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:02.340]   Cyrus the Great was a military leader of the Persian people and they rebelled against the
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:09.220]   Medes because they have been serving the Median Empire, the overlord for so many years and
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.340]   they are fed up.
[00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:18.180]   So they rebelled against it and Cyrus the Great let his people defeated the Medes.
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:24.500]   Well, first of all, they rebelled against the Medes in 553 and then within three years
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:31.260]   they actually defeat the entire empire of Median Kingdom and they swallow up the entire
[00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.340]   Middle East.
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:37.540]   So 539, that is a very important year in the biblical history.
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:44.620]   539 BC is Cyrus enters the capital of Babylonian Empire, the city of Babylon, the greatest
[00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:46.420]   city at that time.
[00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.460]   So he entered there peacefully and took over the entire world.
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:59.740]   And 539 is also important for the Jews because as you can tell from 586, the Jews were exiled
[00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:08.100]   to Babylon for about 70 years and then 539 when Persian Empire took over the world, they
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.860]   reversed the policy of the previous kingdom.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:14.580]   They don't keep the people, they don't exile the people, they send the people back and
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:23.260]   send their temple vessels back to their homeland and Jews were one of them that got the benefit.
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:30.780]   So that's when we have the book of Ezra and Nehemiah when they return from Babylon to
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.840]   Jerusalem and we build a temple and we build the city.
[00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:39.620]   So that is what happened for Cyrus the Great.
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:50.660]   Now I want your attention to the last 10 years of the Babylonian Empire which is 555 to 539.
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:55.700]   That is the last 10 or so years at the end of Babylonian Empire.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:04.740]   What happened here was that there were two kings, father and son, Nebunidas and Belshazzar.
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:10.180]   Father and son taking care of the last period of the Babylonian Empire.
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:16.340]   And what happened was that Nebunidas was a very funny king and he didn't worship the
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:22.020]   main god, the biggest god in Babylon, the biggest god being Marduk.
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:29.780]   And he forsake Marduk and he worship the other god of his own family which is the moon god
[00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.380]   called Sin.
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:39.780]   So that made a lot of people in Babylon, especially the capital, not very happy.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:46.220]   There were a lot of social tension and a lot of discontent in the society of Babylon.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:53.380]   Like us, some people are being fed up by what is going on in the society and what is going
[00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:54.820]   on in our nation.
[00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:02.740]   So they wanted to turn around, they wanted to have someone else in power.
[00:10:02.740 --> 00:10:06.500]   So that is what happened in Babylon in the last 10 years.
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:13.540]   Now what happened was that sin is being elevated by Nebunidas.
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:18.020]   As you can tell from this stele, from this relief, that is the king Nebunidas on the
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:24.340]   right and he is having a staff in his left hand and he is raising his right hand, worshipping
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.340]   the three gods.
[00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.240]   You see the moon god, you see the moon right?
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.500]   And then you see the sun and then also the third symbol is Venus.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:39.340]   So he is worshipping the moon and the sun and the stars instead of worshipping the guy
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:48.260]   on the left which is Marduk or Merodoth mentioned in the book of Jeremiah.
[00:10:48.260 --> 00:10:54.300]   Now there was tons of huge discontent among the Babylonians.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:11:01.320]   If you take the poll in the last 10 years of the Babylonian empire, the last 10 years,
[00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:08.060]   you will get the sense it is very low opinion for Nebunidas and his son Belshazzar who is
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.820]   also mentioned in the book of Daniel.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:18.800]   And there was a political vacuum in the last 10 years of the Babylonian empire.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:27.100]   And Cyrus took this opportunity to invade Babylon.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:34.820]   Now you need to understand the ancient context when the king is privileging one god over
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:44.340]   the other, privileging sin over Marduk is a huge thing in the ancient world.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:52.260]   In Babylon there is a yearly annual festival called Akitv.
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:12:00.380]   Every spring around March to April they celebrate because that is when they harvest the wheat
[00:12:00.380 --> 00:12:07.260]   and barley and it is a huge festival and the king has to be there to host the festival
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:15.380]   and they will take Marduk the idol out of Marduk's temple and put it on a cart and
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.660]   then they will do a procession in the capital and it was a huge celebration and it would
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.460]   determine the destinies of everything for the next year.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:31.260]   So Nebunidas did not do that and that made a lot of people upset.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:38.020]   So Cyrus took this opportunity and he would battle against his overlord the Medes and
[00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:45.500]   then a significant number of military people from the Median empire actually switched sides
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:52.580]   to help Cyrus to help him to defeat the Median kingdom and also the Babylonian kingdom and
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:13:02.140]   finally in 539 BC they defeated the biggest superpower in the world Babylonia.
[00:13:02.140 --> 00:13:07.620]   As you can see all these arrows 553 he would battle against the Medes and then 550 within
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:13.660]   3 years he defeated the entire northern Median kingdom and then all the way he invaded to
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:21.540]   the left to Lydia defeated the Lydia kingdom and then come back and defeated Elam and 539
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:25.980]   as I told you is a very important year in biblical history and world history is that
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:32.460]   Cyrus entered the capital of Babylonian empire Babylon.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:38.020]   And we can find some documents outside of the bible that talks about Cyrus the great
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:45.260]   and one of the documents is called Cyrus the Cylinder and this round thing has a lot of
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:51.420]   inscriptions on it and if you translate it or take an excerpt out of it it talks about
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:55.500]   Cyrus what he did to Babylon.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:01.940]   He said I am Cyrus king of the world king of four corners I enter Babylon in peace and
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:09.500]   Marduk I daily attend to his worship because Marduk exalted me and have all the kings kiss
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:16.020]   my feet and I return the images of the gods and I gather all their peoples and return
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:17.420]   them to their dwellings.
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:23.380]   Remember the Jewish people were one of the groups being returned.
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:28.120]   Now from this excerpt who is Cyrus?
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:34.180]   Is he a worshipper of Yahweh the true God?
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:37.180]   No he worshiped the false gods.
[00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:44.620]   He worshiped Marduk in fact as a Persian he not only worshipped Marduk the Babylonian
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:52.500]   god he worshipped his Persian god the great god of the Persian religion is called Ahura
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:15:00.260]   Masta that was a Persian great god if you drive a master car you know what that means
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.660]   master in Persian means wisdom.
[00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:11.140]   So he is actually a polytheistic person and he worshipped different gods and as you can
[00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:21.540]   tell from the context Cyrus was a pragmatic politician he took the advantage of Babylonian
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:27.700]   vacuum political vacuum and he invaded Babylonian empire.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:34.540]   Now he let the captives free he let some of the Jewish people go back to Jerusalem not
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:40.660]   because he is kind or not because he is compassionate.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:46.580]   Is that he is pragmatic he wanted to reverse the policy from Babylonian empire and let
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:52.260]   these people go as long as they don't rebel against him and he will consolidate his power.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:57.620]   So as you can tell he is a polytheistic worshipper he worshipped false gods and he is also a
[00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:06.300]   pragmatic politician much like today all politicians are pragmatic and you have to be pragmatic.
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.860]   Now with that context we can go to the Bible.
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:11.820]   What does the Bible say about Cyrus the great?
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:15.780]   We find his name being mentioned in Isaiah 44 and 45.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:20.100]   Let me read this passage to you.
[00:16:20.100 --> 00:16:26.060]   And remember Isaiah has two parts the first part is chapter 1 to 39 that is what we call
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:31.380]   first Isaiah and then chapter 40 all the way to the end sometimes we call it second Isaiah
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:32.820]   the second part of Isaiah.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:41.700]   The second part of Isaiah from 40 to all the way to 66 is a prophecy bunch of prophecies
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:49.140]   talking to the Jewish captives in Babylon and how God will have compassion on them and
[00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:52.300]   to lead them to return to give them hope.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:59.260]   That is what Isaiah 40 all the way to 66 is giving them hope and telling them Yahweh
[00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:03.500]   the true God will be faithful to them even though they have sinned against him and he
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.620]   will forgive their sin and he will lead his people back to their homeland.
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:12.980]   So that is the context of 44 chapter 44.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:18.780]   So God is telling his people Israel he said remember this things O Jacob for you are my
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:25.980]   servant O Israel I have made you you are my servant O Israel I will not forget you return
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:30.020]   to me for I have redeemed you.
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:37.460]   And God is the one who sets off Cyrus Cyrus the great the politician he is my shepherd
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:40.660]   and will accomplish all that I please.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:45.660]   He will say of Jerusalem let it be rebuilt and to the temple let its foundation be laid
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:54.220]   and this passage continues to tell us something more about Cyrus in the sight of God.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:18:02.900]   God said what this is what the Lord Yahweh says to his anointed to Cyrus whose right
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:09.060]   hand I take hold of to subdue nations before him and to strip kings of their armor and
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:15.260]   open doors before him the doors of the empire doors of other people and nations including
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:21.140]   Babylon so that gates will not be shut will be open to Cyrus the great.
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:27.660]   Now what is amazing what is interesting here is that not only Cyrus name is being called
[00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:35.780]   out before he exists remember Isaiah prophesied this 100 years before Cyrus existed not only
[00:18:35.780 --> 00:18:44.900]   his name is being mentioned here but also he is being called his anointed his anointed.
[00:18:44.900 --> 00:18:53.340]   That's interesting because a pagan king is being called the anointed.
[00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:55.820]   That is pretty remarkable.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:19:03.680]   Now you go back to the timeline you see Isaiah there 740-700 that's when Isaiah was a prophet
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:10.840]   and he was serving the sovereign kingdom Judah in the midst of the crisis from Assyrian empire.
[00:19:10.840 --> 00:19:20.660]   So before Cyrus existed in Isaiah his name was mentioned and not only his name was mentioned
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:24.660]   he was being called God's anointed.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:31.660]   Now immediately we thought ok anointed the Messiah so often we have this Jesus figure
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:37.780]   in our head right whenever Messiah is being mentioned in our songs or in the Bible so
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:43.580]   often we say ok he is the Messiah the capital M Messiah the savior of the world Jesus Christ
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.700]   himself there is only one Messiah.
[00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:53.620]   So we always have this sacred notion to the word Messiah but again you need to understand
[00:19:53.620 --> 00:20:01.620]   these kind of sacred notion got picked up later in biblical history in the new testament
[00:20:01.620 --> 00:20:08.020]   but in the old testament whenever the word anointed or Messiah is being used it does
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:13.860]   not necessarily mean that someone is sacred or someone is pleasing to God.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:19.340]   In fact so often someone who is being anointed is not pleasing to God.
[00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:26.620]   For example in 1 Samuel 10 verse 1 it speaks of the first king of Israel King Saul remember
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:30.620]   that guy King Saul and after King Saul is David right.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:37.340]   King Saul is being said to be anointed the prophet Samuel took a flask of oil and poured
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:43.660]   it on the head of Saul and kissed him and said has not the Lord Yahweh anointed you
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:46.980]   leader over his inheritance his people.
[00:20:46.980 --> 00:20:55.340]   So Saul is being mentioned or being referred to as the Messiah same word anointed.
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:21:03.260]   Now as you can remember was King Saul a king pleasing to God?
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:11.800]   No right he was actually rebellious to the kingship of God and that's why God raised
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:15.340]   up another king David to replace him.
[00:21:15.340 --> 00:21:18.340]   However Saul is being called the anointed.
[00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:24.420]   So as I said anointed does not mean that he is sacred and this is the same way for the
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.740]   pagan kings in the bible especially Cyrus the great.
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:35.380]   Even Cyrus the great was being named and is being called the anointed of Yahweh does not
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:39.340]   mean he is a true believer of Yahweh.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:44.500]   In fact he is pagan as we can tell from other documents outside of the bible.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:52.060]   You know in the bible the pagan king is used by God for God's glory.
[00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:55.980]   The pagan king is never put on a pedestal.
[00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:59.540]   He never gets the glory.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.420]   God gets the glory.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:08.540]   Whoever is in the white house, whoever is in power, whoever is serving the term in our
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:11.900]   world in the ancient world.
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:15.420]   God gets the glory because God is in charge.
[00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:22.860]   Isaiah 45 actually says this, it says the whole point of raising up Cyrus as the anointed
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:26.100]   one is to gain glory for himself.
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:27.700]   God says this.
[00:22:27.700 --> 00:22:34.340]   God gets the glory because he controls every move of the political figures and the kings
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.580]   and kingdoms and empires on earth.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:43.820]   Isaiah 45 verse 5 it says I am the Lord Yahweh and there is no other apart from me there
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.220]   is no God.
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:50.700]   I form the light and create darkness.
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:54.180]   I bring prosperity and create disaster.
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.580]   I the Lord Yahweh do all these things.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:03.780]   You can see from the translation here I give you in parenthesis the Hebrew words.
[00:23:03.780 --> 00:23:11.820]   Yasa being translated form, Bara often times being translated create and then Asab translated
[00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:14.300]   bringing or doing.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:20.100]   Now these kind of words, these words are often used in Genesis 1.
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:23.980]   Now immediately we have some theological questions here.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.460]   We ask the question of the problem of evil.
[00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.460]   How can God create darkness and disaster?
[00:23:31.460 --> 00:23:34.500]   Is he the origin or the author of evil?
[00:23:34.500 --> 00:23:36.620]   Is God the author of evil?
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.540]   No, no of course not.
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:45.260]   But we are troubled with these words because we as modern readers we always try to understand
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:49.140]   these words from a materialistic point of view.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:55.480]   Like God in Genesis 1 created everything we just thought ok it has to be God creating
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.180]   something out of nothing.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:24:04.460]   It's a material process, it's a material creation manufacturing process that we have in mind.
[00:24:04.460 --> 00:24:09.580]   But in the ancient world that is not what they meant.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:15.860]   In the ancient world in Genesis 1 and in Isaiah 45 when they used these words they are not
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.660]   talking about material or creating something out of nothing.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.900]   It's not talking about God creating disasters out of nothing.
[00:24:24.900 --> 00:24:26.700]   Calamity out of nothing.
[00:24:26.700 --> 00:24:27.700]   There is an evil out of nothing.
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.620]   It's not talking about that.
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:32.980]   These kind of words are talking about management.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.980]   Talking about God is in control of everything.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:43.460]   Good things and even bad things is still under the control in the hands of God.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.300]   So God has good and evil in his hands.
[00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:51.980]   Never have anything that happened in our lives or in our world that would be outside of God's
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:52.980]   control.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:53.980]   That's what they meant.
[00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:58.660]   That's what these Hebrew words are trying to mean.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:02.000]   So God would allow evil to happen.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:07.420]   Or even a pagan king like Cyrus the Great to control the world.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:13.160]   That does not mean they are out of God's hands.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:18.940]   God has everything, the good and the evil in his control.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:24.180]   Just like today when your boss tells you, can you create a department or a team to take
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:26.300]   care of this task?
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:28.460]   You heard the word create.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:34.620]   You would not think, ok, how can I create a team of people out of nothing?
[00:25:34.620 --> 00:25:38.820]   Because he is not talking about manufacturing material process.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.420]   He is talking about management.
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:46.620]   You create a team, it means you have a team in charge to perform a task being assigned
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:47.620]   to you.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.740]   It is the same way in the biblical words.
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:52.740]   Here it talks about reorganization.
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:56.460]   It talks about management.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:58.980]   Do you play chess?
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.180]   Anyone here?
[00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:02.220]   Anyone who is good at playing chess?
[00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:03.220]   I am very bad.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.220]   I am very bad.
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.100]   I am very bad.
[00:26:06.100 --> 00:26:13.580]   But if you play chess, if you observe the game of a great chess player and watch how
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:22.660]   he makes every move and defeats his opponent, sometimes the move he makes, I don't understand.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:28.620]   Sometimes the moves that he makes or the strategies that he has in mind, I cannot comprehend.
[00:26:28.620 --> 00:26:35.060]   Until at the end of the game, that I saw something amazing happen.
[00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:43.220]   So the great chess player sometimes makes a move that is beyond my comprehension, where
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.940]   he plays up a pagan king.
[00:26:46.940 --> 00:26:48.420]   That is beyond my understanding.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:53.300]   That is beyond my so-called plan.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:27:00.620]   But at the end of the game, you will see the wisdom of the great chess player.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:06.380]   And at the end of the game, if you go to the game board, you would not praise the chess
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:07.380]   pieces.
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:12.400]   You would not pick up the chess pieces and say, "Wow, those pieces are very amazing.
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:19.560]   They can do amazing moves, unpredictable moves, and finally they win the game."
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:21.820]   You would not praise the chess pieces.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:25.460]   The glory and victory go to the chess player.
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.480]   The one who is in control.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:31.900]   The one who controls everything and every piece, every move on the game board.
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.620]   It is the same way Isaiah is talking about.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:41.380]   He is saying that God's people need to know that we need to acknowledge the sovereignty
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:46.060]   of the one true king, Yahweh, Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:52.420]   And our allegiance and our faithfulness is always on the only one true God.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.060]   The God of history.
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:56.220]   The God of our nation.
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:59.500]   The God that is to be worshipped.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:07.460]   Whether the pagan king in the White House or the pagan king in power, whether he will
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:14.860]   implement policies that would seem favorable to us or not, there is only one true God and
[00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.580]   one true king.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.900]   And he is in heaven.
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:25.940]   Isaiah 49 says, "God says, 'It is too small a thing for you to be my servant to restore
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:31.780]   the tribes of Jacob and bring back those of Israel I have kept.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:39.620]   I will also not only return the people to their land and their exile, but I will also
[00:28:39.620 --> 00:28:42.260]   do one thing more amazing.
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:47.780]   Is that I will make you the people of God a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:52.740]   my salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
[00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:55.100]   You see what is going on here.
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:59.140]   There is only one God, one true king in the universe.
[00:28:59.140 --> 00:29:02.940]   And he is above all political powers.
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.900]   Kingdoms rise and fall.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:10.980]   However there is only one God who is eternally ruling, reigning over all of us.
[00:29:10.980 --> 00:29:14.300]   In our nation, in your personal life.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:19.020]   And not only that, God says, "I will do something more.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   I will raise you up.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:26.220]   I want to raise you up to be the light for the Gentiles, for the nations.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:33.740]   And with you, you can bring salvation, the gospel to the ends of the earth."
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:38.940]   What a timely word and what timely reminder that we have.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:47.300]   Because the Christian public witness in our nation is at all time low.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.700]   People look at us.
[00:29:49.700 --> 00:29:51.660]   People go to church.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:54.380]   People profess the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:59.980]   They look at us like you guys are hypocrites.
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:05.980]   You belong to the religious establishment.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:07.820]   It's a timely word for us.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:13.340]   And the Christian public witness is at all time low.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:15.380]   Especially in our nation.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:21.140]   And sometimes it's tempting for us to put too much faith on human kings.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:27.540]   I remember I was in seminary class and I heard the professor talking about Cyrus, Isaiah
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:28.540]   44 and 45.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:35.620]   And he's trying to spin the story that Cyrus the Great was probably converted to be a believer,
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:37.700]   to be a believer of Yahweh.
[00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:41.820]   That's why he was favorable to the Jewish people and let them return.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:50.020]   Now that was in the old days when we didn't have much extra biblical document.
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:55.940]   As you can tell from the documents that we read, Cyrus sitting there and all that, Cyrus
[00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:59.180]   remained a pagan king.
[00:30:59.180 --> 00:31:03.060]   There was not a shred of evidence that he was converted.
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.540]   However, this is our fantasy.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.900]   We want someone in power to be converted to be a Christian.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:16.660]   And we all want the kings to become like us, Christians or evangelicals.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.620]   How nice, right?
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.900]   Of course we want that, we want to pray for that.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:27.820]   We want those who are in charge and those who are with the political power, we want
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:31.180]   them to acknowledge the name of Jesus.
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:40.880]   Or sometimes we want or we wish a superstar, a celebrity would become a Christian and she
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.980]   or he will bear witness to the world how great Jesus is.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.700]   And how nice is that?
[00:31:47.700 --> 00:31:57.020]   However, Isaiah reminds us, we cannot outsource the public witness to other people.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:05.380]   We cannot outsource the public witness to those in power or in the entertainment business
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:07.340]   or some celebrities.
[00:32:07.340 --> 00:32:08.700]   We cannot outsource this.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:13.860]   Isaiah is talking about to every single person of the people of God.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:20.700]   You are my witness and God wants to make you the light for the Gentiles, for the nations.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:22.580]   God wants to raise you up.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:32.460]   You see, no matter which political party is in charge, no matter what policies they implement,
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:40.340]   whether it would be favorable to us or non-favorable to us, that is not the key.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:51.020]   The key is that we respond to the calling of God to be the light for the nations.
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:54.140]   And we ask that the church will raise us up.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:58.340]   We will stand up to be the true church.
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:02.820]   Think about the last past two decades.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:03.820]   Two decades or so.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:10.780]   There are so many mega churches that fail, crumble.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.100]   I don't have to give you examples.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:18.500]   I was in Toronto for the weekend and a lot of Canadian Christians told me what happened
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.820]   in the city of Toronto.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:27.300]   In the metropolitan area, there are also many mega churches or mega pastors figures who
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.600]   fail because of scandals.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.000]   You see what's going on?
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   We fail.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.540]   It's not because the political order is in our favor.
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.220]   It really doesn't matter.
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:41.940]   We fail from within.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:48.140]   It's not because the political order is favorable to us to question weakness or not.
[00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:53.540]   It is us that we need to be the light to the nations.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:55.940]   And we bear the name of God.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:59.420]   And we want to bear a positive witness to the world.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:07.060]   A couple of weeks ago, we had a small group gathering for the husbands.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:14.020]   For some of the husbands, we share our stories and our worries for our family, especially
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:16.700]   for the young kids.
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:22.380]   Growing up in a liberal environment and they got their value confused.
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:25.220]   And there are so many cultural wars out there.
[00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:30.500]   And we exchange a lot of stories about our worries about what is going on in the schools,
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.900]   what is going on in the curriculum.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.700]   And we worry about that.
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:41.700]   But I was talking to the husbands, I said, "You know what, whatever, however the political
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:48.300]   order is favorable to us, there is a front line we cannot give up.
[00:34:48.300 --> 00:34:52.260]   And it is our own home.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:54.320]   Our own family.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:35:03.180]   How can we live out the gospel, the beauty of truth, the beauty of truth, to let our
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:08.260]   kids and let our next generation to know that the truth is beautiful.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:15.500]   You know, the next generation is tired of us telling them what is right and what is
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.500]   wrong.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.620]   Of course there is truth and falsehood we have to discern.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.620]   That is important.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:24.940]   But the most important thing is that we as the people of God, we can show and demonstrate
[00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:26.480]   the beauty of truth.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.160]   The beauty of marriage.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.340]   The beauty of manhood and womanhood.
[00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:34.340]   The beauty of Christian life.
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:36.500]   That we live out the gospel.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.300]   And that is what the world is dying for.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:48.140]   They want to see the people of God being raised up to be the light for the Gentiles.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:53.460]   And today Isaiah gives us this reminder and this calling.
[00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:59.580]   You go back to your role and your responsibility.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:03.980]   Go back to your home to deal with your children.
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:06.180]   To handle relationships in your home.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.460]   To handle relationships and ethics in your workplace.
[00:36:09.460 --> 00:36:10.820]   In the society.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:14.960]   How can we speak with the gospel.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.820]   Speak with compassion.
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:18.340]   Speak with peace.
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:23.340]   So that people can see the beauty of the gospel.
[00:36:23.340 --> 00:36:24.860]   Can we do that?
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:25.860]   Can we do that?
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:26.860]   Can we pray at least?
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:30.100]   Toward that direction.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.100]   God help us.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:35.300]   It's not about voting whoever is in the White House.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.780]   Of course if it's favorable, praise God.
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:45.580]   But the front line that we all are on, we cannot give up.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:50.060]   We are in the trenches to be the light for the Gentiles.
[00:36:50.060 --> 00:36:54.780]   To bring salvation to the ends of the earth.
[00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:57.340]   And that is you and me.
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:03.580]   That is all the churches, all the ordinary Christians we can do and we can pray for.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:08.380]   Can we close in words of prayer?
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.940]   And just pray and come back to God and say God call us.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:21.820]   And Father you do want to call us to be the light for the Gentiles, for the nations.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:25.660]   And we come before you, we ask that you will forgive us.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:31.140]   You forgive us sometimes we pay so much attention to okay who is in power but of course this
[00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:32.460]   is our public witness.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.820]   This is what we can do for the coming grace for the society.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:43.420]   However, what is most important is that you are in charge and you are calling us.
[00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:48.420]   Each and every one of us to be faithful people.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:50.980]   To preach the gospel.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.380]   To share the good news.
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:59.020]   In our conversation and in our interaction with other people that we can show them the
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:03.820]   beauty, the goodness of the gospel.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:07.140]   So help us and forgive us.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:09.460]   And please use us.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:14.060]   And this is our prayer as your people.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:17.420]   Humble us so that we worship you alone.
[00:38:17.420 --> 00:38:27.380]   Humble us so that we can display and demonstrate your goodness, your beauty.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.980]   And may your name be glorified.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.860]   This is our little prayers and you send us out this week.
[00:38:33.860 --> 00:38:41.700]   Go back to school, go back to our home, go back to our workplaces.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:50.180]   Any place you send us and help us to bring the truth and the beauty of truth.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:56.780]   And use us to show your glory in Christ in prayer.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.700]   Well thank you very much for worshipping with us.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.900]   And this series will continue next week and I hope to see you next week and we'll continue
[00:39:03.900 --> 00:39:04.900]   with Flat On.
[00:39:04.900 --> 00:39:08.740]   God's psalm over the nations, over us.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:13.540]   So we have some refreshments out there and please stay for a little bit time of fellowship
[00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:16.940]   and get to know one another, to support one another.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.740]   God bless you the rest of the week and see you next week.
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:29.740]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
