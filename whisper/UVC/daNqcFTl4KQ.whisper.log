[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.120]   Let's do it together.
[00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.960]   All right, let's welcome Pastor Mark.
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.960]   - Hey, happy new year.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.960]   Happy new year to all of you.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.000]   And such a good day to be here.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.560]   I know it's snowing outside, right?
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.200]   It's still snowing outside?
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.080]   'Cause I've been here since 8 p.m.
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.200]   So I don't know what's going on outside, you know.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.040]   Huh?
[00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.880]   - 8 p.m.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.480]   - 8 a.m., sorry, 8 a.m., yeah.
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.560]   It's been a long day for me,
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.800]   and it's been a long week for me.
[00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.440]   So good to see all of you.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.100]   And why don't we shake hands with our neighbors
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.280]   and say happy new year,
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.120]   or words of blessing to each other.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.240]   Find five neighbors, five neighbors around you.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.840]   All right, all right, yeah.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.240]   Well, there's some new friends in the midst of us,
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.520]   and we wanna welcome you to be in our church.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.800]   Let's round of applause for all the new friends
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.160]   who are visiting us the very first time, all right?
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.740]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.360]   So it's still new year.
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.380]   You know, the atmosphere, the color, or whatever
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.620]   reminds us what it means to have new year,
[00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.020]   and what it means to have change.
[00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.220]   What do we do as new year kicks in,
[00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.080]   and a new period of time, a new season in our lives?
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.460]   I think this is a great reminder for us to just rethink,
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:22.640]   you know, where are we going?
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.700]   So we may think of new year's resolutions, right?
[00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.660]   New year goals, all right?
[00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.020]   So let me do a survey here.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.480]   How many of you have your new year resolution,
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.140]   and one of your resolution is to lose weight?
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.460]   How many of you?
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.900]   Yeah, that reminds us, you know,
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.700]   this reminds us we have to do it every single year, right?
[00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.900]   Although we already fail, we already fail,
[00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.860]   but that's okay, you know?
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.580]   We continue to grow, right?
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.380]   Not in weight, but in our spirit, all right?
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.800]   You know, some of the new year resolutions,
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.580]   some of the new goals that we're gonna set for ourselves,
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.820]   or some of the new mindset we want to have.
[00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.660]   So this new year will be reminding us, you know,
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.660]   doing something that will require us to change, right?
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.560]   So what it is for you, think about it.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.520]   And today, I would like to start a new series
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.440]   on the sermon, which is about church,
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.600]   about healthy church, healthier church.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.440]   How do we become a healthier church?
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.460]   Think of yourself, right?
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.060]   You have been a Christian for a long time,
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.420]   or maybe a short time, or perhaps you stumble and fall,
[00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:43.020]   stumble and fall, and along the way, you know,
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:45.760]   you still find your identity in Christ, right?
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.420]   And how to be a healthy Christian,
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.400]   what does it mean, healthy Christian, right?
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.740]   You may have your own, you know, imagination,
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.220]   what it means to be a healthy Christian,
[00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.700]   what it means to be a healthier church,
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.260]   but you know, we want to, you know,
[00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.000]   go into the word of God, and see what God has to say
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.980]   about being a healthier church, right?
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.540]   What does it mean to be a healthier Christian?
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.140]   Now, as we talk about, you know,
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.260]   new year's goals and resolutions,
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.140]   you know, we always think of, you know,
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.700]   there's some maybe poor habits we need to do away.
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:27.700]   Some new habits we need to redevelop, right, to pick up.
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.460]   Something like that, spiritual disciplines, right?
[00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:36.700]   You know, things like we have to change our lifestyle
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.260]   in order to be healthier,
[00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.500]   not just physically, but spiritually as well.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.020]   So think about, as an individual question,
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.420]   how we should change in such a way to be healthier,
[00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.160]   and then as a group, as a corporate, as a body,
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.660]   as a community, how do we grow together
[00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.640]   to be a healthier church?
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.380]   So that is the new topic we need to talk about.
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.180]   Now, why do I want to talk about this?
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.620]   Because, you know, as you think about church
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.860]   as a community, as a family, we talk about relationship.
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.500]   Unless our relationship is healthy,
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.700]   our church will not be healthy.
[00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.100]   Unless your relationship with other people,
[00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.940]   Christians, non-Christians, brothers and sisters in Christ,
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.880]   you know, your siblings in your family,
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.080]   your parents or your children,
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.560]   unless your relationship is healthy,
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.700]   there's no way you can walk
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:35.220]   in a spiritual pathway of God, right?
[00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.220]   So we have to dig into how do we grow our relationship
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.580]   in a healthier way in order to be a healthier Christian
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.440]   as an individual and as a group, as a church.
[00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.700]   In fact, if you read through the Bible,
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.060]   there are many places in the Bible
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.900]   that describes church as a family.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.760]   You know, in the first century, 2,000 years ago,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.980]   in the time of Jesus, in the times of the first Christians,
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.780]   the early Christians, all churches are house churches.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.540]   So they gather together, not in a separate building,
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:21.100]   but let's say we are the sample here in the first century.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.500]   We're gonna gather together for worship,
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.460]   for fellowship on Sunday, on the Lord's Day,
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.060]   and we're gonna ask around different people,
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:33.500]   you have a house big enough for us to squeeze in, right?
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.860]   To sit together, to sing together, to pray together,
[00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.940]   and to study the word of God together is house church, right?
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.940]   It's pretty much the situation in many parts of China.
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.100]   Right?
[00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.100]   Having churches not in a separate building, but in houses.
[00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:58.260]   So when the apostle talks about church,
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.080]   he actually described the church as family,
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.740]   literally as a family,
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.420]   because the church will gather in your living room
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:10.140]   as a family, right?
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.380]   And all the members belong to the same family,
[00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.420]   the big family of God, right?
[00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:18.140]   Where you have, of course, your brother and sisters,
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:22.180]   someone who is directly related to you,
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:23.980]   but many of the other people
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.220]   who will squeeze into your living room in the house church
[00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:30.180]   are related in Christ, right?
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.260]   Sister and brothers in Christ.
[00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.060]   So in the days of Paul, all churches are house churches,
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:39.820]   and the family is the basic unit,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.660]   not only just the society,
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:44.340]   but for church, capital C, church.
[00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:48.660]   That's why in this verse, Ephesians chapter two,
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.780]   it says you used to be Gentiles,
[00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.620]   not being part of the kingdom of God,
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.020]   not being related to the people of God,
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:02.140]   but now in Christ, you are no longer strangers,
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.520]   you're no longer foreigners, you're citizens.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.460]   You are the people, along with all the holy people of God,
[00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.220]   and you belong to the family of God.
[00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:15.260]   You are members of God's family.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.260]   That's why we need to talk about family relationship, right?
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.020]   Because I really believe that
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.660]   if our relationships are strong,
[00:07:27.660 --> 00:07:31.360]   if we are closer, if we grow together,
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.800]   then our church will grow.
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.760]   Now, if we don't grow in our relationship,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:42.700]   if we don't grow mature in our relationship,
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.020]   our church will be stifled.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:47.140]   So we need to talk about relationship,
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.200]   just as Paul, writing Ephesians, talking about relationship.
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:56.900]   Now, 2022, last year,
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:08:01.460]   there was a new survey done in United Kingdom, in England.
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:04.700]   So the survey asked a couple of questions.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:06.340]   One of the question is,
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.600]   to ask different people on the street,
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:13.180]   and ask them, how many of you feel that the pandemic
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:17.340]   has improved your family relationship?
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.300]   How many of you feel that the pandemic,
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.800]   which lasts for how many years?
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:24.700]   Seems like forever.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.100]   Three, four years, right?
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:28.980]   Three years, right?
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:32.980]   How many of you feel that COVID,
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.420]   the pandemic, has improved your relationship,
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.720]   particularly your marriage or your family relationship,
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.520]   parents and children and all that?
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.080]   How many of you feel that COVID has,
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.020]   three years, have improved your relationship?
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:51.580]   And the result is, take a guess.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:55.400]   How many of those people, what's the percentage
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.560]   that would say COVID will improve our relationship?
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.640]   Exactly, one third only, one third only.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:06.900]   Is that exciting?
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:09.540]   Not very exciting, right?
[00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:10.380]   Pretty sad.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.600]   The second question is,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.000]   they survey some of the largest family law firms in UK
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.440]   about the increase of divorce
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:28.080]   in the past three years of pandemic.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.220]   And these law firms submit their results,
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:37.220]   and there was increase in terms of cases in divorce.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.480]   Take a guess, percentage.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.320]   How many percentage increase because of COVID for divorce?
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.500]   50, any?
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.120]   I tell you, it's 95%.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:56.040]   Is that exciting?
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.020]   Is that exciting for lawyers?
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.040]   Not for the families, right?
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.240]   Not for the marriages.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.320]   It is indeed very, very sad,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   because in reality, the pandemic
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:16.000]   has a lot of negative impact on our relationship.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Now, think about it.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.880]   And we go to the Word of God and say,
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.680]   what does God want, right?
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:25.880]   What does He require of us?
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:30.720]   How can we be renewed in our relationship, right?
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:34.520]   Because we are family of Christ, right?
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:37.680]   So I've chosen a passage today from the Bible,
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.920]   a very familiar passage.
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:42.620]   And I wanna think about this passage
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:46.440]   and what it means to be a family in Christ.
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:50.540]   What does it mean when Christ comes into our relationships,
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:52.440]   all of our relationships?
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.440]   Now, my relationship with my spouse, my children, if any,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.800]   my brother and sisters, my in-laws,
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.920]   or my, any of our relationship in church
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.440]   or outside of the church, right?
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.560]   So let's think about it.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.960]   But as I read through this passage,
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   I want you to ask yourself,
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:15.440]   as if you are reading this passage the very first time,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.920]   as you listen to the words of this passage
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.060]   the very first time,
[00:11:21.060 --> 00:11:23.680]   how do you feel about this passage?
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.980]   How do you feel about it?
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:27.240]   All right, are you ready?
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:28.800]   You ready?
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.960]   I'm gonna read through Ephesians 5,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   verses 21 and following.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:39.800]   And further, submit to one another
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.880]   our reverence for Christ.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:45.160]   For wives, this means submit to your husbands
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.280]   as to the Lord.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:50.280]   For husband is the head of his wife,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.360]   as Christ is the head of the church.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:55.200]   He is the savior of his body to church.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.040]   As the church submits to Christ,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.680]   so you wives should submit to your husbands in everything.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:06.920]   25, for husbands, this means love your wives
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.960]   just as Christ loved the church.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.280]   He gave up his life for her to make her holy and clean,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.760]   washed by the cleansing of God's word.
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:18.960]   He did this to present her to himself
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.520]   as a glorious church without spot or wrinkle
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.220]   or any kind of blemish.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.660]   Instead, she will be holy and without fault.
[00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.520]   28, in the same way,
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.280]   husband ought to love their wives
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:37.120]   as they love their own bodies.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:38.560]   For a man who loves his wife
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.860]   actually shows love for himself.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:45.920]   No one hates his own body, but feeds and cares for it
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.720]   just as Christ cares for the church.
[00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:51.620]   And we are members of his body.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.940]   31, as the scripture says,
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.940]   a man lives his father and mother is joined to his wife
[00:12:58.940 --> 00:13:02.060]   and the two are united into one.
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:04.360]   This is a great mystery,
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.460]   but it is an illustration
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.560]   of the way Christ and the church are one.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.020]   So again, I say, each man must love his wife
[00:13:13.020 --> 00:13:15.000]   as he loves himself.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.800]   The wife must respect her husband.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.180]   All right, we're done.
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:22.420]   How do you feel about it?
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:25.700]   How do you feel about this passage,
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:29.900]   you know, reading it or listening to the word
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.380]   as if this is the first time?
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.100]   How do you feel about it?
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:37.980]   I tell you, as modern readers,
[00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:41.040]   there is something really hard to swallow, right?
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:43.460]   Some even find this passage oppressive,
[00:13:43.460 --> 00:13:46.060]   you know, because it seems like the passage
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:49.740]   is encouraging some sort of blind obedience, right?
[00:13:49.740 --> 00:13:53.660]   Especially for, on part of the wives, right?
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:55.980]   If you're a wife, if you're a female,
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.220]   you probably will read this passage as a modern reader,
[00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:04.140]   you will find trouble understanding what it means, right?
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.780]   Because we value 21st century, we modern people,
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.420]   we value equality, right?
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:14.440]   Husband and wives, you know, they are equal in status.
[00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:21.620]   So you may feel that it is so old and traditional, right?
[00:14:21.620 --> 00:14:26.620]   Wives, you know, we believe are not subjects,
[00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:29.660]   but partners in marriage.
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:30.500]   Amen?
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.180]   Amen, right?
[00:14:32.180 --> 00:14:36.640]   And we respect each other, there's no blind obedience.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:40.300]   And even the servants,
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:44.620]   the following context will tell us,
[00:14:44.620 --> 00:14:49.220]   even the servants need to be free, right?
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:50.820]   They need to be free men.
[00:14:50.820 --> 00:14:56.140]   So how can this passage be related to us?
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.620]   That's the big question.
[00:14:57.620 --> 00:14:59.860]   What is the passage really talking about?
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.800]   Now, I think you heard me before.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.100]   As we read the Bible, we need to understand
[00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:09.760]   the Bible is not written to us,
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.460]   but the Bible is written for us.
[00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:15.580]   Got it?
[00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:19.500]   The Bible is not directly written to us, right?
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:23.420]   There's no way by saying this would devalue,
[00:15:23.420 --> 00:15:25.680]   you know, the sacredness of scripture.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:30.680]   Because as God revealed himself through scripture,
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.580]   he has to use some of the ideologies,
[00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:38.160]   some of the wordings that were familiar
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.140]   to the first audience, right?
[00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:42.140]   In order to communicate to them, right?
[00:15:42.140 --> 00:15:44.820]   Using the language or the cultural values
[00:15:44.820 --> 00:15:46.580]   that they are familiar with,
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:49.620]   and to communicate some eternal truth to them, right?
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:51.740]   So it's not directly written to us,
[00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.460]   it's directly written to them, using their language,
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:58.580]   using their categories to communicate
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:02.420]   some of the eternal truth that would be applicable
[00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:05.180]   for all cultures and all times and space, right?
[00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:07.820]   So it's not written directly to us, it's written directly
[00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:08.680]   to them.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:10.980]   So we have to understand the scripture
[00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:13.620]   or read the scripture as if we were
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:17.180]   first century Christians.
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.260]   If we live in the Roman Empire, in the time of Jesus,
[00:16:20.260 --> 00:16:25.260]   in the time of Paul, then we probably will be better,
[00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:29.700]   on a better place to understand the real meaning
[00:16:29.700 --> 00:16:30.840]   of the scripture.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.940]   Now, as you can tell, you know, every society has their own,
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:38.260]   you know, understanding of the responsibility
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:41.420]   and roles of, you know, different members, right?
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.720]   Male are expected to do something, right?
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.460]   Or behave in such a way.
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:51.260]   And female are expected to behave in some other way, right?
[00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.180]   Every society, you know, ancient or modern,
[00:16:54.180 --> 00:16:57.980]   there are always some sort of, you know, social categories
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:02.300]   to, well, you can say box in,
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:07.300]   but, you know, in some way it's to define who we are, right?
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.140]   Based on gender or based on, you know, different roles
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.180]   in the society, in the relationship.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.020]   Now, it is the same way in the first century,
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:23.940]   in biblical time, in the Roman Empire.
[00:17:23.940 --> 00:17:26.580]   There was some sort of, you know,
[00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:32.380]   social understanding of how wife should behave
[00:17:32.380 --> 00:17:34.700]   and how husband should behave,
[00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:38.460]   how the master of the household should behave, right?
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:43.340]   It's just part of the social fabric of the time.
[00:17:43.340 --> 00:17:47.620]   Now, reading this passage in the first century context,
[00:17:47.620 --> 00:17:51.520]   we can call it household codes,
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:56.900]   household regulations, household principles, right?
[00:17:56.900 --> 00:18:01.660]   I know you probably heard of a name called Aristotle,
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:03.120]   right, Aristotle.
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:05.840]   Ring any bell?
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.140]   Aristotle is a great philosopher, a great teacher.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.620]   He wrote a lot of things about social relationship.
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:17.680]   And in one of his writings called "Politics,"
[00:18:17.680 --> 00:18:22.340]   Aristotle talked about household management.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.260]   And he said about regarding household management,
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.880]   there were three parts.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:31.140]   There were three different dynamics
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.400]   for every head of the household he has to manage.
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:38.300]   The first one is the rule of a master over slaves,
[00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:39.400]   over the servants.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:45.260]   The second aspect is the rule of a father over the children.
[00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:51.320]   And then the third one is a husband ruling over the wives.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:57.600]   Now, three categories or three aspects
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.380]   of a man's relationship in the entire household.
[00:19:02.380 --> 00:19:06.900]   Now, this is called the household code, right?
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.900]   So that is the popular understanding on the street.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:18.660]   So if you go back to Rome in Jesus' day,
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:19.740]   in the first century,
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.420]   and you ask the people on the street, right,
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:25.300]   male or female, you ask them, "Hey, what's the role?"
[00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:26.940]   "Oh, you are male."
[00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:28.800]   "What is your role and responsibility?
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:31.400]   "What is your duty in the household?"
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:35.640]   And he would probably be able to cite you
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.080]   something like that.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:39.280]   Oh, there are three ways I need to relate
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:41.480]   to my household and manage them.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:45.780]   One is my servant, and one is my children,
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:48.480]   one is my wife, right?
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:53.480]   So they would be able to tell you that the popular idea
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   that a male will rule over his household as a sovereign,
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:04.100]   almost like absolute authority.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:09.160]   And the male is ruling the subordinates,
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:14.160]   and the subordinates are the servants, right?
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:16.100]   The wife and the children.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.620]   So there are three parts, right?
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:22.620]   So the consensus is that the man is justified
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.720]   to rule over his household because wives, servants,
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:31.980]   and children are by nature inferiors, right?
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:34.100]   They are subordinates, they are to submit.
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.180]   So the purpose of the household codes like this
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.540]   in Paul's day, in the first century,
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.100]   is to maintain a good order,
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:46.160]   a good hierarchical order in the Roman Empire.
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.960]   The Roman society is peaceful, is secure,
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:53.580]   is all because all the household heads,
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.660]   the males, the sovereign in the household
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.800]   are managing the family properly.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:04.980]   Now with that understanding,
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.200]   you go to the book of Ephesians,
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:09.780]   you find something really interesting
[00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:14.780]   'cause Paul is almost citing or using some of these ideas,
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:20.260]   but he used it and twisted it in such a way
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.560]   and turned it upside down.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:25.600]   Now if you're familiar with the book of Ephesians,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.120]   as Paul talks about the family church,
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.720]   the family relationship, he talks about three parts.
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:34.680]   First, what we have just read,
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:37.060]   husband and wife relationship.
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.140]   And then the second part, if you go on with the passage,
[00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:43.160]   he talks about a father and children.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:45.240]   And then he talks about what?
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.720]   Master and slaves, right?
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:48.860]   Master and servants.
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   But Paul is not just copycatting the ideas of his day.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:59.240]   He's using the idea of his day,
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:01.520]   the social understanding of his day,
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.060]   and put a new meaning in Christ.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.760]   Twist it and almost turn it upside down.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.280]   Let me tell you the context, okay?
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.960]   We just read 522 to 33.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.200]   If you keep on reading,
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.560]   he talks about other relationship, right?
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.960]   Now let me try to demonstrate.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:25.400]   If we were in the first century,
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:28.840]   hearing the words of Paul in the book of Ephesians,
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:32.600]   as if the first time, right?
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.980]   You're all familiar with the idea of a household
[00:22:36.980 --> 00:22:39.080]   from Aristotle, right?
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.720]   People on the street, they always assume that kind of idea.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.480]   The male head, all the other people in the household
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.120]   are subordinates, right?
[00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.600]   And then Paul comes in, and he's using a similar idea,
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:55.640]   and he talked to different parties in the household.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:01.840]   Now let me demonstrate how probably a male would feel,
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:08.040]   what he would feel like when he heard this word
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:11.560]   first time, first century.
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:18.120]   522, Paul writes, "Wives, pay attention, listen up.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.560]   "You need to submit, right?
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.280]   "You need to do this and that, right, to your husbands."
[00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.840]   And then if you're a male in the congregation,
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:29.560]   hearing the words the very first time,
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:30.920]   what would be your response?
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:35.200]   I would imagine if I'm a male,
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:39.000]   and I hear this 522 to 24.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.560]   Wives, you need to submit to your husband.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.560]   I'll go, my response is, "Yeah, of course."
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:49.040]   Of course the wives have to submit to me, right?
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.640]   Because I'm the head of the household.
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:53.960]   And the 525, Paul comes in and say,
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:58.960]   "But, but hey, husbands, the males, listen up."
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:04.240]   And there's a long verses, you know, 25 to 33,
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:07.320]   actually so much longer than the passage
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.760]   we've done for the wives.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.880]   Listen up, men.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.960]   Lord Jesus comes in.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:17.480]   He is the sovereign, not you, right?
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.440]   And this is what you do.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.480]   Remember what 25 to 23 says?
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:24.320]   Jesus died for the church,
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:27.280]   sacrificed himself for the church.
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.360]   This is how you love your wife, right?
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:33.680]   And as a male reader, I would go, "What?
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   "Why does it concern me?"
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:39.560]   Because that's not what the slogan says, right?
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:43.800]   I mean, all the commands are given to the subordinates,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.000]   right, to submit.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.240]   Not for me.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:49.640]   However, Paul turns it upside down and say,
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.120]   "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, men, slow down."
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:58.520]   Because there's a new sovereign coming into your household.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:02.200]   And you are now become a steward.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:04.800]   You're no longer the absolute authority.
[00:25:04.800 --> 00:25:09.040]   You're accountable to Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:11.880]   And look at how he managed the household of Christ,
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:14.000]   the household of church.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.040]   He died and sacrificed, right?
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.960]   He loved selflessly.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:23.920]   And then six, one to three, children, right?
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.280]   Hey, kids, listen up.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:26.760]   You know, this is what you do.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.440]   You have to respect your parents and all that stuff, right?
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.000]   As a male reader, I would say, "Yeah, of course, right?
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.600]   "My kid has to submit to me."
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.680]   And then six, four, Paul comes in and say,
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.920]   "Surprise, you know, fathers, listen up.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:44.160]   "There's something for you to do
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:47.120]   "because you are now in the Lord.
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:48.800]   "You are not the sovereign.
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.480]   "Jesus is the sovereign."
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.600]   Same way for servants.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.000]   Servant, listen up, right?
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.960]   All the employees in your household,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.360]   yeah, of course, they need to work hard and faithfully.
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:01.400]   However, six, nine, Paul comes in and say,
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:04.240]   "Hey, masters, listen up as well.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:07.520]   "You men, you better behave
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:11.400]   "because Lord Jesus Christ is above you, right?"
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:14.000]   There was a, can you see that?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.840]   There was a, there was a,
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.600]   a fraudy reconstruction or reconfiguration
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:23.840]   when Christ Jesus comes into your family,
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:25.680]   into your church.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.920]   This is what we call subversive.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.680]   Paul is using similar familiar ideas,
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:32.240]   but he turns it upside down
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.720]   all because Christ Jesus comes in, right?
[00:26:36.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   Now, it's reorganization, right?
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.640]   Look, before I entered ministry,
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.080]   I used to work in a chemistry lab.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.240]   I was a sort of a biochemist.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.040]   I was working in a environmental lab for some time.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.760]   And I remember I was working for this lab
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.840]   and I was in the office
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:02.240]   and there were other co-workers beside me, right?
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.160]   And I still remember there's one co-worker
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.120]   I really dislike, all right?
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.160]   I really dislike, you know why?
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:11.000]   You know why?
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.880]   You know me, right?
[00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:13.400]   I work hard.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.400]   I'm a very good worker, all right?
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:18.240]   Right?
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.720]   And that co-worker that I dislike,
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.480]   he comes in late and he exit early.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.600]   He hardly do anything and he's lazy boy.
[00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:34.920]   I was like, how is that possible
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:37.320]   that I'm a new worker
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.680]   and he has been working there for years?
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:42.280]   And then after some weeks,
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:45.480]   I learned about the relationship in the department
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:49.880]   and I realized he is actually directly related
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.040]   to the department head.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:55.400]   He's some sort of relatives to the department head.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:59.280]   I said, bingo, bingo, that's why.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.640]   That's why he hardly working, right?
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.320]   He's hardly working and he's getting paid, right?
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.000]   It's such an unfair situation.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.040]   Have you ever encountered a situation like that?
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:10.880]   Right?
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:14.160]   That's so unfair because they are blood with relatives,
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:15.000]   right?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.720]   So of course he's protecting his cousin, right?
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.880]   And he's getting paid by just showing up for a little bit.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:26.880]   So I feel really oppressed, to say the least.
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.000]   And then I remember one day,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.040]   the CEO of the company,
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.080]   the head of heads, right?
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.400]   He fired the department head
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:45.520]   and he hired a new department head to replace him.
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:49.040]   It's very interesting after that,
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.160]   the co-worker that I dislike,
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.920]   he start working hard.
[00:28:54.920 --> 00:28:59.440]   It's very interesting, his life almost turned around.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.200]   It's because the department head now is new,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.160]   is under new configuration.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:10.160]   There's a new head now, right?
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.040]   So he has to change his behavior,
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.040]   has to change how he works.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:20.960]   Now this is an analogy of Ephesians 5 and 6.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:26.520]   The household is working well according to Roman,
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.720]   Greco-Roman values.
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:31.280]   However, when Christ Jesus comes in,
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:33.760]   everything will be reorganized.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.280]   Now he's the head.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:40.000]   Everyone is kept accountable under Jesus.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.200]   The values will be different, right?
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:45.680]   The order of the relationship has changed.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:47.760]   Just like this.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.240]   The left is the old order.
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:29:53.720]   The male is up there above, right?
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:57.760]   Unchallenged or unchallengeable.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:30:00.560]   And then wife and children and servants,
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:02.520]   they are all subordinates.
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:07.720]   And then there's a reorganization happening in Christ.
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:10.480]   If you believe in Jesus,
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.840]   every single of your religious should change
[00:30:14.840 --> 00:30:17.160]   in a very fundamental way.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.200]   And that's the right side, the new order.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:21.960]   Christ is above all of them.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:26.800]   Male, female, children, servants,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.800]   all are accountable to one sovereign, one Lord,
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:35.600]   one Lordship of Jesus Christ.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.480]   Someone is more powerful than anyone in the household.
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.840]   That is the fundamental change
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.800]   that should happen in our lives.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.520]   If you believe in Jesus,
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.160]   when Jesus comes into your home,
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:55.200]   coming to our home, coming to our family,
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:59.320]   every relationship will be reordered in such a way
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:01.640]   that we, every one of us,
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.840]   will be accountable to the one true Lord, Jesus Christ.
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:07.240]   So how does it work?
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.080]   How does it work?
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.840]   I remember, I don't know if you listen to radio.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.280]   Radio is an old thing, right?
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:17.560]   You radio program, do you listen to it regularly?
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.640]   Don't, or no, right?
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.360]   Sometimes I listen to radio programs.
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:26.040]   I remember not too long ago,
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.000]   I was working in the church,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.640]   it was very, very late, very late, almost 11 p.m.
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.120]   And then I was driving home.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.240]   Takes about five to 10 minutes.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.240]   And then the radio was on, right?
[00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.760]   I didn't intentionally turn to one of the programs,
[00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:44.120]   but it was on.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:47.080]   And 11 p.m., almost midnight,
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:52.000]   what kind of program would be air in a radio station?
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.040]   You know, those songs, "Dedication Time," right?
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.000]   The caller will call in to the radio station
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   and call the DJ and say something really touching, right?
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.880]   Expressing love and all that stuff, right?
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.520]   And then I didn't really pay attention
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:10.800]   until I was a couple blocks away from the church
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:12.000]   on the way home.
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.880]   And I listened up and there was a middle-aged man,
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.320]   50-plus year old.
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.920]   He call in, he call in to the radio station.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:26.680]   And he said to the DJ and saying,
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:29.840]   "Hey, you know, I have been married
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.760]   "with this woman of my love for 25 years,
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:36.480]   "but I have never,
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   "I've never taken the opportunity to apologize,
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.440]   "to say a formal apology.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:48.160]   "So I want to dedicate this song to her
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:49.160]   "because I love her.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:55.040]   "For 25 years, I have been not really properly
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:59.120]   "related to her, and especially in our communication.
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:01.800]   "And I want to dedicate this song to her
[00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.120]   "and I want to say sorry.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.360]   "And I want to change."
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.040]   You know, in those moments,
[00:33:08.040 --> 00:33:11.520]   you know, I almost crashed, you know,
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.040]   almost crashed because I was paying attention.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.400]   I was like, wow, you know, that takes a lot of courage.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.480]   Right?
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.320]   You know, as a male, I find myself,
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.680]   that's pretty hard to do, you know?
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.680]   Would you do that?
[00:33:25.680 --> 00:33:29.800]   You as male, as a man,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.680]   you probably would not have the guts to do it, right?
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.880]   But I was listening to him and I listened to the song.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.360]   I forgot what song it is, but you know, anyways.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:46.440]   I said to myself, that is how Christ should change
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:52.720]   our family, our marriage, our relationships, right?
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:55.080]   Admitting our wrong, right?
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:59.720]   There's no sovereign, I cannot do something like apology
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:03.960]   because I'm ultimately accountable to Christ, right?
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.400]   That is the new order, right?
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:11.560]   That's how it works in our family, in our marriage.
[00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.240]   That's how it works with our relationship
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.280]   with other brothers and sisters.
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:21.120]   The old order would say, you know, I insist on my way.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:23.120]   The new order, when Christ comes in,
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:28.680]   there's forgiveness, there's understanding,
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.480]   there's proactive communication, right?
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.720]   This is how Christ should change our,
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.320]   your marriage, family, and relationship.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.760]   Well, let's work on that.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.600]   Let's really work on that.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   It's a new year, new phase of our lives, work on that.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:58.560]   What does it mean for you when you say Jesus is Lord?
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:04.560]   How does it affect fundamentally and practically
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:07.800]   your relationship with other people, right?
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:09.880]   Let's all pray together.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:14.000]   Father, thank you for loving us.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.560]   That Jesus, your son and only son,
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:25.200]   would come and sacrifice himself on the cross
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.600]   to die for us, to save us and redeem us.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:33.200]   Thank you for your lordship.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:35.920]   It's not a lordship of power,
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.080]   but a lordship of love and grace.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:43.920]   And I pray that as we launch into a new year,
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:49.240]   your lordship will mean to us,
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:51.480]   fundamentally and practically,
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:53.880]   will renew and change our relationship.
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:58.760]   We welcome you, welcome you to be our Lord,
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.040]   to be our savior.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.680]   Now pray that you will renew our relationships,
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:09.240]   whether it's a relationship with our spouses,
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:11.800]   with our brother and sisters, our in-laws,
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:16.800]   our family members, even our spiritual family members.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:20.160]   Now pray that your love will fill us
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:24.720]   and change us in such a way that we'll honor you.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.760]   And thank you for being our loving Lord.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:29.360]   And thank you for being,
[00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:34.880]   for the blessing to be your church.
[00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.680]   And I pray that Jesus, you will be our Lord.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:40.520]   You will lead us and change us
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:42.560]   in such a way to honor your name.
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.000]   In Christ's name, we'll pray.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.240]   Well, God bless you and happy new year.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.360]   And there is a bag of blessing
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.400]   we're going to distribute to all of you
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:55.400]   who haven't gotten one.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.960]   Make sure you get one, all right?
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.520]   I don't know what's in there,
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.040]   but it should be good things.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.800]   All right, and then this afternoon,
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:06.960]   we're going to have a fellowship meal together
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:10.240]   at Gene Fung's house church, all right?
[00:37:10.240 --> 00:37:11.640]   So you're all welcome to come.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:16.640]   And I don't know what kind of good food they prepare
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:19.760]   or we prepare, or we bring our own dish, right?
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.240]   I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.920]   So it's a potluck, okay?
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:23.760]   It's a potluck.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:24.600]   So you bring something good
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.880]   and I'm sure it will be a great time
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:28.560]   of fellowship together, all right?
[00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:29.560]   I'll see you later.
