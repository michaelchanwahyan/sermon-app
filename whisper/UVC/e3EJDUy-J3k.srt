1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,900
 And let's turn to the word.

2
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:05,060
 One question I wanna ask you is that

3
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,620
 where do you find in the Bible

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,900
 the story of the birth of Jesus Christ?

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,980
 All right, if you can talk to your neighbor,

6
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,700
 where do you find it, the first Christmas story,

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,460
 all right, so-called first Christmas story,

8
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:19,020
 where do you find in the Bible?

9
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,820
 Where?

10
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:29,780
 All right, so Old Testament or New Testament?

11
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,300
 New Testament, right, which book?

12
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:38,280
 Luke, okay, right, the third book of the New Testament,

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:43,280
 and then the first book, right, the Gospel of Matthew.

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,440
 Basically, you find the stories of the record,

15
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,960
 the historical record of the first Christmas,

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,760
 the birth of Jesus Christ, the details over there.

17
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,080
 So let's turn to the first book of the New Testament,

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,080
 the Gospel of Matthew, chapter one, verse 18.

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,640
 Here we go.

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,040
 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,740
 His mother, Mary, was pledged to be married to Joseph,

22
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:13,080
 but before they came together,

23
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,520
 she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.

24
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:20,480
 19, because Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man

25
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:24,160
 and did not want to expose her to public disgrace,

26
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:27,960
 he had in mind to divorce her quietly.

27
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,360
 Now, everybody loves the Christmas story, right?

28
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,280
 Everybody loves the Christmas story.

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:37,280
 A young Jewish couple, about 14 years old, 15 years old,

30
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,640
 back then, people marry very early in their lives,

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,640
 and in Jewish marriage, there were two stages of marriage.

32
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,040
 The first stage, the first period, is about a year long,

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,600
 is called betrothal or engagement.

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,160
 It's about one year long,

35
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,080
 and in the beginning of that one year,

36
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:02,640
 when a young couple get engaged,

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,940
 usually the parents arrange them.

38
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:07,440
 So they arrange them, and then they talk about

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,840
 the bride price and all that details,

40
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,920
 and then the young couple will be,

41
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,680
 technically, legally, they will be married,

42
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,880
 and we call them betrothed or engaged,

43
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,800
 and take about a year to prepare for the real wedding,

44
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,320
 which is the second stage,

45
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,320
 and the couple will consummate their marriage relationship.

46
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,960
 So it is at this point in the first stage

47
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,120
 of betrothal and engagement

48
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,880
 that we find the first Christmas story.

49
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:43,160
 So Mary was found to be with a child.

50
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,100
 She was pregnant.

51
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:47,260
 And then for Joseph, and you think about it,

52
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:50,680
 it's quite a tension, it's quite a tension,

53
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,040
 because all you plan for, all you arrange ahead of time,

54
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,080
 didn't work out, right?

55
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,320
 Mary was found to be with a child.

56
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,680
 And for Joseph, for the husband,

57
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,960
 in this stage, in the first stage, the betrothal,

58
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,320
 Mary and Joseph, even though they are so-called engaged,

59
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,160
 but they are officially and legally,

60
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,000
 they are husband and wife.

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,840
 So at this point, Joseph had two options, all right?

62
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,780
 One option is to divorce Mary properly,

63
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:29,760
 grab her to the city gate, to the court of the day,

64
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,280
 and divorce her and just shame her,

65
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:37,280
 because it's presumed that Mary is with child

66
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
 before they come together, before the second stage.

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:45,400
 So it's presumed that Mary would have committed adultery.

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,720
 And in the traditional society,

69
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,720
 and actually in some areas in the land of Palestine today,

70
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,240
 it's so conservative that whoever found

71
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:01,240
 to be committing adultery would be stoned to death.

72
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,040
 So that's the first option for Joseph.

73
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,180
 The second option for Joseph is to divorce Mary privately.

74
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,780
 Probably would ask two or three witnesses

75
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,240
 and come together in a private setting to divorce her,

76
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,160
 give her a divorce certificate.

77
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,120
 I think Joseph still had compassion toward Mary.

78
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:35,080
 At this point, I think he was trying to keep it down

79
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:41,000
 to divorce Mary quietly, to save Mary from public disgrace.

80
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,920
 So here's what happened.

81
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:50,300
 And Joseph, if you think about from his perspective,

82
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,300
 would he believe that Mary had a child from the Holy Spirit?

83
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:01,100
 Would he believe that it was really a miracle from God,

84
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,420
 because we got another version,

85
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,300
 Mary's version from the Gospel of Luke, right?

86
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,500
 At this point, Joseph knew nothing about the annunciation,

87
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:14,500
 about the news that the angel brought to Mary.

88
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,200
 So Joseph knew nothing about it,

89
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:20,460
 and it was pretty difficult for him to accept the reality.

90
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:26,360
 But this is where God came with his divine intervention.

91
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:32,960
 He sent an angel in chapter one, verse 20 and following.

92
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,560
 But after Joseph had conceded all of this,

93
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,360
 an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,

94
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,260
 Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid

95
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,220
 to take Mary home as a wife,

96
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,300
 because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

97
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,760
 It's a virgin birth, it's a miracle, only God could do.

98
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,160
 She will give birth to a son,

99
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:54,980
 and you are to give him the name Jesus.

100
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,940
 And the name Jesus means he will save,

101
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,780
 he will redeem his people from their sins.

102
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:05,900
 Now with that, Joseph obeyed God

103
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,520
 in kind of a difficult situation.

104
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,980
 Even though in the midst of uncertainty,

105
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,420
 you just don't know what happened next, right?

106
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,300
 So Joseph was kind of an example here,

107
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,100
 example of obedience and compassion.

108
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,760
 So he took Mary as wife,

109
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,760
 and essentially he was adopting Jesus to be his legal son.

110
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,780
 Now remember, Joseph is from the house of David.

111
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:40,780
 He's one of the descendants of the Davidic dynasty,

112
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,300
 the house of David.

113
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:47,300
 So in adopting Jesus to be his legal son,

114
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:52,500
 Jesus would be son of David as well.

115
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,040
 Now why did all this happen?

116
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,100
 Matthew continued, 1:22.

117
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:04,680
 All this took place is to fulfill the will of God.

118
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,660
 What the Lord has said through the prophet.

119
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,540
 Here Isaiah 7.

120
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,820
 The virgin will be with child,

121
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:14,140
 and will give birth to a son,

122
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:16,860
 and they will call his name Emmanuel.

123
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,740
 Well, we sang the song,

124
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:22,780
 which means in Hebrew, God with us.

125
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,020
 Now why did this happen?

126
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,180
 Matthew is quoting a prophecy

127
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,860
 spoken 700 years before the time of Christ.

128
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:34,240
 It was back in the time of the Davidic dynasty,

129
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,240
 and it was about 700 BC, before Christ.

130
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:43,340
 It was a wonderful prediction, right?

131
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,980
 700 years before,

132
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,700
 already prophesied the birth of Jesus Christ.

133
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,620
 Now that is only half of the story,

134
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,620
 because as we know, the Bible is not written to us, right?

135
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,980
 The Bible is not written directly to us,

136
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:58,180
 but the Bible is written for us.

137
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,860
 Now with that said,

138
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,440
 the Bible always has a historical background.

139
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,060
 There are tons of history,

140
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,660
 tons of background behind the Bible.

141
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,020
 So we have to understand why Matthew

142
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,260
 is quoting this prophecy from Isaiah 7.

143
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,420
 So Isaiah 7, let's turn to that.

144
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:19,820
 What happened at that time was that in about 700 BC,

145
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,660
 there was,

146
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:26,940
 the dynasty of David was already divided

147
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,320
 into North and South.

148
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,780
 The Northern Kingdom is called Israel.

149
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,980
 The Southern Kingdom is called Judah.

150
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,060
 Now what happened in 700 BC was that

151
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:38,740
 the Northern Kingdom, Israel,

152
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,700
 and other pagan nation called Aram,

153
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,900
 they decided to form a sort of a military coalition

154
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,160
 against Judah, against Judah in the South.

155
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,020
 Now Judah was a much smaller nation,

156
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,660
 and didn't stand a chance.

157
00:08:56,660 --> 00:09:00,820
 So back then, the king of Judah called Ahaz,

158
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,740
 he was freaking out.

159
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,340
 He was freaking out because these two pagan nations

160
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:10,260
 are invading Jerusalem, invading the nation of Judah.

161
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,180
 So it was about 700 BCE.

162
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:16,620
 This little country was under military attack

163
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:21,500
 by two coalition, Israel and Aram.

164
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:27,300
 So what happened was that when the king was freaking out,

165
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,600
 did not believe in God, did not trust in God,

166
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,740
 then the Lord told Isaiah to prophesize to him,

167
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:39,740
 to speak to King Ahaz.

168
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:44,100
 Verse 10, the Lord spoke to King Ahaz,

169
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,580
 and he said, "Ask the Lord your God for a sign,

170
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:50,860
 "whether it's the deepest depth or the highest heights."

171
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,100
 So the sky is the limit, you can ask anything.

172
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,940
 You can ask a sign from God that God will confirm

173
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,620
 that he is with you.

174
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:00,440
 God is protecting you, and you can trust him.

175
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,980
 But King Ahaz said, "What?

176
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:06,780
 "I will not ask, I will not put the Lord to the test."

177
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,660
 Now that may sound really godly, right?

178
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,640
 I don't wanna test God, I don't wanna tempt God, right?

179
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,100
 But in fact, we know King Ahaz was an evil king.

180
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:19,100
 He did not trust in Yahweh, he did not worship God.

181
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:22,620
 He has actually did something to save himself.

182
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:24,660
 So he scraped the gold and silver

183
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,380
 from the temple in Jerusalem,

184
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,220
 and gave it to another bigger king,

185
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,820
 which is Assyria up on the upper right.

186
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:37,460
 Asked Assyria to help him and save himself.

187
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:41,580
 So he has already taken money out of the temple treasury

188
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:46,580
 to bribe another enemy nation, Assyria, to help him out.

189
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,420
 So he did not trust God,

190
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:51,660
 and hiring the Assyrians to help him out.

191
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:54,300
 Now hiring the Assyrians to help him out

192
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,100
 is like taking money out of the offering box, right?

193
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:01,380
 Taking money out of the offering box

194
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,180
 in order to rob the church.

195
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:08,060
 So Ahaz was a really bad king,

196
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,780
 he did not want to tell the prophet.

197
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:15,780
 Now, but we're at this point, Isaiah continue his word.

198
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:20,540
 Essentially he's saying, even though you don't trust me,

199
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,820
 you don't trust God, how so, David?

200
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,460
 Is it not enough to try the patient of man?

201
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,960
 Will you try the patient of my God also?

202
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,940
 Therefore, the Lord will still give you a sign.

203
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:37,020
 The Lord will still give you a sign,

204
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:40,860
 some sort of evidence to tell you that he is with you,

205
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,540
 even though you are faithless, but God is faithful.

206
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,340
 And that sign is the virgin will be with child

207
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,460
 and will give you a son.

208
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:53,060
 And you will call his name, Emmanuel, God of us.

209
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,180
 Verse 16, and this child will be born,

210
00:11:56,180 --> 00:12:00,980
 but before the boy, this newborn child,

211
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,880
 knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right,

212
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,540
 the land of the two kings, remember Israel and Aram, right?

213
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,460
 It's trying to attack Israel, trying to attack Judah.

214
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:16,300
 These two kings will be laid waste.

215
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:21,460
 Now, I highlight here, verse 16,

216
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,320
 before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong

217
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,780
 and choose the right.

218
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:30,580
 It means when a child is born, continue to grow,

219
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:33,180
 and at some point, he will know what is right and wrong,

220
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,380
 right, what is black and white.

221
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:39,460
 Now, how old is the boy, how old is he,

222
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:42,940
 going to tell the difference between right and wrong?

223
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,340
 Not very old, right?

224
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,540
 Probably in a couple of years, right, two years old.

225
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:50,980
 Know enough to tell what is right and what is wrong.

226
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:54,260
 So essentially, the prophecy of Emmanuel,

227
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:59,260
 in the context, in the background of Isaiah 7, 700 BCE,

228
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,460
 is saying in a couple of years,

229
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,500
 God will save you from trouble.

230
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,460
 God will save you from the attacks

231
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,700
 of the two northern kingdoms.

232
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,840
 God will save you, and you will,

233
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,960
 you have to put your trust in him.

234
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,900
 So God is saying, this boy will be born.

235
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,600
 This prophecy will come true in your day.

236
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:23,260
 In a couple of years, God will save you.

237
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,660
 So you have to put your trust in him.

238
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,020
 This is a test of faith.

239
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:30,920
 But King Ahaz, as we know, he failed the test, right?

240
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,120
 In the midst of difficulties,

241
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,580
 in the midst of difficult circumstances,

242
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,300
 he chose to trust himself, right?

243
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,020
 Hire the Assyrians to help him out.

244
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,220
 He failed the test.

245
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,220
 But God giving this sign, this newborn baby,

246
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:53,820
 is to tell the house of David, he will be with them,

247
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,700
 even though the circumstances look very difficult,

248
00:13:57,700 --> 00:13:58,620
 very challenging.

249
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:03,260
 And then we fast forward 700 years later,

250
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,300
 in the first century, when Christ was born,

251
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,340
 Matthew was telling us, this prophecy fulfilled again

252
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,620
 in the time of Jesus' birth.

253
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,940
 Now you're saying, okay, let me ask the question.

254
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:20,060
 So were there two virgin births?

255
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:24,700
 One 700 before Christ, and then one in the first century

256
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,020
 when Christ was born?

257
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:31,020
 No, no, there were not two virgin births.

258
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:36,020
 All right, because when Isaiah talks about this prophecy,

259
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:40,940
 he used the word for virgin, English is translated virgin,

260
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:43,300
 is actually young woman only.

261
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,980
 So virginity is not required, it's only implied, all right?

262
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,860
 So the word is amar in Hebrew.

263
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,880
 Actually in the Hebrew dictionary,

264
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,420
 there's another word, technical word for virgin,

265
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,260
 which is betulah.

266
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,360
 Isaiah 7 did not use that.

267
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,620
 So it's vague enough, it is broad enough,

268
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,460
 to say that in times of Ahaz, in times of 700 BCE,

269
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,500
 the young woman, not virgin, will bear a child.

270
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:18,100
 And then fast forward 700 years,

271
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:21,060
 in the time of the birth of Jesus,

272
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,340
 the final fulfillment of this prophecy came true.

273
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,420
 You got my point?

274
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,300
 700 years before, there was an initial fulfillment

275
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,100
 in times of King Ahaz.

276
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,640
 Now in the first century, finally we see

277
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,420
 the ultimate fulfillment of the word of God.

278
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:44,420
 So the promise in the Old Testament,

279
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:53,520
 always have, or often has, multiple fulfillments.

280
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:58,460
 When God says something, sometimes it was initially fulfilled

281
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:02,080
 in his own time, but then there are multiple fulfillments

282
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,360
 until the time of Christ fulfilled all of them.

283
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,480
 For example, the first temple built

284
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,440
 by the son of David, Solomon, right?

285
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,040
 The first temple was prophesied to be built,

286
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:19,040
 and it was indeed built by King Solomon, the first temple.

287
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,840
 And then several hundred years later,

288
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,040
 the temple was destroyed by the Babylonians.

289
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,560
 The people were in exile.

290
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,720
 The Jewish people were in exile in Babylon.

291
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,600
 And then 70 years later, they returned

292
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:33,600
 to the land of Palestine, they rebuilt their own home,

293
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,540
 and they rebuilt a second temple, another fulfillment.

294
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,000
 And then in the time of Christ, Christ is saying,

295
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,800
 he's responding to the Jerusalem temple,

296
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,680
 built by stone, built by hands.

297
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,080
 He said, "If you destroy this temple,

298
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,640
 "I will rebuild it in three days."

299
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,720
 Now what Jesus was saying was that,

300
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,700
 "I will rebuild my own body.

301
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:58,680
 "I will resurrect from the dead,

302
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,260
 "and my body will be the new temple."

303
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,140
 That is the ultimate fulfillment.

304
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,120
 Now what I'm saying is, in the Old Testament,

305
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,120
 when you find some prophecies,

306
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:09,480
 it's not necessarily it has to be fulfilled

307
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,880
 many, many years later.

308
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:15,440
 There are many different multiple fulfillments along the way.

309
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,440
 And this is also true for Isaiah 7, the Emmanuel prophecy.

310
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,600
 So when Matthew penned the gospel,

311
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,960
 he was checking many different accounts,

312
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:33,000
 many different stories, some he had heard before,

313
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,440
 because he followed Jesus for a few years.

314
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,520
 He's one of the 12 disciples.

315
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,880
 He knows something about the story of Christ.

316
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,380
 He also gathered and collected different stories

317
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:47,040
 from different disciples of different traditions.

318
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:50,120
 He put together the gospel of Matthew.

319
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,860
 Now the question for you is,

320
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,200
 the very beginning I asked you,

321
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,040
 where in the New Testament you can find

322
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,560
 the story of first Christmas, right?

323
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:03,600
 One of them is gospel of Matthew, of course, right?

324
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,640
 Now, why was gospel of Matthew written?

325
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:14,740
 Why did Matthew decide to write a gospel of Matthew?

326
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:18,560
 Where you find the life of Christ,

327
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,340
 different story stitched together,

328
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:25,080
 come together as one book, gospel of Matthew.

329
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,220
 Again, it's the historical background.

330
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:29,960
 Because in the first century,

331
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,400
 when Matthew wrote the first gospel, the gospel of Matthew,

332
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,080
 the young church was in crisis.

333
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,360
 It was under the Roman Empire.

334
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,160
 It was being persecuted.

335
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,840
 And the young church being persecuted,

336
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,160
 the people in the church, many of them are Jewish believers,

337
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,480
 they need to reconsolidate their faith.

338
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,960
 They need to understand what they really believe in.

339
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,960
 That's why Matthew decided to write the gospel of Matthew.

340
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,860
 To tell the church what you should believe.

341
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,700
 And to strengthen the faith of the church.

342
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,100
 So Matthew is collecting different stories of gospel.

343
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:12,140
 And then he traced the story and find a certain pattern.

344
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,540
 For Jesus, when he looks at the birth of Jesus,

345
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,980
 the first Christmas, he found that Jesus

346
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,020
 is indeed the son of David.

347
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,460
 Because Joseph is the son of David.

348
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,160
 And that's why Matthew, in chapter one,

349
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:30,300
 if you turn to the very first chapter of the New Testament,

350
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,140
 it's not very appealing.

351
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,740
 It's the genealogy of Jesus, right?

352
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:39,740
 So he traces from Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,

353
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:42,580
 generation after generation to King David,

354
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,540
 the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth, King David.

355
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,580
 And then he traced after David, Solomon,

356
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,400
 and all the kings in the divided kingdom.

357
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,160
 And then finally it comes to the Babylonian exile.

358
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,460
 When everything seems to be over,

359
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:01,460
 when the nation of Judah was attacked

360
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:04,020
 and destroyed by the Babylonians,

361
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,440
 everything seems game over,

362
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,100
 he continued to trace the genealogy.

363
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,740
 No, God is still faithful.

364
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,820
 And generation after generation from exile,

365
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,300
 he traced another generation of Sababel,

366
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,260
 Jewish people who come back to Jerusalem

367
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,900
 and rebuild the temple.

368
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,800
 And generation after generation doesn't end.

369
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,560
 And finally it comes to Joseph and Mary.

370
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,240
 And then Jesus.

371
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,000
 That's why in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter one,

372
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,800
 after tracing the genealogy of Jesus Christ from Abraham,

373
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,240
 David to exile to Jesus Christ,

374
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,760
 verse 17, it says,

375
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:48,760
 there were 14 generations in all from Abraham to David.

376
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:52,480
 And then from David to the exile to Babylon,

377
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,040
 there were 14 generations.

378
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:58,520
 And then from exile to the coming of Christ,

379
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,000
 to Christ, Jesus, there were also 14 generations.

380
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,800
 So he divided the entire Old Testament,

381
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:10,060
 all together about 39 books together.

382
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,160
 Matthew divides the entire Old Testament history

383
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,780
 into three periods, 14 generations for each.

384
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,620
 Now the question for you, why 14?

385
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,660
 Why 14?

386
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,860
 All right, why 14?

387
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:27,180
 Now in the ancient Hebrew culture,

388
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:29,740
 they didn't have the Arabic numerals,

389
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,760
 like what we do have, one, two, three, four, and so on.

390
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:38,580
 Every letter of the 22 letters of Hebrew,

391
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,940
 each alphabet represents a numerical value.

392
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:45,300
 Like the first one, aleph, is one.

393
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,660
 The second one, bay, is two.

394
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,740
 Gimel is three.

395
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,260
 Dalet is four.

396
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,460
 And then hey is five, and so on.

397
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:56,260
 Val is the sixth letter, is number six.

398
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,580
 So they used different letters to represent different numbers.

399
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:04,820
 Now David, King David's name,

400
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,300
 it was originally written without the val.

401
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:10,740
 So you take out the a and i, you've got dvd.

402
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:15,260
 So David was originally written as dvd or dwd.

403
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:19,180
 D is the fourth letter, and v, or w, is the sixth letter.

404
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:23,460
 So you add them all up, and you get 14.

405
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,460
 So 14 is the royal number for the King David's dynasty.

406
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:31,940
 So when Matthew was tracing the Christmas story,

407
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,540
 he find that the long genealogy of Jesus Christ

408
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,300
 actually is 14 generations for three periods.

409
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,420
 And of course, as the son of David,

410
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,020
 the real son of David, the final son of David,

411
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:47,580
 his number is also 14, right?

412
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,060
 14.

413
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,100
 The birth of Jesus Christ is so much more

414
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,380
 than the miracle birth of virgin birth.

415
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:58,100
 Okay, so note this.

416
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:02,380
 Of course, Jesus was born as a virgin,

417
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:04,100
 the divinity of Christ.

418
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,260
 He is the deity, he's 100% God and 100% human.

419
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,300
 What a miracle.

420
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,940
 It was indeed a miracle.

421
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:14,500
 But the prophecy in Isaiah 7, the Emmanuel sign,

422
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,900
 is so much more than just the miraculous nature

423
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:19,060
 of the birth.

424
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,020
 It is the timing of the birth.

425
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:25,980
 700 years before Christ, in time of King Ahaz.

426
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,740
 It was just at the right time, God save his people.

427
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,540
 Here in the first century, God did the same thing.

428
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,860
 Right, so Matthew is trying to rethink,

429
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,700
 trace the pattern in the first Christmas story.

430
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:42,460
 And the story doesn't stop there,

431
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,140
 because in chapter two of the Gospel of Matthew,

432
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:48,940
 you remember the so-called three wise men, right?

433
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,700
 The three wise men from the east,

434
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,100
 they came to Jerusalem to worship the newborn king.

435
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,220
 They came to the town Bethlehem.

436
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:03,180
 Now Bethlehem is the hometown of David, right?

437
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,020
 Remember that?

438
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:08,660
 The hometown of David was Bethlehem,

439
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,580
 and Christ Jesus was born in Bethlehem.

440
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,700
 So this, Herod the Great, at the time,

441
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,940
 it was Herod the Great, the evil king,

442
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:22,140
 he was an other pharaoh-like oppressor,

443
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:24,380
 trying to persecute the baby Jesus, right?

444
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:26,420
 The boy Jesus, trying to kill him.

445
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:31,420
 So Joseph took his entire family, Jesus and Mary,

446
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:37,620
 became a refugee, and went down to Egypt by night.

447
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:43,940
 So Matthew, thinking about this story,

448
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:49,980
 in chapter two, verse 15, why did this happen?

449
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:53,300
 Jesus became a refugee, went down to Egypt.

450
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:58,980
 He said, "So it is, to fulfill what God has said

451
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,740
 "through the prophet."

452
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,740
 And he is quoting from Hosea, chapter 11.

453
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,980
 It says, "Out of Egypt I call my son."

454
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,100
 Out of Egypt I call my son.

455
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,540
 Now you check, you go back if you have time,

456
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,140
 go back to the book of Hosea in the Old Testament.

457
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:20,320
 It was not about prediction.

458
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,020
 It was not about predicting 700 years later,

459
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,540
 or so many years later,

460
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,980
 then Jesus will come out of Egypt.

461
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,580
 The entire chapter is talking about

462
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,780
 God's commitment to his people.

463
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:36,620
 When they were suffering in the land of slavery,

464
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,100
 in the land of bondage, to be slaves for Pharaoh.

465
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:46,260
 In Hosea 11, God is saying, "I will not abandon you.

466
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,780
 "I will be with you.

467
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,540
 "I will rescue you out of Egypt.

468
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:52,700
 "There will be an exodus."

469
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:55,220
 So Matthew is chasing the Christmas story.

470
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,220
 He is seeing a pattern.

471
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:00,820
 Jesus went down to Egypt, and he will come out of Egypt

472
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,820
 because God will not forget his people.

473
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:07,900
 In Jesus, there will be the real exodus.

474
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,660
 In the story of Jesus, he also went through exodus,

475
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,860
 just like the Old Testament people of Israel.

476
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,020
 They went down to Egypt,

477
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,900
 and they came out of Egypt in the exodus.

478
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:22,900
 And in Jesus, finally, we see the real final exodus.

479
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,020
 And the story continues.

480
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,640
 King Herod tried to kill the boys

481
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,820
 under two years old in Bethlehem.

482
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:35,500
 As you can see, it's horrible.

483
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,620
 It's a horrible story.

484
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:39,820
 Under two years old, all the boys, he slaughtered them.

485
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:45,260
 2.17, Matthew sees another pattern.

486
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:48,060
 He said, "This happened is to fulfill

487
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:51,020
 "what was said by Prophet Jeremiah.

488
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:56,940
 "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and mourning.

489
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:58,980
 "Rachel, weeping for her children

490
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:01,260
 "and refusing to be comforted

491
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,700
 "because the children are no more."

492
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:06,860
 You see the pattern here.

493
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:10,460
 He's quoting Jeremiah 31.

494
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:14,940
 And Jeremiah was about 500 years before Christ.

495
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:19,060
 What Jeremiah was talking about in chapter 31

496
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,020
 is that when the Babylonian slaughtered the Jewish people,

497
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,820
 killed them one by one,

498
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:30,500
 and captured them at a place called Ramah,

499
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,620
 and a place called Ramah,

500
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:34,140
 and Ramah happened to be just close to,

501
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,620
 right next to Bethlehem.

502
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,860
 It was tragic for the nation

503
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:43,420
 because the nation was finally, seems like game over.

504
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:48,420
 And all the men of Judah was being captured at Ramah,

505
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:54,260
 and they marched from Ramah all the way out to Babylon.

506
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,700
 It was in the time of exile.

507
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,180
 It was in the time of weeping and loss.

508
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:04,220
 Lost the men, the children of Judah.

509
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:06,660
 Jeremiah 31.

510
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:12,420
 You keep on seeing the context there.

511
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:17,420
 If you check what Jeremiah 31 has to say next,

512
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,100
 it's not just about the exile.

513
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,340
 Because 31, Jeremiah 31,

514
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:27,620
 is about the return, the hope of return.

515
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,660
 Even though the people of God is in exile,

516
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,540
 God will wipe away their tears.

517
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:37,420
 God will comfort them again,

518
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:39,820
 will bring them back to the land,

519
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,380
 will give them back to homeland.

520
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:46,940
 You see the pattern here as Matthew sees it.

521
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,900
 In Jesus, we see the real return,

522
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,580
 the true return to homeland.

523
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:58,340
 The true home is found in Jesus Christ.

524
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:02,180
 He will wipe away our tears of exile.

525
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:06,260
 Early on, we were praying for our community.

526
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:10,500
 Tragic news that we receive.

527
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,020
 So in the middle of last week,

528
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:16,740
 one of my friends called me.

529
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:20,860
 He's a very close friend of the victim's family.

530
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:23,740
 He called me and said, "Hey, Mark,

531
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:28,100
 "so-and-so just died from a gunshot."

532
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,340
 I could not believe that.

533
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,540
 I could not believe that.

534
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,700
 What a tragic news.

535
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,780
 And other one hitting our community.

536
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:40,020
 So in times like this,

537
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:42,860
 we always ask ourselves, where's our home?

538
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:48,100
 Where do we go that we have real security,

539
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:50,740
 that we'll have real hope?

540
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,260
 We'll find this place to be really like our home.

541
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:57,060
 We fear our insecurity.

542
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:02,060
 We fear about the craziness going on in our world.

543
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,700
 We don't feel like home.

544
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,500
 That is what happened to the Jewish people.

545
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,140
 Yes, they returned from Babylonian exile,

546
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,620
 but empire after empire, they're persecuting them.

547
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:16,780
 They were living, we were in a very, very hard life.

548
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:18,820
 They were still living in exile.

549
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:22,500
 Matthew was saying in the Christmas story,

550
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,860
 if you hope for a real return,

551
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,300
 it's not a political return.

552
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,460
 It's not a historical return.

553
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,460
 It's a spiritual return.

554
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,980
 You return to Jesus Christ,

555
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:39,980
 you will find that your tears, your mourning be over

556
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:44,140
 because the eternal hope that we have in Jesus Christ.

557
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,860
 Christmas story continues.

558
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:52,820
 After King Herod died, Jesus and his family,

559
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:57,420
 Joseph took his whole family out of Egypt

560
00:30:57,420 --> 00:30:59,140
 and back to the land of Israel.

561
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:01,700
 And eventually they settled down

562
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:04,940
 in a place called Nazareth in Galilee.

563
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,860
 It's a very small town.

564
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,780
 And Matthew concludes the entire Christmas story

565
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,700
 with this saying.

566
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,180
 Having been warned in dream by the angel,

567
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:19,660
 Joseph withdrew to the district of Galilee

568
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,100
 and he went and lived in a town,

569
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,940
 settled down there called Nazareth.

570
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:28,820
 So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets.

571
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,900
 He will be called a Nazarene.

572
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:35,900
 Now, the prophets talk about Nazarene.

573
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,380
 Actually, no.

574
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,820
 If you check the entire Old Testament, 39 books,

575
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,980
 not one place mentioned the town of Nazareth.

576
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:49,620
 But Matthew is saying, hey, the prophets are actually saying

577
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:54,020
 that the Messiah will be a Nazarene.

578
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,660
 Now, here we need to understand how the Jewish people,

579
00:31:57,660 --> 00:32:00,660
 especially the rabbis, how they read scripture.

580
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:02,420
 Sometimes they will pick different words

581
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,300
 and connect different dots.

582
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:08,260
 Some of the words, they sound alike, sound very similar.

583
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,740
 They will connect them together.

584
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,140
 And what we find in Isaiah 11,

585
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,020
 in fact, there is a prophecy,

586
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,740
 there is a promise to the house of David

587
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:22,380
 that sounded like Nazareth, 11.1.

588
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,420
 It says a soot will come up from the stump of Jesse.

589
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,340
 Okay, the stump of Jesse.

590
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,260
 The tree is being chopped down.

591
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:35,740
 It's like the nation of Judah being destroyed, right?

592
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:37,260
 It's like a dead tree.

593
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,420
 The stump of Jesse.

594
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,340
 Why Jesse?

595
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:42,020
 Jesse is the father of David, okay?

596
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:46,100
 It's the dynasty, the forefather of the dynasty, the nation.

597
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:49,180
 The stump of Jesse is being chopped down.

598
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,180
 However, there is a branch grow from the stump.

599
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,940
 And the branch in Hebrew is Nasi.

600
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,740
 Nasi will grow and the spirit of the Lord

601
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,020
 will be with his servant

602
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:05,540
 and the servant will be the redeemer, the Messiah.

603
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:10,540
 Nasi will grow out of death, out of the ashes.

604
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:15,420
 God is still there with them, with the people of God.

605
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,740
 And the dynasty of David, the house of David,

606
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,820
 will not be forgotten.

607
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:25,260
 So actually, this is the prophecy Matthew is referring to.

608
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,500
 A Nasi will grow up.

609
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,020
 The Nasi will grow up out of the ashes, out of darkness.

610
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,580
 The nation of Judah, the people of God,

611
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,140
 the kingdom of God will come.

612
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:41,540
 This is actually how the Jewish rabbi

613
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,660
 would like to read scripture.

614
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,780
 This is one of their techniques.

615
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,700
 It's called mitrash.

616
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:48,700
 Mitrash means seeking.

617
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:53,340
 In Hebrew, it means to stop and to ponder.

618
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,460
 That's what mitrash means.

619
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:01,300
 It's a technique of reading and interpreting scripture.

620
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,900
 Connecting the dots.

621
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,620
 You see the pattern here?

622
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:07,500
 This whole story of Israel in the Old Testament

623
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:11,460
 found in the story of the first Christmas.

624
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,260
 Find in the life of Christ.

625
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,340
 When you look at the life of Jesus,

626
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:20,940
 you look at the entire Old Testament story,

627
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,940
 and you see the faithfulness of God.

628
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:28,900
 Mitrash, to ponder, to stop, and to ask the question,

629
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,980
 what child is this?

630
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,940
 What is this?

631
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:37,300
 Who is this Christmas child that we are celebrating,

632
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:38,460
 that we are worshiping?

633
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:43,220
 What does this child bring you, bring to your life?

634
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:48,260
 You see the parent, Matthew C., the son of David,

635
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:52,020
 continues until ultimately fulfilled

636
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,060
 in the life of Jesus Christ.

637
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:59,060
 You see Exodus, Moses come out of Egypt,

638
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:01,540
 having freedom, true freedom.

639
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,380
 You find the ultimate fulfillment in Christ.

640
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,380
 Exile, the tears of exile will be wiped out in Jesus Christ.

641
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,300
 We turn from exile.

642
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,540
 The true home that we find is in Jesus and no other.

643
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:19,860
 Our true home is found in Christ.

644
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,620
 Look around the world, as I said.

645
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:28,620
 All this unrest and all this crisis and pandemic continues.

646
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:34,180
 Sometimes in situation like this,

647
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:37,540
 we always say to ourselves or say to each other,

648
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:40,100
 I wanna move somewhere else, right?

649
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:41,860
 Have you ever thought about it?

650
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:44,500
 Move out of Chicago, then you will be safe, right?

651
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,180
 Move out of Chicago, move somewhere else,

652
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:49,700
 somewhere beautiful, right?

653
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,620
 Somewhere secure, and then you will be safe.

654
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,740
 The Bible is telling us the true home is found

655
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,340
 no other than in Jesus.

656
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,340
 When you have Jesus Christ in your life,

657
00:36:00,340 --> 00:36:02,860
 then you will have eternity.

658
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:05,100
 That's what Mitrash is talking about.

659
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,100
 That's what Mitrash is saying.

660
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:12,100
 To stop and to ponder, who is this baby Jesus

661
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,580
 that we worship every Christmas?

662
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,620
 If you choose to trust in Jesus Christ,

663
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,380
 you will find the true security.

664
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:26,020
 Don't look anywhere else, look up.

665
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:32,060
 The child born in Christmas, he gives us the true freedom,

666
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:35,860
 the true Exodus, the true return, the true home.

667
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:41,340
 Lastly, as we close, I wanna go back

668
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:45,100
 to the very first sentence of the New Testament.

669
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:48,340
 We often miss this first verse.

670
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:53,300
 A record of genealogy of Jesus Christ,

671
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,500
 the son of David, the son of Abraham.

672
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,300
 In Greek, the original language of the New Testament,

673
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:05,700
 the record of genealogy is Bibliogenesis.

674
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:10,060
 Now, if you know a little bit about English,

675
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:13,300
 Bibliogenesis, Bibliogenesis,

676
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:19,420
 you find words that are sounding so similar.

677
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:23,420
 The book of Genesis, the first book of the New Testament,

678
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:26,540
 the first book of the entire Bible is the book of Genesis,

679
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:28,180
 the book of new beginning,

680
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:30,220
 because God created heaven and the earth.

681
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:33,220
 He created the entire cosmos.

682
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,060
 That is the original creation.

683
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:38,820
 But then the first sentence of the New Testament,

684
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:43,820
 it says Bibliogenesis, the book of Genesis,

685
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,620
 the real Genesis, the new creation,

686
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:50,180
 found in Jesus Christ.

687
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:52,820
 When we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord,

688
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:56,940
 when we follow Jesus Christ, we have new beginning,

689
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:02,380
 and this is the only true new beginning we need.

690
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,740
 Now, who is Jesus to you?

691
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,420
 Who is Christ to you?

692
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,020
 Stop and ponder.

693
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:12,740
 Put your trust in him.

694
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:17,500
 Put our trust in Christ that we'll find new beginning

695
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:20,300
 to live as the people of God, right?

696
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:22,580
 To be his sons and daughters,

697
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:26,260
 to have hope and security wherever we are,

698
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:28,700
 no matter how dark the world out there,

699
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,980
 we still have light because Jesus Christ is the true light.

700
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,460
 Let's all pray together.

701
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,380
 Oh God, we give you thanks

702
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:41,180
 for the fact that you are our true light.

703
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:44,020
 And in this first Christmas story,

704
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:48,340
 we see the hope that you offer to all of us

705
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,540
 in the name of Jesus Christ.

706
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:54,700
 Thank you for sending your son to be born in this world,

707
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:00,540
 to bear our suffering, to bear our struggles,

708
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:05,020
 to wipe out our tears, and to grant us true freedom,

709
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,340
 the true exodus, true return, true home.

710
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:15,580
 And I pray that all of us will put our trust anew in you.

711
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,500
 We'll again choose to trust in you,

712
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:21,300
 again choose to believe in you,

713
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:26,460
 and help each one of us to be your true son and daughter,

714
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:31,460
 to live by your word, to live by your scripture,

715
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:35,580
 to follow and obey your will.

716
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:39,300
 In this Christmas, we pray that you will continue

717
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:42,700
 to renew our hearts, renew our trust

718
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:44,780
 in our Lord Jesus Christ,

719
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,020
 and he will continue to lead our lives.

720
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:50,940
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

721
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,740
 Well, God bless.
