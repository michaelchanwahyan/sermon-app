1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 My dear brothers and sisters, good morning.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Okay, you know what, last week actually was the first Sunday worship we had together after the merger.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 So it seems like, you know what, it seems like transplanting our organ.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 So it'll take some time.

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 So when you look at each other, actually they are you.

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 Okay, we are one body.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 It means that they are part of you, you are part of they, part of them.

8
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
 So you need to accept each other as one body of Christ.

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Okay, so this is my homework for all of you guys.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 So before you go home after this worship, as one body, practice oneness.

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 Like what?

12
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 Meet three strangers around you.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 So urban voices, urban voice, you guys, you meet your new brothers and sisters.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 Learn them by their name.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 Look at their eyes, ask their job, and ask their lives, okay?

16
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 Do the same thing.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 Okay, so Puneon, former Puneon, now you are urban voice, don't forget that.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 So ask the other brothers and sisters how they are doing now, okay?

19
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 This is practicing oneness in Christ.

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
 So I don't know, can we have the title on the screen, today's message?

21
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 The message of -- the title of today's message is like this.

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Keep your heart more from the evil than from COVID.

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Did you get it?

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 What is the title?

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Keep your heart more from the evil than you are trying to keep from -- keep yourself from COVID.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 So our COVID situation is going on and on.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 And this COVID situation is the most inconvenient and fearful and dreadful period of our lives.

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 So what did you experience?

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 Do you remember last year, March, COVID situation started in Chicago and then a few months, for the following a few months, everything was closed down.

30
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 Do you remember lockdown?

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 There was no people on the streets.

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 And all the public places were closed.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 We couldn't do anything.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 There was COVID-19.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 And how about these days?

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 I have three children.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 They go to the public -- they go to the school.

38
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 Whenever they have any symptom, like a very light symptom or a mere little fever or just if they -- even if just they sneeze, they need to take the COVID-19 test.

39
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 Okay?

40
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 So COVID-19 is now -- has been so serious for all of us.

41
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 Even after one and a half years later now, more than that, what did you learn?

42
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 What is the greatest lesson through this COVID-19?

43
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 What did you learn?

44
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 I learned about the importance of cleanliness.

45
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 So you guys place some -- what is that?

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 Sanitizers in front of the doors everywhere.

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 What do you think of?

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Cleanliness.

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 Through this COVID-19, what we learned most is cleanliness, the importance of cleanliness.

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 And in today's story, Jesus and the Pharisees and teachers of the law, they were arguing about the true cleanliness.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Why?

52
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 When Jesus' disciples, they joined eating the food, Jesus' disciples, they were maybe -- they were too hungry.

53
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 So they didn't wash their hands.

54
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 So what did they do?

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 Jesus' disciples didn't wash their hands, and they were beginning to eat the food.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 When the Pharisees and teachers of the law, when they looked at them, they were shocked.

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
 What are you guys -- what are you doing?

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 We Jewish people, if we do not wash our hands, we do not eat any food.

59
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 That is our cleanliness.

60
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 We are holy people.

61
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 That's what the Pharisees were thinking.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 Right?

63
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 They were super holy people, super clean people.

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 So they were talking about some cleanliness.

65
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 But when Jesus heard it, Jesus began to talk about another kind of cleanliness.

66
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 What is that?

67
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 Jesus said, when you can read your Bible, please keep your Bible open, and you can go back to the verses again and again together.

68
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 When you look at verse 15, Jesus says like this, "Nothing outside a man can make him unclean by going into him.

69
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 It is rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean."

70
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 Did you hear that?

71
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 So here, when Jesus heard the Pharisees and teachers of the law, Jesus is giving a totally different interpretation about the true cleanliness.

72
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 So, what is that?

73
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 The Pharisees and teachers of the law, they were talking about physical cleanliness, visible, which is visible.

74
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 Visible, physical cleanliness.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 But Jesus was talking about what?

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 Spiritual, invisible cleanliness.

77
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Which is more important?

78
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 Pharisees and teachers of the law, they were keeping the law so well.

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 So they thought we are holy people.

80
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
 But when Jesus was looking at them, Jesus knew that they were actually unclean.

81
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Who is unclean?

82
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 The Pharisees and teachers of the law.

83
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 For an example, Jesus was pointing out their fault.

84
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 You are washing your hands before eating the food, but actually you are not holy people.

85
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 You are unclean, dirty people.

86
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Why?

87
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 Because look at what you are doing now.

88
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 What is that Jesus is pointing out?

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 Jesus talked about Korban.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Everybody, Korban.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 Korban.

92
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 C-O-R-B-A-N.

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Korban is some amount of money, very precious gift set aside only for God.

94
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 So the people, they set aside quite a lot of money, and they called it Korban, which is a gift to God.

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Then what happens?

96
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:33,000
 If you set aside a lot of money for God, it means that you don't need to support your parents.

97
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 So many Jewish people, they were avoiding the duty of supporting their parents, making their money as a kind of Korban.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 But actually in their tradition, they were not supporting their parents.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 At the same time, they were not worshipping God with their true genuine heart.

100
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 That is their heart.

101
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 So when Jesus was talking about this, what did Jesus do?

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 This is not the only thing.

103
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 When you go down to verse 13, Jesus says that this is not the only thing.

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Actually, Jesus says, "You are doing many other things like this Korban."

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 So look at you guys.

106
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 You are trying to keep the law, but actually you are ignoring the law.

107
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 You are not keeping the law.

108
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 So are you really clean?

109
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 Jesus was asking the Pharisees and teachers of the law.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 Then my brothers and sisters in this place, which is more important?

111
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 Physical cleanliness, visual cleanliness.

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 When you guys are coming to the church, if you do not wash, people will look at you.

113
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 "Oh, look at the guy. Oh, smell. Did you brush your teeth? We don't like it, right?"

114
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 But how about the cleanness?

115
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 What is the true cleanness?

116
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 Physical, visual cleanliness, one side.

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 The other side, spiritual, invisible cleanliness, which is more important.

118
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
 Actually, you cannot compare.

119
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 If you are not clean in your body, it's okay.

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 People will frown, make a frowning face at you.

121
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 That's it.

122
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 But if your heart is not clean, what happens?

123
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Because of this dirtiness, people go to hell.

124
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 If our conscience, if our mind and heart is not cleaned by Jesus' blood,

125
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 if our heart is not clean, then what happens to the people?

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 They will go to hell.

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 Spiritual uncleanness gives us that penalty, which is more important.

128
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 What else?

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 If our spirit is not clean, what happens?

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 It governs all the areas of our lives.

131
00:08:52,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 Actually, our spiritual condition shapes and decides the whole quality of our lives.

132
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Are you now painful because your spirit is not clean?

133
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 Are you now anxious or fearful because your spirit has a problem?

134
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 Your spiritual condition decides everything in your life.

135
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 I had a couple of days of short trip this week, and then I couldn't brush my teeth every time, three times per day.

136
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 When I didn't do it, when I came back from the trip, I realized my teeth.

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 I felt a little pain in my gum because I'm an old man.

138
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 But listen, if our spirit is not clean, day by day, moment by moment,

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 we harvest what we sow when we do not take care of our spirit.

140
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 Then let's think about this.

141
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 When you read the scripture together, what is the source of the spiritual uncleanness?

142
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 If you do not brush your teeth, what is the source?

143
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Yes, a little tiny piece of the food inside and between the teeth.

144
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 That is the source, right?

145
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 Of the stinky smell.

146
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 But how about the source of the spiritual uncleanness?

147
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 What is that?

148
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 This is very important.

149
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 My brothers and sisters, listen to me very carefully.

150
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 This knowledge is really, really important.

151
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 You young people, you need to listen very carefully today.

152
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 What is the source of the spiritual uncleanness?

153
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Verse 15.

154
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 Can we go back to verse 15?

155
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 It's very important.

156
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Do you see any verse?

157
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Okay, verse 15, listen to me.

158
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 It is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean.

159
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Nothing outside of man makes him unclean.

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Rather, it is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean.

161
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 What did that mean?

162
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 When disciples heard this verse, they didn't understand, just like you.

163
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 They didn't understand.

164
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 How come?

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 Something out of us, it makes unclean.

166
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 It is not from outside, but from our inside, that is the thing which makes us unclean.

167
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 The disciples didn't understand the first explanation.

168
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 So when Jesus was alone with the disciples, Jesus was explaining one more time.

169
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 From verse 21 to 23.

170
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 Listen very carefully, you young people.

171
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 This is very important knowledge.

172
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Verse 21.

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 For from within, out of man's heart, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance, and folly.

174
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 All these evils, verse 23, all these evils come from inside.

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 Where?

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 Not from outside, but from inside and make a man unclean.

177
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 What does that mean?

178
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 All these evil thoughts, what are the evil thoughts?

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 When they enumerate, when Jesus was enumerating all these unclean evil thoughts, Jesus summarized the first one, evil thoughts.

180
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 What are the evil thoughts?

181
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Coming out of your mind, inside.

182
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 Number one, sexual immorality.

183
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 All kinds of dirty desires, sexual desires, dirty desires.

184
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 Where does it come from?

185
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 And then theft, what is that theft?

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 You want to steal.

187
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 Are you paying the tax honestly?

188
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Even so many Christians, they are deceived by the Satan, by the evil spirit.

189
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 And even paying the taxes, they are not honest.

190
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 So when you hear the word theft, you are thinking about really huge rich people?

191
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
 No.

192
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 So many of us, we are choosing the wrong things.

193
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Theft, that is stealing some money in whatever ways.

194
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 Or murder, what is murder?

195
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 Jesus said, if you have a hatred inside you, if you have a small hatred inside you, it's just stealing.

196
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 It's killing people.

197
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 Adultery, adultery.

198
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Greed, what is greed?

199
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 You desire more than enough.

200
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 You have already enough.

201
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 Who is now hungry?

202
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 Now in our society, you are hungry?

203
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 Pastor Mark, Rachel is now hungry.

204
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 She raised, okay, not that kind of meaning.

205
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 You have enough money to buy food, but what I'm saying is, like, nobody is hungry in our society now.

206
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 But people are desiring more.

207
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 People are desiring more and more.

208
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 There is no satisfaction.

209
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 There is no thankfulness.

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Greed, how about malice?

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 What is malice?

212
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 Young people, what is malice?

213
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 Okay, you did the wrong thing to me.

214
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Okay, I'm going to hate you until I die.

215
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Malice.

216
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 How about deceit?

217
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Are you honest in dealing with your job?

218
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 Dealing with any responsibility?

219
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Deceit, lewdness, what is lewdness?

220
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 Sexually dirty in words and thoughts and behavior.

221
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 Envy, what is envy?

222
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 You have already enough, but you think that the person, what the person has now is what I now want.

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 So you continuously desire what others have.

224
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Envy.

225
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 Until when?

226
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Until you die.

227
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 You are never fully satisfied.

228
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 You never understand that God is the wonderful provider.

229
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 And then slander, what is slander?

230
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 You talk back, you're biting persons, any character, anything behind their back.

231
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 Okay, how about arrogance?

232
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
 Pride and folly.

233
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 All kinds of foolish things.

234
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 You choose foolish words, foolish behavior, but you think that it's okay.

235
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 When you look at other people, when they are doing it, you are shocked.

236
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Why they are doing such a foolish thing?

237
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 But actually, that's what we are doing.

238
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Then brothers and sisters, where do all these evil thoughts come from?

239
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Today's passage is very important.

240
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 It is not from outside, but it is from inside.

241
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Inside.

242
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 Who is inside?

243
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 Who is inside?

244
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 So when you go to the scripture, 1 John 3, verse 8-9.

245
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 When you go to the scripture, 1 John 3, verse 8-9, it goes like this.

246
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 He who does what is sinful is of the devil.

247
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Did you hear me?

248
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 He who does what is sinful is of the devil.

249
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 Because the devil has been sinning from the beginning.

250
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 What does this verse talk about?

251
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 Any sin, every sin is from the Satan.

252
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 It's from the enemy.

253
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 Because when God made us, we were made in God's image.

254
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 What does that mean?

255
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 We love, we desire the true love.

256
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 We desire the holiness.

257
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 We desire the cleanness.

258
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 That's how God made us.

259
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 But all these kinds of evil and dirty thoughts come from the Satan.

260
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 So where is Satan?

261
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 In your heart.

262
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Inside you.

263
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,000
 In your thoughts.

264
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 In your emotions.

265
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 They have built their house in there.

266
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 So this is a very important understanding.

267
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 Jesus said it is not, it is what comes out of a man that makes him unclean.

268
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 So who is inside us?

269
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 The Satan, the evil spirit.

270
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 You may wonder, how can it happen?

271
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 Yeah, that's what the Bible reveals.

272
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 That's the truth the Bible reveals about.

273
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:50,000
 Then, from today, when you have that kind of dirty and evil thoughts, emotions, imaginations, and feelings, and all those things,

274
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 what should you think?

275
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 Oh, you Satan.

276
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 Are you trying to enter my heart?

277
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Again, you should understand.

278
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 All those evil desires is not your desire.

279
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 You need to understand that those desires are from the Satan.

280
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Okay?

281
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 That is the teaching.

282
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 That's what Jesus teaches today in today's passage.

283
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Then, let's think more about this.

284
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 How does Satan's uncleanness enter us?

285
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 Okay, Satan can enter through our thoughts, through our emotions, especially through our hearts.

286
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Then how does it happen?

287
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 What is our heart?

288
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 Our heart is like a cockpit.

289
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Do you know cockpit?

290
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 Cockpit is the small place in front of the airplane where the pilot flies the whole airplane.

291
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 It's a very small place, cockpit.

292
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 Our heart is like a cockpit.

293
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Our heart is the center of our being.

294
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 In our heart, what happens?

295
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 In our heart, we decide and we discern which is right and which is wrong.

296
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 At the same time, we know that, "Oh, that's good. That's not bad. That's good. That's bad."

297
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,000
 Our heart is the place we discern and we decide everything.

298
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
 So our heart is the center of us.

299
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Right?

300
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 Then this heart can be stolen by the evil spirit.

301
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 So actually, when we were talking, Pastor Mark read some parts, but actually read a little bit more than I expected, but it was good.

302
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 Why?

303
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Because when Pastor Mark read the following passage, it shows two people.

304
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 One is a little daughter of a woman.

305
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 The little daughter was possessed by an evil spirit.

306
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 Possessed.

307
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 The Bible says possessed by the evil spirit.

308
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Second case was like this.

309
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 What is the second case?

310
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 The last story. Do you remember?

311
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 What is that?

312
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 Death man.

313
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:24,000
 Jesus says the death came from the evil spirit.

314
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:34,000
 So when you look at these people, when you look at the Bible, you need to understand that much, much more than we can think, ever think.

315
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 There are a lot of evil possession cases.

316
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 We see like a physical condition.

317
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,000
 Like some psychological issue, mental issue, or a physical issue.

318
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:50,000
 But behind that, a lot of spiritual issues too.

319
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 Okay?

320
00:20:52,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 Then, in another story, when you go to Mark's Gospel, chapter 7, when Jesus was expelling the evil spirit, Jesus says, when Jesus called the spirit, Jesus used evil spirit.

321
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 But in Greek language, it says unclean spirit.

322
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 Do you get it?

323
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 So evil spirit, what they are doing is all unclean things.

324
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 Dirty things.

325
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 We love cleanliness, but actually, so many dirty things are coming from our hearts because of the evil spirits.

326
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 Now you are getting it a little bit?

327
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Then, how does the evil spirit enter our hearts?

328
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 How does the evil spirit enter our hearts?

329
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 How?

330
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 When you think.

331
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 When you think, the evil spirit enters your thinking as if it were your thinking.

332
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Actually, it was not part of your thinking, but the evil spirit comes into your thinking slightly, very secretly.

333
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 Okay?

334
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 Or your emotion.

335
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 When you are really angry, evil spirit enters your heart.

336
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Gives more anger.

337
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 More anger.

338
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 Breaking your things.

339
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 Breaking the relationship.

340
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
 Breaking the most precious thing in your life.

341
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 Or some strong desire.

342
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Very strong sexual desires.

343
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 Now young people, you need to listen.

344
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 In your days, if you do not keep your heart pure, you are going to lose everything in your life.

345
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 If you do not keep your heart pure, you are going to lose everything in your life.

346
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 Because it is from the Satan.

347
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 I'm telling you.

348
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 Whatever you cannot do in front of other people, it is from the Satan.

349
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Listen. What is sin?

350
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 Sin is everything you cannot do in front of other people.

351
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 Because it's dirty.

352
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 It's not right.

353
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 That's why you cannot do it in front of other people.

354
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 So through your thoughts, through your desires, or some words.

355
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 Some words are trying to enter your heart.

356
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 I experienced a lot of times.

357
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 Now I know how to fight this spiritual battle.

358
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 So many years.

359
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 And God gave me a victory.

360
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 I couldn't do it.

361
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 But God gave me the victory over a long period of time.

362
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 But still, the Satan tries to enter my heart.

363
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 I can feel it.

364
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 Or sometimes, very grotesque, evil pictures.

365
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 Some dirty thoughts and pictures in your heart.

366
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 You know what?

367
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 This is not yours.

368
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 But it is the Satan's.

369
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 It is the evil spirit in disguise.

370
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 And then all these things, dirty, evil things, they are all lies.

371
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
 You need to understand.

372
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 They are not true actually.

373
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 But they are all lies.

374
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 About you.

375
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 Lies about what?

376
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
 Lies about you.

377
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 You guys, at least as far as I know, all the brothers and sisters in here.

378
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 You love Jesus.

379
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 You are saved.

380
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 You want to be holy.

381
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 But that kind of all dirty, evil desires and thoughts, they are not yours.

382
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
 They are from the Satan.

383
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 So what is that?

384
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 It's a lie.

385
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 It's a lie.

386
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 So John's Gospel chapter 8 verse 44 says like this.

387
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
 John's Gospel chapter 8 verse 44.

388
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 You belong to your father, the devil.

389
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:32,000
 Here you is Pharisees and the teachers of the law.

390
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 Okay?

391
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 Just religious people.

392
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 Religious people.

393
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 You belong to your father, the devil, and you want to carry out your father's desire.

394
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 He was a murderer from the beginning, not holding to the truth.

395
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 For there is no truth in him.

396
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 Listen here.

397
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 When he lies, when the Satan lies, he speaks his native language.

398
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 For he's a liar and the father of lies.

399
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 Who is a Satan?

400
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:02,000
 Satan, whenever he opens his mouth, Satan is a liar.

401
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 He never says any truth about you, about God.

402
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 Okay?

403
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 So whatever the Satan says, it's a lie.

404
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It's a lie.

405
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 And he's the father of lies.

406
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
 His native language is not Cantonese.

407
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 His native language is not Mandarin or Korean.

408
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 His native language is lie.

409
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
 Do you understand?

410
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 How many times did he lie to you?

411
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 Do you understand?

412
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 And then when you listen to the Satan, what will happen in your life?

413
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 What is the time now?

414
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 I'm sorry.

415
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 When does the worship end?

416
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 Ten more minutes?

417
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 Okay, ten more minutes.

418
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 So listen.

419
00:25:52,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 When you listen to the Satan or the unclean thoughts and desires, this is the things that will happen in your life.

420
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 You're going to break your relationship, broken relationship.

421
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 And there are all kinds of shame, shame and guilt in your life.

422
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 We had a great man in our country.

423
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 His name was Park, just a family name.

424
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
 He was a mayor, mayor of Seoul city, metropolitan city, 10 million people.

425
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 He was a mayor, very powerful man.

426
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 He was an activist when he was young, so people respected him.

427
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 He had everything now, mayor of Seoul metropolitan city.

428
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 But you know what?

429
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 He yielded into the wrong desire and what happened to him.

430
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 He had a sexually wrong thing with his secretary.

431
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 And the secretary was going to expose the sin.

432
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 And this guy, he went on to mountain, he committed suicide.

433
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 Just one single wrong desire killed him.

434
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 My brothers and sisters, this is what the Satan does.

435
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 And then, listen, how can we keep our hearts clean?

436
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
 My brothers and sisters, how can we keep our hearts clean?

437
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
 Number one, guard your heart.

438
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
 Everybody, guard your heart.

439
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 Guard your heart.

440
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 Proverbs chapter 4, verse 23 goes like this.

441
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 "Above all else, guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life."

442
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:26,000
 You guys, I have Chinese brothers and sisters here,

443
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 but I was shocked when I saw you guys.

444
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 Because many brothers and sisters, they have a camera,

445
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 the security camera in their houses.

446
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 I don't think they need it because they are not rich people.

447
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 But many brothers and sisters, they have a security camera in their houses.

448
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 They lock the door and then it is not enough.

449
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 So they put the security camera in their houses.

450
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Why? To guard, to guard.

451
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
 How about your heart?

452
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 How about your heart?

453
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Are you setting a guard in your heart?

454
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 Or does every dirty thing come in, goes easily?

455
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 How is your heart? You need to check.

456
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 How can you keep your heart?

457
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 What is the guard?

458
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 If you do not know the word of God,

459
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 then you don't know how to keep your heart.

460
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 When you check God's word, you need to know that,

461
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 "Oh, that is right, or that is wrong."

462
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 You can set a guard according to God's word.

463
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 That's why you need to study God's word day and night.

464
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Young people, read God's word.

465
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 Don't go into any blog or Facebook.

466
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 Facebook after Facebook, it will kill you.

467
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 Listen. Read God's word. Read God's word.

468
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 Second one, how can we be clean in our hearts?

469
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 Number two, throw away the sources of uncleanness.

470
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 Throw away all uncleanness.

471
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 The source of uncleanness. What is that?

472
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:04,000
 The Bible, Mark's gospel, when you go down more,

473
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 in the same chapter, chapter 9, Jesus said,

474
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 "If your hands do something sinful, cut it off.

475
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 If your legs do something sinful, cut it off.

476
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 If your eyes are doing something wrong, pluck it out."

477
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 There is a seriousness, seriousness of uncleanness, sins.

478
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 1 John 3, verse 9 goes like this.

479
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 "No one who is born of God will continue to sin."

480
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 If you are born of God, you should stop doing the same sin again and again.

481
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 If you are repeating the same sin again and again,

482
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 it means you are listening to the enemy.

483
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 This is the enemy's lies.

484
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 You cannot overcome.

485
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
 That is who you are.

486
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
 You've been enjoying it for more than a decade.

487
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 You cannot get out of that.

488
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 My husband cannot change.

489
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 My wife cannot change.

490
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 That's a lie.

491
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 When Jesus' blood touches us, we should change.

492
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 Like what?

493
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 What is throwing away all the sources of uncleanness?

494
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
 When you have a pile of dung.

495
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 Do you like dung?

496
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 You don't like it?

497
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 If you have a good pile of dung, flies will come, surely.

498
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 But if you clean it up, no more flies.

499
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 In the same way, if you throw away all the evil things from your heart,

500
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 from your lives, from your habits, then the evil spirit will leave you.

501
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,000
 Third one, come near to the clean gathering and people.

502
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 Come near to the clean gathering and people, just like this.

503
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 Like what?

504
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 When Jesus was walked about, people wanted to touch Jesus' cloak.

505
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 Just Jesus' clothes.

506
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 Why?

507
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 They knew that even if I touch Jesus' body or Jesus' clothes,

508
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 I'm going to be healed.

509
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 Unclean things are contagious.

510
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 At the same time, cleanliness is contagious, too.

511
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 So if you come to the clean people, our heart becomes cleaner and cleaner.

512
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Number four, wash your uncleanness with Jesus' blood.

513
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 Our guilt and shame of sin is cleansed only by Jesus' blood.

514
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 If you have guilt, if you have any kind of shame, I had a lot.

515
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 In my 30s, I was a sinner.

516
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 I had been going to the church for a long time, but I had a lot of sins inside me.

517
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 Guilt, guilt and shame.

518
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 I had to be covered with Jesus' blood fully, and I got free.

519
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 I was freed.

520
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 1 John 1, verse 7 says, "The blood of Jesus, the Son, purifies us from all sin."

521
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 What does that mean?

522
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 Cleanses us from all sins.

523
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 Okay, last one.

524
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 So you know what?

525
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 What do you do?

526
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 If you are repeating the same sin again and again, you want to get out of it, but you cannot do it,

527
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 you need to cry out, "Jesus, save me from my sin and cover me with your sin!"

528
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,000
 "Remove all the shame and guilt! Make me whole! Make me clean!"

529
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 Okay?

530
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Cry out in your prayer.

531
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 Last one.

532
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 How can we keep ourselves clean all the time?

533
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
 Be filled with the Spirit.

534
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 Ephesians 5, verse 18 says, "Do not get drunk on wine, which leads to debauchery."

535
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Instead, be filled with the Spirit.

536
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 If you are drinking Facebook after Facebook, all kinds of Instagram and those things,

537
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 you are drinking the unholy, unclean things.

538
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 How can you be filled with the Holy Spirit?

539
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 It means that when you sit at home, when you are eating, when you are sleeping, when you are studying,

540
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 you are filled with God's thinking.

541
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 You are filled with God's emotion, God's Word, God's idea, God's feeling.

542
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 Then you are Spirit-filled.

543
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 How can that happen?

544
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 If you give the center of your heart to God.

545
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 If not, you cannot be filled with the Spirit.

546
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 We are easily filled with the Spirit of the world.

547
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 We need to be very careful.

548
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Okay?

549
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 So, let me close, my dear brothers and sisters.

550
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 We don't like unclean vessels.

551
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 If we have an unclean container, we cannot take the food from it.

552
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 We don't like it.

553
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,000
 If you look at an unclean person, we know that the person has a problem.

554
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 But as I told you, as I challenged you, how is your heart?

555
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 How clean is your heart?

556
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 You need to ask today.

557
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 And you need to receive the cleanness only coming from the blood of Jesus Christ,

558
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 which is our hope.

559
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 Let's pray.

560
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:36,000
 Let's pray.

561
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Our Father God, you made us after your image,

562
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 holy and righteous.

563
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 Fearfully, wonderfully, you made us.

564
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 But Lord, we have lived in this world, and we were stained.

565
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 We got all kinds of uncleanness, and we didn't know that it was a sin.

566
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 We desired it. We accepted it. We received it. We welcomed it.

567
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 So our hearts became so defiled.

568
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 But today, Jesus, Holy Spirit, come upon your people.

569
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 Remove all the uncleanness coming from the Satan.

570
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 Let us understand that all these evil desires are not from us.

571
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 They are not ours, but they are from the Satan.

572
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 So give us the right understanding.

573
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 At the same time, Holy Spirit, be our God in our hearts.

574
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Give us the desire to love you more, more than anything else on this earth,

575
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
 that we can love you with our clean hearts,

576
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 and make us clean and healthy in our body and spirit when we love you, Lord,

577
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 when we pursue you.

578
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
