[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   - The phone?
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:01.660]   - Oh, yeah.
[00:00:01.660 --> 00:00:02.500]   - All right.
[00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.460]   Brothers and sisters, I realized I didn't really
[00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.740]   have a chance to tell everyone a little bit about myself.
[00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.500]   And it's a good, I'm really happy to see
[00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.940]   you brothers and sisters in the church.
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.900]   And it's a little bit about me is like,
[00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.340]   James, man, James, I mean, that song,
[00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.300]   "The Power of Your Love" was like something
[00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.900]   that I haven't heard for a while.
[00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.980]   And it was the first time when Pastor Mark
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.900]   was my youth pastor, like close to 20 years ago.
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.260]   And then it was the first time in the retreat
[00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.100]   that I felt like God convicted me to change.
[00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.540]   I need to be different.
[00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:33.820]   I gotta be better.
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:34.660]   And that was the starting.
[00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:36.300]   I was like, wow, my Christian journey,
[00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.500]   especially that verse, "Where your will and foe
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.760]   "in our lives."
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.020]   I'm like, here we are.
[00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.460]   I graduated from Moody two years ago,
[00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.340]   a Master of Arts in Spiritual Formation and Cycle Ship,
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.660]   along with my beautiful wife right here, Shirley.
[00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.480]   And right now, we're getting ready
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.020]   for the mission field in Taiwan.
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.060]   Once Taiwan opens up, we get our visa,
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.220]   we're about to head out.
[00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.340]   So I learned a lot about being a missionary,
[00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.600]   but that's God's will in my life.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.980]   From what I remember 20 years ago as a kid,
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.260]   as a high school kid, with my youth pastor,
[00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.840]   who's still my pastor right now.
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.640]   So I'm just very grateful to have a chance right here
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.860]   to share God's word with you right here.
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.460]   Let's pray together.
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.780]   Father, we thank you, Lord,
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.080]   for the time that you give us right here
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.020]   to focus on you, Lord.
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.900]   As you said, let tomorrow worry about tomorrow, Lord.
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.420]   Help us worry about today.
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.060]   And today is your day, Father.
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.220]   Help us focus, Lord.
[00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.100]   Holy Spirit, may you come into us.
[00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.900]   Help us not worry.
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.900]   Help us just focus on you to receive your words, Father.
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.380]   To receive, to see how great your salvation plan is,
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.580]   Father, for every one of us.
[00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.980]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.840]   Hey, when I talk about the Cubs and the Sox,
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.800]   you have an idea what comes to mind.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.340]   How about the Bears and the Packers, how about that?
[00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.800]   If you've been in Chicago for a while,
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.040]   you probably have a good idea, right?
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.060]   These are a rival.
[00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.260]   I mean, these are fans from opponent's side
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.900]   really hate the other team.
[00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.900]   I mean, these are just basically friendly rivals we see.
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.760]   But in society, as you know, there are many rivals.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.360]   And these could be religious rivals,
[00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.640]   like Catholic versus Christian in general,
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.440]   like economic rivals, right?
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.260]   Are you lower class, are you middle class,
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.140]   or are you in upper class, right?
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.260]   Or other rivals like, oh, the school that you go to,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.460]   that distinguish, kind of like signify your intelligence.
[00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.080]   And there could be family rival.
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.140]   So I wanna tell you a little bit about a family rival
[00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.820]   that I had last year.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.060]   It happened during when my grandmother died,
[00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.140]   like last April.
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.260]   And she was like 90 something already, about the time.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.140]   You know what the sad thing is that she died?
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.720]   But the saddest part is that all my uncles,
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.360]   when she wasn't even in her grave yet,
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.460]   they were talking about money.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.300]   That's the rival.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.420]   You guys know what I'm talking about, we're Chinese.
[00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.980]   Yep, we talk about money, and they became enemy.
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.660]   It's within these division
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.220]   that how Jesus established his church.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.320]   So today's topic I wanna talk to you about
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.920]   is how did Jesus establish the church?
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.360]   So in the book of Ephesians, actually,
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.360]   Paul did not chastise these Christians for anything.
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:32.580]   It's more like an encouragement
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.680]   and laying out God's cosmic plan for them to understand.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.980]   So in the beginning, he talk about God's plan in general,
[00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.480]   which involves our spiritual blessing.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.280]   And in the beginning section of chapter two,
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.200]   he talks about how we are dead to our sins and transgression.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.360]   Therefore, God, through Jesus Christ, made us alive.
[00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.720]   And then right now, we're gonna talk about the second part
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.520]   that is parallel to the first part.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   Within this, we're talking about another way
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.840]   how we are dead to Christ in a different standpoint.
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.600]   So in my first point,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.480]   I wanna talk about hopelessness without Christ.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.840]   How there's no hope without Christ.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.040]   Let me start reading.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.280]   Therefore, remember that formerly you who are Gentiles
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.200]   by birth and caught uncircumcised
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.420]   by those who cautimcise the circumcision,
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.100]   which is done in the body by human hands.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.700]   Remember that at that time, you were separated from Christ,
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.560]   excluded from citizenship in Israel and foreigners
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.800]   to the covenant of the promise.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.840]   Without hope and without God in the world.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.600]   But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far away
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.180]   have been brought back near by the blood of Christ.
[00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.040]   So Paul start off by reminding these Christians in Ephesus,
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:58.720]   these Gentile Christians,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.320]   there is a group called circumcision.
[00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.880]   Mainly, these are Jewish people
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.860]   who probably have accepted Jesus Christ already,
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:11.500]   but still thinks that circumcision is necessary.
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.100]   So they're saying these groups are mocking you guys
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:16.920]   because you are not circumcised yet.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.380]   But the thing is that Romans and Greeks
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.460]   don't call themselves Gentiles.
[00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.080]   The only people that call themselves,
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.360]   call other people Gentiles are Jews, the Jewish people.
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.820]   So why is it so important to distinguish
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.820]   that they are Jews and those other people are Gentiles?
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.140]   So if you take a look,
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.420]   let's go back to the book of Genesis.
[00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.300]   This verse right here is basically the backgrounds
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.460]   where God and Abraham,
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.960]   God made a covenant with Abraham, an agreement.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.340]   He's telling Abraham,
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.220]   all the nations on the earth will be blessed because of you.
[00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.500]   And this circumcision is this phrase
[00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.060]   that you are to undergo circumcision
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.280]   and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.220]   This is a physical sign to show how they are different.
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.300]   But the problem is that a lot of times
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:13.580]   these Jewish people use,
[00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:17.020]   think of the sign as seeing themselves as superior.
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.740]   Like they are the special race.
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.980]   They have God with them.
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:22.620]   They are part of God's family.
[00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.860]   This covenant is telling them,
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:26.940]   we are part of God's family and you are not.
[00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:30.500]   So they think of the Gentiles as a lower race, outsiders.
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.640]   But when Paul is writing this,
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.300]   God, Jesus Christ, step on the cross,
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:37.580]   has redeemed us already.
[00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.060]   Therefore, the old order of the Judaisms,
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.960]   their external and material feature is outdated already
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.820]   because Christ came in and pushed in a new order.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.380]   Therefore, if I go back here and you take a look,
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.020]   Paul specifically says,
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.780]   which is done in the body by human hand.
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:57.300]   What does that mean by human hand?
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.180]   Paul emphasizes because if it's by human hand,
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:01.600]   that means it's not from God.
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.260]   Therefore, what Paul is saying,
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:04.900]   he's mocking these people also,
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.180]   these circumcision, these Jews.
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.100]   He's trying to tell them,
[00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:12.300]   hey, you guys don't have the real circumcision either.
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:15.220]   Like, let's take a look what's the real circumcision.
[00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.300]   The same author of Genesis, Moses,
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.620]   he wrote through to Tyrannomy.
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.460]   He says,
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:30.260]   Circumcision is,
[00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:32.940]   God has to do the real circumcision through the heart
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:36.420]   where we have the ability to obey and follow his order.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.220]   So how does Paul look at that, right?
[00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.260]   In Colossians, this is how he sees it.
[00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:42.300]   In him, you were also circumcised
[00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:46.180]   with a circumcision not performed by human hands.
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.020]   Your whole self ruled by the flesh was put off
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:51.660]   when you were circumcised by Christ.
[00:07:51.660 --> 00:07:53.980]   So as we know now, how does God circumcise us?
[00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:54.820]   It's through Christ.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:56.140]   Christ has to come and die for us
[00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.180]   and change us into a new person.
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.660]   That is the real circumcision
[00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.260]   that's available to the Jews and Gentiles currently.
[00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.740]   (pages rustling)
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:13.380]   After talking about circumcision, the physical sign,
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.780]   Paul continues to remind these Gentile Christians
[00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:20.260]   in Ephesus about their former state without Christ.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.100]   Why?
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.100]   This is to show them how blessed that they are
[00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.900]   at their current position.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:28.220]   So this is what he says to these people
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.260]   before they know in Christ.
[00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:33.700]   Remember that at that time you were separated from Christ,
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:36.380]   excluded from citizenship in Israel,
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.260]   and foreign to the covenant of the promise.
[00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:42.100]   Basically, this is what Paul is saying.
[00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:43.700]   Israel has an advantage over you.
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.420]   The Jewish people have an advantage over you
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.460]   because they're part of God's family, but you are not.
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.740]   So it sums up basically this is what he's saying.
[00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:56.860]   The Gentiles, you don't have anything related to God.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.140]   You're isolated from God, right?
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.820]   So the result comes at the second part of the verse.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.860]   You are without hope and without God in this world.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.740]   So if you take a look, verse 11 and 12,
[00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:12.620]   look so dark and gloomy for the Gentile
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.060]   in their former state before knowing Christ.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.060]   But again, Paul states but in verse 13.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:27.080]   But Christ right here made 180 turn again for them.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.920]   You know, he says, "But now in Christ Jesus,
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.720]   "you once were far away, have been brought near
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:36.520]   "by the blood of Christ."
[00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.000]   Instead of being dead to our transgression,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.840]   we were once far from God, but Christ brought us near.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:45.920]   What does that mean?
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.280]   Bring us near means that we have access to God
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.220]   and that access is through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:58.540]   And this gives me, helps me think of this illustration.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:00.540]   Actually, it's also from Paul.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.820]   He talks about a branch grafted in in Romans.
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.900]   And if you take a look, the lower branch,
[00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:08.700]   the main branch is very different from the top branch
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:10.060]   that is grafted in, you know?
[00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:12.160]   The top branch doesn't belong.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:17.140]   And take a look at how this person
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.340]   attached these two branches together.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.340]   It's by some sort of tape or something to glue it on, right?
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.400]   That tape is basically the blood of Christ.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:28.260]   He used that to glue us into the main branch
[00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.300]   that we could be part of the same family.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:35.420]   Therefore, have a great appreciation
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.420]   for what Christ did for us when we were far away from God.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:42.320]   Therefore, he used his blood to draw us near.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.780]   Now let's go to the second point.
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.520]   The second point is what Christ did to make the church.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.580]   So for he himself is our peace,
[00:10:52.580 --> 00:10:55.220]   he who has made the two groups one
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.260]   and has destroyed the barrier,
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:59.080]   the dividing wall of hostility,
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.500]   by setting aside in his flesh the law
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.780]   with its command and regulations.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.640]   His purpose was to create in himself a new humanity
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.360]   out of the two, thus making peace,
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.900]   and in one body to reconcile both of them to God
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:19.900]   through the cross by which to put to death their hostility.
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:24.740]   He came and preached peace to you who were far away
[00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.900]   and peace to those who were near.
[00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:29.460]   For through him we both have access
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:30.900]   to the Father by one spirit.
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:36.420]   So as we talk about how Christ in the previous point,
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.300]   he restored our relationship with God.
[00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:44.720]   So in verse 14, Paul starts out by emphasizing
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.460]   that Christ is our peace.
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:49.260]   But what does this peace mean?
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:54.260]   In general, peace means there is no hostility, right?
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:56.040]   Everyone get along.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.000]   But how do you gain that peace?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.700]   How did Christ gain that peace for them?
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.420]   Well, you had to join two groups into one.
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:09.140]   Those two groups that we know are the Gentiles and the Jews.
[00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.020]   So how did he go on doing so?
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:14.100]   The first, there is two things,
[00:12:14.100 --> 00:12:15.940]   that's one thing you have to do.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:16.780]   Let me read it according.
[00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.380]   He had to destroy the barrier,
[00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:21.900]   the dividing wall of hostility by setting aside
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.960]   in his flesh the law with his commands and regulation.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:29.460]   So this is referring to the Temple of Jerusalem, guys.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:31.540]   So if you take a look, where I label Gentile,
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.260]   that's the outer court.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:37.580]   That is as far as you can go if you're not Jewish.
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:40.820]   If you're a Jew, you could go into the inner court
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:42.260]   to worship God.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:43.860]   There is actually a physical wall
[00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:46.520]   that divides the two people at a time.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:50.340]   So, but the thing is that,
[00:12:50.340 --> 00:12:54.780]   that's only a manifestation of the Mosaic law,
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:56.340]   the regulations of the command.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:03.920]   That's why Jesus had to come and abolish those commands.
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:07.620]   Those regulations and law, to tell you honestly,
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.260]   even the Jewish people, they can't meet themselves.
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.500]   That holiness is so high, the God standards is so high,
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:18.260]   that it's really impossible to meet in human standpoint.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:22.580]   But besides separating these two groups religiously,
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:23.860]   there are also separated,
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.260]   the law also separated them socially.
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.500]   Because of this law,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.420]   the Jewish people have to live according to,
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.580]   they don't live according to the custom of the world.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.540]   So they kind of like lost communication in that point,
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:37.540]   but consequently at the same time,
[00:13:37.540 --> 00:13:39.780]   it gives the Jewish people that pride.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:43.020]   They feel like the way how we live, we're superior.
[00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:43.880]   The way you live.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:49.620]   But the thing is that at the end,
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.460]   Jesus came and abolished that law once and for all
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.460]   with his flesh to present his perfect sacrifice to God.
[00:13:57.460 --> 00:13:59.660]   So we don't have to worry about this anymore,
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.980]   these regulations.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:05.540]   Now let's move on to the second part of verse 15 and 16.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.980]   So as we move on,
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:12.360]   so the purpose of abolishing these hostility is twofold.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.660]   First of all, in verse 15,
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.960]   the second part is to create in himself a new humanity.
[00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.800]   Basically,
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:24.500]   the rift between the Jews and Gentiles are too deep.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:28.900]   You cannot put them together anymore.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.820]   Think about in our country,
[00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.740]   you think about the political state right now,
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.740]   the two big parties, the Democrats and the Republicans,
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:37.220]   you can't even work together anymore.
[00:14:37.220 --> 00:14:38.140]   The only thing they could do right now
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.340]   is call each other name.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:42.640]   We're lucky that our country's continued to function,
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.440]   seems like quite normally right now.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:49.680]   Therefore, God has to push a new humanity.
[00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:52.840]   Within this new humanity, a new order, a new covenant
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.880]   has to be established by Christ.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:56.720]   And as I said again,
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.680]   Jesus is the one that kind of present himself
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:05.320]   as an offering to reconcile human between human.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:08.400]   So he reconciled the horizontal hostility,
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.180]   the horizontal dimension of the hostility.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:13.700]   And as we go on to verse 16,
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.380]   in that new body is to reconcile
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.420]   both this new humanity to God.
[00:15:19.420 --> 00:15:22.980]   So his blood not just reconcile
[00:15:22.980 --> 00:15:25.340]   this our human to human hostility,
[00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:28.280]   it also reconcile the vertical dimension,
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:29.780]   our humanity to God.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:37.900]   So as we talk about the reconciliation process,
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:42.260]   Paul now talks about the proclamation of peace from Christ.
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.940]   In verse 17, it says, "He came to preach peace."
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.780]   How does Christ preach peace?
[00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:56.660]   He did it by walking, by doing, by walking the talk.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:00.180]   He was, he is our peace in verse 14,
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.560]   that says, "For he himself is our peace."
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:07.420]   Again, by using his body, the flesh, the blood,
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:11.480]   to bring, to end that hostility.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:18.620]   And who are he talking to?
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:22.020]   Again, he's emphasizing the ones who are near,
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:25.180]   which are the Jewish people.
[00:16:25.180 --> 00:16:26.340]   They have, think about it,
[00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.620]   they have all the time, they have the temple,
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:32.860]   the laws, the worship regulation, the covenant,
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.020]   and the Gentiles, the ones who are far,
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.180]   they don't have anything.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:39.060]   But Paul is saying, in verse 16,
[00:16:39.060 --> 00:16:41.380]   "Even though they have all these things, the Jewish people,
[00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.240]   "they still need reconciliation."
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:48.160]   Again, in verse 18,
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.460]   Paul continued to further the concept of peace.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:54.280]   Besides just being right with God, we have access to God.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.540]   We, as Jews and Gentiles,
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:00.740]   we stand as one humanity in front of God.
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.260]   And there is no distinction anymore,
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:03.940]   because it's just by one spirit,
[00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.140]   we have access to the Father.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:10.420]   It stresses that oneness that we have, the new humanity.
[00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:15.060]   And within this new, excuse me,
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.940]   within this new humanity,
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:19.380]   I don't have to talk about my credentials,
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.900]   my spiritual heritage, my zeal,
[00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:24.460]   or my talent to access God.
[00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.740]   The only thing we all need to share in common
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:28.220]   to have access to God
[00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:30.820]   is believing in the redemptive work of Jesus Christ.
[00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:35.460]   This brings me, reminds me of this person right here.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:36.420]   Do you know this person?
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.980]   His name is Jim Elliott.
[00:17:37.980 --> 00:17:40.020]   He was a missionary to Ecuador,
[00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:45.020]   especially to the Native American tribes in around the 1950s.
[00:17:45.020 --> 00:17:49.540]   He and his fellow companions, missionaries,
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:54.280]   have decided, "We must let these people hear the gospel."
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.140]   But the thing is that they know
[00:17:57.140 --> 00:17:59.580]   these Indians are hostile to foreigners.
[00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.300]   Yet they went anyway.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:03.580]   What's the result?
[00:18:03.580 --> 00:18:04.460]   He got martyred.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.860]   He and his fellow missionaries got martyred.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:11.700]   Yet creating this hostility between their families
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.340]   and these Indian tribes.
[00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:18.860]   But instead of seeking revenge,
[00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:22.060]   their wives decided to continue on this mission,
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:25.740]   decided to go into these tribes and live with them,
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.780]   to walk out that gospel.
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.380]   At the end, bringing the gospel,
[00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:32.180]   bringing the conversion to these Indians,
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:34.240]   thus ending the hostility.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   Therefore, Jesus' work of redemption brings us this peace.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.400]   We might have an understanding how hard,
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:47.340]   how much work he had to go through to start this.
[00:18:47.340 --> 00:18:52.400]   Now let's go on to our last point.
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:53.940]   What the church looked like.
[00:18:53.940 --> 00:19:00.480]   Consequently, you are no longer foreigners and strangers,
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.160]   but fellow citizens with God's people
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:05.840]   and also members of his household.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:09.040]   Built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets,
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.080]   with Christ Jesus himself as the chief cornerstone,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.120]   in him, the whole building is joined together
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:19.120]   and rises to become a holy temple in the Lord.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.680]   And in him, you too are being built together
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.640]   to become a dwelling in which God lives by his spirit.
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.840]   So as a result of God's redemptive work,
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.980]   Paul's telling us our status in front of God has changed.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:36.140]   And Paul wanted to talk about
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.460]   how this new humanity functions,
[00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.620]   which we will see the characteristics of the church.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:47.580]   Paul starts out by using, again, the spatial relationship
[00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:50.800]   to show the differences before and now.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:52.200]   He says, consequently,
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:55.080]   you are no longer foreigners and strangers.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.880]   What does foreigner and stranger,
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.300]   when you think about that, what comes to mind?
[00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:02.360]   You live in a land that is not your own homeland.
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.560]   You live with the people who are not your people,
[00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:06.840]   who are not your tribe.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:08.600]   So what does that mean?
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:09.800]   You are outsider.
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.680]   You don't belong.
[00:20:12.680 --> 00:20:14.600]   But Paul continues to elaborate.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.480]   But fellow citizens with God's people
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.480]   and also member of his household.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.720]   We are citizens.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.700]   We are part of God's family right now.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:24.520]   We are not second-class citizens.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.440]   We are the same of the Jewish people.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:32.740]   Or let's say this new humanity that Christ created.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:35.780]   As stated in chapter one, verse five,
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.540]   God already said he has destined us
[00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:39.940]   for a daughter and sonship.
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:41.400]   This is the closest relationship
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.300]   that you can have with someone.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.020]   But think about the process of you becoming our citizen,
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:49.020]   like the ones that have become, right?
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.920]   You have to come to this country.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:54.700]   You have to become a good member for a couple years.
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:55.740]   Make sure you follow the law
[00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.300]   and be a good person in society.
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:00.580]   And then you have to study for a test.
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.420]   And then you make sure you pass the test.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:04.720]   Then you might be able to become a US citizen.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.100]   But what happen if I say,
[00:21:07.100 --> 00:21:10.260]   today the US president came to you personally and said,
[00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:11.940]   "You don't have to do any of that.
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:15.480]   "I will accept you in as a member.
[00:21:15.480 --> 00:21:18.980]   "At the same time, I will adopt you into my personal family."
[00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.840]   That is what the household of God looks like.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.880]   Now in verse 20, Paul can you elaborate
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.040]   how this household is built upon, this universal church?
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:31.800]   He said, "It's built upon the foundation
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:34.040]   "of the apostles and the prophets."
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:36.240]   So the apostles, it's basically talking
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.200]   about the 12 apostles and Paul himself,
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   who Jesus personally chose to proclaim the gospel.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.880]   And how about these prophets?
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:47.360]   These prophets, based on this context,
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:50.240]   I would see they are not the Old Testament prophets
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:53.440]   because Paul in chapter three, verse five says,
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.280]   "The mystery of the gospel is not known
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:57.400]   "to any other generation until now."
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.160]   So I would say these prophets are the people
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.180]   along with the apostles who might have walked with Jesus,
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:10.180]   or these prophets are people that the apostles converted,
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:13.580]   and they continue to preserve the teaching of Jesus Christ,
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.700]   because if they don't continue to preserve the teaching,
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.700]   this new humanity will not have its foundation to rely on.
[00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.500]   But however, that's not the main and most important element.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.140]   As Paul continue, he says, "Jesus Christ himself
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.100]   "as the chief cornerstone."
[00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:34.560]   As you see, Paul emphasize this point.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.280]   He uses the word himself to tell
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.480]   that Jesus is the chief cornerstone.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:41.480]   What does that mean?
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.080]   In the ancient world, the builders,
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:47.240]   the first stone that they lay is the cornerstone.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:48.880]   That's the most important stone.
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:51.160]   It's the stone that gives the direction
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.440]   where the building's gonna go,
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.020]   and it determines if that building will be stable.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:23:01.040]   And other stones are built upon this cornerstone.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.120]   Therefore, Jesus ensure the stability
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.020]   of the system of salvation.
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:11.500]   As we continue on to the last two verses, 21 and 22,
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:16.500]   Paul continue to elaborate that we also are the stones
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.280]   along with the prophets by using the word you too,
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.880]   that we, well, for him, he's meaning the Gentiles,
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.120]   but we are the Gentiles too right now.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.000]   We take part in building this temple too.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.480]   Again, within those two verses, Paul is saying,
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.260]   "We are joined and built together
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:36.820]   "to construct this household."
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:39.240]   It gives us, symbolize the closeness
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.920]   that we have between believers.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:45.000]   And it also shows us this church
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.440]   should be a continuous growing body
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:51.160]   because through our evangelism and discipleship,
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.520]   it should continue to be growing.
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:56.140]   And at the end, the last verse, it says,
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:24:00.440]   Jesus also dwells within his household.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.440]   It shows that God and the people, the believer,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.840]   we should have a close relationship also.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:11.620]   But overall, Jesus is in charge
[00:24:11.620 --> 00:24:13.860]   of connecting all these stones.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.560]   Therefore, he is responsible
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:18.800]   of retaining all these relationships, not us.
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:24.280]   But everything is emphasized on Jesus Christ himself.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:26.040]   Everything is linked to him.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.960]   The house functions probably only because of Jesus.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:33.520]   We, the people, are the church.
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:37.240]   We're not talking about the building, but Jesus is the head.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.120]   Now, this brings me to this picture.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:43.700]   If you guys take a look, as you take a look,
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.420]   something's wrong with this building.
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.680]   This is actually a building that collapsed
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.520]   because of an earthquake that happened
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:53.520]   in 2017 in Mexico City.
[00:24:53.520 --> 00:24:58.640]   Actually, Mexico is known to be a place
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.600]   with a lot of earthquakes,
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.820]   so their building regulation is pretty rigorous.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:07.040]   However, why so many buildings still collapse
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.320]   is mainly due to because of corruption.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:13.880]   A lot of these engineers still sign off on that blueprint
[00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.360]   knowing that they do not meet the safety inspection.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:22.380]   I mean, when glamorous time, when everything is fine,
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:23.960]   I mean, the building looks fine, right?
[00:25:23.960 --> 00:25:27.540]   But when hard times come, you can see what happens.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:29.260]   But I could assure you,
[00:25:29.260 --> 00:25:32.340]   our Christian faith in the church
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.060]   has endured a lot of hardship and trial
[00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:36.900]   throughout the many centuries, right?
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:39.380]   Yet, it stands solid as a rock
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:41.220]   because who is our cornerstone?
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:42.280]   Jesus Christ.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:46.520]   Therefore, we continue to be confident
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.080]   to place ourselves as rocks
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.920]   to continue to build this household, this church.
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.400]   In conclusion, let me get back to my story
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:58.840]   of my family few.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.460]   My uncles, they're currently still enemies.
[00:26:01.460 --> 00:26:04.400]   They have a hatred toward each other,
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   but from the way I see it,
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.920]   there's a sense of hopelessness in them.
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.400]   They don't know, they can't see the light
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:11.600]   at the end of the tunnel.
[00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.600]   Because there's no mediator for them to help them see it.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.920]   But unlike my family member, unlike my uncles,
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.440]   the church has Jesus Christ as the cornerstones,
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:23.640]   brothers and sisters.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:25.120]   He's the one that made the peace
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.560]   between human to human and with God.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:30.200]   Therefore, we should have an attitude
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.880]   of profound thankfulness towards God
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:37.240]   because we are in a very, very privileged position
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:41.200]   as member of God's new community, which is the church.
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.800]   Let's pray.
[00:26:42.800 --> 00:26:47.100]   Father, we just wanna thank you, Lord.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:52.160]   Just help us see the big contrast of where we were.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.400]   We were not your family.
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.240]   We were cut off.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.760]   We don't have any part of what the Israelites had.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:05.860]   And our goal, the end point was hopelessness, Lord.
[00:27:05.860 --> 00:27:10.360]   But again, Father, Jesus changed that for us
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.880]   without us doing anything, while we were still his enemy,
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:19.720]   Lord, and he changed us and he put us as citizens
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.280]   right here along with everyone else
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:23.640]   who profess faith in Jesus Christ,
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:28.360]   where we get to build the church along with him, Lord.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.040]   We thank you for this privileged position, Lord.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.080]   Help the brothers and sisters right here
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.900]   have that, meditate on that, Father,
[00:27:37.900 --> 00:27:40.380]   that this position is not something
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.900]   that we could take granted for, Lord,
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.360]   but to be thankful every day of where we are,
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:50.420]   especially our status with you, Father God.
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:51.480]   We thank you so much.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.020]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:28:03.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
