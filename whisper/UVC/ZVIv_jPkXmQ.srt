1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,520
 All right.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:11,040
 Good morning, happy new year.

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,700
 Southwest Airlines, if you go to Dallas, Texas, there is a Herb Kelleher Way.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,400
 Not sure if you ever heard the name of Herb Kelleher.

5
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,200
 He was the CEO and chairman and president of Southwest a number of years ago, a couple

6
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:28,480
 decades ago, retired.

7
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:33,440
 When you think of Southwest Airlines, you think of one of the premier efficient customer

8
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,060
 service on time.

9
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:40,360
 It messed up pretty badly, as Mark is a testament of.

10
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,000
 And over 25,000 flights around the country were all messed up.

11
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,320
 And the reason being why?

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,440
 Southwest got too confident.

13
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,000
 They knew they were one of the best, best price, best efficiency, all of that stuff.

14
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,520
 They started letting things go lax.

15
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,760
 They started not to invest in different technology.

16
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,200
 They started taking chances, thinking, you know what, we'll just keep riding.

17
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,000
 We'll make sure we continue to make the most profit.

18
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,520
 All the stuff that Herb Kelleher wanted to do, efficiency, customer service, on time,

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:23,720
 everything, all started being lost in the whole process because they all became about

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,200
 making money for the bottom line.

21
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:29,880
 And as a result, they didn't have to upgrade any of the equipment.

22
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,080
 And as a result, they paid for it as what we saw this past in the last couple of weeks.

23
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,840
 And that's a topic that we're going to talk about today.

24
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:46,640
 It goes to this whole theme of power, a topic that we never really talked about before.

25
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,880
 How do we steward the power that God gives us?

26
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,040
 All of us have power.

27
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,360
 All of us have influence.

28
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,000
 All of us have gifts.

29
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 All of us have skills.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,120
 Financially, what we're able to do, our work, our status, our position in life, we all have

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,120
 power.

32
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:14,680
 How do you then steward that power well?

33
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:20,280
 One culture and in all throughout history, we've always seen the use of power and the

34
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,560
 misuse of power.

35
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,160
 We've seen this picture.

36
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,880
 I've shown you this picture before.

37
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:33,120
 And for those who are new, a lot of times if you go over to Russia as well, too, President

38
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:40,280
 Putin, when he meets dignitaries and people come in, he wants to show you his power.

39
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,040
 And he wants you to come and meet him in this room.

40
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,120
 That is a demonstration of power because he wants to show you that he's in charge.

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,840
 Another thing, we've seen the misuse of power throughout history.

42
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:04,280
 We see Adolf Hitler, who used his power to continue to ravage around all of the world

43
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,320
 and go against people groups and abuse and enslave them.

44
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,560
 We've also seen this.

45
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:19,020
 We celebrate the two-year anniversary of the January 6th insurrection at the White House.

46
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:24,680
 We see signs like Jesus saves Christians who are saying that their pastors or churches

47
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,800
 and all that stuff who are going into the Capitol building and saying that the election

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:35,040
 has been rigged and who's sitting there going after the vice president, different state

49
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:42,360
 officials in order to really be able to allow a person who many believe is the king of that

50
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,920
 power to remain in power.

51
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,360
 We look at culture as well, too.

52
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,440
 Look at this.

53
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,080
 When we think of the future of AI or artificial intelligence, pretty soon many of you guys

54
00:03:55,080 --> 00:04:00,360
 who are in the tech field, many of your kids who will be in the tech field will have massive

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,340
 amounts of power.

56
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,960
 We see cars that are now driven without hands free.

57
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:12,960
 Everywhere you go from McDonald's in different places, kiosks, you go to the United Center,

58
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,340
 they don't have cashiers or airports, they no longer have cashiers.

59
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:21,400
 Everywhere you go in, you sit there and you show them your phone and whatever you take

60
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,420
 now is charged on your phone.

61
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,440
 And as more and more data begins to really be built, as more of these computer systems,

62
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,440
 artificial systems begin to understand your ways and gather more data, power begins to

63
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,320
 be built.

64
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:44,400
 And that power through artificial intelligence can be used for good, but it also can be used

65
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,480
 for evil.

66
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,920
 Social media, as we begin to see, can also be used for good and also used for evil as

67
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,920
 well, too.

68
00:04:55,920 --> 00:05:01,920
 We're seeing things like Twitter and Facebook, which are beginning to aggregate your behavior.

69
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:07,580
 They're feeding information that caters to what you believe in.

70
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:12,520
 As Christians who are working in technology, whether it's AI or in some of these technology

71
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,640
 companies, how do we think what is best for the world?

72
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:24,480
 We need Christ followers in these areas to steward that power well, to really be able

73
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:31,760
 to say what decisions do we have to make in our jobs, in these industries, to continue

74
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:40,480
 to create a world that cares and balances, but not be used and abused by different people.

75
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,560
 Power is found in artificial intelligence.

76
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,240
 It's found in social media.

77
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:53,600
 Power can be used for evil, but power also can be used to inspire and to help.

78
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,320
 We saw this picture in 9/11.

79
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,840
 One of the most powerful images that you ever see, and I'm not even saying whether you're

80
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,640
 Republican or Democrat, and for those who are watching as well, too, this is a picture

81
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,080
 of President George Bush.

82
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:18,120
 When 9/11 hit, President Bush went over to New York City and grabbed a microphone, and

83
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,640
 he reminded the people that he hears them.

84
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:27,800
 He gave hope in the world that needed hope.

85
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
 He's retired now.

86
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,080
 I'm not sure if you know what President Bush is doing right now.

87
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:36,320
 He does this for a living.

88
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:44,040
 He paints pictures of immigrants, and he tells their story of hope.

89
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,600
 If you go over to Bush Library, I have been there over in Dallas as well, too.

90
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,720
 He paints images of each person, their face, and he tells the story of how they have overcome

91
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:01,920
 trials, and he gives us a picture of hope within that.

92
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:10,880
 And one final thing, Chick-fil-A, the story of a company who uses their power for good.

93
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,160
 That when you go through the drive-thru or go into the restaurant at Chick-fil-A, what

94
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,720
 is it that you hear from every single employee?

95
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,000
 "How may I serve you today?"

96
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,120
 You see the story of Dan Cathy, who really believed as a Christ follower that he wanted,

97
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,680
 as he says, that we are here to serve.

98
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:37,880
 We keep the needs of operators, their team members, and customers at the heart of our

99
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:43,560
 work, doing what is best for the business and best for them.

100
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,560
 And as a result of that, in every single situation, we serve the customers, we serve our clients,

101
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,440
 we serve our staff employees.

102
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,300
 How can we serve you?

103
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:01,940
 And they continue to build a brand, and every single time you go to Chick-fil-A, your orders

104
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:10,640
 are usually correct, you are treated well, and the customer service is phenomenal because

105
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:16,020
 it stands for the glory of who he works for.

106
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:25,000
 As Christ followers, our topic today, I'm going to go back to this, is this.

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 That Jesus gives us a new framework of power.

108
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:36,480
 That we are called not to give up our power, but we steward the power we are given for

109
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,720
 the gospel.

110
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,500
 That's the big idea I want to get across today.

111
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:47,040
 When I think of power, when I want you to think of power, the influence that you have,

112
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:53,960
 the skills that you have, the money that you have, Jesus gives us a new framework of power

113
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,960
 as we're going to look at John 13 today.

114
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:01,160
 That as Christ followers, we are not called to give up our power.

115
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,040
 That is never the case.

116
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,800
 You don't give up your power.

117
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:12,440
 But you steward your God-given power, your God-given skills, your God-given talents,

118
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,380
 your God-given resources in the form of money and status, and you steward that power we

119
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:24,960
 are given for the glory of the cross and for the gospel.

120
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:31,400
 If you have your Bible, let's take a quick look over in John chapter 13.

121
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:37,640
 We begin in verse 3.

122
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,640
 John 13, verse 3.

123
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,620
 Or actually, you know what, let's start in verse 2.

124
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:49,560
 Going to supper when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's

125
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,800
 son, to betray him.

126
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:57,980
 Jesus, knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that he had come

127
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:04,400
 from God and was going back to God, rose from supper.

128
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:12,080
 He laid aside his outer garments and taken a towel, tied it around his lilies.

129
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,420
 Verse number one, point number one.

130
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:20,120
 Jesus knew what power he had and where his power came from.

131
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,140
 Jesus, knowing that the father had given, I'm reading from the ESV, had given all things

132
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:34,500
 into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper.

133
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,560
 Jesus knew what power he had.

134
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,120
 Jesus knew who had given him the power.

135
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,260
 As Christ followers, we know that Jesus gives us power.

136
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,800
 We know that God gives us power.

137
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,060
 We know the skills that you have, the talents that you have.

138
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:01,840
 We know the position, the job that you have, how smart you are, the resources, financial,

139
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:07,800
 how rich and wealthy you are financially, is all given to us by God.

140
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,380
 We know where that power comes from.

141
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,720
 We know what power we have.

142
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,800
 Now at the same time, what are you doing with it?

143
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:26,300
 We're reminded in John chapter one, automatically, if you look at John chapter one, story of

144
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,840
 John chapter one begins this.

145
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:35,500
 In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God.

146
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,960
 He was in the beginning with God.

147
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:43,960
 All things were made through him and without him was not made any, was not anything made

148
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,260
 that was made.

149
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,760
 In him was life and the life was a light of men.

150
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:54,420
 The light shines in the darkness and darkness has not overcome it.

151
00:11:54,420 --> 00:12:02,280
 Way back in the beginning, John one, we were reminded and John gives us the entire backdrop

152
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,980
 of this is who Jesus is.

153
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:08,440
 This is the power that Jesus had.

154
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,800
 He was at the beginning.

155
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,780
 John chapter two, we begin to see the story of what God has.

156
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:19,420
 John chapter three, who does he encounter?

157
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,080
 He encounters Nicodemus.

158
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:26,620
 Nicodemus comes up to him and says, "Rabbi, who are you?

159
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,880
 Are you the teacher that we were expecting?"

160
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,120
 And that many of you guys are all familiar with John chapter three, the most famous of

161
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,340
 the verse.

162
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,240
 What does he say to him?

163
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,700
 For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only son.

164
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:47,760
 That John chapter one tells us and gives us an option of this is who Jesus is.

165
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,440
 At the beginning of life, when all of this was not even created, there stood Jesus, the

166
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,400
 living word.

167
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:03,560
 Jesus is the rabbi in John chapter three, in which Nicodemus comes to him.

168
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:09,920
 Jesus, as Jesus tells Nicodemus, "I am the savior for God so loved the world that he

169
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:18,080
 sent me his one and only son, that whoever believes in me shall not perish, but have

170
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,080
 eternal life."

171
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:23,240
 And he says it to who?

172
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:29,880
 Pharisee, teacher of the law, a Jewish man.

173
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,920
 A man who believes that his power is only focused on the Jews.

174
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,080
 And Jesus tells him, "You're wrong, because when God sent me and my power, it was for

175
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,840
 the world."

176
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:51,720
 And story after story after story, if you look at John chapter four, chapter five, chapter

177
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:58,140
 six, chapter seven, you see the story of Jesus and the Samaritan woman.

178
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:02,840
 Jesus in chapter five, Jesus and the Gentile official.

179
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,640
 John chapter six, Jesus and the invalid.

180
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:10,680
 John chapter seven, Jesus and the feeding of the 5,000.

181
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:16,120
 Story after story after story of what it means to love the world.

182
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,720
 What it means to use your power for good.

183
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:22,720
 Jesus knew his power.

184
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,400
 Jesus knew where his power came from.

185
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:32,880
 Now the big question, point number two, is that during supper, when the devil had already

186
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,920
 put into it, Jesus, knowing that the father had given all things into his hands and that

187
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:44,960
 he had come from God and was going back to God, rose from supper.

188
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:52,560
 He laid aside his outer garments and taking a towel, tied it around his waist.

189
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,160
 And he poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet.

190
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,240
 Point number two, once we know our power, once we know where our power comes from, point

191
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:08,200
 number two, you make a choice of what you're going to do with that power.

192
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:12,540
 Jesus made a choice of what he's going to do with that power because we are called as

193
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:18,760
 Christ followers not to give up our power, but we steward the power we are given for

194
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:19,840
 the gospel.

195
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:27,040
 And if we know what our power is and we know who gives us the power, what choice are we

196
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:31,120
 going to make to do with that power?

197
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
 He gets up from the meal.

198
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,600
 What choice are you going to make for that?

199
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,160
 During in the last couple of weeks, I've gotten a chance over the Christmas break to sit down

200
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,640
 and I've gotten a chance to talk with two individuals.

201
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,600
 Let me backtrack in that one time.

202
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,600
 All of us as individuals, as Christ followers, make a choice each and every single day of

203
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,280
 what we're going to do with that power.

204
00:15:57,280 --> 00:16:00,200
 You're asked to steward that power.

205
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,320
 You could take that power and continue to build up your own life.

206
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:04,320
 That's easy.

207
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,040
 You could take that power, enjoy a comfortable life.

208
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,720
 That's easy too.

209
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:13,600
 But how do you begin to use that power and make a difference in your life?

210
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,480
 One such example of that person that sticks out to me is right here in the Bridgeport

211
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,640
 area.

212
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,960
 If you ever go down, there's a dental office right near Healy Elementary School.

213
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:28,520
 For those who are watching, Bridgeport is this neighborhood that we're in.

214
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,600
 There's a guy by the name of Dr. Sam Park.

215
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,800
 Sam Park is a Korean dentist who is overseeing and is the lead dentist for Bridgeport Children's

216
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,240
 Dental.

217
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,160
 Sam Park and I have known each other for a long, long time.

218
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:48,680
 Sam Park is one of the most generous individuals as a Christ follower that I knew.

219
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:54,400
 When I worked in the church, he was the elder of a church up north when I first met him.

220
00:16:54,400 --> 00:17:00,600
 If there is one person who teaches me so much about generosity, it's Mr. Sam Park, Dr. Sam

221
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,220
 Park.

222
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,680
 Every single day, Sam walks in.

223
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:10,200
 And every single day, he wants to create a dental office that really ministers and serves

224
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,640
 the community well.

225
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,120
 Every single employee is tasked with treating every single one of your employees that as

226
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,880
 a Christian, that he wants you to experience the love of Christ through all of his employees

227
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,080
 as soon as you walk in.

228
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:32,200
 Dr. Sam Park sits down with every single one of his employees.

229
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:37,640
 And he sits there and he wants to talk with them about what their goals are, what they

230
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,960
 want to earn in life, and how he could serve them well.

231
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:47,360
 Dr. Sam Park, when I first started Resource Global, we had no money.

232
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,720
 Sam Park was one of the most generous individuals that I knew.

233
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
 He knew that our organization had no money.

234
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,320
 This was about 12 years ago.

235
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,040
 And when he knew it was payroll time, he would always give me a call and says, "Tommy, how

236
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,640
 are we doing on payroll?"

237
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,680
 And I would sit there and say, "Sam, things are a little short this week," or, "Hey, we're

238
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,280
 working through some donations and when you're first starting about 12 years ago, you're

239
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:12,480
 kind of always short."

240
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,600
 And right before payroll, about a couple days right before payroll came, I would open up

241
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,660
 my check in the mailbox and there was a check from Dr. Sam Park, every single payroll.

242
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,480
 He showed me what it meant to really be able to be generous in everything that we do.

243
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,340
 During Christmas break, though, I had two conversations with different people.

244
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:41,980
 And both of them were very bad conversations because all of us as Christians are stewarding

245
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:47,200
 our power well or good, but also some of us choose this in a way.

246
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,840
 And so one of the conversations I had was a phone call from one of my employees who

247
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,880
 told me, "Tommy, I just wanted to let you know that we finalized our divorce with my

248
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,920
 husband.

249
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:02,680
 My husband has recently, he had cheated on her for about a couple times in the last few

250
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,260
 years.

251
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:10,280
 And as a result now, he wanted to divorce her, but he wanted the house.

252
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:13,940
 And negotiations were not going very, very well.

253
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:19,920
 And it got to a point where he felt like as the male person in a Christian fellowship

254
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:24,160
 or in the marriage, the woman had to defer to him.

255
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,160
 And he ended up getting the house.

256
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:32,900
 And as a result, they had to tell their kids after Christmas, who had no idea that their

257
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:39,860
 parents were getting a divorce, that the wife, as well as the kids had to move and the husband

258
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:43,000
 was getting a divorce.

259
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:46,300
 Second conversation I had was with another person who says, "Tommy, I would like to have

260
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,440
 a breakfast."

261
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:52,960
 And she got together and we sat down and I said, "How are things going?"

262
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,920
 And she says, "I just want to let you know I separated from my husband.

263
00:19:56,920 --> 00:20:03,600
 My husband also is one of these individuals who really believes that in a marriage, the

264
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:09,060
 men are in charge and women submit to the authority of men.

265
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:13,740
 And as a result, Tommy, I'm the primary breadwinner," this lady tells me.

266
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,300
 And she is.

267
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:20,220
 She makes millions every single year through her business.

268
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,540
 But she says, "I have to come before my husband.

269
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:28,740
 I pay for everything in our house, everything from electricity, mortgage, everything I pay

270
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,020
 for.

271
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:35,580
 But he won't let me spend any money until I get permission from her because he's the

272
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,740
 man of the house.

273
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,460
 When we raise our kids, when we disagree on what the kids need to do, I have to submit

274
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,460
 to him.

275
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:51,060
 Our kids always have to always submit to him in anything he wants, even if they disagree

276
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,940
 because he's the man of the house."

277
00:20:53,940 --> 00:21:00,620
 My daughter tried to commit suicide three times, Tommy, because she couldn't stand my

278
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,640
 husband anymore.

279
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,740
 He was so domineering.

280
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,280
 He was always telling her she wasn't good enough.

281
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:15,660
 And so one day she wrote a note to him about why she wanted to take her life.

282
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,540
 And she gave it to him and says, "This is how you made me feel."

283
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:23,100
 And he says, "I am the man of the house.

284
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:26,980
 Biblically I am in charge."

285
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:33,460
 We have a choice of what we do with our power.

286
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:39,220
 We have a choice of whether we use and steward our power for good or for bad.

287
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:47,180
 God has given each one of us, young or old, certain skills, certain resources, all of

288
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:48,840
 that.

289
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,420
 We sit here with certain power.

290
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:58,300
 What is the choice that you're going to make to do with power?

291
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:01,600
 Jesus gives us this new framework of power.

292
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,700
 Jesus who knew what power he had, he knew where his power came from, makes a choice

293
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:14,300
 to stand up, take off his robe, and begin to wash his disciples' feet.

294
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,420
 Because you know why?

295
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:23,140
 He was not concerned about status stemming from his power.

296
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,700
 He was not concerned about status.

297
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,980
 And the disciples had to learn something.

298
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:29,060
 In Luke 22, right?

299
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:33,660
 As they were walking over to dinner, you know what they were arguing about?

300
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,960
 Who is going to be the greatest in the kingdom and who is going to sit on the left hand and

301
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,020
 right hand of Jesus?

302
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,980
 That's the discussion that they were doing.

303
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,700
 That's what they were arguing about.

304
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,900
 They were concerned about their status.

305
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:53,120
 And as Christians, one of the things that Jesus teaches us in this whole idea of the

306
00:22:53,120 --> 00:23:00,740
 upper room, the last supper, is don't be concerned about your status.

307
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:08,260
 He takes off his robe and he begins to take a basin of water and washes his disciples'

308
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,260
 feet.

309
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,940
 The Roman author writes this and he says this, "Even today, many cultures preserve the

310
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:19,820
 sense of shame that accompanied the feet in Jesus' day.

311
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:25,300
 The lowest part of the body, the one most covered in the grime of the world, far more

312
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:36,920
 grimy in Jesus' day than our modern sidewalks, and the most likely to smell a sweat and toil.

313
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:47,380
 To touch another person's feet was an act of profound subjugation fit only for a slave.

314
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:54,540
 The feet were the antipodes of power, kept away from the table, toward which all guests

315
00:23:54,540 --> 00:24:01,780
 lean, accorded the least attention, and was the least dignified.

316
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:09,060
 Within a normal feast, some household slave would have performed the foot washing.

317
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:13,340
 Should the ritual of foot washing somehow be neglected by the servants attending the

318
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:20,460
 feasts, it would have been the job of the least powerful guest present, making a quick

319
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:30,220
 and entirely calculation status, to quickly take up the culture and perform the duty."

320
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,380
 Amongst the people in this room, who was going to be the least?

321
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,740
 Was it going to be Matthew, the tax collector?

322
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:40,940
 No, not Matthew, the tax collector.

323
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:45,100
 Was it going to be the two, the fishermen that were sitting there, Peter, James, or

324
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:47,620
 John?

325
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,620
 It certainly was not going to be Judas Iscariot.

326
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:55,460
 He had already sold out Jesus and he was hoping to grab all the money for himself.

327
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,860
 That wasn't going to be him.

328
00:24:57,860 --> 00:25:01,140
 Who was the least amongst all these twelve?

329
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,100
 It was going to end up being Jesus.

330
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:14,660
 Jesus makes the choice to take off his robe and start washing the feet of the disciples.

331
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:19,960
 He takes off his outer clothing, he wraps a towel around his waist, and after that he

332
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,100
 poured water into basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the

333
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,700
 towel that was wrapped around him.

334
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:33,820
 And verse 12, "When he had finished washing their feet, he put on his clothes and returned

335
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:39,220
 to his place and he says to them, 'Do you understand what I have done for you?'

336
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:45,140
 He said to them, 'You call me teacher and Lord, and rightly so, for this is what I am.

337
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,140
 I am your teacher.

338
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,100
 I am your Lord.

339
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,960
 But now that I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet, you shall also wash one

340
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,100
 another's feet.

341
00:25:55,100 --> 00:26:00,460
 I have set you an example that you should do as I have done for you.

342
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:05,700
 Very truly I tell you, no servant is greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater

343
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:10,140
 than the one who sent him."

344
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,500
 We know our power.

345
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,500
 We know where our power comes from.

346
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:19,720
 We make a choice of what we do with that power.

347
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:24,740
 We don't get caught up in the status of that power.

348
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:33,260
 And in the process, we change the paradigm of how we perceive power and how people perceive

349
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:34,820
 power.

350
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,700
 Jesus gives us a new framework of power.

351
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:43,020
 And that framework of power is not to give up our power.

352
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:46,500
 A lot of times people interpret that when he took off his robe that he was giving up

353
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:47,500
 power.

354
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:58,360
 We do not give up power, but we steward the power that we are given for the gospel.

355
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:07,060
 And that particular incident was so powerful, we still talk about it to this day.

356
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:10,120
 We're still preaching to this day.

357
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:16,680
 Universities, MBA programs, professors are still talking about what it means to be a

358
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:24,400
 humble servant, that one of the best ways of a CEO is to be the servant leaders.

359
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:29,280
 Whether it's Christians or non-Christians, many of them will tell you, you have to be

360
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,360
 a servant leader.

361
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,400
 Because this framework became so successful, it changed the trajectory of how we look at

362
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:44,400
 leadership and how we steward our power well.

363
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,880
 Jesus gives us a framework of power.

364
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:55,240
 We're not called to give up our power, but steward the power you and I are given for

365
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
 the gospel.

366
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,400
 Let me give you some final thoughts, and I want to show you one video, okay?

367
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:05,100
 Number one, application time.

368
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:11,080
 Many of us as young people, I say this to young people, technology has completely created

369
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,560
 the ability for all of us to be an influencer.

370
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:21,760
 Some of you guys who are here, or those who are watching, technology has elevated all

371
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,520
 of our platform where any individual can now jump on YouTube or Facebook or Instagram and

372
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:32,120
 whatever it is, and create a video.

373
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,880
 And you have the ability to be an influencer.

374
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:40,160
 Many of you guys who are sitting here right now are talented and bright enough to be the

375
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:44,560
 CEO and executive of your company.

376
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:49,860
 You will have more riches than I will ever imagine.

377
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:56,080
 You will have more power than you will ever know what to do with it.

378
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:03,440
 My biggest encouragement for you, make a choice of what you're going to do with that power.

379
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,920
 For instance, a lot of times when money, I heard this from one donor who taught me well,

380
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:16,200
 and this donor says to me, Tommy, as you get older, and before you even become rich, figure

381
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,080
 out what you're going to do with your money.

382
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,960
 A lot of times people always say, well, you know what, I'm going to keep saving my money,

383
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,640
 I'm going to make sure I have kids, I'm going to put away from savings, all of that stuff,

384
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:31,640
 and as I get wealthier, I'll start giving away and all that other stuff.

385
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:37,880
 And he says, no, no, no, Tommy, before you even become rich, before you even get that

386
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:46,360
 great job, figure out and make a decision of what you're going to do with your resources.

387
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,360
 Why?

388
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,080
 Because when you become wealthy, and when you get that power, you're going to be too

389
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,160
 tempted to serve yourself.

390
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:04,800
 Make a decision in your head right now, what you're going to do with that money, what you're

391
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,680
 going to do with that power, what you're going to do with your life, what you're going to

392
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,960
 do with your skills.

393
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,840
 Make a decision and commit to it.

394
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:15,840
 Point number one.

395
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,880
 Point number two, continue to learn to submit.

396
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:28,800
 As you continue to grow in your power and your influence and what you're able to do,

397
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:36,400
 learn to continue to submit to the people around you, and also learn what it means to

398
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,480
 continue to grow in humility.

399
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,560
 I say this one thing because I have this one girl in Jakarta, bright girl, very, very bright

400
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,560
 girl, very talented.

401
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,840
 She's about 24 years old.

402
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,800
 She even made it to Miss Indonesia.

403
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,800
 She's pretty talented.

404
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,480
 And in the midst of that conversation, you know what she says to me?

405
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,640
 She says, "Tommy, I hate when people say no to me.

406
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,560
 I disregard anyone who says no to me."

407
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,240
 And we've had to have a conversation that sometimes as you grow in your power, you have

408
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:13,200
 to learn to submit and surround yourself with people who say no to you.

409
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:18,120
 That sometimes in the midst of our power, you got to make a decision, but you got to

410
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:24,200
 continue to maintain that humility and continue to really be able to learn to submit to the

411
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,400
 people around you.

412
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,120
 Number three, application.

413
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,880
 Learning from Jesus doesn't guarantee you will make the right decisions.

414
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,120
 It's the decisions that you have to make each day.

415
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,200
 Why is that?

416
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,320
 That who was present at this last supper?

417
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:46,200
 You had Judas who literally watched what Jesus did, watched what it meant to be a servant,

418
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,720
 and what does he do later on that day?

419
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,680
 He sells out Jesus for pennies on the dollar.

420
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,440
 He betrays Jesus.

421
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:55,440
 Who's also sitting in that room?

422
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,440
 Peter.

423
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,800
 And what does Peter do?

424
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,280
 He betrays Jesus.

425
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:06,320
 Learning from Jesus does not guarantee you're going to lead the correct life.

426
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:13,060
 It's a decision that you have to make each and every single day because we are written,

427
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,440
 we are living by the gospel.

428
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:22,200
 The gospel guides us in all that we do, and there's a choice that we make each and every

429
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,200
 single day.

430
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:34,440
 And the one final illustration, when you serve as a servant, don't ever expect anyone to

431
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,760
 return that favor back.

432
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,600
 Do not have any expectations of what people can do for you.

433
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,000
 Too often, a lot of times, when we do something for someone, what do we do?

434
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,040
 We expect it to be done in return.

435
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:57,520
 That when you and I use our power, our God-given power, our God-given talents, and our God-giving

436
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:03,720
 resources, don't expect anything in return.

437
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:13,120
 Because when we start expecting things to return, you're going to be sorely disappointed.

438
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,920
 Serve out of the gratefulness of your heart.

439
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:20,280
 Serve out of the glory of what the grace of God has done for you.

440
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:24,960
 Serve out of the joyfulness of your God.

441
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,900
 We understand the power that we have given.

442
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:31,740
 We understand who has given us the power.

443
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:36,300
 We make a choice each and every single day to steward that power.

444
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,520
 We don't care about status.

445
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:46,080
 And in the process, we change the paradigm of how people perceive power.

446
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,280
 Because Jesus gives us a new framework of power.

447
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:56,920
 We use that power and we ignore that power, but we steward the power that we are given

448
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,920
 for the gospel.

449
00:33:57,920 --> 00:34:04,280
 Let me show you one person who did it really, really well this past week.

450
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:09,980
 For those who do not watch football, and for those who are watching American football,

451
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,740
 there was a situation that happened on Monday night football, where one of the players from

452
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:22,160
 the Buffalo Bills tackled one of the opposing players on the Cincinnati Bengals.

453
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:29,540
 The guy stood up, the guy who tackled, stood up for a minute or so and then collapsed and

454
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,680
 went into cardiac arrest.

455
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:36,760
 Game was canceled and we didn't know if the player was going to make it or whatever it

456
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,200
 is.

457
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:44,600
 And all throughout the entire football community came and offered up prayers.

458
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:53,080
 But out of all that prayer, one person, a Christ follower, who had a platform, set an

459
00:34:53,080 --> 00:35:00,520
 example and showed us what it meant to do use his power well.

460
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:04,920
 Phoebe, let's show that video.

461
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:05,920
 >> Football gave me everything.

462
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:11,240
 And I think even through the midst of absolute tragedy last night, I think you saw some of

463
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:16,640
 the beauty of football as well that it's brought us all here together.

464
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,400
 This is a little bit different.

465
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,480
 I've heard it all day, like thoughts and prayers.

466
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:24,320
 You just heard Sheriff and Jonathan Allen say all we can do is pray for them.

467
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,480
 I've heard the Buffalo Bills organization say we believe in prayer.

468
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,680
 Maybe this is not the right thing to do, but I want to pray for them.

469
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

470
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

471
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

472
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

473
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

474
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

475
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

476
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

477
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

478
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

479
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

480
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

481
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

482
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

483
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

484
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

485
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:47,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

486
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,680
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

487
00:35:48,680 --> 00:36:16,880
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

488
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,880
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

489
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,880
 >> I'm going to pray for you.

490
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880

 >> I'm going to pray for you.

548
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,880
 >> What decisions are you going to make to impact your community, to impact this church, to impact your city?

549
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:33,880
 It's a decision that you're going to have to make each and every single day.

550
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:38,880
 It's a decision that sometimes in the midst of understanding power you're going to make that doesn't benefit you.

551
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,880
 It's not going to reward you in any way.

552
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,880
 And that's what we're called to do.

553
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:46,880
 We're called to be stewards of that power.

554
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:56,880
 We're called to be sacrificed because we have the greatest example of the person who sacrificed his very life to die for our sins.

555
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,880
 It's a choice that he had to make.

556
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:13,880
 It's a choice that all of us as Christ followers who are saved by grace each and every single day, we make that choice to continue to be an influence in all that we do.

557
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,880
 To live by integrity.

558
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
 To embrace that power.

559
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,880
 To understand that power.

560
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
 To not care about status.

561
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:29,880
 To love every single person and to serve the world as we know it.

562
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,880
 Let's pray.

563
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,880
 Father, thank you for these wonderful people in this wonderful church.

564
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,880
 Thank you for bringing home Mark safely.

565
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,880
 Thank you for those who are here for Christmas vacation.

566
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:50,880
 We thank you for people like even Dan Orlovsky who uses his platform as a Christ follower to continue to show us and demonstrate what it is.

567
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:55,880
 But dear Jesus, you are the model of what that power and sacrifice is.

568
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,880
 You showed us not only what it meant to wash the feet of the disciples.

569
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,880
 You gave us a new paradigm of power.

570
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:12,880
 But you took it to a new extreme and died on that cross so that we are here.

571
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,880
 And we still talk about that powerful servant attitude.

572
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:21,880
 You give us inspiration and you give us hope.

573
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:26,880
 Let us make those decisions every single day to honor you.

574
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,880
 In Christ we pray.

575
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:28,880
 Amen.

576
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:29,880
 Thank you, Father.

577
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,880
 Thank you so much, Tommy.

578
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
 God bless you.

579
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:40,880
 And I want to ask you for prayers as we meet today, this afternoon, with the old and new Quartermembers.

580
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,880
 We're going to try the course for the next year or so and I pray that you will pray for our leaders as well.

581
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
 Okay?

582
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:49,880
 So God bless you.
