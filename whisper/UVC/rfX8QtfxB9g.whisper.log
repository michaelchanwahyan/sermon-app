[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   Hey family, we are continuing on this morning with this study of the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.200]   the Kingdom Values that Jesus teaches us.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.800]   And we're looking specifically again at this section in Matthew 6 on prayer, where Jesus
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.040]   is teaching us how to pray.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.880]   And this is what we commonly call in the church, the Lord's Prayer.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:28.240]   It's a model prayer for us, kind of a template that Jesus gives us in learning how to pray.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.240]   And that's so important.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.520]   Prayer is just so important for us.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.640]   Prayer has always been important for believers.
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.400]   This is one of the fundamental pieces of our health, our spiritual health as Christians,
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.720]   as followers of Jesus, is to have a strong and a vibrant prayer life.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.280]   And last week I mentioned that I think this is something that a lot of times we're missing,
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.440]   especially in the modern world, especially as believers in North America and the United
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.440]   States.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.640]   We don't pray enough.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.880]   We a lot of times don't really know how to pray.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.640]   And especially as young people, we don't pray enough and we don't really know how to pray.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.280]   And so this is just huge.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280]   This is so important.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.960]   This is so big for us to get.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.320]   And I'm excited that we're looking at it.
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.760]   And I hope that we can really get a lot from what Jesus is teaching us here, because it
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:22.720]   will be such a blessing and such a benefit to our spiritual life and our spiritual health
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.720]   and our relationship to God.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:32.280]   Now last week we talked about the fact that Jesus was teaching us that prayer is a personal
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.960]   conversation with God and how important it is for us to understand that.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.480]   Sometimes we don't really know what prayer is and it's confusing.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.640]   Obviously it's also difficult sometimes because there's discipline involved.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.280]   It's not easy to set aside time to pray.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.880]   It's not easy to focus on praying.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.960]   Our mind can wander, all these things.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.280]   And so just those obstacles in and of themselves can really keep us from praying because we're
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.560]   like, "This is hard.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   It's kind of difficult.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.600]   I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.080]   It seems confusing to me."
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.400]   And so we talked about how important it is just to understand that it's simple.
[00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.040]   It's not necessarily easy, but it is simple.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.880]   Jesus teaches us that prayer is simply a personal conversation with God.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.880]   It's not some type of ritual.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.040]   It's not something that we have to do all these certain steps and get everything right.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.360]   It's not like something where we have to say the perfect words or say the right words or
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.360]   say them in the right order.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.160]   And if we don't say the words according to the formula or say them in the right way,
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.360]   then it's not going to work.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.000]   That's not prayer at all.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.840]   Prayer is simply having a conversation with God, sharing our hearts with God, pouring
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.760]   out the needs, the desires, the fears, the trouble, everything that we're dealing with.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.440]   We share that with God in conversation and that's what prayer is.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.680]   We talked last week about the personal nature of that conversation.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.200]   Jesus makes it clear at the beginning of this prayer that we're talking to our Father who
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.280]   loves us and who is close to us and who wants to be involved in our lives, who wants to
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.960]   hear us.
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.160]   Our Father in heaven is someone that we have a close and personal and intimate relationship
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.160]   with.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.480]   Jesus made that really clear for us.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.120]   And then we spoke last week about how Jesus teaches us that our prayer should be focused
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.920]   on God.
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.880]   And He begins this prayer by focusing our hearts on God, by talking about God first,
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:29.080]   by thinking about God first and how important that is to begin by focusing on God and who
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:34.880]   He is and His love for us as Father, but also His greatness and His goodness and His power
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.480]   and His holiness in our lives.
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.480]   That's so important.
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.080]   And then the other thing we discussed last week was just that as we begin to focus on
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.260]   God, it really informs our praying.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.960]   As we begin to think about God as our Father, as a loving God who cares about us, as we
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:55.120]   begin to think about God as powerful and great, but also as good.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.320]   And as we begin to think about God as holy and righteous and all these things, it really
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.600]   affects the way we pray.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.080]   It really changes the way we pray.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.200]   It really changes what we're going to ask God for.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.080]   And so it's really important for us to do that, to begin prayer from a place of focusing
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.800]   on God and who He is and letting the reality of who God is change the way we pray and change
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.080]   the requests that we have and the things that we're going to ask for.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.520]   So this week, we're going to continue on and look at the next verse here.
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.000]   And we're going to continue to learn what Jesus has to teach us about prayer.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.240]   And I took advantage of some of the really nice weather this weekend.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.840]   I went on a little bike ride on the Lakefront Trail, so I've got a little footage of that
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.040]   for you.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.640]   But I just want us to really consider what Jesus is teaching us here today and try to
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.160]   really understand it and practice it.
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.680]   I want us to think about how we can practice these things in our life and in our prayer
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   life and how we can grow in our prayer life with God.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.640]   So we're going to begin today looking again in Matthew chapter six.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.880]   We're going to start at verse seven.
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.880]   This is Jesus speaking.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.680]   He says, "And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.680]   think that they will be heard for their many words.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.200]   Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:19.600]   Pray then like this, 'Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:27.520]   Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.'"
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.320]   And I really want us to focus on verse 10 today and just one big truth that God is teaching
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.440]   us in this verse.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:41.200]   Jesus is really teaching us here that prayer is not about us notifying God.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:44.280]   It's more about God changing us.
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:51.000]   And we sometimes think that prayer is kind of about us informing or notifying or letting
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.960]   God know what's going on in our lives.
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.040]   Maybe you've prayed that way.
[00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.560]   I've prayed that way a lot.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.300]   Maybe you've heard other people pray that way.
[00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:03.760]   What we're doing in prayer is kind of telling God what's going on and telling God what we
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.200]   need and what we want and all those things.
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.760]   And that is an important part of prayer.
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.440]   I'm not discounting that in any way.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.840]   Like I said last week, God loves us.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:14.080]   He cares about our needs.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.040]   He wants us to express the needs of our heart to Him.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:18.600]   That's hugely important.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.880]   And in the model prayer here that we are talking about a few verses later, we'll get to that
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.440]   section where Jesus begins to teach us to express our needs to Him.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440]   So that's important.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.440]   I'm not saying it's not about that.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   But I'm saying that's not the primary purpose of prayer in our lives.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.680]   And sometimes we think it is.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.520]   Sometimes we think the primary purpose is that I can just tell God what's going on and
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.480]   what I want, what I need.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.960]   And that's not what prayer is about.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:49.760]   Jesus is showing us here at the beginning of this prayer, He gives a foundational and
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:56.440]   primary place to thinking about God's will and purpose in our life.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.000]   And that's something that God wants to do through prayer.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.200]   As we begin to practice it, as we begin to spend time with God in prayer, as we begin
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:11.240]   to use prayer in conjunction with God's Word to really think through our circumstances
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:17.120]   and think through what's going on in our life, God is going to use prayer to change us.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:20.600]   And that's really important for us to understand.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.960]   Prayer is not as much as we think about us informing God, and it's a lot more about God
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.960]   changing us.
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:30.000]   And we see that in verse 8, Jesus says, "Hey, God already knows what you need before you
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   ask Him."
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.160]   Well, if God already knows what we need before we ask Him, why does He even want us to ask
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   Him?
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:40.720]   Why does He even want us to pray in the first place?
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.080]   God already knows everything.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.520]   He already knows what we're going through.
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:46.980]   He knows the intricacies of our challenges.
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.480]   He knows the complexity of our pain.
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:51.400]   God knows all that.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:53.320]   So why are we supposed to tell Him?
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.960]   Why are we supposed to pour our heart out?
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:58.120]   Why are we supposed to let Him know what's going on?
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.480]   Why are we supposed to cry out to Him with our heart?
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:06.280]   Because as we do that, something will change.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   And it won't be God.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.640]   It's not that we're going to change God with the things we say.
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.080]   It is us.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.120]   God wants to use prayer to change us.
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.160]   And that happens in so many ways.
[00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:22.480]   First of all, prayer begins to change our relationship to God.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:27.280]   As we begin to practice it, as we begin to do it, as we begin to spend time in conversation
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:31.200]   with God and pouring our hearts out to Him, we get closer to Him.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:35.320]   It changes our relationship because we grow in that relationship.
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320]   We get closer.
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:40.320]   That relationship gets stronger and deeper and tighter.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.980]   That's what happens.
[00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.640]   Just like in a human relationship, when you have a friend and you begin to spend more
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:50.880]   and more time with that person and you guys share more and more conversation, and over
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.720]   time in that conversation you begin to talk about deeper issues of your heart and difficult
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:59.480]   things that you've gone through and past experiences and things that have troubled
[00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:04.120]   you or things that have been a challenge in your life, that changes that relationship.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.480]   It changes that friendship.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:10.120]   That friendship deepens and it gets stronger and you become closer to one another.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:12.480]   The same is true in our relationship to God.
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:16.640]   As we begin to practice prayer and we begin to practice it more and more and we spend
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:20.360]   more time with God and we open our heart to God more and more and we begin to share more
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:25.000]   and more of what's going on in our life, it begins to change our relationship to God.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.960]   We get closer to Him.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:29.640]   That relationship gets stronger.
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   It deepens.
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:31.880]   It gets more mature.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.560]   Prayer changes our relationship to God.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:42.720]   Prayer as our relationship begins to change, prayer changes our perspective on our circumstances.
[00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:47.240]   See when we see a circumstance, especially a difficult circumstance in our life, when
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.160]   we see some difficult situation and we say, "This is a problem in my life.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:53.540]   It's hurting me.
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.960]   It's a big deal and I don't know what to do about it."
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:58.600]   Maybe it's some type of issue at our job.
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:03.040]   Maybe we lose a job or there's some relationship at our job with a boss or a co-worker that's
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   really a problem.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:09.120]   Maybe it's something in school where school is not going how we want it to or we're afraid
[00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:13.520]   that we're going to experience some sort of failure or rejection in some way.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:18.040]   Maybe it's in a relationship with a friend or in a romantic relationship or maybe it's
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.080]   in some other area of our life.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.840]   But when we see a difficult circumstance, that can cause us to feel fear.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.400]   That can cause us to feel worry.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.840]   That can cause us to feel anxiety.
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:33.840]   All different types of things that that can cause in our heart when we see that circumstance
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.660]   and focus on it.
[00:10:35.660 --> 00:10:42.360]   But when we begin to go to God and focus more on Him, suddenly our perspective on that circumstance
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.400]   begins to change.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.320]   We begin to see God's love for us, His goodness, His care for us.
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:52.400]   The fact that He is bigger and stronger than that circumstance, that situation, that obstacle.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.280]   The fact that He can get us through it.
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:58.200]   The fact that no matter what happens, He will be with us even if things feel like they're
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.560]   not going well for us.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.920]   God's presence is in our life.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.120]   Suddenly our perspective on that situation begins to change.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.280]   Prayer changes us because it changes our perspective on our situation.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.660]   As we grow in that relationship with God, as God changes our relationship and we get
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:20.080]   closer to Him, then our perspective begins to change even more.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:26.680]   In that way, we can understand prayer as a relational conversation that changes our perspective.
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.000]   And that's something that we can illustrate with a human relationship.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.760]   Maybe you've had a friend or a family member, someone that you knew well, and you had a
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:38.200]   good relationship with them.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.160]   And you guys had a different perspective on some issue.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.080]   You had a different idea about something.
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:51.580]   And as you sat down and began to talk about that issue together, it changed your perspective
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:53.260]   or it changed their perspective.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:54.560]   Maybe you've experienced that.
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.120]   Maybe you've experienced the fact that when you have a relationship of trust and empathy
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.680]   with someone and you begin to share your heart with them and they share their heart with
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:11.800]   you, that begins to change your perspective on the issues that you talk about or the issues
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:13.240]   that you're facing in life.
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.400]   Maybe it causes you to say, "Okay, I see this in a different way that I didn't see before
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:21.440]   because I had this relational conversation with this other person."
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.100]   And that is something that happens in prayer.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:30.260]   As we begin to know God more closely and walk with Him in a deeper way, and as we begin
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:36.480]   to have these conversations with Him through prayer, God changes our perspective.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.280]   We start to feel differently about some of the issues in our life.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.280]   Some of the things that used to be really important to us are now less important.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.160]   And some of the things that used to be just kind of side issues that we didn't even really
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.440]   notice now become of primary importance in our life because we begin to value what God
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:13:01.200]   values and we begin to value less all those things that we in our selfishness value and
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:04.560]   that the world around us in its selfishness values.
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.560]   That's what happens in prayer.
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:10.640]   It is this relational conversation that changes our perspective.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.740]   And as that happens, prayer begins to change our desires.
[00:13:14.740 --> 00:13:17.240]   And this is really, really important.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:22.720]   That prayer begins to change the things we want and the things that we desire in our
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.720]   life.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.240]   Let's look at Psalm 37.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:27.520]   This is a great psalm.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.040]   And it's actually got a lot of good truth for us right now in the moment that we're
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:36.080]   in with all the things going on and all the schemes and the plots and everything that
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.680]   happens that makes us frightened in our world.
[00:13:39.680 --> 00:13:41.480]   This is really good for us to read.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:43.560]   This is the first, we'll read the first seven verses.
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:47.840]   It says this, "Fret not yourself because of evildoers.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:52.160]   Be not envious of wrongdoers, for they will soon fade like the grass and wither like the
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:53.520]   green herb.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.000]   Trust in the Lord and do good.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.840]   Dwell in the land and befriend faithfulness.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.560]   Delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart.
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:05.240]   Commit your way to the Lord.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.680]   Trust in Him and He will act.
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:12.160]   He will bring forth your righteousness as the light and your justice as the noonday.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.480]   Be still before the Lord and wait patiently for Him.
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:19.600]   Fret not yourself over the one who prospers in His way, over the man who carries out evil
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   devices."
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:26.240]   Like I said, it's a great passage for us in the world that we live in.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.560]   But I want us to think specifically about verse four, "Delight yourself in the Lord
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.360]   and He will give you the desires of your heart."
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:39.320]   There's something very interesting in this verse and something very interesting in our
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.920]   understanding of prayer as we consider this verse.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.480]   We all have desires, right?
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:45.960]   We all want stuff.
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:51.560]   And for a lot of us, those human desires are we just want to be healthy and wealthy and
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:54.560]   comfortable and for everything to go great in our life.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.560]   We want it to be easy.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:56.560]   We want things to go well.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:02.440]   We want it to all work out and for our life to be comfortable and happy for us, right?
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.360]   That's what we want.
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:09.200]   But this verse is telling us that we first need to delight ourselves in the Lord and
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:12.080]   we need to make what's important to Him important to us.
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.320]   We need to find joy in God and in His truth.
[00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.800]   And as we do that, He'll give us the desires of our heart.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.800]   Now what is this verse saying?
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:27.360]   Is it saying that if we delight ourselves in God and find joy in His truth, that then
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.960]   He'll just make us healthy, wealthy, and our life will be easy and comfortable?
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.480]   He'll give us everything we've ever wanted.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.240]   We'll be a millionaire and we'll get all the things we want from life.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.360]   I don't think that's what this verse is saying.
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:43.460]   I think what this verse is saying is that as we delight ourselves in God and begin to
[00:15:43.460 --> 00:15:50.860]   rejoice in His truth, the desires of our heart will become aligned with God's desires for
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:52.320]   our life.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:55.660]   And we will end up seeing those things brought into our life.
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:58.600]   We will see God's plan at work in our life.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:05.240]   And as our desires are now aligned with God's desires, we will get what we want from life.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:09.400]   We see this in the prayer that Jesus is praying here in Matthew 6 and verse 10.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:16.060]   Jesus says, "God, your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:22.720]   Jesus is saying, "God, I am not asking for you to give us what we want.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.160]   I'm asking for you to do what you want.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:31.720]   And I'm asking for us to become aligned with what you want."
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.680]   And we want to see that happen.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.500]   See as we begin to pray, prayer changes our desires.
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.960]   Maybe we go into prayer thinking, "Okay, God, here's what I need in this situation.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:51.960]   I need my boss to change, or I need my teacher to change in this way, or I need this person,
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:56.660]   my friend, to change in this way, or I need you to give me this, or I need you to give
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.400]   me that, or I need you to fix this, or I need you to fix that in my life."
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.720]   Maybe we go into prayer that way.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.600]   But as we begin to spend time with God, focus on Him, and see more of who He is, and see
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.500]   more of how He works in our life, and as we think more about how He loves us and how He
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:17.400]   is working all things to good in our life, even the difficult things, and He uses even
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:23.900]   the challenges to grow us and to strengthen us and to bring beautiful things in our life,
[00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:27.760]   maybe those prayers begin to change because those desires begin to change.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.260]   And maybe we say, "Okay, God, you know what?
[00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:35.880]   Maybe you don't need to change my boss or my teacher right now.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.340]   Maybe I need to learn how to respond to them in a better way.
[00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:42.440]   Even if they're wrong, even if they're doing something that's difficult for me and it's
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:47.120]   not my fault, maybe I can grow in this situation.
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:52.820]   God, maybe what's going on in my life is not about me just needing to get something else
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:56.700]   and me needing you to give me something else.
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:04.360]   Maybe it's me learning how to be content with what I have, or maybe it's me learning how
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:09.520]   to give to someone else, or maybe it's me learning how to serve and using what you've
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:12.920]   done in my life to serve others."
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:18.460]   See as we begin to pray, it begins to change the desires of our hearts, and as those desires
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:23.760]   of our heart change and begin to align with God's desires for our heart, suddenly we'll
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:26.760]   see more and more of those desires getting met.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.560]   That's what Psalms 37, verse 4 is saying.
[00:18:29.560 --> 00:18:36.080]   If we will delight ourselves in God, if we will find joy in His truth for our life, then
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:40.720]   the desires of our heart will suddenly move to a place where we are wanting for our life
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:42.880]   what God wants for our life.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:47.880]   And as those desires change, then we'll start to see them come to pass.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.120]   Instead of just wanting to be rich and comfortable and have everything go great in our life,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.920]   we'll say, "God, what do you want for my life?
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:59.120]   How do you want to grow me and change me and use even the difficult, hard circumstances
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:02.200]   in my life for your glory and for my good?"
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:05.520]   As we begin to desire that, that desire will come to pass.
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:09.000]   We'll say, "Yeah, I can see this is actually happening.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.240]   God is using these things in my life to glorify Him and to benefit me, and I can see it, and
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:19.120]   now the desires of my heart are coming to me."
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:23.160]   Prayer changes our desires, and that's so important.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.920]   Prayer changes what we ask for.
[00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:29.040]   As our desires change, we start to ask for different things.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.240]   Instead of just saying, "God, I just want everything to be great in my life," we start
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:38.200]   to say, "God, I actually want to know you more, and whatever it takes for you to grow
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:43.160]   me and take me to a place of knowing you more, that's what I want.
[00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.000]   Even if it's not easy, even if it doesn't feel great, that's what I'm asking for."
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.600]   Instead of saying, "God, can you just do this in my life because it would be great for me,"
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:57.280]   we start to say, "God, can you do something in my life that would allow me to serve and
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:20:01.560]   love someone else, even if it's not great for me?"
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.760]   Instead of saying, "God, can you make everything work out where I get what I want in life,"
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:11.920]   we start to say, "God, can you help me to connect someone else with you, and can you
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:14.160]   help me to care for others?
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:17.720]   Can you help me to give more and to love more and to serve more?
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:21.080]   Can you help me to be more focused on what's important to you in my life instead of just
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.440]   what my own selfish desires are?"
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.000]   We start to ask for completely different things, and that's good.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.360]   When I was a young man, I was a follower of Jesus as a teenager, but the things I asked
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:37.320]   for back then are not the things I ask for today.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.280]   The things I asked for in my life back then, some of them were good, but a lot of them
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:45.880]   were pretty selfishly motivated and selfishly oriented.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:50.440]   I'm glad that those things have changed, that I ask for different things today.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.440]   There's still a lot of things that I ask for right now in my life that are selfishly oriented
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.240]   and selfishly motivated, and I'm sure God will change more of those as I continue to
[00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.120]   grow and walk with Him.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:03.960]   But it's good that God has changed the desires of my heart.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.840]   It's good that God has changed what I ask for in prayer.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:11.360]   As you spend time with God and your relationship to Him changes, your perspective changes,
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   your desires change, it will change what you ask for.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:17.040]   You'll start asking for some different things.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:22.000]   The way you pray when people are sick, the way you pray when things are difficult in
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.260]   your life, the way you pray when things surprise you because they don't go your way will change.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:31.240]   You will ask for different things.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:36.800]   And as you begin to change and ask for different things, your choices will change as well.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.040]   Prayer changes our choices.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.920]   We ask for different things and we begin to say, "God, I'm going to choose something
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.920]   different.
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:48.360]   I'm not just going to choose the thing that maximizes my own pleasure and comfort and
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:50.080]   selfishness and wealth.
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:54.200]   I'm going to choose the thing that maximizes your glory in my life.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:56.600]   I'm going to choose to do what would honor you in my life.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:01.040]   I'm going to choose to do what's best for the kingdom of God in my life."
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.840]   It changes our choices.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:08.240]   And as it changes our choices, prayer begins to change our outcome.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:11.920]   It begins to change the direction of our life.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:13.680]   It begins to change where we're headed.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:20.440]   It begins to change the choices that we're making and it begins to change who we are.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:23.880]   Who we are as a person begins to fundamentally change.
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:28.080]   And what we're doing with our time and with our resources and with our energy, with our
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.200]   focus begins to fundamentally change.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.600]   Prayer changes who we are.
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:39.320]   We get to a place where we can say genuinely what Jesus said in verse 10, "God, your kingdom
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.160]   come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.880]   That's a hard thing to say.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:49.960]   It's hard to say, "God, I'm going to surrender my will to you and I'm going to say, 'God,
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:55.920]   this is what I want or this is what I desire,' but I'm saying, 'Your will be done, your kingdom
[00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.040]   come on earth as it is in heaven.'"
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:03.720]   It's an easier thing to say in those moments when you don't care, when you say, "Okay,
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.800]   whatever happens in this situation, I don't really care."
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:08.640]   It's not that difficult.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.520]   But in the situations where you really want something to happen, where you're really praying
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:18.400]   for something, where someone's sick or where there's something going on in your life that's
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:23.400]   really important to you and you're saying, "God, can you please do this?
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:24.400]   This is what I want.
[00:23:24.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   This is what I need.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:27.520]   This is what I want to see happen."
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.000]   It's difficult to get to that place where you say, "God, this is what I want.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.360]   This is what I want to see happen, but I'm going to pray that your will is done and that
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.680]   your kingdom comes on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:46.960]   That's a difficult prayer to pray, but as we begin to spend time in prayer, as we begin
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.440]   to practice prayer, we begin to let God change our relationship to Him, change our perspective,
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:57.840]   change the way we look at our circumstances, change our desires, change what we ask for,
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.800]   change our choices.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.400]   That's what we'll start to see.
[00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.920]   We'll find ourselves in that place where we can say, "God, this is the desire of my heart.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.160]   Yes, I'm going to pour it out to you.
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.760]   I'm going to be honest with what's going on.
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:12.360]   I'm going to be transparent about my feelings, and I'm going to let you know all of what's
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:17.400]   going on, but I'm also going to come to this place where I'm saying, 'God, may your will
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.240]   be done and not mine.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:26.640]   I'm going to come to a place of surrender and of allowing you to work in my life.'"
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.000]   And that's what's huge about prayer.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.440]   Jesus points us to this right up front in the Mahalo prayer, that prayer is less about
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:40.960]   us telling God stuff and more about God changing our heart.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.160]   The telling God stuff is important, but what's even more important is that God wants to change
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:52.340]   who we are and how we relate to Him, how we relate to the world around us, and God does
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:57.840]   that through prayer and through this practice of spending time with Him.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.320]   So I want us to begin to practice this this week.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:07.480]   I want us to intentionally say, "You know what, we are going to, as we pray, ask God
[00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:11.240]   to change our relationship to Him, to change our perspective, to change our perspective
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:16.960]   on our circumstances, to change our desires, to change the things that we're asking for,
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:21.720]   to change some of the choices we make, to get us to that point where we can say, 'God,
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:25.480]   your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.'"
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:30.360]   And Psalm 37, verse 4 gives us a good idea of how that happens.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.320]   It happens when we start to say, "God, I'm going to delight myself in you.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.520]   I'm going to rejoice in your truth.
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.880]   I'm going to focus on your truth.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.920]   I'm going to focus on knowing your truth and understanding what's important to you, and
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.240]   as I do, I'm going to shift my desires to align with your desires."
[00:25:44.240 --> 00:25:46.360]   So let's practice that this week.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.360]   Let's focus on knowing God's truth and on knowing what's important to God in our world
[00:25:50.360 --> 00:25:53.120]   and in our life and what He wants for us.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:56.000]   We've already talked so much about these values of the kingdom.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.600]   That's what God wants for us in our lives.
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.920]   Do we have those values in our life?
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.520]   Are our desires in line with those values of the kingdom?
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.040]   Let's think about that, and as we do, let's begin to let God change our perspective and
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:15.200]   our desires so that we can become more and more of who Jesus wants us to be, and we can
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.040]   move more and more to that place of saying, "God, may your kingdom come and your will
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:20.040]   Let's pray.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   God, I do ask that you would change us through prayer, God.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.360]   I ask that you would help us to first of all just practice prayer.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:35.040]   Just do it.
[00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   And as we do it, that our focus would be on you, and as we begin to focus on you and on
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:47.160]   your truth and on who you are and your love for us, that we would begin to change in our
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.160]   perspective.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:51.440]   That we would begin to change in our desires, God.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:56.560]   I pray that you would change the desires of our heart to align with your desires.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:00.400]   And as that happens, God, I pray that we would change the things we ask for, that we would
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:05.600]   begin to ask for things that glorify you instead of things that just satisfy ourselves.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:10.120]   And God, I pray that as we do that, we would see your kingdom come and your will being
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.880]   done on earth as it is in heaven, God.
[00:27:12.880 --> 00:27:14.000]   Your will is perfect.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:19.240]   Your will is good for all of us in a way that our own will is not, even when we imagine
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.400]   that we know what would be best in a situation.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.000]   We don't, but you do.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.560]   So God, we pray that your will would be done.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.480]   We pray that your kingdom would come on earth.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:36.360]   We know it's already that way in heaven, that your will and your power and purpose is already
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:39.000]   fully manifested in heaven.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.880]   And so we pray that through us, your people, it would be manifested on earth as well.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.560]   In Jesus name, amen.
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.560]   Amen.
