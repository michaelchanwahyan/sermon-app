1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,280
 - It's so good to see you all on Marathon Sunday.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:05,760
 Yeah, and you got here okay?

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:07,320
 Traffic was okay, right?

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:08,520
 Yeah, all right.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:14,760
 You know why people wants to run marathon in Chicago?

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,360
 Know why?

7
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:20,920
 Why Chicago is one of the favorite cities

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:24,600
 in United States or even the world for marathon runners.

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,560
 You know why?

10
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,320
 Well, I was talking to someone who is running today.

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
 He should be still running now

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,600
 and as part of our UV family.

13
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:36,360
 So he got the lottery to be able to join

14
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,400
 the Chicago Marathon and this is very interesting, right?

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,840
 It's not because you wanna run

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,280
 and then you can join the Chicago Marathon.

17
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,120
 You gotta be in the lottery.

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,400
 When you are picked, then you can run, right?

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:51,920
 You know about that?

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,280
 You don't know, you don't run, right?

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,200
 Yeah, Chicago is actually one of the favorite cities

22
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,800
 for marathon runners and I was talking to this brother

23
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,200
 who is still running today at this moment

24
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,920
 and he told me last year he was running in Atlanta.

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,840
 Yeah, and he didn't have a good experience

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,320
 because in the 26 miles of running,

27
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,480
 there were so many sections of the journey

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,640
 was there was nothing there.

29
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,240
 He was like, he told me he was like running in empty space.

30
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,480
 Right, and no one is cheering him on, right?

31
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,120
 In Chicago is different.

32
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,120
 Whether the people on the street are faking it or not,

33
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:37,160
 right, they're cheering you on, right?

34
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,800
 And there's so many things to see, right?

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,200
 You see the high rise and all that.

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,640
 So Chicago is a very, very interesting place

37
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,920
 and especially for marathon runner.

38
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,920
 And it got me thinking, actually this is our life journey

39
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,120
 in light of God's providence

40
00:01:55,120 --> 00:02:00,120
 because God and his people are cheering us on.

41
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,840
 Once we know what providence of God really means,

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,720
 we are being cheer on and we are encouraged

43
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,680
 every step of the way because we are not running

44
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,120
 in the empty space, right?

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,520
 We're not running in the wilderness all the time

46
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:22,440
 because God is always there on the sign line

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,640
 and trying to cheer us on, right?

48
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,040
 This is what providence of God really means.

49
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:31,160
 So this is the second talk of God's providence

50
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,560
 reading Joseph's story.

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,000
 A pop quiz for you.

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,200
 What does the word providence mean?

53
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,760
 What does it mean?

54
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,800
 Can you talk to your neighbors?

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
 What does it mean basically?

56
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,560
 Providence, this word, providence.

57
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,880
 What does it mean?

58
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,200
 Talk to your neighbor.

59
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,360
 Basically, what does it mean, providence?

60
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,800
 - Provision.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,080
 (audience laughing)

62
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,360
 - Okay, so here you go.

63
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,520
 Providence means pro, vision, right?

64
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,280
 The word, that's how we got the English word vision,

65
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,960
 meaning that God sees everything in your life,

66
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,840
 whatever comes to pass in your life

67
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,600
 from the greatest to the least

68
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,920
 is under the love and care of our God.

69
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,920
 So the Bible is very clear about the providence of God

70
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,880
 in your life and in my life.

71
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,080
 In God's sight, there was no accident.

72
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,920
 In God's sight, there was only incidents.

73
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,360
 Got it?

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,240
 All these incidents that happened to you

75
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:41,080
 and you experienced, the people that you have met, right?

76
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,880
 The encounters that you experienced,

77
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,920
 it's all in God's sight, in the presence of God,

78
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,280
 because he's timeless, right?

79
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,200
 God is outside time, it's beyond time and space.

80
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,120
 And for him, God looking at you,

81
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,400
 is that there was no accident, but incident,

82
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,600
 an incident under his love and care.

83
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,280
 And that's why this doctrine is so important.

84
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,280
 And the way the Bible presents and teaches this doctrine

85
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:15,800
 is through storytelling, right?

86
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,880
 The story in the Bible, how God act in history,

87
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,200
 how God act in the life of his people,

88
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:26,840
 is the same that God is doing today.

89
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,200
 God is also active in your life,

90
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,280
 but teaching you through the means of storytelling.

91
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:37,000
 So the story of Joseph is one of those

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 complicated story to teach us this precious truth.

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,760
 So today is number two,

94
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,360
 talking about the divine providence.

95
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,840
 So we're coming to chapter 39.

96
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,280
 Okay, let me read this scripture.

97
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,440
 This is again, a story.

98
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,000
 Let's see what we get from this,

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,720
 as we explore together what divine providence

100
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
 really means in your life, in my life.

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,560
 39 verse one, "When Joseph was taken to Egypt

102
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,560
 "by the Ishmaelite traders,

103
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,360
 "he was purchased by Potiphar, an Egyptian officer.

104
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,600
 "Potiphar was captain of the God for Pharaoh,

105
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,960
 "the king of Egypt.

106
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,800
 "The Lord was with Joseph,

107
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,720
 "so he succeeded in everything he did

108
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:25,000
 "as he served in the home of his Egyptian master.

109
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,200
 "Potiphar noticed this and realized

110
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,080
 "that the Lord was with Joseph,

111
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,240
 "giving him success in everything he did."

112
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,840
 Verse four, "This pleased Potiphar,

113
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,360
 "so he soon made Joseph his personal attendant,

114
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,520
 "his assistant.

115
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,680
 "He put him in charge of his entire household

116
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,080
 "and everything he owned.

117
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,080
 "From the day Joseph was put in charge

118
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,160
 "of his master's household and property,

119
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
 "the Lord began to bless Potiphar's household

120
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,760
 "for Joseph's sake.

121
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,600
 "All his household affairs ran smoothly,

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,640
 "and his crops and livestock flourished.

123
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,640
 "So Potiphar gave Joseph complete administrative

124
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,240
 "responsibility over everything he owned.

125
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,520
 "With Joseph there, he didn't worry about a thing

126
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,880
 "except what kind of food to eat."

127
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,880
 That's interesting.

128
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,760
 Continue with 6b,

129
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,600
 "So Joseph was a very handsome and well-built young man,

130
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:27,280
 "and Potiphar's wife soon began to look at him lustfully.

131
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,760
 "Come and sleep with me, she demanded.

132
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,040
 "But Joseph refused.

133
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,800
 "'Look,' he told her, 'my master trusts me

134
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,600
 "'with everything in his entire household.

135
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:43,360
 "'No one here has more authority than I do.

136
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,560
 "'He has held back nothing from me except you,

137
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,360
 "'because you are his wife.

138
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,080
 "'How could I do such a wicked thing?

139
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,320
 "'It would be a great sin against God.'"

140
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,160
 Verse 10.

141
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,520
 Let's see.

142
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,240
 "She kept putting pressure on Joseph day after day,

143
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,480
 "but he refused to sleep with her.

144
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:07,520
 "He kept out of her way as much as possible."

145
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,680
 Verses 11 and following.

146
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,200
 "One day, however, no one else was around

147
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,840
 "when he went in to do his work.

148
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:20,240
 "She came and grabbed him by the cloak,

149

 "demanding, 'Come on, sleep with me.'

150
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,840
 "Joseph torn himself away,

151
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,760
 "and he left his cloak in her hand

 "as he went from the house.

 "When she saw that she was holding his cloak

 "and he had fled, she called out to her servants.

00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,760
 "'Since all the men came running, look,' she said,

00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,720
 "'my husband has brought this Hebrew slave here

 "Paul was furious when he heard his wife's story

 "about how Joseph had treated her."

171

 Verse 20.

172
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,760

00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,920
 "and over everything that happened in the prison.

182
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,280
 "The warden had no more worries

183
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:00,560
 "because Joseph took care of everything.

184
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,680
 "The Lord was with him and caused everything Joseph did

185
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,120
 "to succeed."

186
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,240
 That's an interesting story, right?

187
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,400
 And a familiar story indeed.

188
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:15,920
 And we know that Joseph started out in chapter 37

189
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,400
 as a favorite son of Jacob of Israel.

190
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,400
 And he was unfortunately sold to Egypt.

191
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,360
 But down in Egypt, Joseph was doing well

192
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,360
 because God was with him.

193
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,160
 And he was in the house of Paul the first,

194
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,880
 one of the captain or one of the officials

195
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,200
 of the house of Pharaoh.

196
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,200
 And then here's a story goes,

197
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,200
 and the wife of Paul the first tries to seduce Joseph,

198
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,760
 because again, I think who can resist Joseph, right?

199
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,480
 He was a well-built young man, right?

200
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,720
 He goes to the gym and is very young

201
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,480
 and good looking young guy.

202
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,720
 And this wife of Paul the first trying to,

203
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,960
 you know, get him to go to bed with her.

204
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:09,880
 And, but Joseph maintained his integrity

205
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,920
 and he was committed not to sin against God.

206
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,360
 And he fled from temptation.

207
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,720
 Now this is a self-contained story.

208
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,800
 It means when you, you know, you cut the story out,

209
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:26,680
 you know, chapter 39, pretty much is self-contained, right?

210
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,960
 You can put the story in a separate book.

211
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,280
 A children's Bible, right?

212
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,160
 Or a children's story book, right?

213
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,520
 You just tell the story about this young man,

214
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:41,920
 lonely, away from his parents, his family,

215
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,360
 in a foreign place and fighting against sexual temptations.

216
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,200
 And notice the details there.

217
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,720
 You find that the wife of Paul the first

218
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,720
 tried to seduce him day after day after day, right?

219
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:57,880
 Who can resist that?

220
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,560
 But Joseph did.

221
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:04,040
 He was worth a noble character and a man of virtue,

222
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,640
 a man of moral example.

223
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,480
 And that's why this story is featured

224
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:11,800
 in almost every children's Bibles, right?

225
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,320
 Every single children's Bible has this story

226
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,720
 and as a self-contained story.

227
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,120
 But you think about it,

228
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:22,520
 the story is, it doesn't seem to be

229
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:27,160
 just a simple, you know, moral story.

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,360
 There were a lot of stories in the Bible.

231
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,920
 If we take it artificially,

232
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,320
 or just, you know, read the text,

233
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,920
 it seems like it's a moral story, right?

234
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,440
 Teaching a good example, right?

235
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,240
 Joseph is one of them.

236
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,280
 But if you dig deeper,

237
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,240
 it doesn't seem like it's just a story of good man,

238
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,040
 good young man resisting temptation,

239
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,160
 although that is true.

240
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:57,080
 But, you know, remember how the story turns out.

241
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,920
 The result of Joseph's integrity was really bad luck, right?

242
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,840
 He was being imprisoned and accused, right?

243
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,520
 Kind of a fake me too moment, right, for Joseph.

244
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:16,200
 And he end up in prison, right?

245
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,920
 And that is not a good turnout, right?

246
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,560
 But some of you are parents with young children.

247
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,120
 I cannot imagine the bedtime story would go like this, right?

248
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,240
 You tell a story to your kid, you know,

249
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,960
 your son and your daughter when they were younger.

250
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,280
 See, once upon a time, there was a boy,

251
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:37,640
 very nice looking, he was a good boy,

252
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:41,800
 and maintain his integrity, and he end up in prison.

253
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:46,200
 Good night, and good night, kids.

254
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,960
 You wouldn't do that, right?

255
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:51,360
 This is how the story functions, right?

256
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,360
 But we want to cut that out,

257
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,880
 and we put it in the self-contained book,

258
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,480
 and tell the story.

259
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,840
 So we have to dig deeper, and what does it mean, right?

260
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,200
 How the Bible puts it together

261
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,160
 so that we get what it really means.

262
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,840
 Now, a lot of stories in the Bible

263
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,760
 are not just stories of good examples,

264
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:15,320
 so that we can copy and follow.

265
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,760
 A lot of the stories in the Bible are actually God's story.

266
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,360
 What is God doing in this man's life?

267
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,360
 And that story tells of his character, God's own character,

268
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,880
 who God really is.

269
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,720
 So here, I have two main points.

270
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,600
 One, as we dig deeper into the story,

271
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,600
 we find that the divine providence triumphs over even evil.

272
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,160
 And second point is providence moves in silence.

273
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,160
 First point, perhaps you need to understand this story

274
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,600
 is to understand the overall flow of the chapter.

275
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:58,160
 Now, this chapter has three paragraphs.

276
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,760
 Outline the passage, you find there were three paragraphs,

277
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,760
 1 to 6a, 6b to 19, and 20 to 23.

278
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:12,640
 It's funny, interesting, in the first part of the story,

279
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,080
 1 to 6a, Joseph was in poverty's house,

280
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:19,880
 but there's a phrase that is repeated.

281
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,080
 The Lord was with Joseph, Yahweh was with him,

282
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,600
 and giving him success.

283
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:31,480
 And then the second part of the story, 6b to 19,

284
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,880
 you find that this phrase is absent.

285
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:39,680
 There's no obvious presence of God,

286
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:44,640
 even when Joseph was in trouble, right?

287
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,640
 In fact, the cloak, the clothe that Joseph was wearing

288
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:54,080
 that Joseph is wearing, remember the story of Joseph

289
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:57,480
 has to do with what he wears all the time, right?

290
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:00,920
 Chapter 37, he got the many colored cloth

291
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,960
 from his loving father, right?

292
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,600
 And then chapter 39 right here,

293
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:11,600
 his clothes is in the hand of Paul's wife.

294
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,960
 Now the word hand can mean power and authority.

295
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,680
 So in the middle part of the story,

296
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,360
 Joseph, unfortunately, is under P.W.'s hands,

297
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,880
 Paul's wife, okay?

298
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,480
 Paul's wife, P.W.

299
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,720
 Seizes the clothe and kept it under her guard

300
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,040
 to accuse him, right?

301
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:42,880
 She screamed and he went outside

302
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,440
 and leaving the clothe with P.W.

303
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,960
 And in this story, Joseph is under the hand

304
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,840
 and the power of P.W.

305
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,480
 Where's God?

306
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,240
 God is not there.

307
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,080
 At least it's not explicitly mentioned.

308
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:03,840
 And then you go to the third part, 20 to 23.

309
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:08,560
 Joseph is in the prison, the royal prison,

310
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,920
 but then the phrase shows up again.

311
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:15,920
 The Lord was with Joseph, giving him success.

312
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,560
 Now, when we talk about divine providence,

313
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,760
 we have to deal with the inevitable tension

314
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:26,160
 between God's sovereignty, God's control in your life,

315
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,080
 and also human suffering.

316
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,160
 Now, a lot of people do not believe in the Bible

317
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:34,520
 or resist the idea of the existence of God

318
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,040
 because they have seen so much suffering in the world.

319
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,320
 There are so many troubles in the world, right?

320
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,960
 You read the recent news,

321
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,160
 what happened in Israel, Gaza.

322
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,120
 Hundreds of people died, innocent people.

323
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,120
 And to a lot of people, this is enough

324
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:57,160
 for them to say, "God, if you exist,

325
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,000
 "why all the troubles, right?

326
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,200
 "Why all the suffering?"

327
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:04,000
 Now, this story tells us, or trying to

328
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,680
 sort out the tension between God's sovereignty

329
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,280
 and human suffering.

330
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,600
 Now, the Bible never said,

331
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:18,480
 the Bible never says that God caused PW to tempt Joseph.

332
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,840
 The Bible is clear on this.

333
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:26,080
 Although the Bible, there's no anti-philosophical answer

334
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:28,120
 to the problem of evil.

335
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,440
 In fact, there's none, right?

336
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,000
 If you read all the works of all the great philosophers

337
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,080
 who are trying to figure out or sort out

338
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,920
 the sovereignty of God and human suffering,

339
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:46,080
 there's no airtight philosophical rational answer

340
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,280
 to explain the two.

341
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,720
 Never.

342
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:54,240
 Even, you get that, even you have a rational understanding

343
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,240
 or comprehensive answer to why suffering happened to me,

344
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,320
 why suffering happened to other people,

345
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,600
 even you get the answer, the Bible says, "So what?"

346
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,040
 Because you are still experiencing suffering, right?

347
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,240
 You still see suffering.

348
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,000
 In fact, we don't need one.

349
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,360
 The Bible is clear.

350
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,200
 The Bible uses stories to try to explain that.

351
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,360
 And as we all know, human language has its limit.

352
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:28,640
 And when you hit that limit, storytelling comes.

353
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,680
 Because story has the power to explain,

354
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,520
 more so than statements that we make.

355
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,560
 So the language is important.

356
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,560
 The Bible is clear that God does not cause suffering

357
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,760
 to happen.

358
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:46,520
 Perhaps there's no better term.

359
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:51,520
 We should say God allows or God tolerates evil

360
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,800
 or suffering to come to pass.

361
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,800
 At best, we must say God permits or allows

362
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,840
 some bad things happen to us.

363
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,960
 Joseph begins with a position of honor,

364
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:10,040
 being loved by his loving father.

365
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:13,720
 And now he come to the bottom of the valley.

366
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:17,880
 That's a story trying to tell us.

367
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:22,520
 But he is here in the position of shame at the end of chapter

368
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,160
 or in the middle part of the chapter,

369
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,600
 is to prepare him for the next thing to happen.

370
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,600
 God's providence is still there when he faces difficulties,

371
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,320
 temptations, and challenges.

372
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,880
 Indeed, the power of God triumphs over all of this evil

373
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,640
 things in his life.

374
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:51,280
 So that's how the story goes, showing you who God is.

375
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,800
 He can triumph over all the troubles.

376
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,880
 And that is true for Joseph.

377
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,120
 That is true for you and true for me.

378
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:03,960
 For a little while, Joseph suffered.

379
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,800
 He did, he suffered.

380
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,200
 But at the end of the episode, God raised him up again.

381
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,080
 That is what God is doing in the life of Joseph.

382
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,040
 And that should be also the case for all of you,

383
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,400
 for all of us.

384
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,240
 So God triumphs over evil and suffering.

385
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:26,760
 But you take deeper into the story,

386
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,840
 the providence of God actually moves in silence.

387
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:36,000
 You have to pay attention, look closely to this chapter.

388
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,360
 And if you divide this chapter as I did

389
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,840
 into three different paragraphs,

390
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:45,400
 you can also subtitle each part as so.

391
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,920
 The first part, Joseph in providence's house,

392
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,840
 God is there, clearly, explicitly stated.

393
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,720
 6B to 19, in the hand of P.W.,

394
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,880
 God seems to be silent.

395
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,640
 God seems to be absent.

396
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,520
 20 to 23, again, God is there.

397
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:11,520
 You see, in this chapter of Joseph's life,

398
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:15,080
 God is there in the beginning, in Egypt.

399
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:20,960
 And sandwiched between it is God seems to be silent

400
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,640
 in times of difficulties.

401
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,560
 Is God really absent?

402
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,880
 That's the question the chapter's trying to pose to us

403
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,200
 as readers.

404
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:36,200
 Is Joseph merely under the mercy of P.W.?

405
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,200
 Is he really?

406
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
 Or is not?

407
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,640
 As I try to understand this providence,

408
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,640
 this teaching of providence,

409
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,640
 trying to understand what God is doing

410
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:52,800
 in this episode of Joseph's life,

411
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:57,120
 I must admit at first, I don't quite understand.

412
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,720
 But then I noticed some of the details

413
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,000
 that I didn't see before.

414
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,200
 Okay, this is what I noticed.

415
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,760
 I noticed a subtle changes,

416
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:13,440
 subtle progression of where Joseph is.

417
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,760
 He started off in poverty's house in Egypt.

418
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,360
 Then bad things happened to him.

419
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:27,560
 And then the location changes to the prison.

420
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:31,000
 That is so bad, right?

421
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,120
 However, the word king shows up the first time

422
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,800
 in Joseph's story.

423
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,280
 He end up in the prison of the royal house, yes, indeed.

424
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:45,320
 However, it is the prison of the kings, the pharaoh.

425
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:51,320
 Now, why is this location change significant?

426
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:55,240
 As we all know, the whole story of Joseph,

427
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,320
 we know Joseph is moving closer and closer and closer,

428
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:04,320
 one step at a time to the royal court of the king of Egypt.

429
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,320
 And God is preparing him,

430
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:12,000
 even in the midst of misfortunes happen along the way.

431
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,760
 God allows or tolerates something bad happened to Joseph,

432
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,760
 but he is slowly, gradually moving Joseph closer

433
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,880
 and closer to the king of Egypt, to pharaoh.

434
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,760
 At the end, as we know,

435
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,760
 Joseph was being placed there in the courthouse of pharaoh

436
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,640
 in order to save the whole family of Israel

437
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:41,520
 and indeed plus many other people who suffer from famine.

438
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,000
 So God has a bigger plan, right?

439
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,040
 God can use evil and indeed triumphs over evil

440
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,600
 to accomplish his will.

441
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,040
 God seems to be absent,

442
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:59,240
 but that does not mean God is not working behind the scene.

443
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,080
 Right?

444
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,080
 As you observe your life,

445
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,440
 as you think about the journey of your life,

446
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:09,720
 all the twists and turns,

447
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:14,640
 if you think about it in light of God's presence,

448
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,200
 what a huge difference the people that you have met,

449
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,360
 the accidents that happen in our lives,

450
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,640
 but in God's sight, there's no accident.

451
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,920
 It's just incident.

452
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,520
 What is God doing in your life?

453
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,040
 Why is God silent or seemingly silent, seemingly absent,

454
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:45,120
 especially in times of difficulty, times of uncertainty?

455
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,920
 In the past few months, I've been struggling with

456
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:52,880
 just so much struggle in the presence of God.

457
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,360
 I prayed for something and it didn't happen.

458
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,720
 And there was a spiritual battle inside of me.

459
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:02,280
 God, what are you doing?

460
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,880
 What the heck are you doing, God?

461
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:05,120
 Right?

462
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,200
 And there was so many sleepless night

463
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:13,200
 and I struggled with my prayers, my wish, my desire,

464
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,400
 not happening according to my will.

465
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:20,560
 And then it turned out, praise God, right?

466
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,160
 It did happen.

467
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,400
 And of course, according to God's good will.

468
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,560
 Philip Yancy, ring any bell?

469
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,680
 Christian thinker, Christian writer.

470
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,040
 He has written many, many books about sufferings,

471
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:39,280
 many, many books about divine providence.

472
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:43,520
 And in one of his stories,

473
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:48,760
 Yancy talks about his struggle with divine silence,

474
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,240
 that God doesn't seem to be working.

475
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,840
 God doesn't seem to be moving.

476
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,880
 When he pray so hard, diligently every single day,

477
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,000
 he feels like God is ignoring his prayers,

478
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,240
 denying his request.

479
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,240
 And one of those moments, he wanted to give up, right?

480
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,040
 And then he thought of something in the Bible.

481
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:19,720
 And that something in the Bible, he thought of,

482
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,760
 was Jesus in Gethsemane.

483
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,760
 Remember the last night of the life of Jesus,

484
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,520
 he was in the garden, he was praying so hard.

485
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,320
 He prayed that the Father would take away

486
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,840
 the cup of suffering, death on the cross,

487
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,480
 soon to happen from him.

488
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:42,920
 He was praying so hard in the garden in Gethsemane,

489
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:45,360
 that prayed that God would remove that cup.

490
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:49,400
 And God denied his prayer.

491
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,200
 It is so-called the first prayer in Jesus' life,

492
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,680
 or the only prayer in Jesus' life,

493
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:59,600
 that God did not answer the way his son prayed.

494
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:02,680
 His son prayed, finally,

495
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:06,600
 "Not according to my will, but your will."

496
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,920
 So Yancy wrote this paragraph.

497
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:14,400
 He said, "How many times have I prayed for one thing,

498
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,720
 "only to receive another?

499
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,500
 "God alone is qualified to answer prayer.

500
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:23,560
 "And there's some time we have to let go and trust God.

501
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,920
 "Who can transmute our self-focused request

502
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,240
 "into an unimaginably larger plan?

503
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,200
 "When Jesus prayed to the one who could save him from death,

504
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,200
 "Jesus did not get that salvation.

505
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:44,120
 "Indeed, Jesus got the salvation of the whole world."

506
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:47,240
 That is amazing.

507
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,660
 God did not answer his son's prayer the way he wanted.

508
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,340
 But God has a bigger, bigger, larger plan.

509
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,640
 Yet Jesus was not saved from death.

510
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:06,360
 But in Jesus' death, he saved many others in the world.

511
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,760
 That is the divine providence of God.

512
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,380
 Look at our lives, right?

513
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,400
 There are many requests, there are many prayers

514
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,200
 maybe delayed, or even God said explicitly, "No."

515
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:24,680
 But we have to remember, who got the bigger plan in mind?

516
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,780
 Not us, right?

517
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:31,000
 We can only see a few steps ahead of us,

518
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,700
 but God sees everything.

519
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:37,280
 Let me end with the Confession of Faith of Westminster.

520
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:40,080
 Again, this document, a theological document,

521
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,160
 written in 1646, 17th century.

522
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:50,880
 But it has been one of the best treatment

523
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,800
 of all the doctrines in summarizing

524
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,320
 all the important teachings of the Bible.

525
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:01,320
 In chapter three, article three, five, article three,

526
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,720
 it says, "God uses ordinary means

527
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,780
 "to work out his providence day by day.

528
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:12,220
 "But as God pleases, God may work without,

529
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:17,740
 "beyond, or contrary to those human means."

530
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,920
 God can do that.

531
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:26,400
 God can work beyond those means that you can think of.

532
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,320
 God can even work contrary to all those means,

533
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,340
 to all those instruments that you can think of.

534
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:39,320
 In fact, if you think about it, that is the gospel.

535
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,520
 That is the good news we found in the Bible.

536
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,720
 The providence of God transcends human suffering,

537
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:50,040
 the suffering of Jesus on the cross.

538
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:53,840
 Human evil, God can triumph over it.

539
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:57,020
 When Jesus died on the cross, it was the moment,

540
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:02,080
 the cosmic moment of injustice.

541
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,340
 But God transcends the means,

542
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:10,080
 perhaps the most devilish means, the crucifixion.

543
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:16,040
 His son died unjustly on the cross.

544
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:20,160
 But God triumphs over all and accomplishes his will,

545
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,460
 his holy purpose for saving us sinners from sin, from death.

546
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:30,480
 There are moments in our lives, God may be silent.

547
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:34,920
 He may be quiet, but God is not absent.

548
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:38,400
 There are moments in our lives,

549
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,080
 we may experience God as if he's a passive God,

550
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,280
 detached from us.

551
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,920
 But the story tells us who God really is.

552
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:52,280
 He's still working, still working behind the scene.

553
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,000
 Look at the cross, look at the crucifixion

554
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,860
 of his own one and only son.

555
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,920
 He's still there.

556
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,520
 He's still there in the life of Joseph.

557
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,000
 He's still there in your life.

558
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,040
 Let's all pray together.

559
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,200
 (gentle piano music)

560
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,880
 Father, as we try to sort out the mystery

561
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,320
 of your sovereignty,

562
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,140
 the mystery of all the happenings in our life,

563
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:25,740
 I pray that if we're going through a season of success,

564
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:29,640
 we don't forget, we don't forget your hand,

565
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,400
 your invisible hand is still working in our lives.

566
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,280
 So we come before you to give thanks.

567
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:42,120
 Thank you, because it's not by our own ordinary means

568
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,920
 that we can achieve all of this.

569
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:47,480
 The fact that we enjoy peace,

570
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,640
 a good season in our lives,

571
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:54,040
 it's because of your grace.

572
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,200
 But we are going through some valleys,

573
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,860
 some dark moments in our lives.

574
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,640
 Help us to remember that you are still working

575
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,740
 behind the scene.

576
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:10,080
 You're moving slowly,

577
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,860
 mysteriously, but faithfully in our life.

578
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:17,020
 Help us to trust in you.

579
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:23,120
 Help us to continue to put our faith in you,

580
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:27,960
 knowing that you are the God who sees all things.

581
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:31,160
 We still wanna praise you,

582
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:33,600
 we still wanna give thanks to you,

583
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,880
 knowing that we can trust in you.

584
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,860
 In Christ, I pray.

585
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:47,860
