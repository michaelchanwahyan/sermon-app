1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
 - Hey, Chris, it's CEO.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,040
 And today, I would like to end this three-part series

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,800
 on some reflections on the Israel-Palestine conflict.

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,280
 If you are following the news stories,

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,760
 this conflict is still going on

6
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,360
 with ground invasion from Israel.

7
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:19,080
 And there were a lot of people who lost their lives,

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:22,680
 and many of them, over 50% of them in Gaza,

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,240
 were children and women.

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,240
 So this is very tragic.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,120
 But we'll take this conflict

12
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,840
 in light of this current conflict,

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,460
 and we ask the question, what we can reflect upon.

14
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:41,340
 We know that ideas do have consequences.

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,720
 Theology matters.

16
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,360
 Your understanding of God and faith

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,200
 in the Bible is critical.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,200
 If we have a truncated understanding of faith

19
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,400
 or the Bible or God,

20
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,320
 it will trickle down into our daily life,

21
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,920
 and it will affect us.

22
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:00,960
 Let me give you some example.

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,400
 If you believed God to be a tiger parent,

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,840
 any one of you have a tiger mom or tiger dad?

25
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,840
 If you believe God is like that,

26
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,480
 tiger parent, stern and straight,

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,200
 it's probably very difficult for you to translate

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:22,040
 grace and joy in your own life, right?

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:24,280
 If you constantly think that God,

30
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,320
 in that kind of image, stern and straight,

31
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,880
 tiger parent, always a righteous judge,

32
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,920
 it's pretty difficult to live a graceful life.

33
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,240
 And/or if you think that the Bible

34
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,720
 is a moral book of legal demands,

35
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 there are hundreds of laws or legalistic demands,

36
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,080
 lists of do's and don'ts in the Bible,

37
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,640
 then you probably have two options.

38
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,400
 One option is to be a Pharisee, right?

39
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,400
 A Pharisee would come up with a list of manageable works,

40
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:02,280
 of good works, that he can attend to.

41
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,040
 He can do all of this do's and don'ts

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,200
 and feel good about himself, right?

43
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,040
 It's a self-righteousness.

44
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:12,360
 Or the other option is that you live hopelessly,

45
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,800
 and there's no way you can match the standard of God.

46
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,040
 You always feel you're not good enough,

47
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,040
 and grace is so far away from you, right?

48
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:26,080
 So what I'm saying is ideas do have consequences,

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,080
 and our understanding of God should be growing, right?

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,000
 We get a better understanding of the Bible.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,960
 So in this, in the light of this conflict,

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,720
 we ask the question, what can we reflect upon?

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,760
 And one idea we often encounter in the news story

54
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,200
 is that God seems to have two peoples.

55
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,080
 One is the Gentiles.

56
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,960
 The other one is the Jews.

57
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,800
 So it seems to be that God has two plans, right?

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,800
 Plan A is to save the chosen people, so-called,

59
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,000
 ethnic Israel or ethnic Jewish people.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,480
 And then plan B is to save the Gentiles, right?

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,360
 And we are Gentiles, right?

62
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,520
 We are non-Jews.

63
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,440
 Ethnically, we are not Jews.

64
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,240
 So there is a popular theory that God has two plans,

65
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,840
 plan A for Jews and plan B for Gentiles.

66
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,840
 And so it ends up God has two distinct peoples.

67
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,720
 Is that really true?

68
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,400
 Is that really biblical?

69
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,040
 Now, if we think that God has two plans,

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,880
 if we think that God has two peoples,

71
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,880
 and one of the two peoples has more privileges, right?

72
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,840
 They are kind of a superior people, right?

73
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,600
 Being chosen, right?

74
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,760
 And the other one, the Gentiles,

75
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,120
 you know, they kind of did plan B, right?

76
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,320
 So plan A was to save one kind of people.

77
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,320
 And if that kind of people remain unbelief,

78
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:06,320
 the gospel spilled out to the rest of the secondary people,

79
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,040
 right?

80
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,960
 If we think that way, this idea has consequences.

81
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,960
 We will see one people superior,

82
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:19,360
 the other people inferior.

83
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,960
 So we have to examine that kind of notion,

84
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:25,760
 one for the ethnic Jews and one for the Gentiles.

85
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,480
 Is that really correct?

86
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:32,480
 So we have to go into a big passage in Romans 9 to 11,

87
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:36,120
 three chapters long.

88
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,280
 So in the letter of Romans,

89
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,960
 Paul is trying to explain to us

90
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,440
 what it means to be in Christ.

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,880
 We are standing in Christ,

92
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,680
 that means we are fully righteous,

93
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,480
 not because of what we have done,

94
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:52,240
 but what Jesus has done for us on the cross.

95
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,960
 So chapter one to chapter eight,

96
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,840
 he's trying to expand what it means

97
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:58,400
 to believe in the gospel.

98
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,720
 It's all about Jesus Christ.

99
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,400
 It's not about us.

100
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,760
 And then in 9 to 11,

101
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,960
 he's trying to tackle another tricky question.

102
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,000
 The Roman Christians might have been asking,

103
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,240
 and to understand these three chapters,

104
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,680
 we have to understand some sort of background

105
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,000
 of the Book of Romans and the city of Rome

106
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,640
 in that time period, in the first century,

107
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,440
 especially mid first century.

108
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,920
 What is going on there?

109
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,400
 What we can do is that we can outline three things.

110
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,800
 And the first thing, as you can see on the screen,

111
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,840
 most Roman Christians were Gentiles at that time.

112
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,720
 So they lived in the city of Rome,

113
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,560
 they gathered in small groups in the bigger homes,

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,280
 and they constitute the early church in the city of Rome.

115
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,240
 But most of them are non-Jews, Gentiles.

116
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,600
 And then we know that in the city of Rome,

117
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,280
 especially in the first century,

118
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,400
 there was a wave of anti-Semitism.

119
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,600
 People just don't like the Jews.

120
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,880
 And that kind of feeling,

121
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,680
 that kind of atmosphere was very, very strong.

122
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,680
 And in fact, we know that some of the Roman Empire policy

123
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:14,980
 would kick out some of the Jews out of the city of Rome.

124
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:19,880
 And that kind of public policy will feed

125
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:24,880
 into that kind of anti-Semitic atmosphere.

126
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,360
 With that, you can understand some of the Gentile Christians

127
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,760
 coming to the church, they thought that we are better.

128
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,160
 And the Jews are being kicked out, right?

129
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,800
 Being discriminated.

130
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
 And the Gentile Christian would have thought

131
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,320
 that God's plan for the Jews was over,

132
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,800
 it's game over for them.

133
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,160
 Now, they ask questions like,

134
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,440
 we are the people of God, we are the Gentiles.

135
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,640
 And there were no more Jews, right?

136
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,360
 They may feel that, or imagine that they are better,

137
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:02,360
 they feel superior, and they became arrogant.

138
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,560
 We are Gentiles, we win.

139
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,240
 And the Jews are being kicked out,

140
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,360
 and God's plan for them, God's saving grace for them

141
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,600
 is game over.

142
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,480
 Because, as you can tell,

143
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,740
 how many Jews were in the early church?

144
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,360
 Not many, right?

145
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,260
 But the foundational population of Christians

146
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:27,140
 in the early church were Jewish Christians.

147
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,360
 And then, as the church spread to other places

148
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,280
 in the Roman Empire, more and more Gentile Christians

149
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,080
 came into the church, and they became the majority,

150
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,600
 and the minority was the Jews.

151
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,600
 So, Gentile Christians having some sense of superiority

152
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,280
 with the culture around them, antisemitism.

153
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,000
 So, Paul is trying to write in this three chapters,

154
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,720
 nine to 11, trying to address this problem.

155
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,560
 Paul argues that, yes, only a handful of Jewish Christians

156
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,640
 in the early church.

157
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,660
 But don't forget, they are the foundational people.

158
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:10,700
 Remember, Apostle Paul, Peter, James, and John,

159
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,700
 all these early disciples, they were all Jewish Christians.

160
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:16,840
 They are the foundation.

161
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:20,080
 But yes, only a handful of them believe in Jesus Christ,

162
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,040
 and the majority of the church people are Gentiles.

163
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,640
 But Paul argues that this does not mean

164
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,320
 God's plan has failed.

165
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,000
 So, 9-6, he says, "It is not as though God's word

166
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 "had failed, for not all who are descended from Israel

167
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,800
 "are Israel."

168
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,880
 What the heck is he talking about, right?

169
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,960
 Israel in two different senses, right?

170
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,600
 So, we can imagine two circles, right?

171
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,080
 Two circles, the big one is the ethnic Israel.

172
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,140
 All the people who are descended from the forefathers

173
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,300
 of Israel, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,

174
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:02,140
 they constitute the ethnic Israel at large.

175
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,020
 But there's a smaller circle inside, the true Israel.

176
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:08,800
 They believe Jesus as the Messiah,

177
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,200
 so-called the Messianic Jews today.

178
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:16,880
 They embrace Jesus as the Messiah.

179
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,000
 They're not waiting for another Messiah.

180
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,280
 They know Jesus on the cross and from the empty tomb,

181
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,640
 He is the Messiah.

182
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,040
 So, they believe in Jesus,

183
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,280
 and they call on the name of Christ.

184
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:32,280
 So, they constitute the true Israel, the believing Jews.

185
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,280
 So, Paul is saying,

186
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:40,680
 not everyone descended from Israel, ethnic Israel,

187
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,580
 is the true Israel.

188
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,720
 And as I told you in the early church,

189
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,320
 some of the most important people were Jewish.

190
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,360
 Paul, Peter, James, and John, et cetera.

191
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,360
 So, Paul is trying to argue that God's plan for the Jews

192
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,280
 is not over, it's not over.

193
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,280
 Because see, there are true Israel, the remaining Israel,

194
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,980
 the believing Jewish people, they are still with us.

195
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,720
 Because what matters is not whether they're ethnically

196
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,600
 related to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

197
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,120
 What matters is that they are standing in Christ.

198
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,640
 10, nine, familiar verse.

199
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,700
 If you confess with your mouth, Jesus is Lord,

200
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,080
 and believe in your heart that God raised Jesus

201
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,880
 from the dead, you will be saved.

202
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,260
 Verse 12.

203
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,960
 See, there's no difference, there's no difference

204
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:43,060
 between Jew and Gentile.

205
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,640
 The same Lord is Lord of all, and richly blesses

206
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,760
 all who call on His name.

207
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,560
 So, God's plan for His original chosen people

208
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,200
 is not over.

209
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,440
 Paul is saying, look at the true Israel.

210
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,720
 Yes, they are the minority, but they are still there.

211
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
 Right?

212
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,840
 And then, in these three chapters,

213
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:09,640
 Paul moves on to an analogy,

214
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,620
 and the analogy is the olive tree.

215
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,120
 So, here's my amazing artwork here.

216
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:20,020
 As you can tell, there's one olive tree,

217
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,280
 and God has not rejected His people, the ethnic Jews.

218
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,720
 There's still a future for them,

219
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,000
 because God's saving grace is for all, right?

220
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 He will execute His plan.

221
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,280
 So, here's just this analogy.

222
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,120
 There are a few things I'd like to point out

223
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,040
 from this amazing artwork, is that the root of the tree,

224
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,480
 the stem of the tree, is the Old Testament Israel,

225
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,340
 the Jewish people.

226
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:50,920
 Salvation is from them, and Jesus, by the way, was Jewish.

227
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,080
 Right?

228
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:53,720
 He was 100% Jewish.

229
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,320
 The root of the tree is the Old Testament Israel,

230
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,920
 and then there are natural branches.

231
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:05,560
 On the left, the green ones, are the believing Jews.

232
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:08,360
 Paul, Peter, James, and John, and all that.

233
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,960
 But some of the natural branches have been broken off.

234
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,400
 Lower right.

235
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,840
 They have been broken off because of their unbelief,

236
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,160
 because they hardened their heart.

237
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,640
 So, those are the unbelieving Jews.

238
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,080
 They are being broken off.

239
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:28,640
 However, from another tree, the Gentiles are being

240
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,280
 crafted in.

241
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,040
 They are from another tree, from the wild olive shoots,

242
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,020
 taken from the other tree and crafted into the one tree,

243
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,060
 the olive tree.

244
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:46,400
 Now, this famous olive tree speaks of God's

245
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,840
 undeserved grace.

246
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,300
 We don't deserve, if we are Gentiles,

247
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,740
 we don't deserve to be crafted in to the tree of salvation.

248
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:00,000
 Remember in Rome, the Gentiles were bragging about

249
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,440
 the fact that we are the majority, and the Jews are gone.

250
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,660
 Right?

251
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,680
 It's game over for them.

252
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,060
 That's what the Gentiles was thinking.

253
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,060
 But this tree analogy is trying to present to us grace.

254
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:18,320
 It's because of grace we are being crafted in.

255
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,060
 11, 17.

256
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:25,400
 Paul says, "If some of the natural branches have been

257
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:30,400
 "broken off, and you, although you are wild olive shoots,

258
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,040
 "have been crafted in among the others,

259
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,040
 "and now share the nourishing sap from the main olive root,

260
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:44,020
 "do not boast over those natural branches.

261
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:47,480
 "Do not think we are being crafted in so we are better,

262
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:50,820
 "so we are in a better place in terms of grace."

263
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:51,800
 No.

264
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,800
 Paul says, "Do not boast over those natural branches.

265
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,000
 "If you do consider this, you do not support the root,

266
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,080
 "but vice versa, the root supports you."

267
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,080
 Right?

268
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:08,960
 We share the salvation.

269
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,600
 We are being called the people of God.

270
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,120
 We are Gentiles.

271
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,120
 Don't boast about the fact that, okay, we are the majority,

272
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,480
 and the minority is over.

273
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,240
 The Jews is over.

274
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
 Now, two questions here.

275
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,000
 How many olive tree is there?

276
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,040
 How many?

277
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,640
 One.

278
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,960
 There's only one.

279
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,380
 So there's only one people of God,

280
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,760
 not two peoples of God, right?

281
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,440
 One tree, two kinds of branches,

282
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:42,840
 the natural and the wildly crafted, right?

283
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,000
 Second, where are you?

284
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,900
 We are the Gentiles.

285
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,240
 We are the yellow, right?

286
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,240
 On the right.

287
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,640
 We are not the natural branches,

288
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,920
 but by grace, we are being crafted in.

289
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,560
 So the olive tree speaks of God's grace to all of us,

290
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,640
 especially the Gentiles.

291
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,600
 Us, all of us, every one of us.

292
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,880
 We are being called the sons and daughters of God,

293
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,480
 being crafted into the people of God.

294
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,800
 It's all because, not because we are better,

295
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,200
 and it's not because they are worse.

296
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,440
 It's because of the grace of God.

297
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,280
 We enjoy the blessing, the relationship with God,

298
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,720
 and thank God for his saving grace, right?

299
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,720
 And there should be not boasting, but gratitude.

300
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,800
 We can come before God as his people.

301
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,680
 We should be thankful,

302
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,440
 thankful for what Jesus has done for us.

303
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,800
 At the same time, Paul is arguing

304
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,720
 that God's plan for the Jews

305
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,960
 is yet to come.

306
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,640
 It's not a game over for the Jews.

307
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:52,360
 God's promised to save many of those unbelieving Jews,

308
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:56,360
 and it is yet to come, 1125.

309
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,080
 Paul said, "I do not want you to be ignorant

310
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,960
 "of this mystery."

311
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,680
 Now he's like opening the lid of the pot,

312
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,920
 and you can see inside,

313
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,120
 there's a spiritual mystery yet to come.

314
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,080
 He said, "Brother and sisters,

315
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,960
 "so that you may not be conceited,

316
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:17,640
 "Israel has experienced a hardening in part."

317
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:20,320
 Part of the people are being hard-hearted,

318
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,400
 not believing Christ as, or Jesus as the Messiah.

319
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:28,880
 "Until the full number of Gentiles has come in,

320
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:33,080
 "and so all Israel will be saved."

321
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,560
 All right, this is a very, very difficult verse,

322
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,400
 and one thing you need to know is that,

323
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,200
 first thing is there's a mystery.

324
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:46,200
 There's a future unseen, not unfold yet,

325
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:49,800
 that is so all Israel will be saved.

326
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,000
 Now, one thing you need to understand,

327
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,680
 first, the key word here.

328
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,680
 The word all does not mean each and every single Jew.

329
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
 Now, how do we know that?

330
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,880
 This is obvious because if you check the Old Testament,

331
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:12,560
 many times it uses the phrase all Israel,

332
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,840
 and many times from the context,

333
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,560
 you know that it does not mean,

334
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:20,440
 and cannot mean every, each Israelite.

335
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,080
 It simply means many of them,

336
00:17:23,080 --> 00:17:25,760
 representative number of them.

337
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
 And secondly, there's an adverb here,

338
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,720
 so, NIV translate, so, S-O.

339
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,920
 ESV has it in this way,

340
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,000
 or in this manner,

341
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,480
 or in the same manner.

342
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,840
 Now, the word translation is very important here.

343
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,040
 You know, ESV or NIV are right on,

344
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,400
 especially ESV.

345
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:52,440
 In this way, in a similar manner.

346
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,920
 Now, what does it mean?

347
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:58,920
 This adverb, so, or in this way,

348
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:05,320
 does not mean a straight sequential order.

349
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,920
 It does not mean, okay, A happen,

350
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,320
 and then B happen.

351
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,360
 So, cross that.

352
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,320
 It does not mean the full number of Gentiles

353
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,080
 come in to the church.

354
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,880
 We count one billion, two billion, three billion, and seven.

355
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:25,760
 Done, and then all Israel will be saved.

356
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,440
 No, it does not mean that,

357
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,440
 because that adverb is not a straightly sequential adverb.

358
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:38,200
 What it means is that, it is trying to show you

359
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,120
 it is in the like manner.

360
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,960
 Now, what does it mean?

361
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,160
 Look at the bottom of the slide.

362
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,200
 The yellow line is the full number of Gentiles

363
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:51,320
 being crafted into the church in the human history.

364
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:54,080
 In the last 2,000 plus years,

365
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,160
 Gentiles from here and there,

366
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,600
 here and there, generation to generation,

367
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,080
 are being crafted.

368
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,520
 God's saving grace becomes reality

369
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,280
 to each and every one of them.

370
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,560
 And the full number of Gentiles will be crafted, right,

371
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,960
 in the entire human history between the first coming

372
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,600
 and the second coming of Christ.

373
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,400
 That's the yellow line.

374
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,880
 And Paul said, "In this way, in the same manner,

375
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,880
 "all Israel, all true Israel, will be saved."

376
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,680
 So, the green line.

377
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,720
 So, it's not sequential, full number, boom, done,

378
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,960
 and then B happen.

379
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:35,800
 It's actually happening the same time, in the same manner.

380
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,000
 So, all Israel, true Israel, will be saved

381
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 because God is choosing and saving

382
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,800
 from generation to generation,

383
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,640
 from different times and space,

384
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,640
 different places here and there,

385
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,640
 and save them to be God's true people, true Israel.

386
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:57,720
 So, that's the amazing thing about God's grace.

387
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:02,320
 We, the Gentiles, we can be God's people.

388
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,000
 You can be God's people.

389
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,780
 Not because we are naturally related,

390
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:11,780
 not because of blood relation, not because of ethnicity.

391
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:17,540
 We are saved because faith alone in Jesus Christ.

392
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:21,480
 If we confess with our heart and our lips

393
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:24,740
 that Jesus is Lord, then we are saved.

394
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,280
 It is by grace.

395
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,000
 It's by faith alone.

396
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:32,300
 Now, no other verses in the entire New Testament

397
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,940
 is more clear than this one, Galatians 3.

398
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,960
 It says about Gentile Christians,

399
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,060
 Paul says, "You are all sons of God

400
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,540
 through faith in Christ Jesus.

401
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,000
 All of you who were baptized in Christ

402
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,140
 have clothed yourself with Christ.

403
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,620
 The image of Christ is on us,

404
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,340
 and there's neither Jew nor Greek."

405
00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:55,640
 It really doesn't matter.

406
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,640
 Your ethnicity, slave or free, economic status,

407
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,620
 male or female, gender, for you are in Christ.

408
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,120
 You are all one in Christ.

409
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,840
 If you belong to Christ, you are the seed of Abraham.

410
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,180
 You are the children of Abraham.

411
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,180
 Not because of ethnicity, but because of faith.

412
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,020
 You have the same faith with Abraham's faith.

413
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:24,780
 So, you are heir according to the promise of God.

414
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,720
 Now, by the way, this is not replacement theology, right?

415
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,480
 If you know that kind of word,

416
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:35,220
 that means church is replacing the original people of God.

417
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:36,980
 No, it's not replacement.

418
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:41,080
 It is fulfillment, fulfill in Christ.

419
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:45,740
 That's what the apostle says in Romans 9 to 11.

420
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,820
 God's plan is still going on.

421
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,500
 Yes, there's only a handful of Jews believing in Christ,

422
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,060
 but God's plan will continue.

423
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:59,100
 It's a mystery, but it's active.

424
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:04,980
 And God's plan continues to unfold in humanity,

425
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,740
 in human history.

426
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,060
 His saving goal, His saving plan

427
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,260
 will continue to be accomplished.

428
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,820
 And that is amazing because God's mysterious plan

429
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,340
 for the future, for His people,

430
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,480
 for you and for me continues to unfold.

431
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,260
 If we think about that,

432
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:30,760
 now we understand why Paul ends these three chapters

433
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,400
 with doxology, with praises.

434
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,420
 That's the end of chapter 11.

435
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,020
 He says, "Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom

436
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:46,260
 "and knowledge of God, how unsearchable His judgments,

437
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,900
 "His paths, the paths of God beyond tracing out."

438
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,580
 There's no way we can comprehend the future.

439
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,580
 There's no way we can advise God what He is doing.

440
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,180
 We just cannot comprehend

441
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,600
 because the riches of God's wisdom.

442
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,960
 "Who has known the mind of the Lord?

443
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,640
 "Who has been His counselor?" 35.

444
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:13,080
 "Who has ever given to God that God should repay him?

445
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,720
 "For from Him, through Him, to Him are all things to Him.

446
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,040
 "Be the glory forever, amen."

447
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,800
 He just end this passage with doxology,

448
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,000
 praising God together.

449
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,500
 That's the response song here.

450
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:30,920
 He just cannot keep it to himself.

451
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,640
 Paul, when he thinks about the plan of God,

452
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:37,420
 unsearchable plan and mysterious plan,

453
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:41,600
 he just wanna praise God and continue to serve Him.

454
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,200
 Sometimes we don't see the future.

455
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:52,080
 The future seems unknown to us.

456
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,320
 Or even we feel confused about what the heck God is doing

457
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,760
 in the future.

458
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,400
 That is what the Roman church was struggling with.

459
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,980
 And Paul burst out with worship and praise

460
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,000
 and say that, "Yes, we don't quite know

461
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,100
 "where God is leading.

462
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,520
 "We don't quite see the future.

463
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:17,520
 "We cannot just fast forward one year from now,

464
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,320
 "six months from now, six years from now,

465
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,960
 "or 10 years from now, what will be unfold?

466
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,840
 "We just don't know yet.

467
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,520
 "It's mysterious to us."

468
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:31,520
 But that does not mean God is not actively doing His purpose.

469
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,600
 Remember this line?

470
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,560
 I'm sure you heard of it.

471
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,320
 Never place a period where God has placed a comma.

472
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:44,140
 God is still working in the world,

473
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:50,060
 saving the Gentiles, saving the Jews, saving us.

474
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:56,560
 And indeed, God's working in our life,

475
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,160
 sometimes it seems mysterious.

476
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,060
 But the fact that it's mysterious is unknown to us,

477
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:10,060
 should not and must not limit the possibilities of God.

478
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,440
 God's plan in the world continues.

479
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,520
 It continues to unfold.

480
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,120
 And that's why after this doxology,

481
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,860
 Paul urges us in chapter 12,

482
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:25,200
 "Therefore," see the connection here?

483
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:30,100
 "God's plan is unsearchable yet active.

484
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,940
 "God's purpose is going to continue.

485
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,220
 "It is not a period, it's a comma.

486
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:43,140
 "God continues to orchestrate things for His glory.

487
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:45,220
 "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters,

488
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,240
 "in view of the mercy of God,

489
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,440
 "to offer your whole life, your whole body,

490
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,880
 "as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.

491
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,960
 "This is your spiritual act of worship.

492
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,900
 "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world.

493
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:06,300
 "Do not think according to the culture,

494
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,560
 "according to the world,

495
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:11,720
 "but be transformed by renewing our mind."

496
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:16,520
 Dig into the word, study the word of God,

497
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,620
 and see what God is doing in the past,

498
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,520
 what God is doing in Christ.

499
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,280
 And we will be amazed that God's plan is mysterious,

500
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:31,760
 but yet His plan continues to unfold.

501
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,060
 Praise God.

502
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,880
 Praise God.

503
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,620
 "To Him, through Him, to Him are all things.

504
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:41,340
 "To Him be the glory forever."

505
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:47,420
 That should encourage us to continue to serve our mighty God.

506
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:53,980
 No matter what, offer our whole life as living sacrifice

507
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:57,340
 to worship Him, to follow Christ,

508
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:01,480
 not the world, but our Savior, Messiah.

509
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,080
 We're gonna sing the last song.

510
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:10,080
 And I pray that this song will be a prayer for all of us.

511
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,060
 Thank God for all the times, good or bad,

512
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,420
 continue to serve Him and follow Him.

513
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:20,360
 Let's pray.

514
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:24,400
 Father, once again,

515
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:27,820
 we acknowledge that we are so limited in our sight.

516
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,340
 We can only see a few things.

517
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:34,100
 A few minutes ahead of us.

518
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:39,060
 We can plan, we can worry about the future,

519
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:45,380
 but yet your word reminds us that you are the active agent.

520
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:51,180
 You continue to work for your glory,

521
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:55,100
 saving Jews and Gentiles alike,

522
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:58,460
 saving all of us in Christ.

523
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,800
 Yes, life is full of mystery,

524
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,700
 but we know they are all commerce.

525
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:11,580
 You have not put periods in our life journey.

526
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:18,380
 Your plan, your purpose continues to unfold in our life.

527
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:24,060
 In the midst of uncertainty, in the midst of unknowns,

528
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,940
 pray that you will increase our faith

529
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,900
 to see how amazing you are,

530
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:33,580
 how rich and unsearchable your plan is.

531
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,900
 To you be all the glory in Christ, we pray.
