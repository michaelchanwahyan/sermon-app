[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]  上一次我們提過出埃及這件事
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.400]  是在公元前1500至1200年間發生
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.400]  當時的世界都是面臨史無前例的動盪
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.800]  近東有很多人正在遷徙移居
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.000]  想找一個安居之所
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  我們舉個例子就是海人Sea People
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.600]  其中一組人就是菲利士人Philistines
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.000]  在大歷史圖畫中以色列人是其中一群在遷徙
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.200]  他們在埃及被欺壓多年
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.200]  離開時前無去路後有追兵
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.800]  但有特別的地方是他們發現上帝親自帶領他們
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.800]  對於今天你和我面對社會政局的不穩
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.800]  有一種被迫的感覺流散在世界不同的地方
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.400]  同樣面對很多改變身份改變和未知之數
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:04.200]  這樣看出埃及這個故事對我們來說是非常切身
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.200]  但當我們看出埃及這個技術時
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.600]  我們一定要梳理一下歷史的問題
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.600]  為什麼呢?因為在舊約聖經中
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.600]  經常提到出埃及這件歷史事蹟
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.400]  可以這樣說在舊約歷史中出埃及這件事
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.600]  就有如新約的耶穌基督從死裡復活
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.400]  歷史性都是這麼重要
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.600]  但在過去幾十年越來越多人質疑
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.800]  為什麼沒有證據證明出埃及這件事
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.200]  或者可能出埃及是很後期虛構的故事
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.800]  我記得好幾年前在香港電台上受過訪問
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.800]  主持人問了一個問題很有道理
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.800]  他說出埃及這麼大件事總會有少少線索
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.200]  居然一點線索都沒有
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.400]  有些道理我們必須承認
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.600]  暫時到現在都沒有直接的歷史證明
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.800]  但我們這樣說也好
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.600]  我們都需要留意幾點
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.200]  第一就是證據的不存在
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.400]  不一定等於不存在的證據
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.400]  這個你動高床板就要想一想
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.800]  The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.800]  因為很多歷史事跡
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.000]  包括聖經或聖經以外的歷史事跡
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.800]  都未必找到考古的證據
[00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.400]  我們不能夠踏時光機回去以前
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.800]  將歷史放在化驗室裡面去證明多一次
[00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.800]  何況當時的背景
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.400]  埃及帝國是獨裁的政權
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.800]  他們不會將失敗的事跡寫下
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.200]  第二件事我們需要留意
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.200]  當我們想起考古證據的時候
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.200]  我們對考古證據的要求一定要實際
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.600]  假設以色列人出埃及的話
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.400]  你想一下他們會帶著什麼
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.400]  他們好像難民一樣離開埃及
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.400]  我不知道你有沒有做過服務難民的工作
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.800]  我記得有一次我參與一個難民服務的工作
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.800]  去到機場接一家六口從剛果難民營來的難民
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.600]  六個人他們入境下機的時候
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.800]  每個人你想一下他們帶著什麼
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.200]  他們只是帶著一個小的膠袋
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.800]  就是這麼多
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.400]  所以你再想一想
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.200]  作為難民甚至作為平民百姓也好
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.000]  過了一百年之後
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.400]  你看我們這班平民百姓的人
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.800]  都一定是蕭聲匿跡的
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.800]  就是說在考古歷史裡面是看不到我們的
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.600]  所以為什麼有這麼多皇帝想建皇陵
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.200]  大墳墓有兵馬俑金字塔等等
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.800]  因為他們想留芳百世
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.000]  所以沒有考古證據不代表你不存在
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  再有一點需要留意
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.200]  如果你真的按照聖經所說
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.000]  以色列人在埃及裡面住了好幾代
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.400]  如果他們出埃及的時候
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.400]  你想一下他們帶著什麼實物出來
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.000]  衣服、瓷器、日用品等等
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.800]  但這些全部的東西
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.000]  都必定是埃及製造的
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.600]  是在埃及製造的
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.000]  所以他們到曠野就算留下這些實物
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.200]  我們找到的
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.600]  我們只會當有一班埃及人
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.600]  他們經過留下過
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.200]  舉個很簡單的例子
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.400]  我的子女都是在美國出生長大的
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.600]  我看遍他們擁有的實物
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.600]  我找不到哪一樣可以直接表明他們是華裔第二代
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.400]  除了他們現在在生的樣子
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.000]  像亞裔的人
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.400]  但他們說話、吃東西、想的東西
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.000]  都是美國本土化的
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.200]  所以我想如果他們真的化了灰的話
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.000]  他們的實物跟其他白人、黑人
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]  這裡的美國人是沒有任何分別的
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.800]  所以我們對考古證據的要求
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.600]  是需要實際一點的
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.000]  我們不會找到一塊石頭
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.400]  上面寫著摩西到此一遊
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:30.000]  你說沒有直接的歷史考古證據
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.400]  是不是就這樣算了
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.600]  其實也不是的
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.200]  在歷史的探索裡面
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.000]  我們再問一個問題
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.600]  有沒有間接性的、情況性的、背景的旁證
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.600]  即是circumstantial background的evidence
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.800]  如果這樣問的話
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.200]  可能真的有
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.200]  因為如果出埃及記
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200]  真的是後期虛構著作
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.000]  即是到波斯時代、公元前500年的時候才寫
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.600]  他的描述裡面一定會用一些後期的字眼
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.200]  但是如果出埃及記
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.800]  真的寫當時的歷史事跡
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.400]  他的描述一定是配合當時的語言
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.200]  當時的環境
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.400]  如果是這樣的話
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.800]  歷史可靠性就會高很多
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.000]  你問前前後後
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]  又說早期又後期的描述
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.800]  好像很難明白、很抽象
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.800]  其實一點都不難明白
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.400]  我播一下一個短片
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.400]  你就知道有什麼問題
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.600]  是,駱Sir
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.600]  失憶的大軍要二十天才到達白里浦
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.800]  但每日的軍餉二十萬兩
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.600]  我們的國庫已經所剩無幾
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.200]  浸暫時不能給太多
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:38.200]  為今之計
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.600]  只要交了十五、十六和十七這三天的軍餉
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.400]  其他的就慢慢想辦法
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.200]  駱Sir,讓盧平替你換一盆熱水
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.400]  周兄長,跟浸再檢查一下
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.400]  看各地各省還有沒有人欠稅
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.000]  浸要把水行一次過追回來
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  實不相似
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.200]  明眼人一看就明白
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:01.600]  因為浸是不會用check這個字
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.600]  看起來好像很好笑
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.400]  但其實這裡點出了一樣東西
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.000]  就是如何鑒定一個歷史文件可靠性的原則
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  古話說出埃及記
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.400]  如果歷史可靠的話
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:18.600]  它裡面的描述一定是吻合公元前1500至1000年之間
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:21.600]  那時是New Kingdom Period
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.600]  是古埃及帝國的新王國時期
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.400]  那時是埃及最後輝煌的時期
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:32.000]  看當時埃及的歷史文件
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.600]  用什麼字眼
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.200]  描述什麼地理
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:37.200]  然後再比對一下
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.200]  出埃及記我們就知道歷史的可靠性
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.800]  舉幾個例子
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.800]  出埃及記一章第十一節
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.000]  於是埃及人派督公管轄他們
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.200]  即是以色列人
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:54.200]  加重他們的負擔和害他們
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.200]  他們為法老建造兩座積火城
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.400]  就是彼東和蘭室
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:02.800]  使他們因做苦工覺得命苦
[00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:07.400]  無論和禮 造磚 做田間各樣的工
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.800]  在一切的工上都嚴嚴待他們
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.600]  這裡細緻的描述
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.000]  造磚 和禮和一切的工
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.400]  我帶你去一個埃及的墓穴
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.800]  叫做Tomb of Rekhmire
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.000]  雷克米爾墓穴
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]  這個人是公元前15世紀
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.600]  即是1400多年的時候
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:31.800]  在埃及做大官
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:34.600]  在他的墓穴有很多壁畫
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:37.800]  裡面描述很多奴隸
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.400]  包括戰俘
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.400]  他們在田間做很多事
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.600]  這個跟出埃及記的描述非常吻合
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.000]  你看到圖畫這一部分
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.200]  有人在池裡取水
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.600]  有些奴隸在和禮
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.800]  有些在造磚
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:04.400]  包括田間各樣的工作
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.400]  細緻地看的時候
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.400]  埃及的督工是拿著木棒來管轄他們
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:15.200]  另一方面我們可以看地理
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.600]  一章第十一節
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.600]  兩座積火城
[00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.000]  叫彼東和蘭室
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.400]  蘭室是法老的名字
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.400]  有一個很出名的法老王
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:30.600]  叫蘭室二世 或蘭室大帝
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.600]  Ramesses II
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.000]  蘭室城真的存在
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.200]  Ramesses 或 Ramesses
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.000]  在舊約聖經裡只提過五次
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.600]  都是在摩西五經裡提過
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.600]  而我們知道蘭室城
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.600]  Pyramuses 城市
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.400]  在埃及的文獻裡出現過
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.600]  也是蘭室二世的法老所建的京都
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.600]  說起蘭室二世的法老
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.800]  他就很有名
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.200]  因為很多人都認為
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.800]  這個很可能是出埃及的法老
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.200]  但說到考古
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:10.400]  蘭室城我們知道的
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:13.000]  只有二百年的歷史
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.600]  由公元前1270至1070年之間
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:21.200]  為什麼最後會被荒廢呢
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.200]  因為當時利羅河在三角洲平地經常改道
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:28.400]  利羅河對埃及人來說
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.600]  是很重要的
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.400]  等於今天的高速公路
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:36.200]  交通 貿易 軍事的輸流都是靠利羅河
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.600]  所以利羅河改道
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.200]  城市在兩百年之後就被荒廢
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.600]  埃及人很會復原
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:49.600]  他們就把本身在蘭室城的石碑
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.200]  有蘭室二世的名字的石碑
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.000]  搬到北面十二英里
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.800]  建另外一個城鎮
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:00.000]  那個城鎮叫索安
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.800]  Zoan 或希臘文是丹尼斯
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:09.000]  說起索安城或丹尼斯
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]  如果你記得或接觸過
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.200]  1981年有一套電影叫《奪寶奇兵》
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:18.800]  In the End of Jones' Waders of the Lost Ark
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:23.000]  裡面提及過丹尼斯的古城
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.800]  電影裡的橋段是二次大戰時
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.800]  德國納粹黨要法國考古學家
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:36.800]  去丹尼斯索安找藥櫃
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:40.800]  你看看以下短短兩三分鐘的片段
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.800]  你告訴我有什麼真有虛構
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:46.800]  Dr. Jones, I've heard a great deal about you.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:47.800]  Have you?
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.800]  Professor of Archaeology,
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.800]  Expert on the occult,
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:53.800]  and I just want to say it,
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.800]  obtainer of rare antiquities.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:57.800]  One way of saying it,
[00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:58.800]  why don't you sit down,
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:11:59.800]  you'll be more comfortable.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800]  Thank you.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.800]  Yes, you're a man of many talents.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:05.800]  You studied under Professor Ravenwood
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.800]  at the University of Chicago.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.800]  Yes, I did.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.800]  Dr. Jones, you must understand
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.800]  that this is all strictly confidential.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:17.800]  I understand.
[00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:19.800]  Yesterday afternoon,
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:22.800]  our European sections intercepted
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.800]  a German communique
[00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.800]  that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:28.800]  You see, over the last two years,
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.800]  the Nazis have had teams of archaeologists
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.800]  running around the world
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.800]  looking for all kinds of religious artifacts.
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.800]  Hitler's a nut on the subject.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.800]  He's crazy.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.800]  He's obsessed with the occult.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:40.800]  And right now,
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:41.800]  apparently there's some kind of
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:43.800]  German archaeological dig
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800]  going on in the desert
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:45.800]  outside of Cairo.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.800]  We've got some information here,
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:48.800]  but we can't make anything out of it,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.800]  and maybe you can.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.800]  Tannis Development Proceeding
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.800]  Acquire Headpiece
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:57.800]  Staff of Ra
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.800]  Abner Ravenwood, U.S.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.800]  Nazis have discovered Tannis.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:06.800]  What does that mean to you, Tannis?
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800]  Well, the city of Tannis
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:08.800]  is one of the possible resting places
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:09.800]  of the Lost Ark.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:11.800]  The Lost Ark?
[00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:12.800]  Yes, the Ark of the Covenant,
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.800]  the chest the Hebrews used to carry
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.800]  around the Ten Commandments.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.800]  What do you mean, Ten Commandments?
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800]  You're talking about the Ten Commandments?
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.800]  Yes, the actual Ten Commandments,
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:21.800]  the original stone tablets
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.800]  that Moses brought down out of Mount Harab
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.800]  and smashed, if you believe in that sort of thing.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.800]  Did you guys ever go to Sunday school?
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:29.800]  Well, I...
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:30.800]  No, look.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:31.800]  The Hebrews took the broken pieces
[00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:32.800]  and put them in the Ark.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:34.800]  When they settled in Canaan,
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:35.800]  they put the Ark in a place
[00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:37.800]  called the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem,
[00:13:37.800 --> 00:13:39.800]  where it stayed for many years
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.800]  until all of a sudden, whoosh, it's gone.
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:42.800]  Where?
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.800]  Well, nobody knows where or when.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.800]  However, an Egyptian pharaoh...
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800]  Sisak.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:48.800]  Yes, invaded the city of Jerusalem
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.800]  around about 980 B.C.,
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:51.800]  and he may have taken the Ark
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.800]  back to the city of Tannis
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:54.800]  and hidden it in a secret chamber
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.800]  called the Well of Souls.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.800]  Secret chamber?
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:13:59.800]  However, about a year after
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.800]  the pharaoh had returned to Egypt,
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.800]  the city of Tannis was consumed by the desert
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.800]  in a sandstorm which lasted a whole year,
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.800]  wiped clean by the wrath of God.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:12.800]  What does this Ark look like?
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:14.800]  I don't know.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800]  There's a picture of it right here.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:22.800]  That's it.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:30.800]  Good God.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:32.800]  Yes, that's just what the Hebrews thought.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.800]  What's that supposed to be coming out of there?
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:41.800]  Lightning, fire, power of God or something.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:46.800]  You don't understand Hitler's interest in it.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800]  Oh, yes.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:49.800]  The Bible speaks of the Ark leveling mountains
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.800]  and laying waste to entire regions.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:56.800]  An army which carries the Ark before it
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.800]  is invincible.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:03.800]  What is the truth?
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.800]  If you've been to Sunday School,
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.800]  you'll know that there's a Ark.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.800]  And you'll know that
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.800]  900 years before the Temple was built,
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.800]  there was a pharaoh named Shishak.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.800]  He really attacked Jerusalem
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.800]  and took away the treasures
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.800]  from the Temple and the palace.
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.800]  This is what the 14th chapter of the Book of Kings
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.800]  has told us.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.800]  The Ark's whereabouts
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:28.800]  is another big topic.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:29.800]  We won't talk about it today.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:30.800]  But anyway,
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.800]  when it comes to Tennis,
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.800]  Denis, Soin, Zouan,
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:37.800]  these cities,
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:40.800]  it's true that since 1928,
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.800]  the French archaeologists
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.800]  have been excavating.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.800]  They've been doing it for years.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.800]  In the early years,
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:50.800]  the French archaeologists
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:54.800]  thought that Soin, Zouan, and Tennis
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:58.800]  were the epicenter of the Egyptian War.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.800]  They found the remains of the dead
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:02.800]  and the stone tablets.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.800]  But now they know that it's not true.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.800]  Soin and Tennis
[00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:11.800]  are an ancient city of 1,000 years.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:15.800]  But they were built in 1070.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.800]  So it's a post-historical city.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.800]  The later books of the Bible
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:23.800]  also mention Soin and Tennis.
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:26.800]  In the 12th chapter of the 78th chapter of the Book of Psalms,
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:30.800]  it says that God was in Soin,
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.800]  the fields of Soin,
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.800]  the fields of Tennis,
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.800]  and was doing a miracle
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.800]  in front of the Pharaoh.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:40.800]  This is very important.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.800]  The 78th chapter of the Book of Psalms
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.800]  is about the plague in Egypt.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.800]  But it says that the place where the plague happened
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.800]  was Soin, not Nanset.
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.800]  So when the poet wrote this poem,
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.800]  he recalled the plague.
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:00.800]  He wrote it after 4,500 years
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.800]  after the plague.
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.800]  At that time, Nanset had already ceased to exist.
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.800]  So the poet only knew
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.800]  that the plague had happened
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:13.800]  in the city of Soin near Nanset.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.800]  But when you go back to the time of the plague,
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:19.800]  you see the details of the geography
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:22.800]  mentioning Nanset.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.800]  This town really existed at that time.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.800]  So when it was recorded,
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.800]  the reliability of history was shown.
[00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.800]  You may think it is very complicated.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:35.800]  But it is not complicated at all.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800]  It is also very simple.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.800]  For example,I have lived in Chicago for 20 years.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:42.800]  I only know the geographical location and geography
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:44.800]  of Chicago in the past 20 years.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.800]  You can ask some old Chinese here.
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:48.800]  They can tell you that
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:49.800]  40 or 50 years ago,
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.800]  the name of the restaurant in the same place
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.800]  was "Meng".
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.800]  Today we have really determined
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.800]  the location of Nanset.
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:02.800]  It is a small village in Alibaba
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.800]  called Cantia.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:08.800]  Here we find the stone wall of Nanset.
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.800]  It also has its royal name.
[00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:13.800]  There are Nanset's great soldiers on the stone wall.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.800]  They are attacking its enemies.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.800]  It is said that the Bible often mentions
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.800]  the new-made shield of the great man.
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:26.800]  It is the political idiom
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.800]  that the French used at that time.
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.800]  In Nanset,we also find
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.800]  the military horse-drawn carriage.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.800]  There are also many large stones for horse-drawn carriages.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.800]  It is estimated that the horse-drawn carriage
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.800]  can stop 500 horses
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.800]  and more than 200 chariots.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.800]   Nanset is estimated to be
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.800]  as large as 10 square kilometers.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.800]  Now it is a field.
[00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.800]  But it was the largest city in the world at that time.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:00.800]  The Egyptian Bible also contains
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.800]  many special idioms and words
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.800]  that the Egyptians used at that time.
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:10.800]  But there is no word for the Persian period.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:14.800]  On the contrary,the books written later
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:17.800]  such as the Book of Ezekiel and the Book of Nehemiah
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.800]  often contain Persian words.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:37.800]  We have just spent about 15 minutes
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.800]  to talk about the historical reality
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.800]  of the Egyptian Bible.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.800]  We don't need to doubt it.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:46.800]  Now we can see
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.800]  the Egyptian route of the Israelites.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.800]  How did God lead the Israelites to Egypt?
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.800]  They set out from Nanset.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.800]  In the 13th chapter of chapter 17,
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.800]  it is mentioned that when Pharaoh went there with his people,
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:03.800]  the roads to Philistine were narrow.
[00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:06.800]  God did not lead them where to go.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:08.800]  Because God said,
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:10.800]  "I am afraid that when the people see the battle,
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.800]  they will regret it and turn back to Egypt."
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.800]  So God led the people to go astray
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.800]  and went the way of the Red Sea.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:24.800]  Here is a road called the road to Philistine.
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:27.800]  This road was also mentioned
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.800]  in the Egyptian documents at that time.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:33.800]  The other name of Egypt is
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:36.800]  the Way of Horus.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:39.800]  It is the way of Horus, the Egyptian god.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:45.800]  The way to Philistine was the most convenient way.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:49.800]  It took a few days to reach the land of Philistine.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.800]  But the Bible says
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.800]  God did not lead the Israelites to the fastest way.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.800]  Why?
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.800]  Because God said,
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.800]  "I am afraid that when the people see the battle,
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.800]  they will regret it and turn back to Egypt."
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.800]   This is a good example.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:15.800]  On the road to the northwest of the Mediterranean,
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.800]  we found a lot of soldiers from the New Kingdom.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   More than ten soldiers.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:27.800]   There were Egyptian war horses on this road
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:29.800]  to guard the land.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.800]  It was a military stronghold.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.800]  So the Bible tells us
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:38.800]  that if the Israelites took this shortest way,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:41.800]  they would not have been well equipped
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.800]  and would not have fought well.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:47.800]  They would have regretted it and turned back to Egypt.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.800]  The way God led people to go
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:51.800]  was not necessarily the shortest and fastest.
[00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:55.800]  It was not necessarily our plan.
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.800]  Sometimes it was not even in line with the law.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:00.800]  The other way to Egypt
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:05.800]  was the way to the shore in the Bible.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.800]  This is what we saw in Genesis.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:09.800]  Do you remember the story?
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:11.800]  When Haggai went out,
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:15.800]  he walked on the way to the shore.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.800]  So the Israelites started from Lancester
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.800]  and walked to the southeast.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.800]   According to the Bible,
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.800]  they should have gone out of Egypt through the Shu'i Basin
[00:22:26.800 --> 00:22:29.800]  and then went to Galilee.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.800]  But what did the 14th chapter say?
[00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.800]   It said, "And suddenly there was a great storm.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.800]  And God commanded the Israelites to turn back."
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:41.800]  It means to go north.
[00:22:41.800 --> 00:22:45.800]  They went to the sea of ​​red.
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:48.800]  It was actually in front of the sea of ​​grass.
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:52.800]  The Israelites were afraid of the storm.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.800]  So they turned back to Egypt.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:56.800]  So they walked on the way to the south.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.800]  God suddenly called them to turn back.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.800]  Why?
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:02.800]  When they were about to go out,
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.800]  God called them to turn back.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:06.800]  What was God's will?
[00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:07.800]  In the 14th chapter, verse 3,
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:09.800]  God said, "And Pharaoh said,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:14.800]   'The Israelites were lost on the ground,
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:17.800]  and the wilderness had trapped them.'
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   In the 14th chapter,
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:22.800]  God said, "I will make Pharaoh's heart strong,
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.800]  and he will chase them.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.800]  And then I will be glorified
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.800]  in Pharaoh and his whole army."
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:33.800]  The Egyptians knew that they were in the wilderness.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.800]  So the Israelites walked on.
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:39.800]  God's command seems to be very complicated.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.800]  It's not humanly reasonable.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.800]  But what is the ultimate goal?
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:47.800]  It is to be glorified to God.
[00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:51.800]  God's purpose is not to make us feel sad and empty.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:53.800]  It's not that people think
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.800]  they are doing well and that's it.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:58.800]  God's command is needed
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.800]  to make us learn to trust Him.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   At the beginning, we said that
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:06.800]  there are many changes in life.
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:08.800]   Especially in the pandemic,
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:12.800]  we have encountered many unideal situations.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:16.800]   We all want to go to an ideal place.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   We always say that we don't like this situation,
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:20.800]  don't like this place,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.800]  don't like this context.
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:24.800]   So we want to walk away.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.800]   We think that's OK.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.800]   Of course, this is humanly reasonable.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.800]   But this story seems to tell us
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.800]  what is the most important thing in God's eyes.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:38.800]   The most important thing is not what we think.
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   Everything is fine and good.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:43.800]   In chapter 14, verse 30,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.800]   it says, "On that day, Jehovah saved the Israelites
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:49.800]  and took the hands of the Egyptians."
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:53.800]   It says that they crossed the Red Sea.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.800]   What did the Israelites see?
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:57.800]   They saw Jehovah's victory.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.800]   What did the Israelites see?
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.800]   They saw Jehovah's great deeds to the Egyptians.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.800]   They knew how to glorify Him,
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.800]   how to trust God and His divine power.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   When we encounter difficulties,
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   we think that we are leaving this unideal situation.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.800]   We are looking for an ideal place.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:28.800]   If God really wants to lead us to our ultimate goal,
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:32.800]   without disasters, without worries, without sickness,
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   we can retire and live happily,
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:41.800]   I think God is the most unsuccessful prophet.
[00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:46.800]   The most successful one should be Jehovah.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:48.800]   Because in the Egyptian Empire,
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.800]   if you put your trust in Him, you can live in peace.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:54.800]   So, you see, when the Israelites left Egypt,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   they were not able to enjoy their eternal peace.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.800]   In fact, after the Israelites left Egypt,
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.800]   they crossed the Red Sea and the Sea of ​​Grass.
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   It was a trial.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:13.800]   Because God's purpose was to prepare us
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.800]   to become a group of people who were faithful to His will.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.800]   This is the greatest blessing.
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   The greatest blessing is not that we have no disasters, no sickness,
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:25.800]   no epidemic.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:28.800]   The greatest blessing is that we can become the children of God,
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.800]   and be with Him.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:32.800]   We can be so glorious
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:36.800]   that we can become people who serve God.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:38.800]   We are now facing different disasters.
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   Whether it is an epidemic or a downturn in life,
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   we may need to ask
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:46.800]   whether we will still be loyal to God
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   after these disasters and downturns.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   We just need to be there to answer the call.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.800]   We have not learned to be more faithful to God.
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.800]   Or when we have passed the command of God,
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.800]   we will be more faithful to God.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.800]   Personally, the same is true for the Church.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:08.800]   God said, "Do not waste the path He has led us on."
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:11.800]   No matter what the disaster is,
[00:27:11.800 --> 00:27:13.800]   let us, the Church,
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.800]   be able to experience new lessons.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:16.800]   Let us, the Church,
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:20.800]   become a Church that is more in line with His will.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:22.800]   Some scholars said it was very interesting.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.800]   They said, "The main thing that God wants to do in the Exodus
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.800]   is to take Israelite out of Egypt."
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:33.800]   God did not want to take the Israelites out of Egypt.
[00:27:33.800 --> 00:27:35.800]   After they left Egypt,
[00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:39.800]   they still had a heart for Egypt.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:41.800]   They wanted to return to the Egyptian Empire
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.800]   because there was a stable and prosperous place.
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:53.800]   God wanted to take Egypt out of the Israelites
[00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   and take the Pharaoh out of Egypt
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:03.800]   and take the Pharaoh out of Egypt
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   and take away the idols
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.800]   like Moses,
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.800]   who was a prosperous man
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:11.800]   and a man of peace.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:15.800]   So that we can truly return to God
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:18.800]   and be faithful to Him
[00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:19.800]   and serve Him,
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:23.800]   and be faithful to Him
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.800]   Are we willing to do that?
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   Let God take away these idols
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.800]   and let our hearts truly return to Him.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.800]   Let us pray with our hearts.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.800]   God, we know that Your way
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.800]   and Your great command
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:43.800]   is not what we humans think.
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:44.800]   Your ultimate goal
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:49.800]   is to make our lives belong to You.
[00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:51.800]   God, we pray that You take away
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   the things we long for in our lives
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.800]   like stability and prosperity
[00:28:57.800 --> 00:29:01.800]   and the benefits that the land can give us.
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:05.800]   God, let our lives truly belong to You.
[00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:08.800]   Let You be our true Lord.
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.800]   You continue to lead our lives
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.800]   and the path ahead of us.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.800]   No matter what we are going through,
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:20.800]   let us know that the ultimate goal
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.800]   is not only to be free and carefree
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:28.800]   but to be faithful to You.
[00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:29.800]   Continue to train us,
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:30.800]   continue to help us,
[00:29:30.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   and nurture us
