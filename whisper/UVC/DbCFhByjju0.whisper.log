[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   I believe that in 1974, when Linda Stratton wrote "Sing Hallelujah to the Lord",
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   she never imagined that this song would become a song that has a political connection to the present.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   In Hong Kong, when there are police officers and government officials,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   the public surround them and sing "Sing Hallelujah to the Lord".
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Indeed, when we listen to this song,
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   the tune of this song is very calming and calming.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   When we sing this song, we can feel that there is a greater truth and peace in this world.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   In this turbulent and unstable world, everyone wants to be safe.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   This song has five verses.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   Many people sing this song, including those who do not know Jesus Christ.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   What message does this song want to convey?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Let me explain the meaning of the five verses.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   The first verse is "Sing Hallelujah to the Lord".
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   "Hallelujah" means "Praise the Lord".
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It is a praise from the bottom of the heart.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   How beautiful is God?
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   The four verses of this song give us some inspiration.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   The second verse is "Jesus is risen from the dead".
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   In the Christian faith, Jesus Christ is the Son of God.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   He died on the cross to save people.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   He saved people from being released from sin.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   When he died, he conquered death and the evil that controls people's lives.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Why do we praise the Lord?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Because God saved us from death and saved us from being released.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   So that people can have a new beginning.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   The third verse is "Jesus is Lord of heaven and earth".
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   This is a very important message.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   In the first chapter of Genesis, God created the world.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   When we understand the word "creation",
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   we understand that it is not about evolution or creation.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   For the Jews, it is very practical.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   If this world is created by our Lord,
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   it means that this world is owned by this Lord.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   If this world is owned by this Lord,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   we must obey him because he is the master of this world.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   He is the Lord of heaven and earth.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   That is, no sovereignty in the world can be greater than Jesus Christ.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   No sovereignty is greater than the Lord of heaven and earth.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   The Lord of heaven and earth reminds those who believe in the Lord that there is only one Lord in the world.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   The fourth verse is "Jesus is living in his church".
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It is true that the Bible always says that the head of the church is the Christian,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   but the body is the church.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   It means that people should see Jesus,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Jesus' goodness, Jesus' kindness, Jesus' kindness, Jesus' justice,
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   through the true believers.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Some people say, "Ask Jesus to come and see me."
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Jesus has already come to see you and me.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   He tells people through the church what is justice and what is love.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   The fifth verse is "Jesus is coming for his own".
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   When Jesus Christ created this world,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   he saw that the world was harmed by sin,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   and that the relationship between man and God was completely destroyed,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and that when people lived in sin and tears,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   God came to this world to conquer evil and death.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   He came to this world again.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   In the 21st chapter of the Book of Ecclesiastes,
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   the third and fourth verses say that God is in the world,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   and that God will be in this world again.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   There will be no more death, sorrow, and pain.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   These teachings are included in the verses.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   But what do they mean to us?
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   They give us a few meanings.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   First, when we sing this song,
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   we must remember that there is a God in heaven who loves us.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   He is not only coming to get rid of the unjust world government
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   and the unfair social system.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   Those are important.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   But most importantly, he wants you to know him,
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   so that our lives can be changed,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   so that the evil and death in our lives can be solved.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   When I was young, there was a saying that came out of my mind.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   "Every day, five or four young people visit each other."
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Every person, every regime can turn from love and hatred to evil.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Only when Jesus Christ returns to this world,
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   can we turn the world around.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   One of the ways to change our lives is to save us,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   so that we can be set free from sin,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   so that people in this world can see what love and justice are.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   So, first, he hopes that when you sing this song,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   you will not only see the problems in society,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   but also your own problems, and be willing to return to him.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   He also wants people to know that he is the true master of the world.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   All the regimes in the world,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   whether you are a democratic or an extreme right wing society,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   all have the tendency to tell us that he is the true master.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Sorry, the true master of this world is Jesus Christ.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   So, the church in this world is telling everyone in this world
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   that there is only one master in this world.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And this master invites us to live a new life of another kind of nation,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   a new life, a life of love, a life of justice,
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   a life of justice, peace and love.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   The regime is not our master.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   We are not our own masters.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   The rich are not our masters.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Only Jesus Christ is our master.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So, here is the second reminder for us.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   When we sing this song,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   we are welcoming the fact that there is a master who loves us.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   He is waiting for us.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   Finally, the church is telling people to know Jesus,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   to believe in the Christian community of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   The church on earth is telling people that there is love,
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   there is light, and it comes from Jesus Christ.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   He will ultimately rule this world,
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   and bring people back to his side once again,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   and give them true freedom.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   So, when we sing this song today,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   whether you are a Christian or not,
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I hope you will sing this song,
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   and you will see the God who commands justice and peace.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   I do not deny that God really wants us to
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   carry out justice and peace in society.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   This is important.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   But at the same time,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   he also invites you and me to walk with him.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   Our life is to be returned to him,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and our life is to be led by Jesus Christ,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   not by any regime.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   We are to be led by Jesus Christ,
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   to reveal the love of justice and peace
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   in our society,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   and to wait for him to return,
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   to show the love of justice and peace
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   to the whole world.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   You and I live every day
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   to reveal the love of justice and peace of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   I hope that at this moment,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   we can experience God's peace,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   peace, and blessings to everyone.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   [END]
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   [END]
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   [END]
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   [END]
