1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 - Well, good morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,720
 It's fantastic to be here as always.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,400
 Really grateful to be with you all

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,880
 and to worship with you this morning.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,680
 And appreciated the worship.

6
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:15,040
 Thank you, Jason.

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,600
 And I'm glad to see all of you.

8
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:20,000
 I know it's not easy to get here on a morning like this

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,800
 when it's this cold.

10
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,800
 I think, there we go.

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,480
 I know it's not easy to get here on a morning like this.

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,120
 When I woke up at my house, it was about negative eight

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:30,960
 or negative nine.

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,240
 So I know it's an effort just to get out the door

15
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,200
 and to get to church today.

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,280
 So thank you for being here.

17
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,440
 And for those that are watching online,

18
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,020
 hope that everyone is warm and safe.

19
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,240
 That's important today.

20
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,400
 Make sure that you're warm and safe

21
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:48,240
 and check on the people in your family,

22
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:49,320
 in your neighborhood,

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,120
 make sure everybody else is warm and safe as well.

24
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,000
 Since this is the beginning of the year,

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,520
 we're gonna be talking about the hope

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,600
 that we have in Christ.

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,880
 And we're gonna be looking in the book of Ephesians today.

28
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,760
 So if you wanna turn there in your Bible

29
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,800
 or in your Bible app,

30
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,520
 we're gonna be in Ephesians chapter one,

31
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,880
 verses 15 to 23,

32
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,800
 talking about the hope that we have in Christ.

33
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,880
 And in chapter one of Ephesians,

34
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,160
 this is a letter written by Paul to this church at Ephesus,

35
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,800
 this group of believers.

36
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,080
 And he starts talking in the chapter one

37
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:25,160
 about what God has done on their behalf.

38
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,720
 And he ends the chapter with this beautiful prayer for them.

39
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,820
 And I think this is really a powerful prayer

40
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,520
 for us to consider at any time,

41
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,640
 but especially as we begin the new year

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,880
 and we're thinking about some of the things we might face.

43
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,040
 So let's read these verses together.

44
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,000
 Ephesians one, beginning in verse 15,

45
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,040
 it says, "For this reason,

46
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:49,180
 "because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus

47
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:51,880
 "and your love toward all the saints,

48
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:54,300
 "I do not cease to give thanks for you,

49
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,560
 "remembering you in my prayers,

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,580
 "that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ,

51
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,920
 "the Father of glory, may give you the spirit of wisdom

52
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,380
 "and of revelation in the knowledge of him,

53
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,400
 "having the eyes of your hearts enlightened,

54
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,700
 "that you may know what is the hope

55
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,140
 "to which he has called you.

56
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,960
 "What are the riches of his glorious inheritance

57
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,900
 "in the saints?

58
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,160
 "And what is the immeasurable greatness of his power

59
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:22,940
 "toward us who believe,

60
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,320
 "according to the working of his great might,

61
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,240
 "that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead

62
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,120
 "and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,400
 "far above all rule and authority and power and dominion,

64
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,600
 "and above every name that is named,

65
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,600
 "not only in this age, but also in the one to come.

66
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,520
 "And he put all things under his feet

67
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,980
 "and gave him as head over all things to the church,

68
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,960
 "which is his body, the fullness of him

69
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,260
 "who fills all in all."

70
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,840
 God, thank you for your word, thank you for your truth,

71
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,480
 thank you for the hope that we have in you,

72
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:01,520
 and I pray that our hearts would be

73
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,040
 filled with that this morning as we look at your word,

74
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,720
 and I pray that as we consider this year that is to come

75
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,960
 and what you might have for us,

76
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,920
 the joys as well as the adversity,

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,680
 that we would be filled with hope

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:18,760
 knowing that you are at work in our lives,

79
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,640
 and that you have grace that's sufficient

80
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,840
 for anything that we're gonna face this year, God.

81
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,720
 In Jesus' name, amen.

82
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,240
 I wanna remind us of a story, this is in Mark chapter two,

83
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,500
 the beginning of Mark chapter two,

84
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:38,320
 there's a man who is paralyzed, he's unable to walk,

85
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:42,960
 and this man has four friends

86
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:47,960
 who want him to be healed, want him to be made whole.

87
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,040
 And apparently one of them, or maybe all of them,

88
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,840
 we don't know, it's not clear from the story,

89
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,720
 but somebody in the story, one of his friends,

90
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,720
 had heard about this itinerant rabbi, this teacher,

91
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,960
 who was teaching and who was also healing people.

92
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:10,920
 And so these four friends get together,

93
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,360
 and they take this man who's unable to walk,

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,160
 and they say, "We're gonna take our friend to see

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,140
 "this teacher, this healer."

96
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,020
 And they go and they find out where Jesus is at that time.

97
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,640
 They go and he's teaching in this house,

98
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:29,320
 probably not a real big house.

99
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,200
 They get there, they've carried their friend all the way

100
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,920
 to bring him to Jesus.

101
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,420
 They get there and the house is so full

102
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,880
 that there's no way they can get in.

103
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:43,880
 And scripture tells us that even the doorway is blocked.

104
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,560
 They can't get in at all.

105
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,200
 But they're not deterred by that.

106
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:51,200
 They say, "We really want our friend

107
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,580
 "to be able to encounter Jesus and to be able to have

108
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:01,580
 "this time with Jesus because we believe, we hope,

109
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:04,420
 "we have faith that Jesus can heal our friend."

110
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:09,640
 And so they find a way up onto the roof of the house.

111
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:14,640
 They somehow make a hole in the roof.

112
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,560
 We don't know if it was a mud house

113
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,560
 and they actually tore tiles off of the roof

114
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,240
 or it was more of a thatched roof and they just opened it up

115
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,200
 but that's not real clear.

116
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,280
 But they make a hole in the roof

117
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,000
 and lower their friend down through the roof.

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,520
 And then Jesus ends up healing their friend.

119
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:35,320
 We're probably familiar with that story.

120
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,600
 Maybe you've heard it in church before.

121
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,840
 Maybe you heard it in Sunday school

122
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,200
 when you were a little kid.

123
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,760
 'Cause it's an amazing story.

124
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,960
 But what I want us to think about in that story today

125
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,360
 is those friends and the motivation,

126
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,960
 the hope that they had in order to take their friend

127
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,480
 who couldn't walk and say, "We're gonna get up this morning

128
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,620
 "and we're gonna take this person.

129
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,720
 "We're gonna go find this teacher that we've heard about

130
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,520
 "and we're not gonna be deterred by any obstacle."

131
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,760
 And when they got there and there was too many people

132
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,880
 and people said, "There's no way you can't even get in.

133
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,600
 "The door's blocked."

134
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,560
 They didn't say, "Well, I guess we'll just go back home."

135
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:14,240
 They said, "No, we're gonna find a way."

136
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:17,480
 And however it happened, they end up on the roof

137
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,540
 and they tear this hole in the roof

138
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,140
 and lower their friend down.

139
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,000
 And then what happens?

140
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,880
 Their friend is healed and he's able to walk.

141
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,280
 He's healed by Jesus.

142
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,480
 And that story reminds us of how important hope is

143
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:34,580
 in our lives, how it propels us forward.

144
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,580
 Without hope, we struggle to move forward.

145
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,580
 We say, "Well, I don't see why I should go forward.

146
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,420
 "What's the point?

147
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,000
 "It's not gonna work, nothing's gonna happen."

148
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,960
 But when we have hope in the work that God is doing,

149
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,480
 it propels us forward.

150
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,740
 And that's a great consideration for us

151
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,360
 at the start of a new year.

152
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,680
 All of us are probably thinking about some things

153
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:03,320
 that are in our life during 2024.

154
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,940
 Maybe we're reflecting on some things

155
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,220
 that were in our life during 2023.

156
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:10,800
 Hopefully we have some prayers, some desires

157
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,560
 that we're asking God for and we're considering.

158
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,200
 And all of us know that this year is gonna hold some things

159
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,600
 that we are fully unaware of

160
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,640
 and unprepared for at this point, right?

161
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:29,760
 I remember January of 2020, right here in this room,

162
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,560
 having conversations with Pastor Mark

163
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,760
 about what was gonna happen.

164
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,500
 At that point, there were no,

165
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,520
 the lockdowns hadn't started in Chicago yet.

166
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,900
 It was just, things were just starting here.

167
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,740
 Obviously, we had no idea what 2020 was gonna hold

168
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,200
 and the adversity and the challenges

169
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,320
 that it was gonna hold for so many people.

170
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:56,740
 Hopefully this year doesn't have anything like that for us.

171
00:07:56,740 --> 00:08:00,480
 But still, there are things ahead that we don't know about.

172
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,820
 Some of them are joyful things.

173
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:04,960
 Some of them are really, could be challenging things

174
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,200
 in this year for us.

175
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,200
 And we need to have hope in God's work in our lives.

176
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,760
 And one of the things that I see in this prayer of Paul

177
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,840
 in Ephesians 1 that's really beautiful

178
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,400
 is he's letting these believers know,

179
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,200
 he's saying, "Hey, the climb ahead of you is steep,

180
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,060
 "but have hope because God has given you

181
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,080
 "all that you need in Christ."

182
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,160
 Now, I wanna just do a quick flyover

183
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,300
 of the book of Ephesians and the things

184
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,560
 that he's talking about.

185
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,060
 There's a lot of big issues in this letter.

186
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,660
 So in chapter two, he starts talking

187
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:43,940
 about unity in the church.

188
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,360
 That's a big issue.

189
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,760
 That's a challenging thing, to stay unified

190
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:48,920
 as the people of God.

191
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,700
 He talks about how God has brought us

192
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,360
 from this spiritual state of alienation

193
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,900
 and being separated from God into reconciliation.

194
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,000
 That's huge, that's cosmic, right?

195
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,560
 To go from separation from God into reconciliation.

196
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,960
 In chapter three, he talks about the mystery

197
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,640
 of the gospel, how God's brought us

198
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,280
 from spiritual darkness into understanding.

199
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,840
 In chapter four, he talks about the new life

200
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,440
 we have in Christ, how we're to put off

201
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,460
 the old self and put on the new self.

202
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:20,660
 Well, again, how do we even comprehend that,

203
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,320
 much less live it out?

204
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,200
 These are big things that he's gonna be putting

205
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,660
 in front of this group of believers.

206
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,880
 In chapter five, he talks about how we're supposed

207
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,020
 to walk in love in our family relationships,

208
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,280
 in the practical relationships of our lives.

209
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:36,500
 In chapter six, he talks more about relationships

210
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,380
 and spiritual warfare and the armor of God.

211
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,960
 The point I'm making here is that this letter

212
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:47,160
 is full of really heavy topics and really big things

213
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,200
 and things that, as a Christian, we say,

214
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,220
 wow, how is this possible?

215
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,240
 God, how could I ever live this out?

216
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,520
 How could I ever see these things happen in my life?

217
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,540
 How could I be transformed in this way?

218
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:01,420
 How could I be brought from darkness to light?

219
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:04,860
 These are really big things.

220
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:08,440
 The climb is steep, and that's what Paul is letting us know.

221
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,600
 That's why this prayer is in the beginning of,

222
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,400
 it's in the first chapter, it's in the beginning

223
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,680
 of the letter, he's saying, listen,

224
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,800
 there's some tough stuff ahead of you.

225
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:17,920
 It's not gonna be easy.

226
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,160
 God's called you to something big and something important

227
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,080
 and something significant, and it's not gonna be simple

228
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,840
 or easy, but you can have hope because God's given you

229
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,540
 everything you need in Christ.

230
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:32,460
 And that's a really beautiful message for us.

231
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,620
 We need to know that.

232
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:36,720
 We need to know that as we look forward in our own lives

233
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,660
 into this year and into our future, and we say,

234
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,580
 hey, there's probably gonna be some challenging things.

235
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:44,420
 Some of us may be sitting here already knowing

236
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,300
 what some of those are.

237
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,260
 We may say, okay, I already know that there's some things

238
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:51,980
 coming up in my life, in relationships that I have

239
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,940
 that are gonna be challenging, or in my workplace,

240
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:57,780
 and it's gonna be really tough, or in my school,

241
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,700
 or in some decision I have to make,

242
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,460
 and it's not gonna be easy.

243
00:11:02,460 --> 00:11:05,140
 Maybe we already know what some of those things are.

244
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,300
 Maybe we don't know.

245
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,380
 Maybe they're gonna hit us in a few months.

246
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,600
 Or maybe for some of us, those are these things

247
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,580
 that we see in the book of Ephesians.

248
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,220
 We're saying, I want to be transformed.

249
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:16,380
 I wanna be more like Christ.

250
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,020
 I want God to use me more in the lives of others.

251
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,740
 I wanna grow as a disciple maker.

252
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:23,420
 I wanna grow in my service to God in the church,

253
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:26,380
 and I know myself, and I know that that's not

254
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,220
 gonna be easy.

255
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:31,620
 And as we think about those challenges,

256
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,500
 and the fact that the climb is steep,

257
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:37,940
 we can have hope because we have the power of Christ.

258
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,700
 This prayer is prayed over people who are facing

259
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,780
 a lot of challenges, and they need to know

260
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,980
 the hope that they have.

261
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,820
 And this prayer isn't just, it's a pep talk,

262
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,740
 but it's more than a pep talk,

263
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,780
 because it has spiritual power.

264
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,580
 He's not just saying, hey guys, let's think positive,

265
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,780
 and I'm gonna tell you some stuff to make you feel good.

266
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,180
 It's more than that.

267
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,820
 He is encouraging them, but he's also saying,

268
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,860
 God is at work through the power of the Holy Spirit

269
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:07,900
 in your lives in a supernatural way,

270
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,220
 and God will carry you through these things.

271
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,060
 Look at what he says.

272
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:15,380
 He says that you may know what is the hope

273
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,940
 to which he has called you.

274
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,700
 What are the riches of his glorious inheritance

275
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:23,260
 in the saints, and what is the immeasurable greatness

276
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:25,700
 of his power toward us who believe

277
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:28,740
 according to the working of his great might?

278
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:32,660
 That's the hope that we have.

279
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:38,180
 Our hope is in the gospel, the good news of transformation

280
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,900
 by grace through faith in Christ.

281
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,980
 Our hope is in the power of God.

282
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,940
 And this is, we need to understand

283
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,860
 that this power is God's power.

284
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:49,740
 It's given to us as his people through Christ

285
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,860
 and by the Holy Spirit, but it's God's power.

286
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,100
 It's power, as he says here in verse 19,

287
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:00,900
 beyond measurement, it's power beyond comprehension.

288
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:04,140
 This is the power of God the Father,

289
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,700
 the King of the universe, the creator who made us

290
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,780
 and everything that we see in the entire universe.

291
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,660
 And sometimes we need to be reminded of that.

292
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,340
 As we face challenges in our lives,

293
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,820
 and we say, these are big challenges,

294
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:18,820
 this is a big deal, I don't know how I'm gonna

295
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:21,540
 get through this, and it seems like there's no way out,

296
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,820
 and this situation seems impossible,

297
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,860
 we need to be reminded that we're not just trusting

298
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,780
 in a God who can kinda work things out,

299
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,740
 or who is a good negotiator.

300
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:36,820
 That's not the God that we're trusting in.

301
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:39,980
 We're trusting in the God who has absolute power

302
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,380
 over everything in our life and in the universe,

303
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:48,000
 the God who created it all, and the God who loves us.

304
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,180
 And so we have a sure hope, as the scripture says,

305
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:54,960
 we have something that is not gonna change,

306
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:59,020
 it's not gonna fade away, it's not gonna evaporate,

307
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:01,820
 because we're trusting in the power of God.

308
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:04,040
 And Paul reminds us of this in the next verse.

309
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,020
 In verse 20, he goes on to say that he worked in Christ

310
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,780
 when he raised him from the dead and seated him

311
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:11,140
 at his right hand in the heavenly places,

312
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,020
 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion,

313
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,540
 and above every name that is named,

314
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:18,460
 not only in this age, but also in the one to come.

315
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:22,620
 Paul's reminding us, hey, you have this power,

316
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,620
 and these immeasurable riches of grace

317
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,380
 that are given to you by God.

318
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,380
 What God?

319
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:30,320
 The God of the universe, the creator God,

320
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,780
 the God who raised Jesus from the dead,

321
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:35,520
 the resurrection power of Christ,

322
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,920
 is at work in our lives as believers,

323
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,900
 and we need to understand that.

324
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,860
 This is not a small thing.

325
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,080
 This is the same God, the same power

326
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,300
 that raised Jesus from the dead

327
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:50,420
 that is at work in our lives.

328
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,940
 It's an eternal power.

329
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:57,820
 And this power is fully vested in Jesus Christ

330
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,380
 as the son of God, but through the Holy Spirit,

331
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,500
 it's at work in us as well.

332
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,080
 It's not something that we take hold of

333
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:11,080
 and we use for our own purposes.

334
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,760
 It is God using it for his purposes through us,

335
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,820
 but we can have confidence in that.

336
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,600
 Not a confidence where we believe in ourselves

337
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,540
 and say, well, I know my year's gonna be great.

338
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,920
 I know things are gonna go well for me

339
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,800
 because I'm really confident in myself,

340
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,720
 and I'm gonna do such a great job

341
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,320
 of navigating all these challenges.

342
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,700
 No, it's a confidence in Christ where we say,

343
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,720
 you know what?

344
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,880
 I know my year's gonna be challenging,

345
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,260
 and I know I'll probably make some mistakes,

346
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,040
 but God is at work in my life through the power of Christ.

347
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,840
 His grace is gonna be at work even when I mess up,

348
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,040
 even in my relationships or my workplace

349
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:55,320
 or whatever other area of challenge I have.

350
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,860
 Even when I make a mistake, God's grace is at work.

351
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:01,320
 God has the power to heal.

352
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:04,720
 God has the power to redeem even my mistakes.

353
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,120
 God has the power to change people's minds.

354
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,520
 God has the power to work in situations,

355
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:12,480
 and so I can have confidence in God's work

356
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,000
 in my life this year,

357
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,920
 and peace and comfort that comes along with that confidence,

358
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,280
 not because of me, but because of Christ,

359
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,440
 because of my relationship to him.

360
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:26,000
 We can believe in him and believe in the power of God

361
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,700
 at work in our lives.

362
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,500
 One of the things we see here is that this power

363
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,080
 is for God's glory, it's not for ours.

364
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,920
 This prayer is so beautiful,

365
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,600
 and it's there to encourage us as believers,

366
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,840
 but it's not centered on us.

367
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,920
 It's centered on God.

368
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,620
 God doesn't just empower us for our own purposes

369
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,280
 so that we can say, okay, now I can go out

370
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,960
 and achieve my objectives in life,

371
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:55,960
 and that's what it's about.

372
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,320
 God gave me power so I can do what I want.

373
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,480
 That's not what the scripture teaches us.

374
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,000
 That's not the gospel.

375
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,460
 The gospel is that God has his objectives.

376
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,080
 He's at work in our world.

377
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,000
 He's at work in our life,

378
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,360
 and as we align with him in obedience,

379
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:14,040
 his power flows through us,

380
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,880
 but it's to achieve God's objectives, God's purposes,

381
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,300
 not just our own.

382
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,720
 Now, the beautiful thing about that is that

383
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
 our God is a God of love.

384
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,080
 The scripture's clear about that as well,

385
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:30,120
 and so as we are walking with God

386
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,640
 and we're living in obedience to him,

387
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,940
 he's going to bring goodness and blessing

388
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,940
 and joy into our lives because he's a God of love,

389
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:41,860
 but we need to understand that ultimately,

390
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:45,480
 the glory is his and the power is his.

391
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,480
 It's not mine, and we see that in these verses

392
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:53,240
 when he talks about what the power of God

393
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,200
 at work through Christ, it's all centered on Jesus.

394
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,400
 It's all centered on him.

395
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,440
 Far above all rule, verse 21,

396
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,120
 in authority and power and dominion,

397
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,760
 and above every name that is named,

398
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,160
 not only in this age, but also in the one to come.

399
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,240
 Whose name is above every name that is named?

400
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,160
 Jesus.

401
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,480
 That's, it's centered on him.

402
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:14,000
 22, he put all things under his feet

403
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,240
 and gave him as head over all things to the church,

404
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,520
 which is his body, the fullness of him

405
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,060
 who fills all in all.

406
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:23,840
 We see Christ at work in us, the body, the church.

407
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,280
 He's filling all of us with his fullness,

408
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,760
 but it's all centered on him.

409
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,600
 It's not about drawing attention to ourselves.

410
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,620
 It's not about exalting ourselves.

411
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:38,320
 And the mission that we have in life

412
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:41,600
 is for us to know him and experience his shalom,

413
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,600
 his peace, his wholeness, his health, his blessing

414
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,520
 as we live in right relationship with him and one another.

415
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,020
 And for us to make disciples.

416
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,480
 That's the mission that we have in the church.

417
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,120
 Well, that's not an easy thing.

418
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:56,980
 How does that happen?

419
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:00,400
 It happens as we align with what God is doing in our lives,

420
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,040
 as we live in obedience to him

421
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,520
 and his power flows through us.

422
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,160
 And then we see those things begin to take place.

423
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,480
 We begin to live a life that's defined by love for others

424
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,480
 and compassion and defined by holiness and righteousness

425
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,080
 and defined by service to others

426
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,700
 in the community of the church.

427
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:21,820
 And all these things that we want to see take place,

428
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,880
 those things take place as God's power

429
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,540
 begins to work through us.

430
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,500
 And it's for his glory.

431
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,560
 The other thing that we really see in this passage

432
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:38,400
 is that Paul is trying to help us understand our identity

433
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,360
 so that we can live out the mission God has for us.

434
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:46,280
 If we're gonna have hope for the future,

435
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:48,700
 a part of that is understanding who we are.

436
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,200
 And I love that in this passage,

437
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,520
 Paul is really focused on our identity.

438
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,400
 He's not focused on the forms of what we're doing.

439
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,040
 Now, here's what I mean by that.

440
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,720
 Paul is praying for this church,

441
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,220
 this small group of believers

442
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,440
 who are facing a lot of challenges.

443
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,560
 And if we went back into the background of Ephesus,

444
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,720
 we could explore that further, right?

445
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,340
 They're in this very secular city

446
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,560
 that is known throughout the known world

447
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,360
 as one of the largest and most important centers

448
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:23,360
 of the kind of European Roman Empire there at the time.

449
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,480
 And it's known throughout that area for its idol worship.

450
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,440
 It's known throughout that area for its secularism,

451
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,880
 we would say, and its paganism, right?

452
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,880
 So this is the background of where they live.

453
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,120
 So obviously, they're facing all kinds of challenges,

454
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,220
 both in their personal lives,

455
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,040
 but also in their life as a church

456
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:45,480
 in order to be disciples together and make disciples

457
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,760
 and help people know Jesus.

458
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,200
 They've got this really steep climb ahead of them

459
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
 as we talked about earlier.

460
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,460
 And what does Paul pray for them?

461
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,660
 Look at what he prays.

462
00:20:54,660 --> 00:21:00,200
 He doesn't pray for the forms of ministry or lifestyle.

463
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,340
 He doesn't say, "Church of Ephesus,

464
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,300
 "I'm praying that you guys

465
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,680
 "would really have an effective ministry,

466
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,380
 "and you'd learn how to start a great men's ministry

467
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:12,680
 "or a great women's ministry,

468
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,880
 "or you'd learn to do great work with kids,

469
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,880
 "or you'd learn to really have strong marriages,

470
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,380
 "or that you would learn how to

471
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,920
 "make great financial decisions,

472
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:26,640
 "or that you would all be successful in your jobs."

473
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,740
 That's what's important, right?

474
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,960
 All those practical things.

475
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,560
 But he doesn't pray any of that.

476
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:37,740
 He's pointing them towards their identity in Christ.

477
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,880
 He's praying that they'll be full of hope

478
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,580
 because they know who they are in Christ

479
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,360
 and the power that they have.

480
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,500
 Not that they'll have great programs or lots of money,

481
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,420
 or even be really effective

482
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,500
 in what they're trying to do.

483
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,660
 I think that's really huge for us.

484
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,900
 When we think about God's work in our life,

485
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,220
 and we look forward to this year,

486
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,660
 and we say, "Okay, here's some of the things

487
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,480
 "that I'm praying for."

488
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,700
 That's great.

489
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,220
 All those practical things are important,

490
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:04,060
 and God loves you,

491
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,500
 and he cares about those things in your life,

492
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,260
 and he's engaged in those things,

493
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:11,340
 in your job, and in the needs that you have,

494
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,360
 and in those relationships.

495
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:13,860
 God's engaged in all those things.

496
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,100
 They're important to God.

497
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:20,140
 But the most primary thing for you

498
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:22,900
 to be healthy in all the other stuff

499
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,060
 is to know who you are in Christ,

500
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,700
 and to walk in that.

501
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,060
 And that's why Paul prays this,

502
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,020
 because he knows for this little church,

503
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,800
 this group of believers,

504
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,180
 maybe it was big.

505
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,560
 I don't really know how many people were there.

506
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,020
 But for this group of exiles,

507
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:40,120
 we'll say it that way,

508
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:45,660
 I want us to understand that they were facing challenges,

509
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,660
 whether there was a lot of them or a few of them.

510
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,060
 They were in a difficult place.

511
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:53,420
 And for this group of exiles in a very difficult place,

512
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,660
 what does he pray?

513
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,500
 He prays that they'll know who they are in Christ,

514
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,380
 and know what they have in Christ.

515
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,220
 Because he believes,

516
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,140
 I think the reason he prays this

517
00:23:03,140 --> 00:23:04,820
 is because he believes

518
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,420
 that if they know who they are in Christ,

519
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,940
 and what they have in Christ,

520
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:10,700
 then everything else gets fixed, right?

521
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,520
 Then they begin to have healthy marriages,

522
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,620
 and they begin to be effective

523
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,620
 in the ministry they're doing,

524
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,860
 and they begin to effectively make disciples

525
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:18,700
 with their neighbors,

526
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,060
 and they begin to truly love others,

527
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,220
 and serve in their community,

528
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,740
 and all that other stuff,

529
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,700
 the practical stuff that he could've prayed for them,

530
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,780
 he doesn't pray that,

531
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,500
 because he knows if they get this,

532
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,340
 then the rest of it falls into place.

533
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:38,420
 Like Jesus, who told us to seek first the kingdom of God,

534
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,660
 and his righteousness,

535
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:44,400
 and everything else will be added to us in Matthew 6:33.

536
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:49,580
 I think that this prayer has a very similar theme to it.

537
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:51,980
 Paul's saying if you will know who you are in Christ,

538
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,260
 and know the hope that you have in him,

539
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:58,740
 then the rest of this stuff will sort out,

540
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:02,180
 and God will be at work in those areas of your life.

541
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:05,540
 And so I think that's a powerful consideration for us

542
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,360
 at the beginning of this year.

543
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,100
 As we think about all those specific

544
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,220
 and practical challenges,

545
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,900
 again, nothing wrong with thinking about those things,

546
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,580
 and nothing wrong with asking God

547
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,820
 to be active in those things.

548
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,140
 That's important, God loves you,

549
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,540
 he wants to be at work in those parts of your life.

550
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,860
 But the thing that we need most

551
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,380
 is to know who we are in Christ,

552
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:27,540
 and to be really secure in that identity,

553
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:31,380
 and to be really focused on living into that.

554
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,820
 And if we're doing that,

555
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,160
 then those other areas,

556
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,300
 God is gonna be at work,

557
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,200
 and they're gonna get sorted out.

558
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,860
 And that's what's happening here.

559
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,660
 Paul is praying that these believers

560
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,580
 would walk in the hope of God's work,

561
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,060
 and God's power in and through them,

562
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,700
 as they seek to know and experience him.

563
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:55,060
 Walk in that hope as they seek to share the good news,

564
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:59,140
 and make disciples in their very broken and hostile world.

565
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,740
 And that's true for us as well.

566
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:05,500
 We need to walk in that hope

567
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,780
 of God's work and power in and through us.

568
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,620
 Walk in the hope that we belong to Christ,

569
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,500
 that we're forgiven, that his grace covers us,

570
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,620
 that we are being transformed by him,

571
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,180
 that during 2024 we're gonna be able to seek him,

572
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,740
 and know him more, and obey him more,

573
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:26,080
 and become more like Christ.

574
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,920
 Walk in that hope.

575
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,940
 And as we seek to share the love of Christ with others,

576
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,860
 and share the good news,

577
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:35,260
 and make disciples in our broken and hostile world,

578
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,620
 God's power is gonna be at work through us.

579
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,820
 Walk in that hope.

580
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,180
 We need to know the hope that we have.

581
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:49,060
 Verse 18, "Having the eyes of your hearts enlightened,

582
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,440
 "that you may know what is the hope

583
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
 "to which he has called you.

584
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,160
 "What are the riches of his glorious inheritance

585
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,620
 "in the saints?

586
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,980
 "And what is the immeasurable greatness

587
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,700
 "of his power toward us,

588
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,160
 "who believe, according to the working of his great might,

589
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,740
 "that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead,

590
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:06,180
 "and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places?"

591
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,020
 That's the hope that we are called to walk in as well.

592
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,920
 And I would just encourage us,

593
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:16,260
 as we think about that,

594
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,580
 that walking in that hope

595
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:21,260
 allows us to have peace,

596
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,740
 it allows us to have security,

597
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,460
 and it also allows us to be prepared

598
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,980
 for whatever's in our future.

599
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,620
 All those things that we don't know about,

600
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:32,100
 that will come in 2024 and beyond.

601
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,980
 I remember, today's the 14th,

602
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,780
 so tomorrow, the 15th,

603
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,060
 is kind of a special anniversary for me,

604
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:47,380
 'cause we moved to Chicago on January 15th,

605
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,940
 as of tomorrow, 10 years ago,

606
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,380
 so when we moved here.

607
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,420
 And our family came,

608
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,780
 we just had these two at the time,

609
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,100
 our other three were born here,

610
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,500
 and we didn't grow up here,

611
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,920
 we were coming here from a state pretty far away,

612
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,500
 that's further south than the United States,

613
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,300
 so we were not used to these winters.

614
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:12,100
 And when we got here, it was very cold.

615
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,980
 We moved into an apartment,

616
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,900
 sight unseen, we had just found it on Craigslist,

617
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,060
 which was a thing back then,

618
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:20,860
 I know no one uses Craigslist anymore,

619
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:23,300
 but back then, people used to use Craigslist.

620
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,100
 And we found an apartment,

621
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,200
 and signed a lease,

622
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,300
 and pulled up in a big van with all of our stuff,

623
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:32,300
 and that was the first time we had actually seen it,

624
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,900
 other than the pictures,

625
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,200
 and went up the stairs.

626
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,580
 And we moved here,

627
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:40,820
 'cause we felt like God called us here to do ministry,

628
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,260
 so we were just trying to respond in obedience

629
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:45,020
 to what God was doing in our lives.

630
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:50,020
 And we did, all those things hit us right in the face,

631
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:51,340
 just the reality of being in the city,

632
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:53,440
 we hadn't lived in a city this big,

633
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,000
 but also the place we were living,

634
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,940
 and all the challenges of it.

635
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:58,180
 I mean, from the very first day,

636
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,500
 it was just all right there, and the cold.

637
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,980
 There was like a record-breaking,

638
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,900
 not record-breaking,

639
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:09,620
 but one of the top five snowstorms in Chicago history,

640
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,660
 I think, was about a week after that,

641
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,560
 snowed like 20 inches.

642
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,540
 And I remember just being like, what's happening?

643
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,060
 (laughing)

644
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:19,560
 And it was also a very cold winter,

645
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:22,020
 it was one of the winters when like 97% of the lake

646
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,780
 was frozen, and nothing thawed out

647
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,660
 until the third week of April.

648
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:31,300
 So it was just a shock to our system in so many ways.

649
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:35,300
 But like I said, we were just trying to obey the Lord.

650
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:39,620
 And I can honestly say that my wife and I had no idea

651
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,020
 (laughing)

652
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,820
 the things that we would encounter

653
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,620
 over the next 10 years in our life.

654
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,740
 A lot of joyful and beautiful things

655
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,320
 that we've gotten to experience,

656
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,820
 but a lot of really challenging things as well.

657
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,900
 Challenging things for my wife and I,

658
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:57,040
 challenging things in the life of our family,

659
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:59,900
 but very challenging things in ministry

660
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,660
 that were ahead for us.

661
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:10,220
 The thing that propelled us forward 10 years ago

662
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:15,420
 and still does today is this, the hope that we have in Christ.

663
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:20,660
 If it wasn't for that, there's no way I would have made it.

664
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:22,500
 No way I would have made it.

665
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:26,060
 A lot of people that I met at the time

666
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,360
 thought my wife and I were crazy for even trying,

667
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,060
 and we were.

668
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:33,100
 From an earthly perspective, it didn't make sense

669
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,580
 what God had called us to do.

670
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,100
 It really didn't make sense.

671
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,340
 And there's still plenty of days now

672
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,780
 when it doesn't make sense.

673
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:45,940
 But we have hope because of the God that we serve,

674
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:49,540
 the God who loves us, and because of the power of God

675
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,100
 that's in work in our lives through Christ.

676
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:56,500
 And that's true for each one of us in this room,

677
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,440
 for each one of us who's watching today.

678
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:01,480
 If you know Jesus and you have relationship with him,

679
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,360
 as you look forward in your life, you say,

680
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,240
 "Hey, I wanna obey.

681
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,980
 "And if I'm honest, I have no idea what that means

682
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:13,060
 "over the next two years or five years or 10 years,

683
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,420
 "or even over the next one year.

684
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,140
 "I have no idea what it means for me to walk with Jesus

685
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:20,300
 "and try to surrender to him and do what he has for me.

686
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:23,580
 "And there's probably stuff that I'm not prepared for,

687
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,500
 "and that if I knew about it now,

688
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,140
 "I would not wanna go forward."

689
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,300
 (laughs)

690
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,000
 Definitely some of those things in our life,

691
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,480
 that if we had known 10 years ago

692
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,920
 what we were gonna experience,

693
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:37,600
 we would've had some serious second thoughts.

694
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:43,220
 But we have this hope, and we need to know that hope,

695
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:46,420
 this hope that Paul prays over the Ephesian believers

696
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,580
 of the immeasurable riches of the grace of Christ.

697
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,940
 It work in us, and it pushes us forward,

698
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,100
 it propels us forward.

699
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,260
 Even when we encounter adversity and challenges,

700
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:00,980
 to know that God's power, the resurrection power,

701
00:31:00,980 --> 00:31:04,540
 is at work in our lives through Christ,

702
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:07,660
 and that he has blessing and goodness

703
00:31:07,660 --> 00:31:11,580
 and protection and peace even in those difficult times,

704
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:14,300
 and that he's at work, and that he's gonna use us,

705
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,420
 if we'll be obedient to him, he's gonna use us

706
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,700
 for his glory, and it will also be for our good

707
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,540
 because of his great love for us.

708
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,380
 That's the hope that we have, and that's the hope

709
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:27,540
 that as we start this year, I pray that we know

710
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,220
 and rejoice in that hope.

711
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,060
 Let's pray.

712
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:36,860
 God, I thank you for the hope that you give us,

713
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:40,500
 and God, I just pray over everyone in this room right now,

714
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,620
 and anyone who's watching online, God,

715
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:48,540
 I know that there are a lot of challenges

716
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:51,540
 and a lot of questions in this room,

717
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,700
 and a lot of things that we look at in our lives

718
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,420
 that maybe are happening right now,

719
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:00,260
 or maybe they're happening in the weeks and months to come,

720
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,500
 things that we look at and we say,

721
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:06,420
 God, we don't understand, we don't know how to navigate this.

722
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,540
 We see the brokenness of our world,

723
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,820
 we see the struggles in our own lives,

724
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,320
 and yet, God, there is such great hope in you.

725
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,940
 There is such great hope in the immeasurable riches

726
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,380
 of Christ that have been given to us by grace.

727
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:27,820
 So God, I pray that we would know that.

728
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,980
 We would know the hope that we have,

729
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:33,300
 and that it would propel us forward with strength

730
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,860
 and with confidence in you and with joy

731
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,980
 into whatever you have for us this year,

732
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,000
 into walking more deeply with you,

733
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,460
 into serving you in a deeper way than we ever have,

734
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,780
 into loving you and seeking you and knowing you

735
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,900
 more than we ever have in the past,

736
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,020
 into loving the people around us

737
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,940
 deeper than we ever have in the past.

738
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,780
 God, I pray that that hope would really propel us forward

739
00:32:57,780 --> 00:33:00,420
 into what you have in our lives this year.

740
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,280
 In Jesus' name, amen.

741
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:12,280
