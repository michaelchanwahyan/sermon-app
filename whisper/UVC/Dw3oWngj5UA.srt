1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,980
 Okay, our colleges are closed, okay?

2
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,820
 All right, let's see, how about next month?

3
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,800
 Any important dates next month, November?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,940
 Thanksgiving, yes, Thanksgiving.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:14,660
 So we're coming to the end of the year.

6
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,300
 In fact, as we are talking about this series

7
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,520
 on faith and time, think about how you use your time.

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,280
 What are the important reminders in our time,

9
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:27,900
 in our calendar?

10
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,600
 And we're talking about the Feast of Tabernacle, right?

11
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,760
 The Feast of Tabernacle, we talk about in biblical times,

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,280
 in the Old Testament or in the New Testament.

13
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:38,340
 It's a very important date.

14
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:39,180
 In fact,

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,980
 today,

16
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:45,520
 after sundown, Sukkot begins.

17
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,820
 Sukkot, I know, we in United States,

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,700
 so we are not really, we don't really care, right?

19
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,940
 So I flew to, last week I flew to

20
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,040
 this Midwestern seminary,

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:02,960
 and I was going through one of my seminars.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,200
 So I flew back last Friday,

23
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:09,280
 or Thursday, actually, Thursday evening.

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,720
 So I got off the plane, in Midway Airport, if you remember,

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,860
 from the gate all the way to the baggage claim,

26
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,260
 there's quite a walk, right?

27
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:20,580
 Five to seven minutes or 10 minutes,

28
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,640
 depends on how fast you walk.

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,480
 But I met, I came across a couple,

30
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,200
 they were in black and white,

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,000
 and they were holding something, some plants in their hands.

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,520
 And then I said, "Happy Sukkot,"

33
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,720
 because they're a Jewish couple.

34
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,380
 They are heading to probably Skokie

35
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,760
 or some other Jewish community in the city of Chicago.

36
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,780
 So, hey, there you go, I saw them,

37
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,840
 "Hey, you know, Sukkot," right?

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,160
 So, happy Sukkot.

39
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:53,460
 So sundown today begins the Sukkot for seven days.

40
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:56,800
 So tomorrow is the first day of the Feast of Tap Neckles.

41
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,800
 So we will take some time to examine

42
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,000
 some of the passages in the Bible.

43
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,280
 Remember I said in the Old Testament,

44
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,940
 as well as in Jesus' time,

45
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:09,900
 there are three main festivals

46
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,140
 to remind the people of God, the grace of God.

47
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,800
 The Passover, around what month?

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,580
 In our calendar.

49
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,660
 Yeah, April, yeah, you're right.

50
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,400
 April, the spring.

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,080
 And then there's Shavuot, or Pentecost,

52
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,160
 which is seven weeks after Passover.

53
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,320
 So it's another half a day for the wheat and barley.

54
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,980
 And then the third one, the biggest festival is Sukkot.

55
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,160
 All right, so it's this week, all right?

56
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,520
 So let's take a look what the people of God

57
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,960
 in the Old Testament, how they celebrate Sukkot.

58
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:55,320
 So here I have a couple of verses from the book of Nehemiah.

59
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,240
 So when the Jewish people,

60
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:00,160
 they were in Babylonian exile for 70 plus years.

61
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,540
 So they returned to the land, to Jerusalem,

62
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:05,000
 and this is what they did.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,040
 After building temple, we building a temple,

64
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,760
 we building the city wall, everything is done.

65
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,720
 And one more thing they do is to celebrate the festival.

66
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,880
 So chapter nine, verse 15,

67
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:20,500
 the leaders are telling the people to go to the hills

68
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,300
 to get branches from olive, wild olive, myrtle, palm,

69
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,400
 and all these kind of trees.

70
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,560
 And they use these branches to make sukkah, shelters,

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:36,260
 in which they will live during the seven day festival

72
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,500
 as prescribed in the law of Moses.

73
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,840
 So the people went out and cut branches

74
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,340
 and used them to build shelters, sukkah,

75
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,420
 on the roofs of their houses,

76
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:48,660
 because most of the Palestinian houses,

77
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,120
 they have flat roofs, unlike Chicago.

78
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,400
 In the courtyards, in the courtyards of God's temple,

79
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,500
 in the squares just inside the water gate and Ephraim Gate,

80
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:01,860
 so everyone who had returned from captivity

81
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,860
 lived in these sukkahs during the seven day festival.

82
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,060
 They were all filled with great joy.

83
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:11,560
 And the Israelites had not celebrated sukkot

84
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,380
 since days of Joshua.

85
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,580
 Somehow they have forgotten,

86
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,740
 or they have not had the full scale of celebration

87
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,740
 for so long, since the time of Joshua,

88
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,740
 since the time they entered the land.

89
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,060
 So this is what they do.

90
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:33,480
 When on sukkot, they will prepare, as I said,

91
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,680
 in Midway Airport, I met a Jewish couple.

92
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,180
 They were holding in their hands,

93
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,980
 you see the Jewish man in front of Western Gate,

94
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,640
 or the Western Wall,

95
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,220
 he was holding a bundle of plants.

96
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,300
 And just like the book of Leviticus talks about,

97
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:02,240
 on the first day, gather branches from magnificent trees,

98
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,700
 palm trees, leafy trees, willow, myrtle, or whatever,

99
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,220
 and celebrate with joy before the Lord your God

100
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,480
 for seven days.

101
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,880
 So what they have today, the modern Jews,

102
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:23,000
 they would put palm branches, myrtle,

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:32,240
 and willow together, three kinds of green leaves together.

104
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,640
 And then there's one citrus fruit called itro,

105
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,100
 and then they put together, and put in the bundle,

106
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,140
 and then they would shake it, front and back,

107
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,460
 left and right, up and down.

108
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:49,060
 And this is how they pray.

109
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:51,020
 So it's a time of celebration,

110
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,620
 it's a time to pray together.

111
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:57,620
 In fact, in Jesus' time, the Jews in Jerusalem,

112
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:01,820
 or in the land of Israel, this is how they celebrate,

113
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,060
 sukkot, they would gather some branches,

114
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,700
 maybe different, but something similar.

115
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,540
 They would pray together because in sukkot,

116
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,900
 it's actually a harvest day.

117
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:16,420
 It's the last harvest of the year.

118
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:19,380
 Okay, it's like you getting your paycheck, right?

119
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:23,060
 At the end of the year, it's my last paycheck, right?

120
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:26,220
 I'm waiting for my last paycheck or bonus, right?

121
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,180
 Yeah, there you go.

122
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,780
 And then you get your check or whatever, your deposit,

123
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,660
 and then you hold it in your hand,

124
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,100
 and you kind of shake it, you know, in all directions,

125
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,500
 and then you pray.

126
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,060
 Now, what do they do?

127
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,620
 In fact, they are thanking God

128
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,940
 for what God has done in their lives,

129
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,140
 something that doesn't seem very important

130
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,020
 because year after year, you get your harvest, right?

131
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,580
 Month after month, year after year, you get your bonus,

132
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,500
 right, you get your paycheck, you get your salary,

133
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:06,620
 something that occurs over and over again, right, routinely.

134
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:13,700
 But sukkot is to remind the people,

135
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,740
 you know, whatever happened in your lives,

136
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:20,580
 God's provision, you should not forget,

137
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:25,260
 to remember, to pray with thanksgiving.

138
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:30,260
 And then at the same time, sukkot falls in the days

139
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,140
 or the time that the summer is fading away,

140
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:38,180
 and the autumn and winter is coming.

141
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:42,980
 You know, you feel like it, right, in Chicago, right?

142
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,780
 Summer is gone, too bad,

143
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,060
 and then autumn or winter is coming.

144
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:51,140
 It's the changing of season.

145
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:54,660
 Now, in the Bible, then, the changing of season

146
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,900
 is even more contrasting.

147
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:04,100
 Now, in Chicago, summer is about, what, 80s, 90s,

148
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,580
 good days, right?

149
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,780
 80, 90s, Fahrenheit.

150
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:11,460
 That's pretty hot and a little bit humid.

151
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:16,460
 And then autumn and winter, what is the temperature now?

152
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:23,300
 50s, right, 50s, 50s, 40s, something like that.

153
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,140
 And then it will go down, right?

154
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,820
 It will go down, all the way down to negative, right?

155
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,700
 So you feel the temperature change, right?

156
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:35,140
 In the land of Bible, you also feel that contrast

157
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,860
 of summer and winter,

158
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,460
 because there's actually two seasons only

159
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,820
 in the land of Bible,

160
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,940
 summer, which is hot and dry, right?

161
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,460
 90 degree, 100 degree, very sunny, scorching heat.

162
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,860
 And then after Sukkot, the winter will come,

163
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:57,860
 and winter in the land of Bible is wet and colder,

164
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,940
 cold and wet.

165
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:04,580
 Summer is hot and dry, and winter is cold and wet,

166
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:08,060
 because the winter season kicks in the first rain,

167
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,940
 the first season of rain.

168
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,020
 Now, when I say rainy season,

169
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,540
 I don't mean one month has 30 days,

170
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:20,300
 and then 30 days is gonna get rain, no.

171
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
 A rainy season means in a month,

172
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:27,060
 you get like nine days or 10 days of rainy days.

173
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,060
 So when Sukkot comes, rain is expected.

174
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,820
 Rain is gonna come.

175
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,020
 So the Jewish man here in front of Western Wall,

176
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,940
 he and with other people are actually praying for rain,

177
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:49,100
 praying for another year that God will bless them,

178
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,380
 God will provide for them,

179
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,700
 because in the agricultural society,

180
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:57,700
 you need water and you need rain in order to get harvest.

181
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,940
 Right at this time in Sukkot,

182
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,340
 they will keep praying and praying

183
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:06,380
 that this coming year, God will bless them,

184
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:10,640
 God will bless us, so we can have enough water, enough rain,

185
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,980
 so that would guarantee our harvest coming, all right?

186
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,140
 It's kind of like you starting a new fiscal year,

187
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,460
 what do you expect?

188
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:22,660
 You anticipate growth, right?

189
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:26,860
 Hope that there will be a financial gain,

190
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:29,620
 or the report, the first quarter report,

191
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:32,980
 will match your whatever expectation

192
00:10:32,980 --> 00:10:35,700
 or plan that you have, right?

193
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,300
 It's kind of like that in Sukkot.

194
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,020
 So praying for rain.

195
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:43,660
 In fact, for seven days in Sukkot,

196
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,640
 the last day, the seventh day,

197
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,340
 is the highest holiday of the entire week.

198
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,740
 And the priest in Jesus' day,

199
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,960
 they would go down from the temple

200
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:02,820
 to the downhill area of Jerusalem,

201
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,220
 and there's a big water pool there,

202
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,140
 it's called Saduam Pool.

203
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:11,940
 They would use a golden flask, golden flask,

204
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:15,380
 and pick up some water from the pool,

205
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,860
 and then bring it all the way back

206
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,700
 with processions and celebrations,

207
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:21,460
 go back to temple and the altar,

208
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,620
 and they would do a libation.

209
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:26,780
 You know, they would sprinkle the water

210
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,580
 in front of the temple,

211
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,580
 praying that God will give them a new year

212
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,980
 with provision and blessing.

213
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:40,020
 Now, this kind of festival or celebration

214
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,060
 reminds the people of God,

215
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,540
 everything comes from God,

216
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:47,900
 as basic as the rain from heaven.

217
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:50,840
 It's only because God provides, right?

218
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,780
 What a reminder for you, too.

219
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,540
 Whenever you pick up your paycheck,

220
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,480
 whenever you get your bonus, right?

221
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,300
 Have you ever thought about,

222
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,580
 we should be thankful?

223
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:06,600
 God provides, right?

224
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:10,380
 There's no guarantee, right?

225
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:12,300
 I was just talking to a friend,

226
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:15,340
 you know, we're getting old, right?

227
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,300
 We're getting old, we're like old cars.

228
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,060
 Some of our parts are not working, right?

229
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,980
 (congregation laughing)

230
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,540
 And we don't expect that.

231
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:27,980
 We don't expect that part will recover, right?

232
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,940
 Once you get some permanent damage

233
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:34,980
 or permanent deterioration, right?

234
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,000
 It's gone, right?

235
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,140
 It's kind of like your old car, right?

236
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:39,780
 The water pump is not working.

237
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,640
 You can replace it,

238
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,060
 but once in a while, it will get stuck again,

239
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,580
 and then you have to replace it again.

240
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,300
 And then come to a point that

241
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:53,380
 you realize the old car is not worth to fix it anymore.

242
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,700
 Right?

243
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,940
 It's kind of how life is, right?

244
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,700
 So I was talking to some of my friends

245
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,500
 because we are over 50s,

246
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,180
 and we are getting to the point

247
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,660
 that we know that some water pumps are not working,

248
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,440
 and some of our parts are not working.

249
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,740
 And we need to go to a physical therapist,

250
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,980
 we need to go to see doctors,

251
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,500
 we need to go to see dentists,

252
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:19,340
 and there's some deterioration.

253
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:25,820
 When it happens, it will not be renewed again, right?

254
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,500
 Now last week, I remind you,

255
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,860
 life is short, life is fragile.

256
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:34,540
 It is.

257
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,880
 We are broken, and we will be broken.

258
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:40,780
 And we better think about how we invest

259
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:42,900
 our lives and our times and our effort

260
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:45,140
 into something that will last.

261
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,880
 Sukkot is one of those festivals,

262
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,060
 year after year, to remind the people of God

263
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:53,240
 what you're living for, right?

264
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,320
 Who is providing for you, and for what purpose, right?

265
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:02,080
 I know we all have our own anxiety and our own concerns,

266
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:02,920
 right?

267
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:07,160
 Some of you may be worrying about your jobs,

268
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,320
 your career, your education,

269
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:14,120
 your family, your visa.

270
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:17,060
 Those are the practical stuff.

271
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,900
 That causes anxiety, right?

272
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:26,300
 Sukkot, one of those time reminders,

273
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,460
 is to remind us every single day,

274
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,880
 it's by God's provision, right?

275
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,580
 Now if I ask you, what are you thankful for these days?

276
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:38,020
 In the past few weeks, what are you thankful for?

277
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,340
 Can you think of something that you are thankful for,

278
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,740
 for the person next to you?

279
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,160
 That's great.

280
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,000
 So nice.

281
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
 (audience laughing)

282
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,920
 What are you thankful for?

283
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,480
 Right, think about it.

284
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,460
 Sukkot is one of those days.

285
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,680
 In fact, I told you, the last day of Sukkot,

286
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,680
 the seven day festival, is the day of greatest expectation.

287
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,940
 The people of God will pray for rain

288
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:07,000
 for the next season, for the next year.

289
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,360
 That God will give them blessing, right?

290
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,600
 And here, in the book of John, the gospel of John,

291
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,000
 we see what happened in the last day of Sukkot,

292
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,880
 the seventh day.

293
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,240
 Here is the story of Jesus.

294
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,600
 Now what happened before was that

295
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,520
 some of the brothers of Jesus,

296
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,260
 they went from the north, Galilee,

297
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:36,460
 going to Jerusalem to celebrate Sukkot.

298
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,480
 And those brothers did not believe in Jesus at that time.

299
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,800
 So they were telling Jesus,

300
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,520
 hey, if you are really the Messiah,

301
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,040
 why don't you go to the Sukkot with us?

302
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,640
 Go to the temple, go to Jerusalem,

303
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:52,120
 and announce yourself to be the Messiah, to be the king.

304
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,180
 And then everyone will believe in you.

305
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:57,060
 Of course, Jesus doesn't do any,

306
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:00,520
 that kind of show and tell, right?

307
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,680
 So Jesus said, I'm not going to Jerusalem,

308
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,640
 I'm not going to Sukkot.

309
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:08,120
 In fact, he went secretly.

310
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,640
 He went secretly in Jerusalem.

311
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,840
 He didn't show up on stage.

312
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,960
 He didn't talk to the people until the last day of Sukkot.

313
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,740
 So 737, Gospel of John.

314
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,320
 On the last day of Sukkot, the climax,

315
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,200
 the highest day of the festival of Sukkot,

316
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,780
 the tabernacles, Jesus stood and shouted to the crowd,

317
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:34,520
 "Anyone who is thirsty may come to me.

318
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:38,280
 "Anyone who believes in me, come and drink.

319
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:41,340
 "For the scriptures declare,

320
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:46,340
 "rivers of living water will flow from his heart."

321
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,200
 Now, when Jesus said living water,

322
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,400
 he was speaking of the spirit,

323
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,940
 who would be given to everyone believing in him.

324
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:58,280
 But the spirit had not yet been given

325
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:01,280
 because Jesus had not died and rose again

326
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,980
 and entered into his glory.

327
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,800
 So at that point in chapter seven of Gospel of John,

328
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,820
 on the last day of Sukkot, when people are so thirsty,

329
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:15,320
 so thirsty because after four or five months

330
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:20,760
 of dry and heat, dry and hot summer,

331
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,000
 they were expecting, they were wanting,

332
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,480
 yearning for water, for rain.

333
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:32,480
 The last day, the best time to announce this gospel

334
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:37,560
 is that anyone, if you are thirsty,

335
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,220
 everyone you can imagine,

336
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:44,220
 you know, when their water tank is lowest,

337
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,620
 when their bank account is lowest,

338
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:49,620
 they were expecting a new year, right?

339
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:52,420
 Kind of like you spend all your money, right?

340
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,020
 At the end of the month, at the end of the year,

341
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,280
 you're expecting God will provide for you, right?

342
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:02,300
 When you are poorest, when you're a lack of money,

343
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,780
 when you're a lack of water,

344
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,620
 you're expecting God will bless you.

345
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:09,940
 And Jesus said and announced on the climax of the day,

346
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,740
 if you are thirsty, come to me,

347
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:16,860
 because I give you more than literal water,

348
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:22,940
 living water, eternal life, eternity.

349
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,200
 This is what you want.

350
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,760
 What you really want is not just a paycheck.

351
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:34,900
 What you really want is me giving you the life of God

352
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,240
 that will last forever lasting.

353
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,260
 It will not end.

354
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:45,620
 And sometimes we think what we want

355
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:48,260
 is the ultimate need that we have.

356
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:53,900
 Jesus said, no, it's only for temporary relief.

357
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:58,380
 Next year, you're gonna need water again.

358
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:02,060
 Next month, you need another provision again.

359
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,620
 You need another paycheck.

360
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:06,040
 You need another level of happiness

361
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,820
 or whatever you're seeking for.

362
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,400
 The true need, the ultimate need that we need

363
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,040
 is eternal life.

364
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:19,480
 And that's what Sukkot is all about.

365
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:24,200
 On the climax of the festival, Jesus said,

366
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:29,200
 if you're thirsty year after year, month after month,

367
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:33,820
 you find yourself lacking week after week,

368
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:39,260
 I announce to you, I give you river of living water,

369
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,760
 the best water, the best water.

370
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:48,180
 The everlasting supply of water is from me,

371
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,340
 from the Spirit, right?

372
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,060
 Now we're in Christ.

373
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,420
 We enjoy this kind of living water

374
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:57,020
 because Spirit is living in you.

375
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,840
 Now we often struggle after we follow Christ,

376
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,460
 is the Spirit speaking to me, right?

377
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,820
 Have you ever wondered, the Spirit, God is speaking to you?

378
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:12,260
 I think God is constantly speaking to us.

379
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,340
 The problem is our world is too noisy

380
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:22,260
 and we cannot hear the voice of the Spirit, right?

381
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,380
 We're too busy with our own things,

382
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,440
 too noisy in our environment,

383
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:33,080
 and we hardly hear the word of God, right?

384
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,780
 The problem is not the speaker.

385
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:39,880
 The problem is the audience, it's us.

386
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,420
 Sometimes we don't slow down.

387
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:44,820
 We don't read the word of God, right?

388
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:48,420
 And we treat our relationship with God as transactional.

389
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:51,340
 Whenever I have a need, right?

390
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,620
 Okay, I am building my family, I need some more money.

391
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,140
 You know?

392
00:20:56,140 --> 00:21:00,560
 God, I pray, and out of the blue, you drop some money, right?

393
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,920
 Well, you don't do that.

394
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,720
 So, you know, I'm gonna forsake you.

395
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,720
 You see that kind of relationship?

396
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:12,560
 We have a list of needs we present to God

397
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,880
 and hope that God will fulfill those needs, right?

398
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,640
 If God fulfill those needs,

399
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,560
 then I'll come draw closer to God, right?

400
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,400
 For what?

401
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:24,720
 For more needs, right?

402
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,320
 We need, we have more wants.

403
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,480
 And then if God satisfy those wants,

404
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,000
 we are satisfied and then we come back to God

405
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,760
 with even more needs, right?

406
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:39,320
 So, the cycle go back and forth, back and forth,

407
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,460
 you know, just continuously.

408
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,720
 And you see that kind of relationship with God

409
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,760
 is transactional.

410
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,280
 You know what transactional is?

411
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:52,000
 It's like husband and wife, right?

412
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,640
 Well, how do you tell a husband and wife

413
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:54,800
 really love each other?

414
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,800
 How do you tell they don't really love each other?

415
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,080
 It's when, you know, I do the dishes

416
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,520
 so that you do other things, right?

417
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,500
 I mop the floor and you're gonna bring food on the table,

418
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,340
 right?

419
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:14,620
 If I don't mop the floor, right?

420
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:17,600
 Okay, then you don't bring food on the table.

421
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,680
 In order for you to bring food on the table,

422
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,800
 then I'll have to do something, right?

423
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,680
 It's transactional, it's an exchange.

424
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,920
 I do something and you do something, right?

425
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,720
 I do something to earn you something.

426
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,240
 Now, that kind of relationship is actually idolatry.

427
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,120
 It's worshiping idol, right?

428
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,920
 How do you know two people are really loving each other?

429
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:46,200
 Is that the husband is loving the wife 100%,

430
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,960
 unconditional, and the other person is loving back,

431
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
 unconditionally.

432
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,480
 That is a real relationship.

433
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,920
 And our relationship with God is the same thing.

434
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,720
 It should not be transactional.

435
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:09,840
 It should be a relationship we can enjoy, right?

436
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,760
 I serve God, it's not because I wanna get good stuff

437
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,320
 from God.

438
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:18,120
 I'm faithful to God, it's not because God is good to me.

439
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,820
 God is sprinkling some money to me,

440
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:26,820
 and then I'll do something back to earn the blessing.

441
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,880
 No, that is not a real relationship

442
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
 because it becomes transactional, it becomes an exchange,

443
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,120
 becomes a financial transaction, right?

444
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:37,320
 In order for us to really relate to God,

445
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,600
 I mean, eternal relationship,

446
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:44,040
 is for us to understand God loves us unconditionally,

447
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 fully, 100%.

448
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,880
 So we love Him back, not because we wanna gain something

449
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,280
 or earn something from Him.

450
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,500
 It's because we respond thankfully, right?

451
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:02,180
 All the things that we do for God, in ministry, in service,

452
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,660
 by living closely to the Word of God,

453
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:11,660
 what we do for God is a response,

454
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:16,580
 is to tell God, "Thank you.

455
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,780
 "Thank you for your grace, right?

456
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,000
 "I don't earn it, I don't deserve it."

457
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,040
 And that kind of relationship

458
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,180
 is the biblical relationship with God.

459
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:30,080
 Now I hope this analogy will remind you

460
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:35,960
 what does it mean to worship God Himself?

461
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:38,040
 What does it mean to serve Him?

462
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,800
 What does it mean to follow Christ?

463
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:45,720
 Now I'll close with a short story about Sukkot, okay?

464
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,820
 About building the tabernacle.

465
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,820
 I think years ago, there was a chief rabbi in England,

466
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,000
 in United Kingdom.

467
00:24:57,000 --> 00:25:00,800
 So it was in UK, his name is Jonathan Sachs.

468
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:05,260
 He was a chief rabbi in England, everyone respects him.

469
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,260
 And he was telling a really good story about Sukkot.

470
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,140
 When he was younger, so much younger, he just got married.

471
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,300
 So as a Jewish man, he got married

472
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:17,940
 and building his own family.

473
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:22,460
 Sukkot comes and as a new family, husband and wife,

474
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,380
 they are supposed to build Sukkot, right?

475
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:29,740
 So he was not quite handy.

476
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:32,240
 Anyone of you are handy here?

477
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,420
 Nails and hammer, putting things together, you are?

478
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,000
 Yeah, okay, you're not.

479
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,300
 Well, Rabbi Sachs was not very handy.

480
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,060
 So he didn't know what to do, right?

481
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:47,420
 How do you put things together like a tent or a Sukkot?

482
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,260
 How do you do that?

483
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,420
 So he doesn't know.

484
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:54,420
 So he asked his friend, how to build a Sukkot?

485
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:58,580
 And his friend happens to be very, very handy.

486
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:02,020
 So the friend invite him, hey, I'm going to like Home Depot,

487
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:04,700
 lumberjack or something.

488
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:08,940
 And then we're gonna buy something for building my Sukkot.

489
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,460
 You wanna come along?

490
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:13,740
 And Rabbi said, of course, yeah, I wanna come along, right?

491
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:19,380
 And this friend of Rabbi Sachs was very handy.

492
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,940
 And he went into the Home Depot store

493
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,940
 and with a big list of materials and all the detail plan,

494
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:32,420
 right, how to nail the tent together

495
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,340
 with lights and all that stuff.

496
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,860
 And it's kind of like that.

497
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,260
 Kind of like that.

498
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:42,280
 There's some Sukkot are really, really elaborate.

499
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,700
 So his friend had a really elaborate plan,

500
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,820
 a blueprint, how to build a Sukkot.

501
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:53,860
 So he was going with his friend, he had no plan at all.

502
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:57,740
 So he ended up buying just three, four by eight,

503
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:01,220
 some nails, brought them all home.

504
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,580
 And then his friend got all these plans, right,

505
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,580
 with all the lights and all the decoration on it,

506
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,580
 very beautiful.

507
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,020
 So his friend built his Sukkot

508
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,380
 and he built his Sukkot outside of his home.

509
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:17,240
 Each one has a Sukkot.

510
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,000
 And his friend's Sukkot, of course, it's very elaborate,

511
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,320
 but his Sukkot is like a cardboard,

512
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,400
 four by eight nailed together only.

513
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:29,700
 And then that night, a powerful storm came by,

514
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,160
 strong wind and strong wind.

515
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:38,440
 And then the next morning, both of them got up

516
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:40,840
 and checked on their Sukkot.

517
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:45,840
 His friend's Sukkot fell down, collapsed altogether.

518
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,280
 Everything's gone.

519
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:52,280
 And then he called Rabbi Sacks and said,

520
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,480
 "How about your Sukkot?

521
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,460
 "Is it still standing?"

522
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:01,840
 And Rabbi Sacks went out to the patio and checked the Sukkot.

523
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,320
 Yeah, my Sukkot is still standing.

524
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,180
 And guess what, it's still here.

525
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:09,220
 And his friend, in disbelief,

526
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:13,320
 he drove all the way to the Rabbi's house

527
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,200
 and checked on his tabernacle, his Sukkot.

528
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,600
 And he was checking why,

529
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:25,560
 why my Sukkot, so elaborate, fell on the strong wind.

530
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,560
 But his Sukkot is so poor and still standing.

531
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,620
 And then he's checking his architecture,

532
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,680
 how he built things together and put things together.

533
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,160
 He found there was one nail

534
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:46,180
 of the Rabbi's Sukkot was nailed to the wall of the house.

535
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:50,720
 And that's why the Sukkot did not fall.

536
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,620
 His Sukkot, however elaborate it is,

537
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,660
 fell after the wind and the storm.

538
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:05,080
 And his friend, all of a sudden, just dawned on him.

539
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,060
 "I know what that nail is.

540
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:13,220
 "That nail is the nail of faith.

541
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:15,800
 "It's the nail of faith."

542
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,980
 See, how elaborate you build your life,

543
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,380
 Sukkot, as your life,

544
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,620
 how many plans that you have,

545
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:26,260
 how many investments you have,

546
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:29,700
 it really doesn't matter at the end.

547
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:34,060
 Because when the test of life comes,

548
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,340
 when storm hits you,

549
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,920
 your life will collapse,

550
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:41,560
 unless you have the nail of faith.

551
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,400
 And that nail of faith, his friend realized,

552
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,320
 is our faith.

553
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,020
 It's our faith in God.

554
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,740
 It's our faithfulness in God,

555
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,540
 to walk in God faithfully.

556
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,440
 I hope this lesson, this story,

557
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,900
 is not just interesting to you.

558
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:04,900
 But it's insightful and transforming to us.

559
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,020
 To realize what are we planning for,

560
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:11,660
 our 401k, our retirement, our family, our whatever.

561
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:15,180
 If you don't have the nail of faith,

562
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,300
 when storm comes,

563
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:20,720
 when wind and rain hit you,

564
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,820
 you will collapse.

565
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:25,860
 Only with the nail of faith,

566
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,760
 then you can stand.

567
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,620
 C.S. Lewis, I mentioned to you last week,

568
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:34,180
 he said, "Do not let your joy

569
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:36,640
 "depend on something you may lose."

570
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:42,740
 There are many things that don't last into eternity.

571
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,140
 There are many things like that.

572
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,560
 And you will lose them.

573
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:52,500
 You will lose all of them.

574
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,900
 But there is something that will last,

575
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,740
 eternal life.

576
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,580
 Right?

577
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,420
 Our service to God,

578
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,840
 our investment into His kingdom,

579
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,660
 they will all last.

580
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,060
 And they will not collapse.

581
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,300
 You know, in times of tabernacle,

582
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,140
 in times of Sukkot,

583
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:15,140
 if you go into a Jewish synagogue today,

584
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,220
 one of the scriptures that they will read

585
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,560
 during Sukkot, during this week,

586
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,820
 is the book of Ecclesiastes.

587
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,180
 Now, the book of Ecclesiastes is a very long book.

588
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,580
 It's 12 chapters.

589
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,140
 Not gonna go through all the details

590
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,560
 'cause we're gonna end here.

591
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,900
 But the central idea, the big idea

592
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,060
 of the book of Ecclesiastes

593
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:39,080
 is that everything is meaningless under the sun.

594
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,780
 Now, under the sun, everything will repeat again and again.

595
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,380
 It will be occurring all the time, right?

596
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,060
 No matter you live in Stone Age

597
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:49,100
 or live in today,

598
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,420
 everything will continue to repeat.

599
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,540
 So everything is meaningless under the sun

600
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,020
 because someday you're gonna die, right?

601
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,020
 And we're gonna die.

602
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:05,740
 So what makes life meaningful at the end,

603
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:07,140
 the 12th chapter,

604
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,980
 is that you don't live under the sun.

605
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:12,420
 You should have a perspective to live above the sun,

606
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,780
 above this world.

607
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:19,300
 You get an eternal anchor, the nail of faith,

608
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:23,060
 the eternal perspective to see what you're doing,

609
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,680
 big or small.

610
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,980
 You got another anchor, eternal anchor,

611
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,780
 to evaluate what you're doing,

612
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,060
 whether it's worth it or not.

613
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,820
 And that is life above the sun.

614
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:38,620
 And Ecclesiastes says that is a meaningful life

615
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,540
 because whatever you do,

616
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:46,300
 if you have that perspective to fear God,

617
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,340
 it will last.

618
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,580
 It will work eternally.

619
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:56,300
 12.13, I'm gonna end with this last two verses.

620
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:58,940
 Now, this is the whole story.

621
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:02,000
 So he was arguing for 12 chapters.

622
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,460
 Life under the sun is meaningless

623
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:06,860
 because we're gonna die, right?

624
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:10,740
 Here now is my final conclusion.

625
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:12,800
 Fear God and obey His commands

626
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,340
 for this is everyone's duty.

627
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:18,720
 God will judge us for everything we do,

628
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,320
 including every secret thing,

629
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,680
 whether good or bad.

630
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:29,320
 Life of wisdom, life of worth,

631
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,520
 is to invest into something that is eternal, right?

632
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,720
 Let's all pray together.

633
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,800
 Father, wherever we are in our life journey,

634
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:45,480
 we pray that you will remind us time and time again

635
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:50,720
 that our life and our time needs to be invested

636
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:56,280
 in eternal course,

637
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:01,280
 into your gospel, into your people, into your kingdom.

638
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,200
 And I pray that you will help us to return back to you.

639
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,560
 We return to you with a heart to serve you 100%

640
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,640
 because you love us so much.

641
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,040
 You love us 100%, 200%, beyond measure.

642
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,920
 That we enjoy the eternal life

643
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:22,160
 because of the cross of Christ.

644
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,280
 And thank you we can worship you and listen to your word.

645
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,080
 And I pray that this coming week,

646
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:28,920
 no matter what we do,

647
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:32,800
 any things that seems insignificant,

648
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,540
 we do this to honor your name.

649
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:42,680
 We do all of our works

650
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,960
 and everything that we do,

651
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:51,960
 pray that we will do something worthy for your kingdom,

652
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,760
 to invest our life and our time in you,

653
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,360
 to listen to your word, to pray to you, to worship you.

654
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,400
 And I pray that you will grant us strength.

655
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,000
 And thank you for being our God

656
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,360
 and being our loving God in Christ, we pray.

657
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,680
 Well, God bless you

658
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,160
 and pray that you will continue to worship with us
