[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480]   Well, it's really great to be here and as Pastor Mark said, I've known him for a while
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.080]   but some of you have not seen me before.
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.040]   I actually live in the northwest part of the city, but this is where I grew up, so it's
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.960]   like coming back to home.
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.400]   I also found out that I've reconnected with Mir, who I've met before, so it's nice to
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.360]   see her and realize that actually some of you are part of a group that's come to UV
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.000]   from another congregation and Jayuk is actually a former classmate of mine, so it's nice to
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.920]   have that multiple overlap that I realize.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.680]   And I actually saw Jayuk before after moving back into the city from Trinity, where we
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.520]   were at seminary, and realized that his kids were going to the same school as our kids,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.960]   and so it's nice to have just these multiple connections.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.920]   When Pastor Mark asked me to preach today, I asked him what scenes or what books he might
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.240]   be covering so that I can maybe stay consistent with the message and maybe how I should cater
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.260]   what I was going to preach, and he wittingly replied that he had taught some things in
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.120]   Genesis before and then he's taught some things in Revelation, so pretty much anything in
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.760]   those books or in between is anything that I can choose from.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:26.040]   So that left me with a lot of freedom and a lot of no direction, but I hope that what
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.360]   I chose today will be helpful and relevant.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.940]   And the topic that I chose for today is actually something that we as Asians do not like to
[00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.360]   address very much, and it's the topic of, the softer topic of emotions.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:47.560]   And some of you are already probably thinking, emotions, feelings, what good are those?
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:49.680]   Why talk about it?
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.400]   And I think in my younger years, I would probably be on your side as well.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.720]   I would think how emotions and feelings were not really convenient and weren't really useful,
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:09.240]   and if anything, might be a liability in making decisions and just journeying through life.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.880]   But I think that this is really colored by our Asian perspective, and we tend to focus
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:21.560]   on things that are just more practical and monetarily profitable.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.880]   What I've come to discover over the years is this is actually rather unbiblical.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.080]   This is not how we're meant to be.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.600]   And emotions are very much part of how God designed us and how he wants us to be.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.200]   He wants us to feel.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:42.520]   And so the title of my message today is actually An Emotive Lord, because our God is emotive
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.840]   and expresses a range of emotions.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.440]   We who are also created in his image are also meant to display the range of emotions that
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.360]   we see him express in the Bible.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.520]   But because of our brokenness, we fall into elevating and prioritizing what is our cultural
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.280]   upbringing and what is our cultural lens, and that just affects how we live.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.360]   We fall short of fully living out how God designed us to be and how we're meant to emotionally
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.600]   also express our faith.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.960]   And I know that over the past several years, it's been a really hard time.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.640]   The pandemic has taken a toll physically, mentally, spiritually, and emotionally on
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.680]   us.
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.880]   And people are really feeling very anxious, and they're feeling the fragility of life.
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.880]   And I actually observe this often through the teammates that I have, that I interact
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.880]   with in my work.
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.780]   I actually work at a startup as my full-time job, and my team is globally distributed across
[00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.200]   the world.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.920]   And in my role, I actually do a lot of these one-on-one checkups with every person that
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.800]   I can on a, if not weekly basis, then a biweekly basis.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.720]   And there's a particular teammate of mine that I had a conversation with recently.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:08.200]   And these meetings are meant to be a pulse check to just check the general mood of people
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.200]   across the company to see how everyone's doing.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.480]   And the conversation that I had is with my teammate, who is also a fellow believer.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.960]   It was right after Easter, and I spent some time just kind of asking him how he is.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.600]   And there's always some personal chit-chat that happens at the beginning of these conversations.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.840]   And he told me that his Easter was relatively quiet and relatively somber.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.260]   And the reason was because his parents had to abruptly actually leave and go see his
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.960]   maternal grandmother, because they had found out that she was on her deathbed.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:46.360]   Fortunately, his mom and dad were able to actually make it in time to see his maternal
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.320]   grandmother before she passed.
[00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:57.360]   I offered my condolences, and I just really tried to care for him and ask how he was doing.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.040]   And he said that he was close to his grandmother.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.600]   He said that he has really fond memories of her and how he's helped to shape his own faith.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:16.040]   And he started to shift into talking about how despite her passing, because of our faith,
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.240]   because of the hope that Jesus Christ provides, that he was hopeful about the situation.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.760]   And this was all true, or this is all true.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.840]   And especially with his grandmother passing over Easter, there is this idea that this
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.360]   wasn't the ultimate end, that there's a hope, there's an alternative for his grandmother
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.720]   beyond just the passing in this earthly world.
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.840]   And it certainly made what was more of a sad and morphal situation a little bit more hopeful
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.920]   with this idea in mind.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:56.200]   However, despite not speaking about his feelings, I could really sense this greater level of
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.380]   grief and sadness that was emanating from him.
[00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.480]   And it was masked by this cover of hopefulness.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.840]   I felt that he was unnaturally overlooking the grief and just trying to maintain a positive
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.880]   outlook and then trying to shift toward work.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:20.480]   I think many of us would actually appreciate this approach, and some of us have probably
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.240]   adopted this approach in handling an experience of loss.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:30.280]   But this conversation actually sat with me for a while, and I think it really disturbed
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.480]   me and it caused me to reflect upon my own experiences in the past and my own dealings
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.960]   with sadness.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.440]   I recalled my memory of my grandfather, who was 93 when he passed.
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:46.360]   And a lot of people, when they found out, expressed their sympathies, which I was very
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:48.040]   thankful for.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:51.600]   And my reply was usually, "Oh, you know, it's okay.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.440]   He lived a long life."
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.160]   And this was the response that I provided people that came to me with their condolences.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:05.400]   It helped me accept the situation, but it didn't really acknowledge my true feelings.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:10.720]   And over time, I've come to believe that this isn't really a biblical approach.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:16.120]   It's not really the way that God had intended for us to deal with situations like this.
[00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:22.640]   And so today's passage is actually from John 11, 1 to 44.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.960]   You can't, I guess you can't see it.
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:29.920]   And I was planning on reading it, but then I decided that actually what's better is for
[00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:34.760]   me to kind of just paraphrase and summarize the passage and then kind of hone in on what
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.060]   I want to aim in on.
[00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:42.060]   And so John 11 tells a story of Lazarus's death and resurrection.
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.260]   In the beginning part, Jesus is in the wilderness, and Lazarus is sick in a different part of
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:51.620]   Israel, you know, in Bethany.
[00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.680]   And this is the village where Mary and Martha are from, who are sisters of Lazarus.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.020]   The sisters sent word to Jesus and told him that the one he loves is sick.
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.920]   These three siblings are actually described as ones that Jesus loves.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.660]   And so Jesus had a very special relationship with them.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:15.180]   When he heard this, Jesus said that this sickness will not end in death, but it is for God's
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:18.620]   glory so that God's son may be glorified through it.
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:22.300]   Jesus doesn't leave right away, but he actually does the opposite.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.220]   He actually waits even longer to make a move and to leave.
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:32.500]   He says to his disciples that Lazarus has fallen asleep and he will wake him up.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:37.980]   And so his disciples thought that he meant that he fell into a natural sleep and that
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.320]   he'll get better.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:44.080]   But then Jesus then has to correct him and say plainly that Lazarus is dead, but he intended
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.780]   for this to happen so that they may believe.
[00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.980]   And Thomas actually replies, "Oh, then let us all go so that we might die together."
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:55.720]   So I think they really missed the point, even though Jesus was correcting them.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.180]   And so by the time that Jesus arrives in Bethany, Lazarus had already been dead and entombed
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:02.780]   for four days.
[00:09:02.780 --> 00:09:07.500]   And many Jews had come to Martha and Mary to mourn with him and to comfort them during
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:09.440]   this period of loss.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:15.000]   When Jesus saw all these people weeping, it's described that he was deeply moved in spirit
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.320]   and troubled.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:22.380]   And in verse 35 out of the 44 verses that we have here, Jesus wept.
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:27.500]   He's moved by the situation and then he goes on to ask for the stone to be rolled away
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.900]   from the tomb and cause Lazarus out, which he does, fully resurrected, looking like a
[00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.740]   mummy.
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:42.020]   Those around come to believe and Jesus and God are glorified in this situation.
[00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:45.560]   There are actually very many preachable lessons here.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:49.020]   It's a very jam-packed passage.
[00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:54.380]   Jesus knowing Lazarus' condition deliberately delays his visit to Lazarus until way past
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:59.540]   his death to magnify the impact of the miracle he knew he was going to perform.
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:05.300]   Jesus shows his power to resurrect the dead in dramatic fashion as he calls folks to roll
[00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:11.380]   away this stone and signals his own resurrection through this story.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:16.860]   So much can be impacted and applied to our lives about suffering, perseverance, and eventual
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:24.460]   deliverance, how God's timing is perfect for a reason even in suffering.
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.940]   But my focus is actually none of this.
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.500]   What I want to hone in on is verse 35.
[00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:35.620]   And this small part is in fact the easiestly memorized Bible verse in the whole of the
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.700]   Bible because it is the shortest Bible verse.
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:42.780]   It is verse 35, which is Jesus wept.
[00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:46.340]   And so now you can all tell Pastor Mark that you've memorized today's verse because it
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:49.140]   is so easy to remember.
[00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:53.980]   But there is something very profound in this two-word verse.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:11:00.480]   It openly describes Jesus, who is fully divine and fully human, weeping.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:03.180]   It isn't shown in a negative way.
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:08.380]   It shows a very human response of grief as completely acceptable.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:09.940]   It doesn't dismiss it.
[00:11:09.940 --> 00:11:12.340]   It doesn't regard it as weakness.
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.140]   It doesn't try to cover it with something nice.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:19.340]   It's shown as natural and completely embraced.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.140]   Now remember that Jesus knows the greater plan.
[00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:28.700]   He knew Lazarus was going to die, but he also knew that Lazarus was going to be raised from
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.620]   the dead by him.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.780]   With that in mind, many might wonder, "Well, why be sad at all?"
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.980]   Yet Jesus openly grieves.
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:43.940]   Maybe he grieved at the individual death of Lazarus, or maybe his grief comes from the
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:50.740]   idea that there will be so much death still until his resurrection and his second coming.
[00:11:50.740 --> 00:11:56.180]   But whatever the case is, we see here that he wept, that he was moved and troubled, and
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.340]   that he openly grieved.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:00.620]   And there was nothing wrong with that.
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:07.620]   This act of Jesus affirms grief, sadness, and despair as appropriate responses and feelings
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.740]   that we should more readily embrace.
[00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:19.860]   Now, God really expresses a range of emotions as we see from Jesus.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:25.760]   But sociologists say that it's common for people to perceive that God is like the fatherly
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.800]   figures in their lives.
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:35.540]   If God is caring, patient, and concerned, then children will believe God has those same characteristics.
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:41.100]   And the opposite holds true when a father, when an earthly father is harsh, judgmental,
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100]   or absent.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.500]   Fortunately for us, or unfortunately for us, a typical Asian dad is one characterized as
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:55.100]   a dutiful, hardworking provider, sometimes a bit emotionally distant, and one whom we
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:59.360]   might, who might be critical and hard to please.
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:05.300]   Emotionally available and accessible is not a usual description of Asian parents.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:10.340]   This is important to recognize because this lens can shade our perception of how God the
[00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:13.980]   father is to us and how he's captured.
[00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:19.820]   We run the danger of projecting an idea of how God the father is through a worldly lens
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:21.820]   versus a biblical one.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:27.300]   This has risks of stunting our spiritual maturity and can lend itself to unhealthy perceptions,
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:32.300]   especially of how God, of how we think God sees us, how we see ourselves, and how we
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.240]   think we think God wants us to act.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.380]   When we perceive God the father through a traditional Asian parental profile, we can
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:48.700]   project him to be a figure that is harsh, unforgiving, demanding, and not easily satisfied.
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:54.960]   We may make him out to be emotionally distant and unconcerned and dismissive of our feelings
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:14:00.400]   and cause ourselves to undermine our own emotional health and situations.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:05.860]   We need to remember that God expresses the emotions of righteous anger, judgment, and
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:14.100]   disappointment, but he also shows a positive range of emotions of concern, love, pride,
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.500]   and joy.
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:22.060]   These are expressions that Asians, Asian parents, have a hard time struggling to display.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:25.860]   Our earthly relationships can really cloud how we see our relationship with God the father
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.380]   is.
[00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:33.400]   And we can dangerously misinterpret God being dismissive of our feelings and just focusing
[00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.140]   on our performance like our earthly parents do.
[00:14:37.140 --> 00:14:40.780]   We are a broken people and we need God.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.800]   And we need to be mindful of how not to be trapped in this lie that he doesn't care about
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.300]   our emotions and our feelings.
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.900]   It's important to observe and know that God displays a range of emotions with very positive
[00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.580]   ones as well.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.540]   There's delight, there's satisfaction, there's joy.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.220]   And we need to be able to embrace these as well as display these ourselves.
[00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:08.020]   We can establish that God openly expresses a range of emotions.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:13.780]   And knowing that, and knowing that we are made in the image of God, we must not restrict
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:18.260]   how we model a potential range of emotions.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:22.360]   It's not enough that we acknowledge the negative emotions that we tend to avoid.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:30.420]   We also have to embrace and express the positive ones thoroughly and toward ourselves.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.280]   You can ask yourselves, do you receive compliments well?
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.340]   Do you feel successful?
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:38.380]   Do you feel valued?
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:41.820]   Or do you often feel that you're not good enough?
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:47.740]   And you feel like an imposter about to be found out by someone and revealing your true
[00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:49.620]   nature.
[00:15:49.620 --> 00:15:52.980]   Now, this is also very small.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.140]   It's an emotional wheel.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:03.140]   And it shows a large range of emotions from happy, sad, disgusted, angry, fearful, bad,
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:09.620]   surprised, from the center spanning out to just more descriptive ones of feeling isolated,
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:17.620]   victimized, horrified, furious, excluded, but also positively aroused, free, joyful,
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:22.060]   curious, successful, respected, valued.
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:27.720]   Just think about some of these for a while and see if you can actually articulate some
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:35.220]   of these or can actually say that you've expressed a range of these emotions.
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:41.220]   Coming from a background that is grounded in honor and shame, most of us probably inherently
[00:16:41.220 --> 00:16:47.900]   understand that we tend to be emotionally reserved, focused on gaining face, concentrated
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:53.580]   on our duties and responsibilities, are hard to please, and very critical of others as
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:55.860]   well as ourselves.
[00:16:55.860 --> 00:16:59.460]   And this whole sermon has actually been a difficult thing for me to prepare because
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:02.660]   I can't honestly say that I'm good at this.
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.780]   Emoting is something that doesn't come easily to me.
[00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:09.700]   And I remember when I was younger, I'm very expressive emotionally.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:15.740]   But then over the years growing up, I've been conditioned to focus on what's proper and
[00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:22.580]   what I need to do in terms of my duty and focus on the family and focus on our collective
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.020]   group and to preserve face.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:35.860]   It's been an even greater challenge for me as I've become a parent and how I've unwillingly
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:39.980]   transferred this behavior to my own children.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:46.100]   And as much as I try to maintain a positive mindset over the years and be more expressive
[00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:52.180]   emotionally with my feelings, with my children, I find that I'm challenged by my past and
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:56.020]   I tend to revert back to just how I was raised.
[00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:01.980]   And some of you are parents here, are preparing to be parents.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.780]   Before you become a parent, you think that you're going to prepare to be the most amazing
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.300]   parent the world has ever seen.
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:18.300]   And we study, we seek out advice, and we plan to be the greatest in the world to our kids.
[00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:23.580]   But the truth is that when the children actually come, it's chaos.
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.620]   And there's nothing that can prepare you.
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.980]   And you can study all you want, but it's just a different experience.
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:38.060]   And what happens is that what we plan on doing in terms of best practices just turns into
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:41.220]   just trying to survive one more day.
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:47.540]   And when that happens, all the stuff that you thought about, planned out, goes out the
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:51.020]   window and you revert back to your natural instincts.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:54.860]   You parent how you were parented.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:00.020]   And emotions for me are not given their proper attention.
[00:19:00.020 --> 00:19:04.540]   And what I see is my own children beginning to avoid expressing their feelings for fear
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.940]   of being dismissed.
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:10.540]   I don't sit with them and their emotions adequately enough.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:14.980]   I don't hold space for them in their moments of hurt and sadness.
[00:19:14.980 --> 00:19:17.820]   And I don't offer praise as much as I should.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:24.160]   I fall into this performance-oriented person that our culture has trained us to be.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.820]   And even when we do something well, or even if we're the best at doing what we're doing,
[00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:31.480]   there's very little praise for us, right?
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:37.460]   One because that's what we were supposed to do, so why get any praise?
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:42.640]   Or the fear is that, well, if there's too much praise, we breed mediocrity.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:47.020]   People get too used to it and that it doesn't really have the same level of strength that
[00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:48.020]   it's meant to have.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:56.440]   I know someone who shared with her parents not too a while ago that she took some standardized
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:20:00.640]   tests and she rated in the 99th percentile.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:05.600]   Her parents' immediate response was, "Well, why weren't you in the 100th percentile?"
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:09.760]   But she already, if you understand percentiles, being in the 99th percentile means that you're
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:11.520]   in the top 1%.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:15.000]   But the immediate response was, "Why weren't you in the top 100?"
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.460]   Which you can't be.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:24.260]   And the funny thing is that even though your parents don't praise you, what you see is
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:28.460]   that they actually brag about you in front of their friends, right?
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:33.020]   So they use your accomplishments and your performance as ammunition for those around
[00:20:33.020 --> 00:20:34.340]   them, but you get none of the credit.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:42.500]   You get even more burdened because then you have to continuously deliver these expectations.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:49.880]   As aspiring as Jeremy Lin was a number of years ago, I felt sorry for a whole generation
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:51.940]   that came after him.
[00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:57.560]   And I can imagine the countless conversations that were had of, "Well, not only did Jeremy
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:03.120]   Lin get into the NBA and is six feet plus tall, he also went to Harvard.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:04.120]   What about you?"
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:12.200]   You know, I can already see the pain of all these children that had to face this reality.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.560]   But more recently we had the Winter Olympics.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:20.260]   And of course we know that the focal point for Asians was not the athletics, it was who?
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.040]   It was Aileen Gu.
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.740]   And I thought it was hard enough when Jeremy existed, but Aileen Gu just blows them out
[00:21:27.740 --> 00:21:29.480]   of the water, right?
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:34.760]   Here we have someone that is a multi-gold medalist in the Olympics, scored near perfect
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:42.160]   in her SATs, is going to Stanford, is a millionaire, is a model, reads, writes, and, you know,
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   reads, writes, and speaks Chinese fluently, and then just add insult to injury, she can
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.760]   recite Chinese poetry from the Tang Dynasty, right?
[00:21:50.760 --> 00:21:53.160]   Like we are all condemned.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   This just makes it incredibly hard for everybody that comes now from the Chinese household.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:03.600]   But this is why God is great.
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.680]   He doesn't care about this stuff.
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:11.120]   He loves us for not what we can do, but who we are, right?
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:18.000]   We need to embrace the idea that God expresses delight toward us versus persistently projecting
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:25.640]   this idea that God is a critical parent and just expects us to deliver and perform all
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.740]   the time.
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:29.800]   We need to feel loved ourselves.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:36.600]   You know, in Matthew 3, 16 to 17, it says that as soon as Jesus was baptized, he went
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.200]   up out of the water.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.120]   At that moment, heaven was open and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:44.120]   rest on him.
[00:22:44.120 --> 00:22:48.600]   And a voice from heaven said, "This is my son, whom I love.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.760]   With him, I am well pleased."
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:56.360]   God delights in his son for being faithful.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:23:02.840]   Who here has heard their parents say to them that they delight in you?
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:09.360]   Who here as parents have shared that same expression to their children that you delight
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.760]   in your children?
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:19.920]   God wants us to be able to feel the good, like adoration, loyalty, love, desire, peace,
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:24.000]   success and joy, along with the negative that we feel.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.880]   The Bible clearly captures the full range of emotions.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:33.000]   The clearest comprehensive collection is in the 150 Psalms that we have in the Bible.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:42.680]   It speaks of lament, fear, pain, hate, but peace, joy, contentment, love, and so on.
[00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:46.360]   The Song of Songs is a full love letter.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:54.880]   And Revelation starts with a grim reality but turns into expected hope.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:24:00.720]   We need to be able to cry when we feel despair and celebrate jubilantly when there are things
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:03.440]   worth being happy about.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:08.000]   King David is seen trapped in some pretty dark moments in the Old Testament.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:14.640]   But he's also shown to be depicted as someone that can shout for joy and dance like a fool
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.460]   in the streets.
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:22.520]   It's not enough for us to start expressing the feelings now.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:30.720]   And we need to express the full range, but God also wants us to, sorry, to work deeply
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.360]   through our emotions.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:40.120]   So we are meant to see God as one who expresses a range of emotions.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:42.880]   And sorry that I kind of blasted through that.
[00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:48.320]   But God also encourages us to express the range of emotions ourselves.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:55.240]   And then thirdly, God wants us to work deeply through our emotions.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:59.360]   He encourages us to work through some of our older painful emotions.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:03.860]   We're called to dig deep into our past at times to examine some of the harder things
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:06.720]   that we've been through.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:11.680]   Studies have shown that there are real physical and mental effects resulting from undealt
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   with suppressed and repressed emotions.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   Studies show that individuals who repress their emotions and suppress their body's
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:25.680]   immunity, making them more vulnerable to a variety of illnesses leading from the common
[00:25:25.680 --> 00:25:28.620]   cold to cancer.
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:34.280]   There are real effects from undealt with emotions, not just on the emotional level, but that
[00:25:34.280 --> 00:25:39.800]   physically manifest themselves in physical form in our bodies.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:46.960]   And it's not that dealing with emotions is a nice to have, but it's closely interconnected
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:53.600]   with all that we are, all that we are, with our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:54.880]   by design.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.080]   And we have a responsibility to address them.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:05.060]   Before Jesus was crucified, he predicted Peter would deny him three times before the rooster
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:07.480]   cried in the morning.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:13.120]   But Peter boldly claimed that he would follow Jesus both to prison and to death.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:20.480]   Now we know that this wasn't true because Peter indeed denied Jesus three times, and
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:22.720]   he was bitterly ashamed of himself for it.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:27.480]   It's described in the Bible that he wept bitterly after the rooster crowed when he realized
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:30.600]   that Jesus' prediction came true.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.600]   And Peter could have wrestled with this for the rest of his life.
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:40.520]   But what we see captured at the end of John is that Jesus works through these shameful
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:46.640]   and guilty feelings that traumatize Peter.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:52.880]   After Jesus is resurrected and reappears to his disciples, he's captured at the end of
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:59.920]   the book of John, sitting Peter down over a meal of fish that they just caught.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.040]   And this is the passage.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:07.640]   They had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.640]   more than these?"
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.160]   "Yes, Lord," he said, "you know that I love you."
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.680]   Jesus said, "Feed my lambs."
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.160]   Again, Jesus said, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:23.040]   He answered, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you."
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:25.620]   Jesus said, "Take care of my sheep."
[00:27:25.620 --> 00:27:30.300]   The third time he said to him, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?"
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:34.280]   Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, "Do you love me?"
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:38.040]   He said, "Lord, you know all things, you know that I love you."
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:40.700]   Jesus said, "Feed my sheep."
[00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:47.240]   We see Jesus here going deeper and deeper with Peter, probably because Peter was avoiding
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.240]   this.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:54.440]   He doesn't explicitly bring up the denial that Peter did, but he asked him three times,
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:28:00.420]   almost in a way, redeeming the three denials that he had.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:06.140]   Jesus actively works with Peter through his emotions to bring restoration, and over a
[00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:11.820]   meal that actually physically restores him as well.
[00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:15.500]   Those who serve in ministry are not exempt from this work.
[00:28:15.500 --> 00:28:19.260]   One of the requirements to graduate seminary for me was actually go through a number of
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.020]   counseling sessions.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:27.180]   This was very important because we have to make sure that whatever potential painful
[00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:33.020]   memories, experiences, don't surface and put our future ministry at risk.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.420]   And there are actually some churches that are really good about this that have a requirement
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:43.760]   for their pastors to just get counseling every so often to make sure that they're cared for
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.840]   and that they're addressing their emotional and mental health.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:54.020]   When we go through periods of dismissed emotions that get suppressed and repressed, there are
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:29:01.340]   triggers that could derail us, that can surface in ways and at times that we don't expect.
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:06.620]   We are seeing a lot of the effects of isolation and depression amongst children, especially
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.860]   during these COVID times, and we have to be very mindful of the longer-term effects of
[00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:14.020]   this behavior.
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:17.300]   So I have a task for you.
[00:29:17.300 --> 00:29:22.900]   I want you to, and I'll leave this on here, I want you to look at this emotional wheel
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:27.820]   and pick an emotion here that is hard for you to express.
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:33.580]   And I want you to just kind of process it over this week, and if you can, by the end
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:37.500]   of next week, to find someone that you can trust to actually just talk about it and try
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:41.300]   to talk about it in a way that you haven't before.
[00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:45.100]   I challenge you to share it with someone that you can trust so that you can really, you
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:50.580]   know, exercise, take this exercise just really seriously.
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:57.660]   Well, Pastor Mark said that I could preach about anything from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:01.580]   and the entire Bible captures the full range of emotions.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.140]   So I think that I fulfilled my duty in spanning the whole of the Bible with emotions that
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.140]   span the whole of the Bible.
[00:30:07.140 --> 00:30:12.660]   And I just want to say that it's okay to not be okay.
[00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:15.020]   It's okay to not feel okay.
[00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:17.260]   And there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.060]   And there's nothing wrong with feeling great as well.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:25.940]   I think that sometimes being Asian, when we feel too positively, someone just wants to,
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.400]   you know, squash that.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:34.960]   So it's okay to feel great when there's cause to celebrate and to be festive.
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.020]   God actually expects it.
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:39.100]   And God actually designed us to be that way.
[00:30:39.100 --> 00:30:44.660]   So we deny ourselves the fullness of how we're meant to live and how God created us when
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:49.140]   we restrict ourselves in this area of life.
[00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:54.180]   Embrace the way that the Lord has made you, understanding that it might be uncomfortable
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:58.580]   at times to work through some of the things that we like to avoid, especially because
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:01.820]   of our cultural conditioning.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:08.700]   But don't allow our cultural lens, our upbringing, to shade the kingdom-centered perspective
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.660]   that God wants us to have.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.040]   Be renewed through His Spirit.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.660]   Have this fresh perspective.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:22.140]   And don't let the worldly way that we've been brought up color the way that we're meant
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:27.460]   to understand the world from just a believer's perspective.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:29.500]   Well, that's it for me.
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.020]   Let me just close in prayer.
[00:31:33.020 --> 00:31:39.940]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the way that you've created us and the ways that we
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:42.420]   sometimes don't like.
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:47.140]   But we understand that that is the way that we were designed.
[00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:52.700]   Help us here to really feel the way that you want us to feel.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:58.060]   And where there are maybe painful memories, help us to also work through them, through
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:01.180]   your strength and through your support.
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.780]   Let us embrace the way that you designed us and feel love when we should feel loved, but
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:12.420]   also feel the yucky things when we are meant to feel them, and to not repress them or suppress
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:17.660]   them, but to openly grieve and to openly support those that are going through these periods
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:20.180]   of negative feelings.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.580]   We praise you and we glorify your name.
[00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:23.580]   In your name we pray.
