1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,300
 - Some weeks ago, oh, I forgot to turn it on.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:05,720
 I'm sorry, yeah.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,220
 You know, this movie is about emotions inside out,

4
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:14,940
 and quite a few weeks ago, I remember Speaker Brian Ame

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,440
 was with us, and he talks about the emotional will, right?

6
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:20,560
 Remember that?

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,000
 Yeah, how we should articulate our emotion correctly,

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,360
 and how we process our emotions, okay?

9
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,700
 So here's my question to you this morning.

10
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:33,640
 Is where are you gonna put yourself in the past week

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,460
 on the emotional will?

12
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,680
 Where are you gonna put yourself?

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,720
 Okay, so pick a color, pick a color, or pick one emotion.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,080
 Well, you have some stronger emotion,

15
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,940
 so-called positive emotions, happy,

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:49,500
 you know, feeling strong and pump up, right?

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,660
 And then on the other side is feeling sad and depressed,

18
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:57,260
 bored, exhausted, lonely.

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:01,160
 And then down there, there's fear, the emotion of fear.

20
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,840
 And then on the upper right is feeling mad, you know,

21
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,340
 feeling mad about something, okay,

22
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:09,180
 or feeling mad about someone, all right?

23
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,400
 So take a look at the emotional will.

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,520
 Where are you gonna put yourself?

25
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,020
 Where are you gonna put yourself in the past week?

26
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,240
 All right?

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,580
 So how many of you put yourself in the fear section?

28
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,660
 Fear section.

29
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:27,500
 Wow, you guys are so bold, okay?

30
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,060
 No one's in fear, all right?

31
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,820
 How many of you, just take a sample,

32
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,740
 how many of you put yourself in the mad emotion?

33
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:37,700
 The yellow.

34
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,000
 Paul, you were mad, right?

35
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,440
 Yeah, mad about someone, probably.

36
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,580
 (laughs)

37
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,420
 Or mad about yourself, right?

38
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,260
 How many of you feel the sad part?

39
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,040
 Depressed a little bit?

40
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,400
 Okay, all right.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,260
 How about on the left side, the strong side,

42
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,200
 the happy side?

43
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,520
 How many of you fall into that quarter?

44
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,740
 No?

45
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,400
 Okay, those of you who didn't vote,

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,380
 those of you who didn't vote,

47
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,200
 you're probably being emotional less,

48
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,620
 which is not good, right?

49
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:08,660
 Which is not good.

50
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,400
 All right, so I'm sure the past week

51
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,260
 probably very hectic for you.

52
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:16,480
 Whatever happened in your life journey,

53
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,960
 we need to understand,

54
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,200
 as we look at one of the Psalms today,

55
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,620
 we have been looking at the book of Psalms,

56
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,640
 using different Psalms, different songs

57
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:28,620
 in the book of Psalms to study.

58
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,200
 You need to understand emotion is a window.

59
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,580
 It's a window to your soul.

60
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,600
 It's a window to something inside of you.

61
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,720
 Now, this is very interesting

62
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,460
 because you look at the book of Psalms,

63
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,040
 there were 150 Psalms recorded,

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,720
 being collected together.

65
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,880
 And those Psalms are actually prayers of people to God,

66
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,560
 words of humans to God.

67
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,020
 And at the same time, we collected those Psalms,

68
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:05,680
 and those Psalms are collectively God's word to us, right?

69
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,740
 So 100%, they are prayers to God, right?

70
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:15,620
 From a human poet, from a human player,

71
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:19,440
 playing a song, playing a prayer to God.

72
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,040
 At the same time, it is God speaking to us.

73
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,320
 If you run out of materials for your quiet time

74
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,760
 or devotions, you always can go back

75
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,080
 to the book of Psalms, right?

76
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:32,620
 You never get tired of thinking about,

77
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,900
 pondering on the words of the Psalms.

78
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,480
 So, you look at the 150 Psalms,

79
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,940
 you find all this kind of colors,

80
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,260
 and all this kind of emotions.

81
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:49,420
 And that's why I want to ask you how you feel today.

82
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:53,620
 How are you feeling in the past week?

83
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,260
 Let's process your emotions, right?

84
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,120
 Life is hectic, right?

85
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,860
 You have to take care of many, many different things,

86
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:03,240
 and you have to tackle different challenges and issues.

87
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,400
 But it's time for you to come before the presence of God

88
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,700
 to process your emotions.

89
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,740
 How do you feel today, right?

90
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,040
 How do you feel today?

91
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,200
 And let us go to Psalm 63.

92
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,940
 Now, as we read through some of the verses of this Psalm,

93
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,680
 I want you to understand and hear

94
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,760
 what David is trying to say, his prayers,

95
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:37,260
 his words to God, and how did he feel.

96
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:40,480
 A Psalm of David.

97
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,400
 And he was in the wilderness of Judah.

98
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,640
 "O God, you are my God.

99
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,600
 "Earnestly I seek you.

100
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,720
 "My soul thirsts for you.

101
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,860
 "My body longs for you.

102
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:56,160
 "In the dry and withered land, where there is no water,

103
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,120
 "I have seen you in the sanctuary,

104
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,700
 "and beheld your power and your glory.

105
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,000
 "Because your love is better than life,

106
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,240
 "my lips will glorify you."

107
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:09,640
 The first few verses that we have just read

108
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,720
 are the prayers of David.

109
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:17,080
 And he made this prayer, he made this Psalm,

110
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:20,160
 he composed this Psalm, where?

111
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,620
 In the wilderness, right?

112
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,220
 In the wilderness of Judah.

113
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,060
 Now, if you go back to the background of the Psalm,

114
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:30,720
 you will understand wilderness is actually part

115
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,960
 of the landscape of Israel.

116
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:39,780
 It's part of the landscape, a default geographical setting

117
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:43,620
 of any Israelite living in the land of Canaan.

118
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:47,180
 They know where the wilderness is.

119
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,100
 You climb the mountain and you descend the other side,

120
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,180
 you will see wilderness.

121
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,620
 The land of Israel is very interesting.

122
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,280
 It's very engaging.

123
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,460
 Next week, I'm leading about 10 people

124
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,040
 going to the land of Israel.

125
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,880
 It's gonna be interesting.

126
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,960
 I want to tell you something, it's very interesting.

127
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:08,620
 When we drive from west to east,

128
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:12,080
 we drive west to east,

129
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,140
 you see a total different two worlds.

130
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,880
 All right, let me show you how.

131
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,160
 The land of Israel, going from left to right,

132
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:24,960
 from west to east, is actually a mountain

133
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,500
 climbing all the way up to almost about 2,000 feet

134
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,840
 above sea level, 2,500 feet.

135
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,300
 That's where Jerusalem is.

136
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,380
 Can you see that?

137
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,640
 Can you make it out?

138
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,960
 And then after Jerusalem, you continue to drive,

139
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,160
 and then you will continue to descend

140
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,140
 in terms of elevation.

141
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:47,620
 You continue to descend and you can hear it,

142
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,680
 you can sense it because your ears pop, right?

143
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,960
 Because you are descending so much

144
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,180
 to the lowest point on earth,

145
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,420
 1,400 feet below sea level.

146
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,380
 It's very interesting to drive from left to right

147
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,620
 and from west to east,

148
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,720
 because when you pass Jerusalem,

149
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,280
 there's a tunnel in Mount of Olives.

150
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,420
 You go through that tunnel,

151
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,060
 before you went through the tunnel,

152
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:17,540
 everything looks kind of green.

153
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,420
 After you went through the tunnel,

154
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,460
 you went to the right side,

155
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:23,320
 the right side of the blue line,

156
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,320
 where the water shadows.

157
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:31,380
 After you pass that, everything looks brown and yellow,

158
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,760
 because there's no grass growing

159
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,540
 on the other side of the,

160
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,580
 the right side of the watershed.

161
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:41,740
 Now, what is important is the watershed, the blue line,

162
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,440
 because the rain cloud is moving from left to right,

163
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,900
 from west to east.

164
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,260
 And when the rain clouds move through the land,

165
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,560
 especially in the rainy season, the winter season,

166
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,700
 about October to March,

167
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,480
 it will rain on the left side of the watershed.

168
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,080
 And then after the rain clouds go through,

169
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,000
 went through the watershed line,

170
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,600
 there's no more rain.

171
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,160
 So after that watershed,

172
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,100
 there's no more rain on the right side of the watershed.

173
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,960
 So let me show you two pictures.

174
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,280
 You'll see the difference.

175
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,440
 The left picture is the left side of the watershed.

176
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,660
 You see kind of green, right?

177
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,380
 Most of the time, there are greens.

178
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:27,360
 And then after you move through the,

179
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,560
 past the line of watershed, past Jerusalem,

180
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,880
 you will see everything is dry, right?

181
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,100
 Everything is so dry.

182
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,800
 It's like desert.

183
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,140
 That is wilderness of Judah.

184
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:43,600
 So for Israelite, for the people of God,

185
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:47,000
 in the Old Testament, they know what wilderness is.

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,800
 They climb the mountain and they will see wilderness.

187
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,200
 They will go into the wilderness.

188
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,340
 And David, as the title of the psalm says,

189
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,860
 he wrote the psalm in the wilderness of Judah.

190
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,240
 Now, because wilderness is kind of default setting

191
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,240
 for David and for the people of God,

192
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:13,660
 wilderness becomes a metaphor, a metaphor of life.

193
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,840
 It represents testing and tough times

194
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:21,740
 you have to go through in your life.

195
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,260
 Challenges and trials and temptations.

196
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:28,180
 And from the landscape, you see the soul scape.

197
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:33,180
 What is going on in your life, right?

198
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,500
 Perhaps today, you are going through some wilderness.

199
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,260
 Perhaps recently, life has been tough for you.

200
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,600
 Life has been challenging to you.

201
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,160
 And because of the background of the psalm,

202
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,660
 we understand this wilderness.

203
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,520
 It's unavoidable.

204
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,400
 There's no way you can avoid it, right?

205
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,440
 You lost a job, that's a time of wilderness.

206
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:04,780
 You lost someone you love, that is time of wilderness.

207
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:08,080
 You lost some of the good things in life,

208
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,840
 that is a time of testing, time of wilderness.

209
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,400
 Now, the most important question is,

210
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,780
 if you are going through wilderness, what do you do?

211
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,120
 How do you maintain and sustain yourself

212
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,180
 through wilderness, through the dry

213
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,200
 and weary season of your life?

214
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,040
 And here, the psalmist David said,

215
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,460
 "Oh God, you are my God.

216
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,040
 "Earnestly I seek you, my soul thirsts for you,

217
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,880
 "my body longs for you.

218
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,480
 "In a dry and weary land of wilderness, there is no water."

219
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,080
 What is he doing?

220
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,520
 You know, something is not right in his life.

221
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,920
 And in fact, the context tells us,

222
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,520
 if you continue to read Psalm 63, he was on the run.

223
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,280
 David was a fugitive.

224
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:04,740
 You know some stories of David

225
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:08,320
 in the book of First and Second Samuel.

226
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,200
 He got a lot of enemies trying to kill him,

227
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,360
 pursue him, and take his kingship and take his power.

228
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,980
 So he was on the run.

229
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,480
 And where are you gonna run when there is trouble?

230
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,040
 Where are you gonna run when you are pursued by enemies?

231
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:28,180
 You run into wilderness.

232
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:30,280
 It is a land of fugitives,

233
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,280
 land of escape,

234
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:38,420
 land of going through some tough time.

235
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:41,200
 Wilderness becomes a metaphor for all of us.

236
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,280
 And he was on the run, and he was praying the psalm

237
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:46,200
 in the wilderness where there's no water.

238
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,320
 It was time of testing for him.

239
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,520
 And of course, if you're in the wilderness,

240
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,360
 the first thing you want is water.

241
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,900
 You need water.

242
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,900
 When you are thirsty, you need a glass of water.

243
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,320
 I go to Israel quite often,

244
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,960
 and the most important thing you need to bring

245
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,760
 when we are on a day trip,

246
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,120
 we leave our hotel or Airbnb very early in the morning,

247
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:15,660
 and then there's a day trip for us,

248
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:18,320
 and we won't come back until probably evening,

249
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,040
 after sundown.

250
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,700
 The most important thing in our backpack

251
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,120
 is the bottle of water.

252
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:28,800
 You probably have to drink at least one to two liter

253
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,960
 of water every single day.

254
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,960
 Dry and wiggly land.

255
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:38,400
 The first thing you want, your body thirst for, is water.

256
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:42,040
 But David is doing something very interesting here.

257
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,840
 He transformed his physical experience

258
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:47,180
 into a spiritual experience.

259
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:52,620
 He take that as a spiritual transformation moment.

260
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:55,120
 It's for him to yearn for God.

261
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:58,040
 Because if you know,

262
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,340
 if you have gone through life for some period of time,

263
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,360
 whether you're going through some really tough time,

264
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,320
 or your lack of money, you worry,

265
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:10,640
 or you deal with a lot of negative emotions,

266
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,900
 you need to understand that

267
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,740
 in terms of the physical body,

268
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:19,380
 the water can do something to your body,

269
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,820
 can crunch your thirst.

270
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,520
 But there's emptiness in your life.

271
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,640
 Water cannot crunch.

272
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:31,200
 There's only one thing that can crunch the thirst,

273
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,260
 crunch your yearning.

274
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:36,640
 And Psalm 63 says, "It is God."

275
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,960
 God himself.

276
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,460
 Only God can fulfill and make you satisfied

277
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:46,220
 from the inside out, from your heart.

278
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,260
 So seek God and thirst for God.

279
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:53,840
 That is what David does in the wilderness.

280
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,580
 Notice what he says, "You are my God."

281
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,060
 My God.

282
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,900
 Now usually the English pronoun,

283
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,020
 we don't think it is important.

284
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:06,260
 But in this Psalm, verse one,

285
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,100
 "God, you are my God."

286
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,700
 God of mine.

287
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,780
 That personal pronoun is important.

288
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:15,620
 Because for David, God is his God.

289
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,240
 His personal God.

290
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,660
 He has a vibrant, personal, living relationship

291
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,280
 with God himself.

292
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:27,700
 So God for David is not someone else's God.

293
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,220
 It's not some other pastor's God.

294
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,480
 It's not some other family member's God.

295
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,520
 It's not some other friend's God.

296
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,680
 Why so often we associate with God

297
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,200
 and our relationship with God

298
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,860
 is by other associations, right?

299
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,260
 I have a good friend who is very good Christian,

300
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,780
 who is very solid Christian,

301
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:48,140
 who is very, very solid believer.

302
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,220
 And because of him, I kind of close to God, right?

303
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,660
 But it's got your God.

304
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:56,980
 It's got your personal, relatable being.

305
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:02,540
 Self-sufficient in the wilderness.

306
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,960
 David said, "You are my God."

307
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:10,820
 God and me is a personal relationship.

308
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,740
 I'm not sure where you are in your relationship with God.

309
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,500
 Can you really call God your God?

310
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:21,500
 Can you really call Jesus your savior,

311
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,200
 your Lord and your leader?

312
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,360
 Yours, not someone else's.

313
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:30,020
 Personal relationship in the wilderness.

314
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,260
 He remembers his relationship with God.

315
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:37,540
 And that's the thing, that helps him.

316
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,480
 I want to challenge you.

317
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,760
 You probably heard of Jesus.

318
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,720
 You probably accept the gospel,

319
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,560
 you know, here and there for some time.

320
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:50,640
 But can you really pray 63 verse one?

321
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:53,180
 "Oh God, you are my God.

322
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,120
 "And Jesus, you are mine."

323
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,720
 Right?

324
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,120
 And secondly, what does he do?

325
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,160
 He recalls his past experience with God.

326
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,280
 He continues his prayer.

327
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:06,780
 He says, "I have seen you in the sanctuary,

328
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,800
 "in the temple, in the temple of Jerusalem."

329
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,800
 David used to be a worshiper, regularly, weekly,

330
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,420
 on Shabbat, on Sabbath, Sunday.

331
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:23,800
 He goes to the temple, he goes to the court,

332
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,220
 worshiping God with the community, right?

333
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:31,180
 He remembered that in the wilderness.

334
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,360
 I really appreciate the comment made previously

335
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,780
 about the need for community.

336
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:40,420
 Need for a friend, right?

337
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:43,060
 You know, in my circle, recently there was a big news

338
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,400
 about some people being lured

339
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,780
 into a human trafficking trap.

340
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:57,900
 You know, in my circle, there's some people from Hong Kong.

341
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,820
 They are being tempted by some human trafficker

342
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:06,540
 to go to Cambodia or Thailand

343
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,460
 to make some big money, right?

344
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,780
 And they're being tempted

345
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:13,100
 because there's so lack of money, right?

346
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,340
 They wanna make some quick money, quick income,

347
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:19,380
 and that's why they got themselves into the trap

348
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,560
 and they followed the head of the human trafficking scheme

349
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:27,060
 and went to Cambodia,

350
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:32,820
 and they never able to return, they disappeared.

351
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,980
 It's a horrible news.

352
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,900
 It's a horrible news.

353
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,820
 There's no bottom line in morality.

354
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,400
 But what they did was that they were in a time of weakness,

355
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:49,700
 time of wilderness, so to speak,

356
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,860
 and they are being tempted to get some quick money

357
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,540
 but got themselves into huge trouble.

358
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,880
 What David did in the wilderness

359
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,780
 is that he recall something

360
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,520
 that he had experienced with God.

361
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:14,020
 Memory defines us.

362
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:17,340
 Think of your memory, your spiritual memory.

363
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,380
 What do you remember?

364
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:23,300
 Reading the Bible, God speaking to you,

365
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:25,800
 the Holy Spirit touching your life.

366
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:27,220
 You know, here and there,

367
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:31,980
 there must be some sort of spiritual encounter with God.

368
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,320
 Some people would encounter God with a different ways.

369
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,140
 Some people would encounter God

370
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,600
 in a totally different means,

371
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,080
 and some people would cry for three days.

372
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,980
 Some people would just feel it, and life goes on.

373
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,540
 But those are real experience.

374
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,280
 Those are real spiritual encounter with God,

375
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,260
 and that goes into our memory,

376
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,780
 and this is what exactly what David is doing.

377
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:00,940
 He recall in his memory, in the midst of wilderness,

378
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:03,320
 in the midst of tough time.

379
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,100
 Do you do that?

380
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,360
 Do you do that when life gets difficult?

381
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,120
 When life gets tough?

382
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,100
 You recall memories with God, right?

383
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,600
 I wonder if you have ever lived with someone

384
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:20,680
 who has suffered Alzheimer's disease.

385
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,420
 Have you ever?

386
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,940
 Have you ever?

387
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:29,260
 For some years, my mother-in-law

388
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,680
 was suffering Alzheimer's disease.

389
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:36,260
 Now, Alzheimer's disease is painful to see.

390
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,860
 It's painful to experience with her,

391
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,740
 because at least physically,

392
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,740
 I mean, her organs or body functions

393
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:48,340
 are continually deteriorating.

394
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,380
 But I think the most painful thing

395
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:55,860
 to see her going through suffering Alzheimer's disease

396
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,700
 is the loss of memory.

397
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:01,040
 She lost much of her memory,

398
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,160
 and she lost herself.

399
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,500
 She doesn't know who she is.

400
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,080
 Not to mention where she is, right?

401
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,180
 I remember that one time, she always go out for a walk,

402
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,760
 and there was one afternoon, I came back home,

403
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,020
 and we came back home, and we don't find her.

404
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,680
 So we're kind of very desperate.

405
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:31,880
 And then I drove my car around the neighborhood,

406
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,740
 every single block, searching for her.

407
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,940
 And all of a sudden, on Western Avenue, on Western,

408
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,620
 I found a cop, and there she is.

409
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:47,700
 The cop is talking to her, but she doesn't know English.

410
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:52,100
 She doesn't know where she is.

411
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,880
 And then, thank God, we found her.

412
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,100
 And then I talked to the cop, and he says,

413
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,720
 "My mother-in-law, okay, I want to pick her up."

414
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,360
 So he was kind enough, and no question asked,

415
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,200
 and we bring her home.

416
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:10,580
 It's painful to see that she just don't know where she is.

417
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,740
 She don't know who she is.

418
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:18,020
 And after she came home, a couple hours later,

419
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:20,460
 we asked her, "What happened?

420
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,820
 "What happened, Mom?"

421
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:24,400
 She cannot recall.

422
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,200
 She cannot recall.

423
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:29,300
 And I told her, "We were searching for you.

424
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,280
 "You got lost in the neighborhood,

425
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,000
 "and some of the neighbors encountered you

426
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,120
 "and called the police.

427
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,320
 "That's why you came home."

428
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,500
 And she cannot remember, recall any of this experience.

429
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,700
 I think God is merciful to those people,

430
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,220
 because they just don't know who they are.

431
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,720
 And they even cannot sustain their belief.

432
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:01,540
 If you ask her questions about faith,

433
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,040
 she cannot respond positively.

434
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,240
 Memory loss.

435
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,900
 Now, what I'm trying to say is,

436
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,300
 memory is a powerful thing.

437
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,800
 Memory defines us.

438
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,000
 When you meet someone who's new to you,

439
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,320
 meaning a new friend, what do you ask?

440
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,320
 How do you know someone?

441
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:24,780
 Hearing the story, right?

442
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,180
 If you want to get to know someone

443
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,640
 or introduce yourself to someone else, what do you do?

444
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,200
 You talk about yourself.

445
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,980
 You talk about your story, your history,

446
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,960
 your memory, where it came from,

447
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:39,360
 and what did I do, and what happened to me

448
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,900
 in the past few years, or whatever.

449
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,980
 It's your memory that connects with other people.

450
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,020
 And memory is a powerful thing.

451
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,860
 And in the wilderness, Psalm 63,

452
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,400
 David is recalling his past experience with God.

453
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,700
 I have seen you with my own eyes.

454
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,240
 The sanctuary, the temple, the glorious temple,

455
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,440
 the sacrifice, the songs that I hear,

456
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:08,780
 the choirs that are singing the praise and worship.

457
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,120
 Other people of God in the community.

458
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,300
 That's why his spiritual life is vibrant.

459
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:16,280
 Now, how do you sustain yourself?

460
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,860
 How do you even grow in the wilderness?

461
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:22,020
 The answer is to remember.

462
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:27,740
 To memorize what God has done in your lives.

463
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:31,740
 So often we think when life is not going well,

464
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,600
 only if God can turn around my bad situation,

465
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,880
 then everything will go well, right?

466
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,960
 This is our naive prayer.

467
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,660
 Now, of course we want to get healing, right,

468
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,880
 when we're sick.

469
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,480
 Of course when we lack of money,

470
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,580
 we want God to shower us some cash, right?

471
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:53,400
 Turn around our circumstances, turn bad into good,

472
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,720
 and then we'll praise God, we'll thank God, right?

473
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,360
 No, of course, we'll pray that way, right?

474
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,940
 We'll pray in that orientation.

475
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:05,340
 But don't you know, at least from the Old Testament,

476
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,900
 or from our real life situation,

477
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:11,060
 when people find themselves, everything is going well.

478
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:13,080
 It's going well.

479
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:16,020
 They forget about God.

480
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,960
 For the Old Testament, story after story,

481
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,840
 the people of God, when God bless them,

482
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,260
 they forget about God, right?

483
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,080
 They forget about Him, and they follow the idols.

484
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,580
 They follow money.

485
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,960
 They worship gold and silver.

486
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,880
 This is the irony in our relationship with God.

487
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,940
 However, David is not praying

488
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:48,260
 that God will take him out of wilderness.

489
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:51,340
 In the wilderness, he recall his past experience.

490
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:55,500
 He recall his experience of worshiping God in the temple,

491
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,500
 worshiping God with other people.

492
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:04,880
 And guys, this is how you keep yourself,

493
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,320
 sustain yourself in the presence of God,

494
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,960
 in the love of God.

495
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,960
 It does not merely depend on your circumstances.

496
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,100
 It does not depend merely on your external condition.

497
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:24,480
 It is right here, the soul scape.

498
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,800
 It's not the landscape that defines you.

499
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:27,960
 It's the soul scape.

500
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:31,300
 It's your relationship with God Himself.

501
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:37,360
 I remember I had a really good friend,

502
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,020
 and his life really inspired me.

503
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:44,600
 What it means to be a Christian.

504
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,440
 You know, he's a very humble man, very quiet man,

505
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,300
 but his faith is rock solid.

506
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,640
 I remember in his last days,

507
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,460
 I went to ICU to visit him.

508
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,380
 He couldn't talk.

509
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,400
 He couldn't talk.

510
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,760
 He could only say a few words.

511
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,100
 But his faith is rock solid.

512
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,920
 Now that inspires me because,

513
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,180
 not because he was so blessed, right?

514
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,380
 Not because everything is going well with him.

515
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,420
 On the other hand, he's not going well, right?

516
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,040
 He was suffering from cancer.

517
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,880
 But in his whole life,

518
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:24,480
 he becomes inspiration for many of us,

519
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:27,480
 because even in times of wilderness,

520
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,480
 he lives in the presence of God.

521
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,080
 He and God have a relationship.

522
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,420
 Have a close, personal relationship.

523
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:42,340
 And that inspired me because of his faith.

524
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:46,500
 He reminds me there is some other reality in the world.

525
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:50,540
 It's not just something we can hear

526
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,280
 or we can touch right now.

527
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,740
 It's not just here and now.

528
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,220
 There is another world.

529
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:59,300
 There is another hope that transcends everything.

530
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:02,660
 That inspires me.

531
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,320
 The goodness of God.

532
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,780
 Now we will continue to study the psalm,

533
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:10,140
 but I want to leave you this challenge today.

534
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,060
 Is God really your God?

535
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:16,160
 Or you just follow your friends?

536
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,380
 Yeah, we have a good time, right?

537
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:20,880
 But God is just someone else's, not yours.

538
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:26,380
 You are my God.

539
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,800
 Earnestly I seek.

540
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:31,340
 And if you find yourself in times of wilderness,

541
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:34,880
 I pray that your life will continue

542
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:37,500
 and completely transform.

543
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,680
 It's not just a quick fix.

544
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,380
 All right, everything goes well.

545
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,100
 And then I forget about God.

546
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,520
 And life goes on.

547
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,380
 God is taking the landscape into your soul scape.

548
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:54,400
 He's working something transformative in your spirit

549
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:59,180
 so that you will draw closer and closer to God.

550
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:00,960
 Let's all pray together.

551
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,060
 No matter where you are

552
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:06,340
 and what is going through in your life.

553
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:09,060
 I pray that you take a moment before God

554
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,820
 to reorient yourself.

555
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:16,600
 God, thank you.

556
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,000
 You are the God who listens to our prayers.

557
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,660
 Thank you for all the emotions that we encounter.

558
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:27,640
 All the emotional highs and lows

559
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:31,220
 that you allow to have happen in our lives.

560
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:35,220
 For our experience to transform us,

561
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,380
 to bring us closer to you.

562
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:41,620
 I pray especially for those sisters and brothers

563
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,420
 who are going through some tough time of wilderness

564
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:47,620
 where there's no water and they're exhausted.

565
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,820
 I pray for your strength.

566
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:53,300
 I pray that your presence will be real to them.

567
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:56,700
 You will walk through the wilderness with them.

568
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
 You will be with them.

569
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,780
 You will let them sense your presence

570
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:06,120
 as something so real that we can take it

571
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:10,360
 and call you our God, our personal God.

572
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,180
 And thank you for being our great and faithful Lord.

573
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:20,660
 I pray that every step of the way in this coming week,

574
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,820
 you will grant strength and grace to your people.

575
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,980
 That your church will be built up

576
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,140
 and your people will be closer to you.

577
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,800
 In Christ's name, we pray, amen.

578
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,800
 In Christ's name we pray.

579
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:33,800
 Amen.

580
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,640
 Amen.
