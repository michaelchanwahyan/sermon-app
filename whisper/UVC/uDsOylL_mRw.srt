1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,800
 - Thank you so much for your appreciation

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,200
 and I really appreciate and really encourage us as staff

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,140
 to continue to be faithful

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,140
 and we'll put your gifts in good use, all right?

5
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,480
 We could put your gifts in good use.

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:21,480
 Today, we're going to continue our series on way of wisdom.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,800
 How do we live a life of wisdom?

8
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:26,580
 And the Bible has so much to say about it.

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,580
 And remember this passage that I talk about last week

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,880
 and it's from chapter 24 of Proverbs.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:41,920
 And here, the wise teacher is going through

12
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,160
 some observation and he went past the field

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,240
 of the lazy people, sluggard,

14
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:51,800
 and he saw that everything is in ruin

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,800
 and he's trying to apply from his observation of the nature

16
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,940
 and apply it to his spiritual life, his personal life.

17
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,340
 So again, in the book of Proverbs,

18
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:08,740
 it's not simply about natural observation.

19
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,740
 It's about observing and then get some spiritual insight

20
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,860
 so that your life can be built up.

21
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,300
 And one has to work against and fight against

22
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,040
 the chaos in our lives.

23
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:24,760
 You know, in the past week, have you thought the chaos

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,620
 or the chaos overwhelm you?

25
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:29,880
 You know, there are tons of chaos around us

26
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:32,920
 and if we don't put energy to work against it

27
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,680
 and fight against it, it will be a field of sluggard

28
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,640
 and it will be in ruin.

29
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,480
 And your spiritual life, your personal life,

30
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,680
 your marriage, your family, your work, your career,

31
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,080
 everything will be in ruin.

32
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,740
 And one has to do that and that is what the wisdom literature

33
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:54,000
 or the book of Proverbs has to say to us.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,480
 It's bottom up, observe how life works.

35
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:01,360
 Observe the moral order, the spiritual order

36
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,760
 of God's universe and to observe that

37
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:10,020
 so that you can get spiritual insight from it.

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,520
 Now, sometimes we have to understand how to read Proverbs.

39
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:18,360
 So I really wanna encourage you to read Proverbs.

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,720
 And here I give you a simple structure

41
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,160
 of the book of Proverbs.

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,360
 And in this book, there are 31 chapters.

43
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
 And if you zoom out a little bit,

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,320
 you find that there's a whole structure of the book.

45
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,480
 And you begin with the first nine chapters,

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,880
 which is the introduction.

47
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,280
 It's a prolonged introduction.

48
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,560
 It's an invitation to walk in wisdom.

49
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,720
 And you get the sense that the father or the mother

50
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,220
 is telling the son to walk in wisdom,

51
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:49,840
 to invite him to be wise, to learn the way of wisdom,

52
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,080
 encouraging him and urging the son to choose wisdom

53
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,040
 and reject folly of the world.

54
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,760
 To choose God, reject the false gods in the world.

55
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
 And then you come to a long collections

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,280
 of individual sayings from chapter 10 to 30.

57
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,840
 And if you read those chapters, have you tried it?

58
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,780
 If you try to read one verse after another,

59
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,940
 it's sequentially, you try to understand it,

60
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:22,940
 you can't find a really tight flow of argument.

61
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:27,220
 Because it is not designed to be like that.

62
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,220
 It's a collection of a lot of different wise sayings

63
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,540
 and put them together.

64
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,140
 It's like an anthology.

65
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,780
 You know what an anthology is?

66
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,700
 It's a collection of essays.

67
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,460
 It's a collection of articles in a book.

68
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,860
 So there's not necessarily a logical flow from it.

69
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,860
 So you can read chapter 10 to 30

70
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:53,400
 the same way you read the Book of Romans.

71
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,360
 You know, the Book of Romans, we are doing bio study on it

72
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,580
 and we are still on the early chapters of the Book of Romans

73
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:03,340
 and you have to read it from verse one, verse two, verse three

74
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,100
 because Paul is trying to build an argument there

75
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,700
 and try to explain some of the themes

76
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:14,580
 and is trying to carry you through

77
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,900
 with some sort of sequential, you know, logical flow.

78
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,700
 But in the Book of Proverbs, it's not like that.

79
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:24,100
 So in order to understand chapter 10 to 30,

80
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:28,540
 the best way, I think, is to read them topically.

81
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:31,380
 Is to read through it and then you try to collect

82
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,060
 some of the things that is related

83
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:37,360
 to a certain kind of topic.

84
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:40,440
 For example, money.

85
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,740
 Wealth and money.

86
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:46,980
 The Proverb has a lot to say about money, about wealth.

87
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:49,020
 So you read through those chapters

88
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,700
 and try to collect those things.

89
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,340
 Just like you go to Whole Foods,

90
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,380
 you want to buy something and then you go through

91
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:56,980
 different aisles and then you pick what you want.

92
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,380
 It's kind of like that because, you know,

93
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,380
 wisdom is kind of like that.

94
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,460
 Wisdom is observing and collecting

95
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:06,580
 and try to organize things.

96
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:09,740
 So you read through these chapters 10 to 30

97
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,420
 with a certain kind of topic in your mind,

98
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:14,500
 like family life, work and career,

99
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:19,940
 speech, how we speak and when to speak,

100
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,100
 wisdom of speaking.

101
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:26,100
 You categorize them under different topics,

102
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,420
 under different headings, and then you try to understand

103
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,460
 what the wise is trying to tell you.

104
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:36,220
 And today, I want to demonstrate this topical reading.

105
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,220
 And we're going to understand or study the theme of pride

106
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,580
 and humility.

107
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,220
 Pride and humility.

108
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,300
 What is that?

109
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:53,580
 So when you think of humility or pride,

110
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,420
 what do you think of?

111
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,680
 How do you define it?

112
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,580
 How do you describe humility?

113
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,580
 How do you describe pride?

114
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,940
 And from my understanding, we'll read through

115
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,600
 some of the Proverbs that has to do with this topic.

116
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,580
 And I organize it into two related headings.

117
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,720
 First heading is humility leads to more wisdom.

118
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,780
 That's what humility will do to you.

119
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,780
 The second topic is humility will lead to more life,

120
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:29,660
 life in God, more substantial growth in your life.

121
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,000
 So in these two headings, I want to study with you

122
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,760
 what humility, what pride is.

123
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:39,820
 Now, first of all, what humility is not.

124
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,820
 What is not humility?

125
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,100
 What is not?

126
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,080
 Now, humility is not humiliation.

127
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,960
 Humility and humiliation are totally different things.

128
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,940
 All right, the difference is very, very, very important.

129
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:59,940
 Because especially for some of us who grow up

130
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,440
 in a shame-based culture, a shame-driven culture,

131
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,440
 you know, the Asian culture, is very much shame-based.

132
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:13,100
 And humiliation sometimes is messed up with,

133
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,440
 misunderstood to be humility.

134
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,880
 Humiliation or self-abasement, it's to shame yourself

135
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,520
 into thinking that you are worthless.

136
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,040
 You know, less worth than other people.

137
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,280
 Have less value than other people.

138
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,740
 And it's very intriguing because at times,

139
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,560
 and this is how I experience it,

140
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,340
 is that we think that we don't measure up

141
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,380
 and we have to compare ourselves to others.

142
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,380
 And in doing so, we try to prove that we are better.

143
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,440
 We try to assert our own value

144
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,240
 by comparing ourselves to others.

145
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,240
 But this is a whole complex of pride and, you know,

146
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:06,240
 humiliation, because when you compare yourself

147
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:09,600
 with other people, so often the result is that,

148
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:14,380
 okay, maybe I still have something that you do not have.

149
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,400
 I still get something that you don't.

150
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,360
 And it's very easy to fall into another trap for pride.

151
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:28,960
 I compare myself with you, against you,

152
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,880
 and I find that, okay, maybe you are better,

153
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,880
 but maybe there's some way I'm better than you,

154
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,780
 even though there's some other things

155
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,560
 that you are better than me.

156
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,800
 Now, that is not humility.

157
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,760
 Humility in the Bible says that, yes, I'm broken,

158
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:51,760
 I am sinful, but God accepts me unconditionally in Christ.

159
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,760
 You see, this will free you up from comparison.

160
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:02,280
 This will free you up from being arrogant, from pride,

161
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:07,920
 because humility is seeing yourself as low,

162
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:12,360
 humble, in front of God.

163
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,960
 No one can measure up to God's standard.

164
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,960
 So we come before God and we know, okay,

165
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:23,960
 we are sinful, we are sinful, and we are humble.

166
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:30,200
 However, we are totally accepted unconditionally in Christ.

167
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,240
 And that's the ground we stand on.

168
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,080
 That is humility in the Bible.

169
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,920
 Look with me, chapter 15.

170
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:44,120
 "Whoever ignores instruction despises himself,

171
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,880
 but he who listens to reproof gains intelligence," wisdom.

172
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:56,880
 33, "The fear of the Lord is instruction in wisdom,

173
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,360
 and humility comes before honor."

174
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:04,360
 All right, let's begin with the last verse here,

175
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,560
 the second verse, verse 33.

176
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,840
 What is humility here?

177
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,680
 Look the parallel here.

178
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,320
 You know, the wise saying always says,

179
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,920
 two short sentences put together.

180
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,160
 Look the parallel between two sentences in verse 33.

181
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,400
 "Fear of the Lord is parallel with humility.

182
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:28,800
 Fear of the Lord, as I explained briefly last time,

183
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,960
 or other occasions, fear of the Lord means

184
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,360
 a proper relationship with God,

185
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,280
 a proper relationship with the Creator.

186
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,800
 That is the fear of the Lord.

187
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,800
 That's why I fear God, I worship God,

188
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,000
 because He is my Creator, He is my God."

189
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,840
 Right?

190
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,560
 So proper relationship with God is fear of the Lord.

191
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:56,560
 And that is parallel, or sort of equal to humility.

192
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,120
 To understand my relationship with God.

193
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,000
 You see, this is the gospel of Jesus Christ.

194
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,920
 This is the gospel.

195
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,440
 I'm totally, 100% accepted by Christ,

196
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,120
 and that is sheer grace of God.

197
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,160
 It's not because of my works.

198
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,480
 It's not because I'm better.

199
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,960
 It's not my goodness.

200
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,800
 I'm totally accepted because what Christ has done for me.

201
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,840
 Right?

202
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:24,240
 The righteousness of Christ.

203
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:29,200
 I'm solidly grounded in the love of Christ.

204
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,400
 And that is my security.

205
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,600
 My security does not come from

206
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,160
 because I'm better than my co-worker,

207
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,560
 or my co-worker is worse than me.

208
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:42,800
 My security does not come from,

209
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,840
 okay, I'm better than my friends,

210
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:47,400
 or better than other people, probably in the church,

211
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,240
 I'm better than them, so I feel better.

212
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,840
 That is a false sense of identity.

213
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,960
 That is idolatry.

214
00:11:53,960 --> 00:12:00,000
 But when you are properly related to Christ,

215
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,200
 you receive grace unconditionally,

216
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,320
 and you receive the gospel,

217
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,160
 that's where your identity and your security come from.

218
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,800
 You see what I'm saying?

219
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,800
 So we don't have to compare with other people,

220
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:21,120
 because I have a solid ground to stand on.

221
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,080
 That is the love of Christ, the grace of Christ.

222
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,120
 In my college year,

223
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:33,960
 I remember a good pastor who taught this.

224
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,960
 He shared one of his experience,

225
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,960
 and this pastor, I just love him.

226
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,520
 He's so wise.

227
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:43,960
 And this pastor told us,

228
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:47,960
 when he was much younger, when he was younger,

229
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,440
 and he joined the church,

230
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,880
 and he wanted to join the church choir.

231
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,080
 So there he was, and he joined the church choir,

232
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,240
 and he had rehearsal,

233
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,240
 and he served in the choir for a few times.

234
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,560
 And then one day, after the choir performance,

235
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,880
 or after the service,

236
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,880
 the choir director pulled him aside,

237
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:15,280
 gently and firmly said to him,

238
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:17,680
 and asked him, "Dear brother,

239
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,840
 "do you really think that God calls you to be in the choir,

240
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:23,760
 "because you're tone deaf?"

241
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,200
 And for the few times he was trying to join the choir,

242
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,440
 because he liked to sing.

243
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,760
 He likes to sing.

244
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,600
 He likes to sing hymns and praises to God.

245
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,480
 So he wants to join the choir, or the worship team.

246
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:44,840
 And then it just dawned on him that he was tone deaf.

247
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,240
 He just cannot sing in tune.

248
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,120
 And he messed up other people in the choir.

249
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,440
 And after this realization,

250
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,440
 he understand he's not musically gifted.

251
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,680
 He's not musically gifted.

252
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,400
 Yes, he can sing praises to God,

253
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,200
 you know, in the congregation,

254
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,800
 probably it will annoy some of the people beside him,

255
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,560
 but he's not musically gifted.

256
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:10,840
 And that's how he come to a conclusion.

257
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,800
 And he shared with us his non-participation

258
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,400
 is helpful for the ministry.

259
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:24,800
 And he's not gonna be jealous and envious of other people.

260
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,880
 Other people who are musically gifted,

261
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,280
 they can share the stage.

262
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,160
 They can lead other people to worship,

263
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,080
 but he's not gifted.

264
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,240
 But he was totally secure.

265
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:40,560
 He doesn't feel bad.

266
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,600
 He doesn't feel sad.

267
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,400
 That's how God created me.

268
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,280
 That's how God gifted me.

269
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,640
 And that's how I use my gifts.

270
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,720
 And he is very gifted in teaching.

271
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,440
 Not in music, not in worship,

272
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,640
 but he is very gifted in teaching.

273
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,120
 And that's why he's trying to polish his craft

274
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,720
 and to be a good teacher.

275
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,200
 And he was a good teacher and he is a good teacher.

276
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,240
 And that's what humility does to you.

277
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,720
 You listen to advice.

278
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:12,960
 You listen to those who teaches you.

279
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:17,960
 And he who listens to reproof gains wisdom,

280
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,160
 gains intelligence.

281
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,920
 Now, what is humility?

282
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,760
 I like what C.S. Lewis says about humility.

283
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:31,760
 C.S. Lewis is a very famous, well-known theologian

284
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,960
 or apologist in the 20th century.

285
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,440
 Oh, he passed away a long time,

286
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,240
 but he wrote a lot of things

287
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:42,280
 and people are still studying the works of C.S. Lewis.

288
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,760
 In fact, there was a institute of C.S. Lewis

289
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,160
 and people trying to understand what he wrote.

290
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,000
 He wrote so much.

291
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,120
 And C.S. Lewis says about humility.

292
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,000
 He says, "Humility is not thinking less of you,

293
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
 "but thinking of yourself less."

294
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,040
 Amen?

295
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,440
 Humility is not humiliation.

296
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,960
 It's not thinking less of yourself,

297
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,800
 but thinking yourself a little bit less.

298
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:15,920
 Because if you're totally grounded in the grace of God

299
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,920
 and the love of God, you're free.

300
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,000
 You're free to compare yourself

301
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,040
 and contrast yourself with others.

302
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,240
 And that, as I explained, will lead to humiliation

303
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,360
 or a kind of subtle pride.

304
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,680
 Humiliation in the sense that I don't measure up

305
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,640
 and I'm jealous, I'm envious of other people.

306
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,800
 They have other gifts and I don't have.

307
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:42,800
 And so you're kind of in this loop of humiliation.

308
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:48,480
 And the other result is pride,

309
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,280
 is seeing at least I'm better than you.

310
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:56,040
 No, there's a very, very intriguing complex to it.

311
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,960
 But humility is not thinking less of yourself,

312
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,960
 but thinking of yourself less.

313
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,360
 And the book of Proverbs has so much to say

314
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,600
 about pride and humility.

315
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,500
 Humility is the way of wisdom.

316
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,480
 Another verse in 1310.

317
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:18,920
 It says, "Pride only breeds quarrels."

318
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,440
 But wisdom is found in those who take advice.

319
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,720
 You know, have you ever argued with someone?

320
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,400
 Have argument with the other people?

321
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:37,440
 Either your spouse or your child or a friend

322
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,060
 or whoever that is, or even your pastor.

323
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,080
 You see, in the midst of argument,

324
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,040
 so often there is pride, right?

325
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,320
 I want to prove that I'm right and you are wrong.

326
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,800
 You know, in premarital counseling,

327
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,000
 I always tell the couples, I always tell couples,

328
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,480
 in marriage, marriage is only game in town

329
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,260
 that you have the result of,

330
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:13,000
 you don't have the result of win-lose.

331
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,880
 You always have both of you lose

332
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,020
 or both of you win.

333
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:25,240
 There's no win and being lost in marriage.

334
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,880
 Because if you lay down yourself,

335
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,120
 if you grounded yourself in the love of Christ,

336
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:36,260
 in the grace of God, there's no pride.

337
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,360
 If there's no pride, there's no argument.

338
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:41,980
 You listen to one another.

339
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,600
 You learn from one another.

340
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:47,680
 See, wisdom is found in those who take advice,

341
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,300
 who listen to advice.

342
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:53,400
 Last night, we have a small gathering

343
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,400
 with some of the husbands in the church.

344
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,120
 And this is kind of a once in a while,

345
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,200
 once in probably nine months or 10 months,

346
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,320
 we get together for a simple dinner.

347
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,320
 So I went there and to my surprise,

348
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,920
 we had so much to talk about.

349
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,200
 So I show up in the restaurant at 7 p.m., 7 at night.

350
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,800
 Went to Phoenix, 7 o'clock.

351
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:25,000
 And I was planning to have a dinner for two hours,

352
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,280
 for two hour max, right?

353
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,000
 What do men talk about?

354
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,100
 Men have nothing to talk about.

355
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:33,560
 But when we sit down and then we warm up

356
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,520
 and then we go into talk about life

357
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,440
 and talk about family in general,

358
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,200
 to my surprise, we had a five hours dinner.

359
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,080
 Five hours dinner.

360
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,480
 I got home after 11.

361
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:52,360
 Yeah, but I really enjoyed the community.

362
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,280
 I really enjoyed the group, you know,

363
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,320
 try to open up ourselves and see,

364
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,440
 hey, you know, can we listen to one another

365
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
 and learn from one another?

366
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,120
 Now, I want to tell you,

367
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,580
 this kind of community does not come easily.

368
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,520
 Does not come naturally.

369
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:13,760
 For us, for many of us, we have to commit

370
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,820
 in order to cultivate that kind of relationship.

371
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:20,320
 We have to open up and we have to make commitment

372
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,880
 to spend time with one another.

373
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,760
 Otherwise it won't happen, right?

374
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,000
 You go to church sometimes,

375
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,880
 you find the conversation is not deep.

376
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,760
 And you get tired, you don't want to have fellowship.

377
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,100
 You know why?

378
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,880
 It's not because people are shallow.

379
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:42,800
 All of us are yearning for meaningful conversation.

380
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,760
 However, in order to do that,

381
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,120
 there is investment.

382
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,280
 We have to spend time and commitment

383
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,560
 to stick to one another in order to cultivate

384
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:00,200
 that kind of family, that kind of community.

385
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,800
 So with the men, we talked so much about,

386
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:05,920
 you know, how to lead the family,

387
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,360
 how to relate to our kids,

388
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,800
 how to deal with the local politics,

389
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,000
 you know, election is coming,

390
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
 and what are we concerned about,

391
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,520
 and why do we concern about this or that with our kids?

392
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,640
 And it was a very, very open

393
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:24,280
 and just great time together sharing

394
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,360
 and communication with one another,

395
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:30,000
 you know, over a glass of wine.

396
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,480
 And that is wisdom, right?

397
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,240
 The community is the wisdom.

398
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,280
 So here we come to the second heading,

399
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:44,200
 which is humility leads to life.

400
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,480
 Humility will give you more life.

401
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,760
 If you gain wisdom and then you get life

402
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,560
 and then you get better life,

403
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:55,560
 a godly life, and then it will return back to you

404
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,920
 and will give you more humility.

405
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,680
 And you will be humble before God and you learn more

406
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,200
 and then you get more wisdom.

407
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,440
 And this is a kind of a circularity.

408
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,960
 Circularity in terms of, you know,

409
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,880
 you give and then it will give back to you.

410
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,800
 1618, pride goes before destruction.

411
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,360
 Haunted spirit before a fall.

412
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,120
 Now, this is the observation of the wise teacher.

413
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,320
 He observed there was an order in your life,

414
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,080
 order in human life in general.

415
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,200
 This is the cosmic order.

416
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,200
 You think you're powerful, you're invincible.

417
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,520
 If you're prideful, you will fall.

418
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:48,960
 You will fall, inevitably.

419
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,400
 Because I'm preparing some of the messages

420
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,800
 for my trip to Toronto,

421
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,560
 I'm talking about the book of Daniel,

422
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,040
 especially the later chapters of Daniel.

423
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,960
 Those are really tough chapters.

424
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,840
 You have to do a lot of interpretation,

425
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:10,000
 do a lot of careful reading.

426
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,320
 And I was doing some research,

427
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,760
 because the later chapters of the book of Daniel

428
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,360
 is all about the rise and fall of human kingdoms.

429
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:22,520
 Rise and fall of human kings, like Assyrian kings

430
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,320
 and Babylonian kingdom and Persian kingdom

431
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,880
 and the Greek kingdom, the Greek empire.

432
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,880
 It's all about the rise and fall of human empire on earth.

433
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,360
 And only God's kingdom is eternal.

434
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,000
 And that's pretty much what the later books,

435
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,480
 or later chapters of the book of Daniel is all about.

436
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,600
 So I was doing some research on the rise and fall of kingdoms

437
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,800
 and it's kind of fun research.

438
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,040
 And now, of course, when we talk about

439
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,480
 the fall of any empire, any king,

440
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:58,080
 it's a whole complexity of factors go into it.

441
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,000
 How do you explain the fall of an empire?

442
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:07,040
 Either in recent history, like the Soviet Union,

443
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,520
 fell in 1991, if I'm not mistaken,

444
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,540
 recent history, or in ancient history, in biblical time.

445
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:20,300
 Now, how do you explain the fall of any empire?

446
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,700
 Of course, there are a lot of different factors go into it.

447
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:28,960
 You know, economic slowdown or political corruption

448
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:33,960
 or the fall of, the collapse of their social structure

449
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,760
 or social unrest or there's a food supply,

450
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:40,360
 you know, farm surplus, not enough.

451
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,320
 You know, those things.

452
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,440
 But the newest research I want to share with you,

453
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,020
 the newest research is actually climate change.

454
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,920
 Climate change.

455
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:54,440
 You never thought of it, right?

456
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:58,280
 Never thought of it because, you know, an empire fell

457
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:02,080
 because, of course, it's mismanagement

458
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,440
 by one of the bad king, right?

459
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,960
 The last king.

460
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,840
 And the newest research has to say

461
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:12,040
 there's one more factor that we have forgotten.

462
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,680
 It's climate change.

463
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,160
 For example, this one.

464
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,220
 How did the Assyrian Empire fall?

465
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:24,320
 Now, Assyrian Empire, as you tell from the Old Testament,

466
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,280
 is the most powerful kingdom,

467
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,560
 the first most powerful empire

468
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,160
 the ancient world has ever seen.

469
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:39,920
 Ancient first empire, Assyria,

470
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:44,260
 from the seventh century to down to,

471
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,960
 well, from the ninth century down to the seventh century,

472
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:51,160
 200 years, 200 some years of powerful empire.

473
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:54,000
 And they conquered land after land after land,

474
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,240
 conquered their whole world.

475
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,120
 And why did they fall?

476
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:02,640
 Now, the researchers are saying

477
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,540
 not only the social factors or political factors,

478
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,820
 but there's climate change.

479
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:11,240
 There's 125 years of magnet drought.

480
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,600
 125 years.

481
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:15,520
 Now, one year of drought, you know,

482
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,080
 you probably can, you know, go through it.

483
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,240
 Two years, you probably can go through it.

484
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,980
 10 years, probably you can go through it

485
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:25,480
 because you have enough surplus.

486
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,480
 But, you know, 125 years of mega drought,

487
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,740
 that happened in the last 100 years of the Assyrian Empire.

488
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:38,360
 That's why the empire fell.

489
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,340
 It collapsed.

490
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:44,240
 Now, that's very, very relevant for our day, of course,

491
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,480
 because it's climate change, right?

492
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:51,480
 You see all this extreme climate pattern in Florida,

493
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,160
 in some of the places, in the wildfire, hurricane,

494
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,460
 wipe out everything.

495
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:00,640
 Of course, it has so much to say about

496
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,960
 what the Bible has to teach us about creation care,

497
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,200
 about environment and all that, right?

498
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,800
 And many researchers are focusing

499
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,840
 on this kind of direction.

500
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,680
 You know why?

501
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,960
 Because not only because this is a relevant topic,

502
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,040
 it is because you cannot control it.

503
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:23,400
 You cannot control it.

504
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,480
 No matter how invincible you are,

505
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,600
 you just cannot control climate.

506
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,260
 Now, that's what pride is.

507
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:37,700
 To the empire, to the king,

508
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,840
 they always think that they are invincible.

509
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,660
 Pride means self-sufficiency.

510
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,800
 I'm all good.

511
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,620
 I don't need other power, right?

512
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,720
 I can stand on my own.

513
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,820
 I have my success, achievement, it's all mine.

514
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,000
 It's by my power.

515
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,960
 That's what pride is, self-sufficiency.

516
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,180
 There are factors that you cannot control.

517
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,820
 Even for empire, you just cannot control it.

518
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:18,020
 And that means you are not invincible.

519
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:20,000
 You better be humble.

520
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,180
 Last verse I wanna share with you is 22.4.

521
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:27,600
 Humility and the fear of the Lord

522
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,640
 bring wealth and honor and life.

523
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:34,760
 Humility will give you life,

524
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,440
 but pride will give you collapse.

525
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,960
 Think about some of the examples

526
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:45,580
 that you probably have some in mind.

527
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:50,280
 How personal life, how someone who is so successful,

528
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,160
 and he fell and collapsed.

529
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:56,600
 Moral collapse, spiritual collapse.

530
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,680
 Think about even religious institution.

531
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,040
 It can fall.

532
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,780
 If you think you're invincible,

533
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,080
 if you think you don't need to be accountable,

534
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:11,220
 what lesson we need to learn?

535
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,620
 Humility and the fear of the Lord,

536
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,780
 again, it's a parallel here,

537
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,500
 bring you wealth, honor, and life.

538
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:22,360
 You cannot be pride, prideful,

539
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,820
 and think that you've got everything under your belt.

540
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:30,260
 You see, the book is telling you

541
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,160
 you have to walk in the way of wisdom.

542
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:38,160
 You need to surround yourself with other people of God,

543
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,380
 other godly people.

544
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:44,100
 You cannot go through the spiritual journey by yourself.

545
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:48,080
 You have to have someone to help you,

546
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,760
 and that is humility.

547
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,140
 And this will give you wealth and honor and life.

548
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:57,800
 Now, I like the package here,

549
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,400
 wealth, honor, and life, especially the word honor.

550
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:05,760
 You know, in Hebrew, Hebrew is a very concrete language.

551
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,920
 It's very concrete language

552
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,960
 because you use a word picture all the time.

553
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:15,960
 And honor, this word, is kavod in Hebrew.

554
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:16,840
 And what does it mean?

555
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:21,560
 Kavod means something really heavy, weightlifting.

556
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,080
 Have you been to gym?

557
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,400
 Weightlifting, that is kavod.

558
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,140
 That is something heavy.

559
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,360
 Life has substance.

560
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,580
 If you have honor, you have substance.

561
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,480
 And humility will give you that.

562
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,680
 The fear of the Lord will give you that.

563
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:43,840
 So that's why we need to learn how to be humble.

564
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,500
 And remember, we have to ground ourselves

565
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,820
 in the sheer grace of God.

566
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:54,220
 And once we do that, we have security, true humility.

567
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:58,320
 So we can do what God has called us to do.

568
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:04,320
 Kelly has reminded us of the need for Bible study.

569
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,080
 Now, I want to challenge and I want to encourage you.

570
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,480
 Yes, we do need that.

571
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,020
 To study the word of God,

572
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:14,120
 to listen to other brothers and sisters,

573
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:17,680
 and to be led so that you can understand the word of God.

574
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,480
 We all need that, you know.

575
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,340
 If you think you know it all,

576
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:27,200
 I think among us here,

577
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:31,800
 I would say I'm the one know it all, right?

578
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,560
 But you know, every time I have Bible study

579
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,800
 with other people, other brothers and sisters,

580
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,360
 sometimes we go tangent, okay, fine.

581
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,320
 But you know, I always learn something.

582
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,160
 I always learn something.

583
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,280
 I'm not going to say, you know, you guys,

584
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,080
 you know, you don't know much about,

585
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,600
 you know, the scripture and all that.

586
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,340
 That would be pride.

587
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:57,240
 But every time I get together with other people

588
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,800
 and listen to their life

589
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,640
 and listen to how they read the word

590
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,880
 and what they get from the truth of God,

591
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,320
 you know, that will cultivate wisdom.

592
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,040
 And we all need this.

593
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,480
 And humility will give you reward.

594
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:15,600
 And the reward is eternal life,

595
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,500
 wealth, honor, and life.

596
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,260
 Let's all pray together.

597
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:26,640
 And ask Father to grant us true humility.

598
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,800
 Father, we come before you.

599
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:32,880
 You are the source of our life.

600
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,760
 You created us.

601
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,440
 You gifted us in so many different ways.

602
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,360
 And we want to praise you.

603
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,120
 We want to give you thanks because we are all different.

604
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,660
 We're all gifted in a wide diversity of way.

605
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,760
 And that is your will.

606
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,120
 And that is your goodwill.

607
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,300
 Thank you, Father, for calling all of us to be your people.

608
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,380
 Teach us the way of wisdom.

609
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:04,060
 Teach us the way of humility.

610
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,040
 Help us to learn.

611
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,720
 Learn about your word.

612
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:12,560
 Learn about what you're doing in our life.

613
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,140
 Help us to be grounded in your sufficient love.

614
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:22,220
 And God, you are the all-sufficient God.

615
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,220
 And we are not.

616
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,020
 We're not sufficient.

617
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,260
 That's why we need your word.

618
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:29,220
 We need your community.

619
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,860
 We need your love.

620
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:33,100
 Thank you for being our God.

621
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:37,140
 And call us and encourage us

622
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,060
 so that we'll walk humbly before you.

623
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,780
 Help us to look in our lives

624
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:45,780
 in the light of what Christ has done for us.

625
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,580
 So that we stand secure.

626
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:53,060
 We know that we are valuable in your sight.

627
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,940
 So valuable that your Son died on the cross to redeem us.

628
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:03,940
 Let our lives demonstrate your way,

629
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,940
 your way of wisdom.

630
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:08,280
 Help us, sisters and brothers in the church,

631
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,440
 we can learn from one another.

632
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,900
 Help us to cultivate that kind of spirit of learning,

633
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,700
 spirit of humility, to learn from one another,

634
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:19,080
 to learn how to fear you,

635
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,840
 so that we can walk in the way of godliness.

636
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,680
 Shape us and form us and transform us

637
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,640
 so that your word will be our guidance.

638
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:32,180
 Thank you for being our God, wisdom in Christ's name.

639
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,020
 We pray.

640
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,420
 Well, God bless you.

641
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,060
 And we have some refreshment out there.

642
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:42,140
 And again, I wanna thank you for all your support

643
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:45,580
 for our trip to Toronto.

644
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,700
 I'm leaving Chicago on Thursday.

645
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,100
 And we'll come back Monday night.

646
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,880
 And pray for us and pray for me

647
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,540
 as I speak to other churches.

648
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,720
 All right, I have six messages to give

649
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:06,720
 and pray for good well-being.

650
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,120
 All right?

651
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,180
 Okay, God bless you.

652
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:18,040
 And next week, Chi is preaching, all right?

653
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,640
 So please be here, please be here.

654
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,760
 I'm sure he will bring a word of wisdom to all of us.

655
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:25,600
 All right?
