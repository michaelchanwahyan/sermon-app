1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,880
 Good morning, UV.

2
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,880
 It is good to be able to worship with you this morning.

3
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:07,960
 And as Pastor Mark say, it's good to see some old faces back

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,280
 and also some new faces as well this morning.

5
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,280
 So welcome and thank you for joining us.

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,240
 So what are some of the hardest things

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,600
 that you have been asked to do before?

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,760
 Or if you think about it,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,800
 what are some of the most challenging tasks

10
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,040
 that you have gone through?

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:32,120
 As I reflect on my personal experience,

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:35,560
 I think they usually fall under a few categories.

13
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,640
 Some of these things are hard

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,520
 because they test our human limits

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,440
 and they push us to our very edge,

16
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,100
 intellectually, emotionally, or physically.

17
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:51,080
 This October, I will be running

18
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,800
 the Chicago Marathon as well.

19
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,480
 And even though I'm looking forward to it,

20
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,040
 there's also part of me that is somewhat nervous about it

21
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,440
 because I know that in order for me

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,760
 to finish these 26.2 miles,

23
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,140
 it will push me to my very limit.

24
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,840
 And on the other hand,

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,120
 some of the things are challenging

26
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,640
 because they require us to face our own fears.

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,040
 Think of extreme activities like skydiving,

28
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,280
 bungee jumping,

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,760
 or even small things like catching a cockroach or a spider.

30
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,320
 Right?

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,760
 And then there are certain things

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,040
 that are hard and challenging

33
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,880
 because of what they require from us

34
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,620
 to sacrifice our own preference.

35
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:45,920
 So the passage that we will be looking at today

36
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
 contains one of the most radical teachings

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,460
 and challenging commands from Jesus himself.

38
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,880
 It is difficult and challenging

39
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,360
 not because it pushes to our limits

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:58,840
 or it requires us to face our fears,

41
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,120
 but it is difficult because in order to do

42
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,880
 what Jesus has told us to do here,

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,500
 it requires us to completely deny ourself

44
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,320
 and our own self-interest.

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,880
 To put it another way,

46
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:17,400
 if we're not willing to give up our own pride,

47
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,280
 our preference, our convenience,

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,380
 our comfort, or the illusion of control that we have,

49
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:28,960
 this command from Jesus will almost be impossible

50
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,040
 for us to live out.

51
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,200
 So if you have your Bible with you,

52
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,800
 let's turn with me to Matthew chapter five.

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,280
 We're gonna look from verse 43 to 48 today.

54
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,960
 So Matthew chapter five, 43 to 48.

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,200
 But before we dive into God's word,

56
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,840
 let's pray that his spirit will be with us

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,160
 as we open up his words.

58
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:56,680
 Father, we thank you that we're able

59
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,800
 to come into your house this morning

60
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,840
 to lift up our praise to worship you.

61
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,340
 And as we open up your words now,

62
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:10,360
 I just ask that your Holy Spirit will be with us.

63
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,840
 I ask that your words

64
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,740
 will not just be knowledge for us,

65
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,040
 but it will be truth that will be able

66
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,220
 to transform our life,

67
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:27,080
 so that we're able to live in a way

68
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,000
 that brings honors and glory to you.

69
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,400
 Amen.

70
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,340
 So, Matthew chapter five, verse 43.

71
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,180
 You have heard that it was said,

72
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:43,620
 love your neighbor and hate your enemy.

73
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,940
 But I tell you, love your enemies

74
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,840
 and pray for those who persecute you,

75
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,000
 that you may be children of your Father in heaven.

76
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,520
 He causes his son to rise on the evil

77
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,100
 and the good,

78
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,660
 and sends rain to the righteous and the unrighteous.

79
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:07,160
 If you love those who love you,

80
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,220
 what reward will you get?

81
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,500
 Are not even the tax collectors doing that?

82
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,160
 And if you greet only your own people,

83
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,480
 what are you doing more than others?

84
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,260
 Do not even the pagans do that.

85
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:25,000
 Be perfect, therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,020
 This is the word of God.

87
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,680
 So today, we actually come to the end of Matthew chapter five

88
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,380
 and our passage today serve as sort of a conclusion

89
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:39,140
 to this first major sections in the Sermon on the Mount,

90
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,820
 where we look at the relationship of the Old Testament law

91
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,200
 to the new covenant of Jesus.

92
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,400
 And if you can recall, we begin this section

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,840
 by looking at what a truly blessed life is.

94
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,560
 And we come to this truth that

95
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:58,120
 because Jesus has fulfilled the law and the prophet,

96
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,200
 to enter into his kingdom

97
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,240
 and to experience this truly blessed life,

98
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,180
 it doesn't depend on our own righteousness,

99
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,680
 but the righteousness of Jesus alone.

100
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,240
 And right after that,

101
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:14,700
 we look at a series of case studies on how Jesus,

102
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:17,640
 now being the definite interpreter of the law,

103
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,600
 redefines what true righteousness mean

104
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
 in his kingdom of heaven,

105
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,140
 in contrast to the righteousness according to the Pharisees,

106
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:28,040
 the teachers of the laws,

107
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,620
 or the Jewish religion or Jewish tradition.

108
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,240
 In the past couple months,

109
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,040
 we have looked at anger and murder,

110
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,480
 lust and adultery,

111
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,560
 divorce,

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,540
 making oath,

113
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,320
 and also the law of retribution.

114
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,840
 And how each and every time,

115
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,240
 Jesus shows us his better way and his greater righteousness

116
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:56,280
 that points back to God's original intention

117
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,460
 behind this law.

118
00:05:57,460 --> 00:06:00,600
 If you remember, he always introduced them by saying,

119
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,600
 "You have heard that it was said, but I tell you this."

120
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,400
 So our passage this morning is actually the sixth

121
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,840
 and also the final examples

122
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:14,500
 that will pretty much sum up these entire sections.

123
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,940
 So for my sermon this morning,

124
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,100
 we will first look at the command from Jesus,

125
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:22,660
 and then we'll look at the reason behind his command,

126
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,260
 and then we will end with the ultimate goal.

127
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:29,860
 So the command, the reason, and the goal.

128
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:32,100
 So let's look at the first part, the command.

129
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,180
 Verse 43.

130
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,140
 You have heard that it was said,

131
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,040
 love your neighbor and hate your enemy.

132
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,520
 But I tell you, love your enemies

133
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,080
 and pray for those who persecute you.

134
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,160
 So once again, Jesus begins his teaching with this formula.

135
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,020
 You have heard that it was said.

136
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:56,520
 And the first half of this quote, to love your neighbor,

137
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,280
 actually comes from Leviticus 19.18.

138
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,180
 And alongside Deuteronomy 6.5, which is the Shema,

139
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,860
 to love your Lord your God with all your heart,

140
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,640
 with all your soul, with all your strength.

141
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:13,200
 Jesus, he sums up the entire Old Testament law

142
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:16,200
 with these two commandments later in the book of Matthew.

143
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,260
 As for the second half of this quote, hate your enemies,

144
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:26,040
 the origin of this second half is a little more ambiguous.

145
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:30,080
 In the book of Deuteronomy, as the people of Israel

146
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,280
 are about to enter into the promised land,

147
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,440
 the Lord gave them this instruction

148
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,280
 to drive out all the enemies or the inhabitants

149
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,980
 of the land of Canaan,

150
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:43,360
 and pretty much devote these people to destruction.

151
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,480
 And so this quote, to hate your enemy,

152
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,360
 may be an inference that is drawn

153
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,320
 from those passage in Deuteronomy.

154
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:53,840
 On the other hand, this idea of hating your enemy

155
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,980
 may also come as a logical conclusion

156
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,100
 from the command to love your neighbor.

157
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:03,600
 In Leviticus 19, when the Lord commanded the Israelites

158
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,840
 to love their neighbor, the neighbor there

159
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,800
 was clearly referring to a fellow Israelites.

160
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,320
 And so when it comes to Jesus' day,

161
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,400
 some of the Jewish people, they take this command

162
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,020
 and draw the conclusion that, okay,

163
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,640
 if we are only called to love our neighbors,

164
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:24,860
 that probably means we can hate our enemies.

165
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:28,640
 So do you see how twisted our human heart can be

166
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,280
 when we take a positive command from God

167
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,360
 to love our neighbor,

168
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,880
 and pretty much turn it into a license to hate?

169
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,120
 So how does Jesus address this false narrative

170
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,280
 and misunderstanding?

171
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:50,080
 Verse 44, "But I tell you, love your enemies

172
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,560
 "and pray for those who persecute you."

173
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,240
 So Jesus couldn't be any more clearer here,

174
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,200
 but to most of Jesus' Jewish audience at that time,

175
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,280
 this probably comes as quite a shocking command.

176
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,840
 And even for most of us today,

177
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,580
 I would assume that this is still quite a radical command

178
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,880
 and a tall task for us, right,

179
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,120
 to actually love our enemies.

180
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,080
 And one thing to clarify here,

181
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,480
 when we hear the word love,

182
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,840
 what are some of the things that come to your mind?

183
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,300
 I feel like in our current day and age,

184
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:28,880
 this word love has become like a catch-all phrase

185
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,200
 for all sorts of different ideas and different feelings

186
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,920
 and different thoughts, right?

187
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,040
 You might say, "Oh, I love pineapple on my pizza."

188
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,640
 Or you say, "Oh, I love the Chicago Bears.

189
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,800
 "I hope they do well this season."

190
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,200
 Or you might say to your significant others, "I love you."

191
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,980
 Or you say to God, "God, I love you."

192
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,460
 Do you notice the issues here?

193
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,180
 The word love has been used

194
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,160
 in such a wide range of applications

195
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,920
 that it has lost its significance

196
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,800
 when it comes to the way that Jesus

197
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,560
 and the Bible talks about love.

198
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,360
 And so when Jesus give us the command to love your enemy,

199
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,300
 what kind of love is he referring to?

200
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,360
 Is it the kind of love

201
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,400
 that you like to have pineapple on your pizza

202
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,580
 or the love that you have for your significant others?

203
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:25,000
 Well, love in the sense that Jesus talks about

204
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,520
 is not just about having a passion for something

205
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,840
 or a deep affection for someone

206
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,200
 because those feelings will fade over time, right?

207
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,720
 Yes, it is true that love includes all of those feelings,

208
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,720
 but more importantly, love is about action and commitment.

209
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,840
 And love entails accountability and responsibility.

210
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,480
 So let me read a passage from 1 John

211
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,400
 that will help us better understand what love is

212
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,360
 according to Jesus.

213
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,080
 So 1 John 3, 16.

214
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,840
 "This is how we know what love is.

215
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,200
 "Jesus Christ laid down his life for us,

216
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,940
 "and we ought to lay down our lives

217
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:11,000
 "for our brothers and sisters.

218
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,600
 "If anyone has material possessions

219
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:17,440
 "and sees a brother or sister in need

220
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,460
 "but has no pity on them,

221
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:22,260
 "how can the love of God be in that person?

222
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,980
 "Dear children, let us not love with words or speech,

223
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,940
 "but with actions and in truth."

224
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,620
 So church, love is more than just the feelings.

225
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,180
 I hope that doesn't come as a surprise for you,

226
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,340
 but it is also about actions and truth.

227
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:45,020
 This kind of love is generous,

228
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,500
 yet costly at the same time

229
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,780
 because it requires us to lay down our own kingdom

230
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,680
 and commit to seeking the good of others.

231
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,300
 In other words, this is a love

232
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:01,580
 that is shaped after Jesus and his cross.

233
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:03,480
 This is a kind of cruciform love.

234
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:07,520
 And this cruciform love model after Jesus

235
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:10,620
 is being lived out when we, as his followers,

236
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:13,620
 are able to actively love our enemies

237
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,900
 and genuinely pray for those who are hostile

238
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,620
 or unkind to us.

239
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,180
 And in the Greek grammar,

240
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,900
 both of the verb to love and to pray

241
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,980
 stress that this command is to be lived out now

242
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,780
 and not just towards a singular enemy,

243
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,000
 but to all who we consider as enemies.

244
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:41,380
 So is loving our enemies easy?

245
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,380
 Of course not.

246
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,460
 And is responding to kindness

247
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:48,340
 towards those who are hostile towards us

248
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:49,580
 a challenging task?

249
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,260
 Of course it is.

250
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,620
 This is because in our fallen and unglorified state,

251
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:00,580
 we all have an inward curse towards ourself,

252
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,100
 as St. Augustine has pointed out.

253
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:08,060
 That is the tendency to always focus inward on ourself,

254
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,060
 on our needs, on our desires,

255
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:14,460
 rather than on God and other people.

256
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,160
 So of course, to love our enemies

257
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,360
 and pray for those who persecute us

258
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,340
 is not going to come easy

259
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,060
 because it requires us to act in a way

260
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,940
 that is contrary to our human nature, corrupted by sin.

261
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:32,680
 But why does Jesus command us to do so right here?

262
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,580
 And even more, to use this command

263
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:38,060
 as a summary to his entire teaching

264
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,820
 regarding the better righteousness

265
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,740
 that is required to enter into his kingdom.

266
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:46,640
 So let us look at the why behind this command now.

267
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,800
 (silence)

268
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:57,460
 Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you

269
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,620
 in order that you may be children of your Father in heaven.

270
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:05,460
 He causes his son to rise on the evil and the good

271
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,540
 and sends rain on the righteous and the unrighteous.

272
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,540
 So what is the reason behind Jesus' command

273
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,460
 to love our enemies?

274
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:18,220
 It is to imitate the character of our heavenly Father,

275
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:21,340
 who is gracious and compassionate,

276
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:25,780
 slow to anger and abounding in steadfast and loyal love.

277
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,460
 To love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us

278
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:33,340
 shows that we don't belong to this world,

279
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:37,320
 but we belong to another kingdom that is above.

280
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,300
 And moreover, God himself also loves impartially

281
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,620
 by bestowing his blessings on both the evil and the good,

282
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,180
 the righteous and the unrighteous.

283
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:57,040
 So yes, while loving our enemies is not easy,

284
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:02,040
 we are able to love radically because God loved us first,

285
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,420
 regardless of our actions.

286
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,380
 Paul in Romans 5 said this,

287
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:12,380
 "Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous person,

288
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,080
 "though for a good person,

289
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,620
 "someone might possibly dare to die.

290
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,900
 "But God demonstrate his own love for us in this.

291
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:26,060
 "While we were still sinners, Christ died for us."

292
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,740
 Did you catch that?

293
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:34,260
 While we were still sinners and enemies of God,

294
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,080
 Jesus Christ, the son of God, died for all of us.

295
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,460
 And so as God's people, we don't have the excuse

296
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:46,380
 to not love in the way that God loves us

297
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:49,720
 and loves in the way that reflects our heavenly father.

298
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:53,700
 Think of the most evil person

299
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,800
 that you can think of in your life,

300
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,340
 or someone that you would consider as your worst enemies.

301
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,220
 And guess what?

302
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,420
 He or she is still made in the image of God

303
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,460
 and deeply loved by God, our heavenly father.

304
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,180
 So again, as God's people,

305
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:16,580
 we are to reflect this loving character of our father,

306
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,660
 even towards those that we rather

307
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,340
 would have nothing to do with.

308
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,780
 Right?

309
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:29,220
 And then Jesus tries to bring his point home

310
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,780
 by using two rhetorical questions in verse 46 and 47.

311
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,420
 So if you are not familiar

312
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,640
 with what rhetorical questions are,

313
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:41,800
 these are questions posed usually to provoke thoughts

314
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:45,120
 rather than to actually get a response.

315
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,840
 And rhetorical questions,

316
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,800
 they have the functions of drawing attention to something

317
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,160
 or highlighting a point.

318
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:56,040
 So with these two rhetorical questions,

319
00:16:56,040 --> 00:17:00,280
 Jesus is trying to draw his audience to his point.

320
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,800
 So verse 46,

321
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,600
 if you love those who love you,

322
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,620
 what reward will you get?

323
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:10,060
 Are not even the tax collectors doing that?

324
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:14,000
 So a little context about the tax collectors.

325
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,920
 Tax collectors during Jesus' times

326
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:18,880
 are being viewed as traitors,

327
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:23,020
 and they're people that are being despised by the Jews.

328
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:24,920
 So the tax collectors,

329
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,720
 they're usually Jewish people

330
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,320
 who works for the Roman government

331
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,400
 to collect taxes from their own people.

332
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,800
 And the common practice for these tax collectors

333
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,520
 is they're actually allowed to collect

334
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,000
 more than that is required,

335
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,440
 and then they can just pocket

336
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,880
 the rest of the money for themself.

337
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,840
 And so these Jewish tax collectors,

338
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,920
 they pretty much build their wealth

339
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:50,500
 by quote-unquote daylight robbing their own people,

340
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,760
 and that is why they're being despised by the Jews as well.

341
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,680
 And so what Jesus is trying to say here is this.

342
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:01,760
 Even the tax collectors whom all of you despise

343
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,800
 can reciprocate love to their friends.

344
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:06,880
 There's nothing to brag about it

345
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,000
 if you, as my followers,

346
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,600
 are able to love those who only love you back.

347
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:16,280
 And then Jesus continues, verse 47.

348
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,760
 And if you greet only your own people,

349
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:20,960
 what are you doing more than the others?

350
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,760
 Do not even the pagans do that?

351
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:26,840
 And so here from 46 to 47,

352
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,760
 Jesus moves from within the Jewish community

353
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,760
 to those who are outside the Jewish community now,

354
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:36,400
 and he used the Gentiles or the pagans as the examples.

355
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,000
 And greetings in that culture

356
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,020
 is closely tied to someone's social status as well.

357
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,080
 So especially for those who hold

358
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,840
 a higher social status in a society,

359
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,120
 they like to exchange greetings with other people

360
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,720
 so that they can hear other people calling them their title

361
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,160
 or kind of like highlighting their status, right?

362
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,880
 Again, the point that Jesus is trying to make is this.

363
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,480
 If the pagans or the Gentiles

364
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:07,480
 in which you Jewish people consider as inferior to you all,

365
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,840
 they are able to reciprocate the greetings

366
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,480
 that come from their own people.

367
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:15,480
 You all, as my disciples,

368
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,280
 you should be able to do much better.

369
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,680
 You should be able to show the same respect and honor

370
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,840
 to other people, including your enemies.

371
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,200
 (smacks lips)

372
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,560
 So at this point,

373
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,300
 we have gone through all six of these case studies

374
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,600
 or examples on what true righteousness is

375
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,720
 according to Jesus, right?

376
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,640
 And each and every time we see how Jesus redefines

377
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:45,400
 what true righteousness is compared to the law

378
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,140
 on how it was being understood by the Jewish people.

379
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,840
 And so what is the purpose of Jesus' teachings here

380
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,280
 in revealing the heart of God

381
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,360
 behind all these laws and commandment?

382
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,400
 What is the ultimate goal that Jesus has?

383
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,220
 Let us look at verse 48 here.

384
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:08,600
 "Be perfect therefore, as your heavenly Father is perfect."

385
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:13,520
 Here, we see Jesus refers to the heavenly Father once again

386
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,340
 as the model for all of us to follow,

387
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,580
 recalling His command earlier to love our enemies

388
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:22,980
 and pray for those who persecute us

389
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,040
 in order that we can be children of our heavenly Father.

390
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:31,560
 On the surface level, this call to be perfect

391
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,880
 sounds kind of like a commandment that is almost impossible

392
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,480
 for us to achieve on this side of heaven, right?

393
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,600
 However, the word perfect here,

394
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:45,560
 instead of referring to absolute sinlessness

395
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,440
 or perfect in a way that is like blameless and never sin,

396
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,160
 the Greek word for perfect here, teleos,

397
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,040
 actually reflects more of the idea

398
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,700
 of wholeness or completeness.

399
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:02,440
 And besides, the idea of perfection

400
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:03,840
 that Jesus talks about here

401
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,560
 is actually more functional as well,

402
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,840
 rather than positional.

403
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,000
 What does that mean?

404
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,160
 So for example, if a thing is able to fulfill

405
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,840
 its intended purpose or function

406
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,580
 or reach its full development,

407
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:23,080
 it can be considered as perfect or teleos in that sense.

408
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,080
 So if a puppy is able to grow to its full-grown stature,

409
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,580
 it is considered as teleos.

410
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:35,420
 Or if this wireless microphone is able to function

411
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,720
 in the way that it is supposed to function

412
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:40,020
 and that it is created to function,

413
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,800
 it can be considered as teleos and perfect as well.

414
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:48,280
 And when it comes to us as human,

415
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,600
 this begs the question,

416
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:53,940
 what purpose are we as humans created for?

417
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,800
 As you all know, we as human,

418
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,480
 we are made in the image of God.

419
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,640
 And as image bearer and ambassador of God's kingdom,

420
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,800
 we are to reflect the character of our heavenly father

421
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,160
 and represent him in this world,

422
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,160
 just as a diplomatic ambassador

423
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,260
 will represent his or her country, right?

424
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,080
 And as we have seen in our passage,

425
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:23,840
 our heavenly father is one who loves impartially

426
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,000
 by making his son rise to both the good and the evil

427
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,880
 and causing rain to fall on both the righteous

428
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,980
 and the unrighteous.

429
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:35,280
 And in Romans 5, we see that he is a God

430
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,360
 who loves radically and generously

431
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:43,280
 by sending his own son to die in our place for our good.

432
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:50,320
 All this while we're still sinners and enemies of the cross.

433
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:55,280
 So when we are able to reproduce this kind of life

434
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,120
 that fully exemplifies the character of our heavenly father,

435
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,280
 one that is marked by radical,

436
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,520
 self-sacrificing, cruciform love,

437
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,760
 we fulfill the purpose in which we are made for.

438
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,520
 And therefore, we can be considered perfect

439
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:12,420
 or teleos in that sense.

440
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,940
 So to be perfect as our heavenly father is perfect

441
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:20,340
 means that conformity to the character of our God

442
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:25,020
 and the image of Christ should be the goal of our words,

443
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,180
 the goal of our actions, our thoughts,

444
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,820
 and the way we relate to those that are around us,

445
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,540
 friends and foes alike.

446
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:40,020
 So if you're taking notes, you can write this down.

447
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:44,560
 The point of all of this is as the children of God,

448
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,480
 we are called to a lifelong journey

449
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:51,300
 of becoming more and more like our heavenly father.

450
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,280
 Notice that this is not an instantaneous thing,

451
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:57,800
 that when we put our faith in Jesus,

452
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,920
 we instantly become like our heavenly father.

453
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,620
 But this is a lifelong journey.

454
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:07,360
 And this includes the way we relate to other people

455
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,000
 made in his image.

456
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,480
 If you recall our passage on anger and contempt,

457
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,560
 as well as on adultery and lust.

458
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:19,400
 And this also includes the way we view marriage and divorce,

459
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,880
 the way we use our words, whether we speak truthfully,

460
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
 the way we respond to evil,

461
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,360
 and ultimately, in the way we love other people,

462
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:37,840
 especially those that we consider as our enemies.

463
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,240
 And church, this is the surpassing righteousness

464
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,520
 that Jesus is referring to,

465
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,860
 one that is in perfect alignment

466
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,960
 with the heart of our heavenly father.

467
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,080
 So again, as the children of God,

468
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,600
 our goal on this side of heaven

469
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,200
 is to continually work towards becoming

470
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,300
 more and more like our heavenly father.

471
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:08,080
 So I just want to end with this story.

472
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:11,240
 So last Sunday, after our general assembly,

473
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,960
 if you were here, you might remember

474
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,880
 that there was just a huge thunderstorm, right?

475
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,400
 So after that, I offered to drive

476
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,940
 one of the members from UV home.

477
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:24,520
 But sometime between dropping him off

478
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,680
 and getting home myself,

479
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:30,420
 I think my car probably ran over some nail at some point.

480
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,040
 Because later that evening, when I was driving again,

481
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,360
 I started to notice some weird noise

482
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,360
 coming out from behind my car.

483
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,520
 And when I stopped and take a look,

484
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,360
 this is what I see.

485
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,000
 I had a flat tire.

486
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,280
 And at that point, I was only about 10 minutes

487
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,800
 away from home, so I'm like,

488
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,400
 okay, I'm not gonna call a tow truck or trip away

489
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,120
 because it might take them a while.

490
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,960
 And I'm so close to home,

491
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,300
 I'm just gonna drive home with this flat tire.

492
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:05,420
 But as I was driving, the noise just keep getting

493
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:08,840
 weirder and weirder and louder and louder.

494
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:12,560
 And me personally, I also became more and more frustrated.

495
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,440
 And in my mind, I was like,

496
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,560
 whoever is responsible for that nail

497
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:19,160
 like dropping on the street, like screw you.

498
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,420
 I hope you had a bad day.

499
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:25,440
 Monday morning came, I brought my car to the shop

500
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,160
 to get it fixed.

501
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,800
 And the first thing in the morning,

502
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,320
 like the very first thing in the morning,

503
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,320
 so that I can pretty much spend the rest of my day

504
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,060
 to have some like focus time to prepare

505
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,200
 for my sermon today.

506
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:41,440
 But as I read through this passage from Matthew five,

507
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,020
 with the frustration that I had

508
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,100
 towards the flat tire situation still fresh in my mind,

509
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,500
 this word really just stood out to me,

510
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,360
 to love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you.

511
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:58,560
 And even though this is just such a small incident,

512
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:01,600
 I realized that for me to love and pray for whoever

513
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,880
 that is responsible for that nail,

514
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,680
 it doesn't come natural to me.

515
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:10,680
 I have to kind of like, in some ways, like humble myself

516
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,040
 and come before the Lord.

517
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,000
 It's like, okay, Lord, like that is not the way

518
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,680
 I should respond yesterday.

519
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,680
 And it takes a lot of intentionality out of me as well.

520
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:26,000
 So this call from Jesus to be perfect

521
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,520
 as our heavenly father is perfect,

522
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,080
 requires a lot of intentionality,

523
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,500
 as well as discipline.

524
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,620
 To understand our father's heart,

525
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,300
 we need to spend time with him.

526
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,980
 We need to immerse ourself in his words.

527
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:45,380
 And to become more like our father in heaven,

528
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,640
 we need to allow the Holy Spirit to work in our hearts

529
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,900
 and transform us from the inside out.

530
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,400
 The righteousness of Jesus

531
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,160
 is not about outward behavioral management,

532
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:02,000
 but it comes from a heart that is truly transformed

533
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,600
 by Jesus and his gospel.

534
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,760
 And this is a process that will last until the day

535
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,480
 that we're able to meet Jesus face-to-face.

536
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,600
 So it requires a posture of constant obedience

537
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,920
 and a process of constant surrendering

538
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,240
 in our day-to-day life.

539
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:22,280
 So I want to leave with these questions

540
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,640
 for us to reflect on.

541
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:28,240
 Who are some people whom you would consider

542
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,960
 as your enemies?

543
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,540
 Or who are some people who have wronged you?

544
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:37,140
 And in light of our passage this morning,

545
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,800
 how can you show the love of Christ to them

546
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,900
 in a way that reflect the love you have received

547
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,240
 from our heavenly father?

548
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,960
 So I'll have Amanda come up to

549
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,760
 play some background music

550
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:52,600
 and just take some time to reflect on it,

551
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,820
 and I will end this with a prayer in a couple of minutes.

552
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,400
 (gentle music)

553
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,820
 (gentle music continues)

554
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:05,240
 (gentle music continues)

555
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,660
 (gentle music continues)

556
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:12,080
 (gentle music continues)

557
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,500
 (gentle music continues)

558
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,920
 (gentle music continues)

559
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,340
 (gentle music continues)

560
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:25,760
 (gentle music continues)

561
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:45,260
 (baby crying)

562
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:48,680
 (gentle music continues)

563
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:52,100
 (gentle music continues)

564
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:55,520
 (gentle music continues)

565
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,940
 (gentle music continues)

566
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:02,360
 (gentle music continues)

567
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:28,660
 (thunder rumbling)

568
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:32,080
 (gentle music continues)

569
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:45,080
 Heavenly father,

570
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,800
 we thank you that while we were still sinners,

571
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,760
 while we were still enemies,

572
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:57,360
 you sent your son, Jesus Christ,

573
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,360
 to die on our behalf for our good.

574
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,600
 Help us, father, to be people

575
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,100
 that reflects your loving character to those around us.

576
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:13,700
 Help us to become people that love in a way

577
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,760
 that we're willing to sacrifice our own preference,

578
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,020
 our own comforts, our own conveniences.

579
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:26,240
 Help us to love in a way that when the world see us,

580
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,340
 that they will know that we belong to you,

581
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,440
 that we can bring glory and honor to your name.

582
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,940
 So again, father, thank you for your word this morning.

583
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,120
 We pray this in your son's name, amen.

584
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,560
 All right, thank you for joining us this morning.

585
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,320
 We will have some refreshment outside,

586
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,180
 so I encourage you all to stay after our service

587
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:54,240
 and just hang out, get to know some new people,

588
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,300
 and yeah, enjoy fellowship with one another.

589
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,360
 All right, go in peace, UV, your love.
