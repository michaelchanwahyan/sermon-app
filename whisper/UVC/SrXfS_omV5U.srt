00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
好 今日我哋繼續睇呢個series

2
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,400
就係睇下聖經嘅節期

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,400
每逢講到節期嘅時候

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,400
好多時我哋都會諗起同一啲故事

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:12,400
或者歷史嘅事蹟

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,400
或者食物有關

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
譬如我比你估估

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,400
或者你諗一諗

9
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,400
到新年嘅時候我哋華人食咩

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,400
年糕係咪 冇錯 年糕

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,400
或者

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,400
蠔豉發菜嗰啲咁嘅嘢

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,400
我細個嘅時候最怕食嗰啲

14
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,400
食一日ok

15
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:35,400
跟住第二日又食 第三日又食

16
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,400
食到初七 咁我就覺得好辛苦

17
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,400
譬如仲有咩節日呢

18
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,400
同呢啲食物有關

19
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,400
冬至

20
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,400
湯圓係咪

21
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,400
喂 湯圓

22
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,400
仲有呢 糯米

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,400
仲有呢 打邊爐係咪

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,400
打邊爐

25
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,400
仲有咩節呢

26
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,400
感恩節呢

27
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,400
係打邊爐係咪

28
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,400
端午節食咩

29
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,400
就唔係打邊爐

30
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,400
我哋淨係識打邊爐

31
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
咁講到聖經嘅節期

32
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,400
其實都有好多同食物有關

33
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,400
譬如今次我哋講

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,400
預節

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,400
預節同乜嘢有關

36
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,400
食物

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,400
羊我哋諗到係咪

38
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,400
我哋第一樣嘢就會諗到係羊

39
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,400
事實上聖經裏面

40
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,400
第一次守預節嘅時候

41
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,400
就係同羊有關

42
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,400
係出埃及記你記得

43
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,400
當耶和華要降十災

44
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,400
最後嗰災

45
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:37,400
就係擊殺埃及長子嘅一災

46
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,400
係上帝嘅審判

47
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,400
去到呢一個嘅

48
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,400
即係所謂強國當時

49
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,400
然之後呢

50
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,400
以色列人住喺埃及裏面

51
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
佢哋係需要被拯救出嚟嘅

52
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
於是乎上帝就同佢哋

53
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,400
設立呢一個嘅預節

54
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,400
十二章第三節

55
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,400
嗰度講到

56
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,400
預節嘅安排

57
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,400
即係你哋要去做啲乜嘢

58
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,400
然之後呢

59
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
食完呢一餐飯你就要走

60
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,400
十二章第三節

61
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,400
佢話你要告訴以色列

62
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,400
傳會眾

63
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,400
本月初十

64
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
各人要按照家庭

65
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,400
娶羔羊

66
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,400
一家娶一隻

67
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
然之後佢就講到呢個羔羊

68
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,400
要去被烤

69
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:25,400
然之後呢要喺屋企裏面食

70
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,400
然之後呢就要將

71
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
宰殺咗嘅羔羊

72
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,400
羔羊嘅血

73
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
就要塗喺邊度

74
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,400
門尾上面

75
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
門尾上面

76
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,400
以至上帝嘅審判

77
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,400
臨到呢個國度嘅時候

78
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,400
上帝就會越過

79
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,400
有門尾上面

80
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,400
有血嘅

81
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,400
即係家庭

82
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,400
係一個拯救嘅故事

83
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,400
佢話你要咁樣去吃

84
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,400
呢個羔羊然之後呢

85
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,400
要腰間束帶

86
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,400
腳

87
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
要穿著鞋呢個好有趣

88
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,400
因為猶太人

89
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,400
起碼以色列人

90
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,400
入到屋嘅時候佢就會脫下鞋

91
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,400
喺門口

92
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
然之後

93
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
要上路嘅時候

94
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,400
佢哋就會

95
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,400
戴皮帶係咪

96
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,400
出門口嘅時候

97
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,400
好多時都會戴皮帶然之後穿鞋係咪

98
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
準備去走嘅

99
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,400
食呢隻羊羔

100
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,400
手裏面仲要拿住杖

101
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,400
特別係講到嗰啲

102
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,400
walking stick係咪

103
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,400
即係你要行路嘅時候攞住嗰張

104
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,400
快快地

105
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,400
然後仲交代咗

106
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,400
好多嘅細節我哋冇時間講

107
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
食無烤餅

108
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,400
點解係無烤

109
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,400
如果整個麵包嘅話你知道

110
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,400
你等嗰啲麵粉發酵

111
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,400
要等好耐嘅係咪

112
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,400
要等好幾個鐘頭

113
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,400
然之後你先至能夠

114
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,400
烘到嗰啲麵包

115
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,400
因為趕住走就唔可以

116
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,400
所以呢佢哋喺呢一個

117
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
嘅節日就要

118
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,400
去食無烤餅

119
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
就紀念返上帝拯救佢哋

120
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
離開埃及

121
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,400
拯救佢哋以至佢哋

122
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,400
唔能夠唔會呢係被審判

123
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,400
這是耶和華的預言

124
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,400
Passover

125
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
越過

126
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:23,400
越過佢哋嘅門

127
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,400
或者去到

128
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,400
保護佢哋

129
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,400
每年西曆嘅時候

130
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,400
三四月呢就係呢個

131
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,400
猶太人嘅

132
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,400
Passover嘅時候就淨係呢個

133
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
所謂即係春分

134
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,400
嘅時候之後嘅

135
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,400
第一個嘅新月

136
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,400
所以亦都係

137
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
一個季節

138
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
與季節之間過渡嘅

139
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
一段時間

140
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
當時特別講到如果你講

141
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,400
耶穌嘅時候

142
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,400
當時有好多散居

143
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,400
流散喺世界各地嘅猶太人

144
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,400
佢哋就會返返去

145
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,400
耶路撒冷

146
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,400
然後就會守節

147
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
當時嘅人會好擠迫好烈鬧

148
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,400
你可以想像呢個係一個最大

149
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,400
最大嘅節日

150
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,400
好似我哋華人嘅新年

151
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,400
華人嘅

152
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,400
一啲重要嘅慶典

153
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,400
或者好似

154
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
美國呢度Thanksgiving

155
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
嘅時候最忙嘅地方

156
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
係咩地方

157
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,400
機場餐館

158
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,400
華人餐館

159
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,400
好多人走來走去

160
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,400
猶太人就係咁樣

161
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,400
猶太人就會去返

162
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,400
以前冇得搭飛機

163
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,400
佢哋就會趕路

164
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,400
去到耶路撒冷

165
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,400
所以我哋諗起

166
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,400
預節嘅時候就諗起高揚

167
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,400
頭先歌都有唱

168
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
上帝帶領我哋

169
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,400
預約經過

170
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,400
Passover

171
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,400
類似咁樣嘅意思

172
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,400
但係你要知道喺兩約中間嘅時候

173
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,400
即係舊約完咗

174
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
到新約未開始嘅兩三百年

175
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
當時嘅猶太人佢哋諗起

176
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
預節嘅時候佢哋就唔係

177
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,400
諗起高揚

178
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,400
佢哋諗起成個package

179
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,400
成嚿嘢成個上帝嘅拯救

180
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
會係有啲乜嘢呢

181
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,400
你諗下有啲乜嘢除咗隻羊之外

182
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,400
佢諗起一連串嘅嘢

183
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,400
有摩西出現

184
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,400
因為上帝呼召摩西

185
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
去帶領佢哋好似一個牧羊人

186
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
帶領佢哋離開埃及

187
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,400
然之後當然就係我哋有所謂

188
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,400
sacrificial lamb 即係呢個

189
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,400
預節嘅高揚

190
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,400
預節嘅高揚嘅血

191
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
無烤餅

192
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,400
仲有諗起乜嘢

193
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,400
就係水嘅神蹟

194
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
過紅海

195
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,400
過完紅海

196
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,400
成個package

197
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,400
就睇埋一個

198
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
礦野

199
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,400
咁多年上帝帶領佢哋

200
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,400
係行過嘅

201
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
喺礦野又畀佢哋馬拿

202
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,400
等佢哋每一日

203
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,400
能夠有嘢食

204
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,400
咩叫馬拿

205
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,400
manner

206
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,400
大概可能聖經嘅description

207
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,400
嗰啲嘅描述

208
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,400
係一啲圓圓地嘅好似餅咁嘅嘢

209
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,400
其實我哋都唔係好知

210
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,400
因為呢個故事

211
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,400
話畀我哋聽

212
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
馬拿個名係點嚟

213
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,400
上帝降咗一啲咁樣嘅

214
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
好似麵包咁樣嘅嘢畀佢哋

215
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
然之後佢哋就唔知係啲乜嘢嚟

216
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
佢哋就話Mazet Mazet Mazet

217
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
Mazet 希伯來文

218
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,400
What is this

219
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,400
乜料

220
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,400
乜嘢嚟㗎咁樣

221
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
所以就嚟咗呢個名叫做馬拿

222
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
所以其實我哋唔知乜料嚟

223
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,400
但總之佢哋食咗咁多年

224
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,400
上帝就

225
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
冇間斷過嘅

226
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
嚟到去供應佢哋

227
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,400
我講兩日中間

228
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
耶穌之前嚟到嘅時候

229
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
佢哋就諗起呢一連串嘅

230
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
所謂預月節會發生嘅嘢

231
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,400
或者pass over嘅時候

232
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,400
佢哋會諗起嘅嘢

233
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,400
一路由過紅海到去

234
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
離開埃及

235
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,400
去到呢個曠野嘅時候

236
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
佢哋就會諗起

237
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
有好多嘅故事

238
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
甚至佢會加上一啲故事啲

239
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
加上咩故事呢

240
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,400
就嚟到耶穌嚟之前

241
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
嗰啲嘅猶太人就會想像

242
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
因為聖經確實有講

243
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,400
佢哋過完呢個

244
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,400
紅海過完四十年嘅曠野

245
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,400
入到迦南嘅時候

246
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,400
就有講馬拿就唔降落嚟

247
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,400
佢入主迦南咗之後

248
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,400
去到佢哋嘅屋企

249
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,400
真係去到目的地

250
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,400
就唔再有乜料落嚟

251
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,400
然後佢哋就食迦南地嘅土產

252
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
所以佢哋就會想像

253
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,400
天上面唔再降馬拿

254
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
點解呢

255
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
因為原來摩西有條鑰匙

256
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
當以色列人入主迦南之後

257
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
佢就將天上面

258
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,400
馬拿嘅倉庫就關咗

259
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
就唔再降馬拿

260
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,400
所以佢哋就繼續諗

261
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
如果上帝真正嘅救恩

262
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
最終極嚟到嘅時候

263
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,400
應該會係點呢

264
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,400
摩西會天上面嗰個倉庫

265
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
就攞條鑰匙再開返

266
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
然後就會降落嚟馬拿

267
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:16,400
然後我哋就可以食嗰啲馬拿

268
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,400
就係天上降落嚟嘅糧食

269
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
以至我哋能夠有終極嘅救恩

270
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:25,400
天上降落嚟嘅天糧

271
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Spiritual food

272
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
但如果咁樣諗嘅時候

273
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
我哋就明白

274
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:33,400
咦 聖經裡面提到御節嘅時候

275
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:36,400
嗰時同耶穌有關

276
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,400
我哋睇一段嘅經文

277
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:42,400
我哋只係揀好幾節嚟睇

278
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
因為比較長

279
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,400
約翰福第六章

280
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
約翰福第六章第四節

281
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,400
那時猶太人嘅御節近了

282
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,400
可能未到或者已經過咗

283
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,400
總之係附近

284
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,400
猶太人嘅Passover

285
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,400
耶穌舉目看見一大群人嚟

286
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
就對肥利講

287
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,400
喂 我哋去邊度買餅畀佢哋食

288
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
當時佢哋加利利

289
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
好多山頭 曠野嘅地方

290
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
耶穌就話 喂 咁多人跟住我哋

291
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
咁點呀 你記得個故事

292
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,400
就係五餅而魚嘅故事

293
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,400
每每我哋睇到五餅而魚嘅時候

294
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
我哋就會諗起

295
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
上帝嘅供應

296
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,400
去到俾人嘅恩典係足夠

297
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,400
因為五餅而魚就餵飽咗五千人

298
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
但係你留意到

299
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:31,400
呢度特別係約翰福音

300
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,400
約翰福音先至會咁樣記載

301
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,400
因為五餅而魚呢個故事

302
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,400
四本福音書都有提

303
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,400
但淨係約翰福音係加咗呢句第四節

304
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,400
佢就係留意

305
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,400
呢個五餅而魚嘅故事

306
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,400
神蹟嘅故事

307
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
係幾時發生

308
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Passover 附近嘅時候

309
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
你都發生

310
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:57,400
約翰福音好多時

311
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,400
講到上帝藉住耶穌所做嘅嘢

312
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,400
嗰啲嘅Acts

313
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,400
嗰啲嘅Great Deeds

314
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
上帝要做嘅工作

315
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:09,400
其實係一個Sign

316
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,400
一個路牌

317
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,400
即係換句話講

318
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,400
等陣你去餐館

319
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:21,400
你就打開餐館Menu

320
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:24,400
你見到有好多相

321
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,400
佢就話畀你聽呢隻嘅菜係咩名

322
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
同埋係咩樣

323
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,400
嗰個就係Sign

324
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:36,400
Sign係Something point to the reality

325
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,400
你唔會攞住個Menu嚟食

326
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,400
你話畀個攝影聽我要呢一個

327
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
到佢攞嚟嘅時候就係嗰碟餸

328
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,400
貨不對版

329
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,400
你話同個Sign係唔同

330
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
個Menu就係個Sign

331
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,400
喺約翰福音裏面

332
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
耶穌做嘅嘢

333
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:58,400
一舉一動都係一個Sign

334
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,400
五餅二魚就係一個Sign

335
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,400
Point to something beyond itself

336
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:09,400
唔係個實體

337
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:13,400
而係指向實體嘅東西

338
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,400
五餅二魚呢個神蹟

339
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,400
約翰就話諗清楚

340
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,400
唔係淨係講供應

341
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,400
每日食嘢咁簡單

342
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,400
耶穌做緊一樣嘢係最終極

343
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
想做啲乜嘢

344
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,400
約翰福音第六章當然好長

345
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,400
我呢度純粹畀一個Outline畀大家

346
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,400
大概五段

347
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
首先就係五餅二魚

348
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:38,400
第二 發生咩事

349
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,400
係特登咁鋪排

350
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,400
唔一定係時間上係咁樣發生

351
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,400
但係記載返耶穌做嘅嘢嘅時候

352
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,400
第二個故事

353
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,400
佢哋講到嘅時候

354
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,400
就係耶穌喺加里海平靜風浪

355
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,400
都唔拉監

356
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,400
食完嘢跟住又講個平靜風浪

357
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,400
你記得我頭先講咩

358
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,400
猶太人諗起御節嘅時候

359
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,400
御節嘅時候近了嘛

360
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
第六章第四節 約翰福音

361
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
佢就諗起咩 成個Package

362
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,400
諗起食物

363
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:15,400
天上有糧食畀我哋

364
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,400
然之後諗起過紅海

365
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,400
上帝將水分開

366
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,400
或者上帝將水Control

367
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,400
將嗰啲混沌邪惡嘅嘢

368
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,400
嚟到去Control住

369
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,400
跟住佢就提到耶穌平靜風浪

370
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
所以耶穌平靜風浪又唔係淨係單單

371
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
我哋生命裏面有風浪

372
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
上帝就平靜啦

373
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
當然係咁嘅意思

374
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,400
但亦都係一個Sign

375
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
去話俾我哋聽耶穌做緊啲咩

376
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,400
你呢度諗起就成個御節出埃及嘅故事

377
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,400
然之後下面三段都係說話

378
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,400
如果你返去睇下六章約翰福音

379
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:59,400
好長呀 你越睇越拗頭

380
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,400
唔知佢講乜

381
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,400
總之耶穌就同那些猶太人去辯論

382
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,400
大家有好多對話

383
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,400
講啲乜嘢呢

384
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:08,400
就係講食物

385
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:11,400
因為啲人見到耶穌 五餅二魚

386
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,400
呢個人成日請食飯

387
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,400
梗係成日搵佢

388
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,400
結果佢哋真係去搵佢

389
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,400
由烈國營之後搭船走去搵佢

390
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,400
搵到佢啦

391
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,400
佢就同佢哋講

392
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,400
你可唔可以畀啲糧食畀我哋

393
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,400
耶穌就同佢有好多嘅Debate

394
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,400
有好多對話

395
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:32,400
然之後有啲人就發怨言

396
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
聽唔明就走鬼咗

397
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
佢就話呢個人講嘢太爛

398
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,400
我哋接受唔到

399
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,400
然之後有好多本身跟耶穌嘅人

400
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,400
就嗱一聲走咗

401
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
因為佢都唔再請我哋食飯

402
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,400
就唔好同佢做朋友

403
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,400
就係咁嘅意思

404
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,400
然之後耶穌最尾嘅時候

405
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:53,400
就Round up講一樣嘢

406
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:55,400
就同12門徒講

407
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,400
佢話你哋走唔走

408
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,400
門徒就話

409
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,400
你有生命嘅道

410
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,400
我哋仲要跟邊個

411
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,400
你有永生

412
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,400
我哋仲要跟邊個

413
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,400
類似一個咁樣嘅對話

414
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,400
我哋睇幾節

415
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
讀咗呢17節

416
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
呢度就係大家有Debate嘅時候

417
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,400
即係嗰啲嘅猶太人

418
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,400
佢哋試咗一次五餅如臘

419
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,400
嘩都唔使做嘢

420
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,400
然之後呢個人請我哋食飯幾好

421
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,400
搵佢先

422
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,400
搵到佢啦然之後就同佢講

423
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,400
喂你可唔可以畀啲咁嘅嘢畀我哋食呀

424
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
你可唔可以再降呢啲咁嘅糧呀

425
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
你記得成個預節嘅Package

426
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,400
就係有摩西開上面嗰個Bank

427
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,400
然之後降馬拿落嚟呀嘛

428
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
呢個會唔會就係嗰個呢

429
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,400
等我哋唔使每日做嘢呀嘛

430
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,400
然之後耶穌就同佢講

431
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:50,400
佢話唔好為那會壞嘅食物而操勞

432
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,400
In fact

433
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,400
喺出《阿俠記》裏面

434
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,400
講到嗰啲馬拿跌落嚟嘅時候

435
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,400
如果嗰啲人呢

436
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,400
將佢儲起嘅話

437
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,400
拿多少少先

438
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,400
聽日我驚唔夠呀

439
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,400
跟住我就雪起佢

440
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,400
然之後第二日我叮翻熱佢啦

441
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,400
咁上下咁嘅意思

442
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,400
會壞嘅其實

443
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,400
佢就講緊咩呢

444
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,400
不要為那會壞嘅食物而去操勞

445
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,400
係你可以搵食

446
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,400
Sorry

447
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,400
但唔好為嗰樣嘢嚟到操勞

448
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,400
為啲乜嘢而操勞呢

449
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,400
傳住永生嘅食物

450
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
呢啲食物就係

451
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,400
耶穌話我人子賜畀你哋

452
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,400
你要搵嗰啲食物

453
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,400
係乜嘢食物

454
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,400
跟住啲人聽唔明34節

455
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,400
他們就對他說

456
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,400
主呀請常常每日把這糧給我哋啦

457
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:53,400
每日你都畀我好嗎

458
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,400
我每日都想

459
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
你畀飯我食

460
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
唔記得喺出埃及記嘅時候

461
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,400
佢哋行過曠野40年

462
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
真係每日畀佢哋

463
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,400
就算到Shabbat嚟之前

464
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,400
都畀兩份佢哋㗎

465
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,400
等佢Shabbat嘅時候就唔使煮飯

466
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,400
40年上帝就係咁樣去供應佢哋

467
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
但係呢度呢

468
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,400
耶穌就有少少

469
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,400
用佢哋所熟嘅故事

470
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,400
嚟到講一啲再深啲嘅嘢

471
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
佢話你食完每一日嘅嘢

472
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
你哋都要再食

473
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,400
40年都係咁樣食

474
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,400
事實上嗰啲以色列人食咗40年

475
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,400
都係死喺曠野

476
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,400
點都係死硬呀

477
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:50,400
點解要為呢樣嘢咁粗魯

478
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,400
佢都講一啲更加重要嘅食物

479
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,400
六章第三五節

480
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,400
佢話我就使生命都要

481
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,400
嚟到我呢度嘅

482
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
終不饑餓

483
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,400
信我的永不乾旱

484
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,400
我畀食物同埋水畀你哋

485
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,400
呢一啲係永遠嘅食物

486
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,400
呢個就係好出名喺約翰福音入面

487
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,400
七句七次耶穌講咩

488
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,400
我是

489
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
I am

490
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,400
佢話我係門

491
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,400
我係羊嘅門

492
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
等等好幾次

493
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,400
呢就係其中一次

494
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,400
I am the bread of life

495
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Eternal life

496
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,400
佢話我使生命嘅糧

497
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,400
嚟到我呢度嘅話

498
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,400
你就唔會饑渴

499
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,400
信我的話就唔會乾渴

500
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
呢啲就係比喻

501
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,400
因為我哋會食啲嘢嘅

502
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,400
食食物

503
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,400
我哋唔會信食物

504
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
喺你面前啲飯都係食嘅

505
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,400
你唔會話我信你阿凡

506
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,400
我好掂架我信咗你就得

507
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
佢肯定就係講緊比喻

508
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,400
我哋唔會信麵包

509
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
我哋會食麵包

510
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,400
耶穌就係咁嘅意思

511
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
我就是生命

512
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,400
信我的就唔會饑餓

513
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,400
五眼一節

514
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
又繼續debate嘅時候就講咩

515
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,400
佢話我就是從天上降下來生命的糧

516
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,400
上面個倉庫打開

517
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,400
降落嚟有馬欄

518
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,400
人若吃這糧

519
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,400
就永遠活著

520
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,400
我為世人嘅生命

521
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
所賜下嘅糧

522
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,400
就是我的肉

523
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
呢個重眼

524
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,400
咩呀

525
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
講馬欄

526
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
其實佢就話

527
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,400
我就是馬欄

528
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,400
佢唔係只俾碟飯嚟

529
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:56,400
佢話我就是飯

530
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,400
我就是飯

531
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
你信我的話

532
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
你吃我的話

533
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,400
你就能夠

534
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,400
永遠活著

535
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,400
喺以前農業嘅社會

536
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,400
跟我哋有少少唔似

537
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,400
農業嘅社會做咩

538
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
農業嘅社會好清楚

539
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,400
佢食任何嘢

540
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,400
食嘅嘢都一定要犧牲咗

541
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,400
你先食到

542
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,400
舉個例

543
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
我哋今日攞個漢堡包食

544
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,400
有啲咩死咗你先能夠食到漢堡包

545
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
以致你唔餓能夠活著

546
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,400
牛

547
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,400
除非你嗰啲

548
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,400
牛

549
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,400
除非你嗰啲

550
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,400
那啲唔知咩嚟

551
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
麥當勞嗰啲就係咁

552
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
烏鷹都唔食

553
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
牛

554
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
菜

555
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
嗰塊菜

556
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
植物死咗放你面前夾住漢堡包

557
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,400
你先可以食

558
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
大麥小麥整出嚟嘅麵包

559
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,400
係由咩嚟

560
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
係由田產出嚟

561
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
係啲麥子死咗

562
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
先至煮到喺你面前

563
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
然後你食咗

564
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,400
你就能夠可以活著

565
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,400
以前農業嘅社會

566
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,400
好清楚呢樣嘢

567
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,400
我哋話食羊羔

568
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,400
食任何嘢幾乎

569
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,400
都係有啲嘢死咗

570
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,400
有啲嘢犧牲

571
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,400
以致我哋能夠得到生命

572
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
頭先我哋講嗰啲全部還嘅節期

573
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
全部都有嘢死

574
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
新年唔好講呢啲嘢啦

575
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
大家猜過你咩

576
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,400
但樣嘢都死啦

577
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,400
放得上去嘅都已經死咗

578
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
以致你能夠有生命

579
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,400
耶穌就係講緊一樣嘢

580
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
耶穌就係話

581
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,400
我嘅死

582
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,400
使到你有生命

583
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
每一日

584
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,400
你能夠有糧食

585
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
都係因為有生命犧牲

586
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,400
以致你能夠有生命

587
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,400
如果講永生嘅話

588
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,400
就先係我

589
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,400
為你犧牲

590
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
以致你唔會受審判

591
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,400
以致你能夠得救

592
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,400
我哋等間會搜聖餐

593
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
聖餐

594
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,400
就係從呢一類嘅經文

595
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,400
嗰度引申出嚟

596
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,400
就係耶穌嘅死

597
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,400
每時每刻我哋攞聖餐嘅時候

598
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,400
諗起佢嘅犧牲

599
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,400
餅

600
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,400
同葡萄汁

601
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,400
大麥小麥嘅死

602
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,400
葡萄樹嘅死

603
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,400
能夠祝福我哋有生命

604
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
呢個先至係我哋要操勞嘅

605
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,400
最重要我哋要知道

606
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,400
我哋係領受上帝嘅救人

607
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,400
開始嘅時候我哋提醒大家

608
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,400
喺個感恩節裏面

609
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,400
為啲乜嘢去操勞

610
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
為啲乜嘢去到講

611
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,400
Fan Guard

612
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
最重要嘅

613
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,400
係天上降下來

614
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
生命救流

615
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
耶穌基督自己

616
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,400
我哋請我哋敬拜隊上嚟

617
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,400
我哋唱呢首歌嘅時候

618
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
我哋喺最後

619
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,400
我哋第一節嘅聖經

620
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,400
係同呢個預知有關

621
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
同耶穌嘅聖餐有關

622
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,400
佢話既然你哋係無孝嘅面

623
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,400
佢講緊教會

624
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,400
講緊御節

625
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,400
無孝嘅面

626
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,400
舊孝隨正

627
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,400
好使到你哋成為新團

628
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,400
我哋嘅御節嘅羔羊

629
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
基督就係被殺

630
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
犧牲嘅

631
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
我哋到守呢個節

632
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
其實佢講緊聖餐

633
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,400
唔係淨係猶太人嘅節

634
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,400
守呢個節嘅時候我哋就係

635
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,400
作無孝嘅餅

636
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
孝代表罪

637
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
代表一啲唔好嘅嘢

638
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
隨去嘅時候

639
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
領受呢一個嘅

640
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
真正心靈嘅流量

641
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
以致我哋能夠

642
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
永遠活著

643
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,400
我哋同心大道基督

644
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
上主我哋多謝你

645
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
因為你係嗰一位

646
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,400
帶領我哋

647
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:18,400
愉悅嘅羔羊

648
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
你就係嗰個

649
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,400
天上降嘅力量

650
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,400
叫我哋能夠得到

651
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
永生

652
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,400
上主我哋感恩去讚比你

653
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
因為你為我哋預備嘅救恩

654
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,400
你就係你嘅愛子就係

655
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,400
御節嘅羔羊

656
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
喺十家上面

657
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,400
為我哋流血寫生

658
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,400
救我哋離開

659
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
罪惡

660
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,400
離開審判

661
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
離開死亡同黑暗

662
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,400
主帶領我哋呢一刻

663
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
去到領受呢一個

664
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,400
代表你同在嘅

665
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,400
呢個餅同呢個盤

666
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
提醒我哋

667
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,400
你救恩嘅貴重

668
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,400
主當我哋領受嘅時候

669
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,400
我知道你就係天上降下來嘅

670
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
生命不可

671
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
叫我哋永遠不記憾

672
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,400
主求你嘅救恩

673
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,400
能夠喺我哋內心裏

674
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,400
能夠喺我哋嘅心裏

675
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,400
能夠喺我哋嘅心裏

676
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
能夠喺我哋嘅心裏

677
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,400
喺我哋生命最深嘅地方

678
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,400
去到滿足我哋

679
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
祈禱扶住命

680
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,400
我哋先唱呢首歌

681
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,400
在困苦艱難

682
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:51,400
仍謙卑土高

683
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,400
要安靜

684
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:58,400
知道你是神

685
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,400
無罪羔羊

686
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,400
曾被失怨犧牲

687
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:10,400
為救贖

688
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:14,400
流血捨身

689
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,400
為救贖

690
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,400
流血捨身

691
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:26,400
凝望月死亡

692
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,400
月掛方岸

693
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:37,400
神恩神不可欣賞

694
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:42,400
成功是實在和

695
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,400
跌剩一生無盡

696
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:53,400
知己都不懼痛難過

697
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,400
願救恩歸於

698
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:01,400

00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:27,400
願救恩歸於

704
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,400

願救恩歸於

凝望月死亡

710
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,400
月掛方岸

711
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,400
神恩神不可欣賞

712
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:11,400
成功是實在和

713
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,400
跌剩一生無盡

714
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:22,400
