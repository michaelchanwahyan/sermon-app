[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   of God. And today, as we get together to worship together, I would like to share a few words
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.240]   with you. And the title of the sermon is "Following God in Tough Times." We're going to turn
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.320]   to the book of Job, chapter 1. If you have your Bible with you, please turn to your Bible,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.820]   to the book of Job, which is found at the very middle of the Bible. Now, we are living
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:37.760]   in a tough time. The pandemic has entered the third year with no end in sight. We are
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:47.000]   having bad times whenever we are suffering, whenever we are not feeling good about what
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.320]   is happening in our lives. We sometimes think of the poor Job. We turn to the book of Job.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.020]   Sometimes we want to find some wisdom. Job talks about something that is universal for
[00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.920]   the humanity, the universal question of human suffering. Suffering is real. I don't know
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:17.160]   what you are facing, but there are many facets of suffering. At least there are three areas
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.200]   we can think of about human suffering. The first one is personal suffering. Of course,
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:31.240]   we are all familiar with it. It comes with different forms and different kinds. Emotional
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:38.080]   suffering, mental challenges, loss of jobs, or you're facing the future, you find a lot
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.800]   of uncertainties, you just don't know how to cope with it. Sickness and disability of
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.920]   all kinds. These are personal suffering, and it is universal. Everyone is familiar with
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:00.120]   it or gets some taste of it. The second category is disasters, natural disasters. COVID is
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:10.520]   one of them, although it was partly caused by human failures, but it is partly also a
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.160]   natural disaster. Think of what the Americans had experienced some weeks ago because of
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:26.400]   tornadoes. Their families, their houses got destroyed, and they became homeless and displaced.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.000]   These are some of the universal experiences of natural disasters. The third category is
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.680]   systemic evil. Sometimes we don't think of that, but it is so real. Think of people living
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.800]   under oppressive regimes. Churches, minorities being persecuted, human rights being taken
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:56.000]   away from them. This is systemic oppression. We think of all these kinds of sufferings
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:03.920]   as we turn to the book of Job, because poor Job suffers a lot. Chapter 1 opens with this
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.800]   verse to introduce this main character called Job. Chapter 1. In the land of Uz, there lived
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:21.040]   a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright. He feared God and shunned evil.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.480]   He had seven sons and three daughters. He owned a lot of things, thousands and thousands
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.080]   of oxen and donkeys, a very rich man, and a large number of servants. He was the greatest
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:41.280]   man among all the people of the East. That's how the Bible introduced the character Job.
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:50.240]   Then the book talks about how Job was a blameless man morally or ritually or in terms of worship.
[00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.000]   He does everything he can to make sure he feared God. He is blameless in every single
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:06.880]   way imaginable. Then the book of Job turns the attention to heaven. All of a sudden,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:15.400]   the focus turned to heaven. Verse 6 and following. One day the angels came to present themselves
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.520]   before the Lord, and Satan also came with them. The Lord said to Satan, "Where have
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.680]   you come from?" Satan answered the Lord, "From roaming through the earth and going back and
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:35.900]   forth in it." Then the Lord said, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:43.360]   on earth like him. He is blameless and white. He is a man who fears God and shuns evil."
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:52.960]   Then the conversation continues with Satan asking a question. "Does Job fear God for
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:05:00.640]   nothing?" Satan replied. "Have you not put a hat around him and his household and everything
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:10.000]   he has? You have blessed the work of Job's hands so that his flocks, his herds, are spread
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.440]   throughout the land. But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has. He will
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:23.880]   surely curse you to the face." The Lord said to Satan, "Farewell. Then everything he has
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:30.040]   is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.160]   the presence of the Lord.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:41.000]   This story continues in the later context. It talks about disasters and suffering one
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:48.480]   after another fell upon the life of Job. His children died one after the other in tragedies,
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:56.540]   and finally he fell really, really sick. This creates many tensions for us because whenever
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:07.280]   we suffer or we see someone suffer, we always ask the question, "Why?" "Why did Job suffer?"
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.960]   From this very short portion of scripture from chapter 1, it seems like we can blame
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:19.680]   it all on Satan, blame it all on the devil because of the evil one. He is doing something
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:29.160]   to destroy our lives. Does that explain suffering? Does it really answer the question, "Why
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:36.940]   we suffer? Why did innocent suffer?" It seems not because it seems like God allowed Satan
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:46.140]   to bring suffering to Job. So it really doesn't address the question of why Job suffered or
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:49.320]   why the innocent suffered.
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:56.740]   Now about this character Satan, there is also something that we need to pay attention to.
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:04.280]   The English word translated "Satan", if you check the Hebrew behind the word, it is not
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:13.440]   "Satan", it is "Ha-Satan". Now in Hebrew, you don't have to be an expert to understand
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:25.600]   this. In Hebrew, "Ha" is a definite article, in English equivalent to "the". And "Satan",
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:34.160]   of course we get it from Satan, right? "Satan" originally was Hebrew. Now it simply means
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   challenger or adversary, someone who opposes, someone who raises a question. Now it can
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.040]   be a good character, it can also be an evil character, it can be neutral. So remember,
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:58.100]   Satan as we know it from the New Testament, the evil one, the capital evil one, from the
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:03.760]   book of Revelation for example, Satan does not become a personal name or a personal entity
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:09.040]   until the time between the end of the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament,
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:16.640]   so-called intertestamental period. Satan does not exist in the mind of the ancient Israelites,
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:23.300]   the ancient Jews, until the intertestamental period before the New Testament. So in this
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:31.000]   time in the Old Testament, there is no understanding of Satan as a personal character. So "Ha-Satan"
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.800]   is actually not a personal name, that's why it's "the Satan", right? So a better translation
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:48.440]   could be "the challenger". So a better translation would go, "Does Job fear God for nothing,
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:57.000]   the challenger in the heavenly court, ask the question?" So the challenger asking a
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:06.040]   neutral question, perhaps not an evil one, is a question which is legitimate, because
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:12.200]   the challenger is asking a question, saying, "God, if you continue to give good things
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:18.440]   to Job, of course he will fear you, of course he will worship you. If you keep on blessing
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:28.480]   Job, you will ruin his motive of being good, and eventually Job will fear you only because
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:33.960]   of the benefits he will receive from you." So the challenge is legitimate, right? The
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:40.960]   challenge is really legitimate. If you think about young children, you should understand
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:46.400]   that. Children will behave because they want rewards from you, they want benefits from
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:55.800]   you. And eventually, a child will behave only for the benefits he gets from you. So the
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:02.880]   challenge is a valid question, is a valid concern. And what is driving the righteousness,
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:09.920]   the worship of Job, right? That's the essence of the question. So the challenger is questioning
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:20.960]   how God operates the cosmos. Some sort of a challenge to God's way or God's policy
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:29.880]   of managing the universe. And then, from the later context, we know God readily accepts
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:36.560]   the challenge. God said, "Okay, Job is in your hand. His things is in your hand. Take
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:45.280]   his things out. Take his things away. See if he continues to worship you." So this
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:51.520]   short story kicks off the rest of the entire book, a very long book, the book of Job.
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:59.080]   Now let's take a look at this really long book of Job. What is it all about? The first
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:05.880]   three chapters' introduction is the suffering of Job. They have a dialogue between Hasatan
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:14.880]   the opposer, the challenger, which is a legitimate challenge that he presents, and then God himself.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:19.640]   First three chapters is a short introduction. And then there's cycles of cycles of cycles
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:28.000]   of dialogue between three friends of Job. They're debating why Job suffered. And then
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:38.320]   chapter 28, there's a wisdom song. And then chapter 29 to 41, another cycle of speeches.
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:45.680]   Job and then there's a guy who popped up called Elihu. Probably he represents the ancient
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:53.000]   Israel, how they see suffering, why the innocent suffer. And then lastly Yahweh, God himself,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.800]   show up and then conclusion. Now as you can see, a big chunk of the book is conversations
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:09.120]   or actually debates between Job and his friends. Why does the righteous suffer? The three friends
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:16.000]   are saying, and they insist, that Job suffered because he has done something wrong. He has
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:25.600]   sinned against God. If Job is willing, the friends argue, willing to confess his wrongdoing,
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:30.360]   whatever that is, something you can think of or you can just make it up, just confess
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:37.120]   your sin, Job, and then you will be fine. Now if Job confesses his sin, the friends
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:44.080]   are saying, your suffering will end and you will be okay and you'll get your stuff back.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:48.600]   It's very simple, it's very easy. It should be the end of conversation. But of course
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.720]   not, right? Of course not that simple because Job, in the entire chapters, in the entire
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:13:04.200]   debate, Job is saying, I am innocent. I insist that I am innocent. I do not deserve this
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:10.560]   kind of suffering. I do not deserve this kind of pain. So the debate prolongs and continues
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:16.160]   and continues. Now let's pause and ask why this prolonged
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:24.840]   conversation is there and what it really means. As I have told you before, the Bible is not
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:30.560]   written to us. It was written to the ancient audience, right, in the Near East, in the
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:37.960]   ancient Middle East. Now in the ancient Middle East world, people believe that their relationship
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:45.680]   with God or gods, the false gods, follow some sort of principle and we can summarize saying
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:54.840]   the principle is retribution principle. Some sort of, you know, I relate to God in this
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:02.280]   kind of retribution dynamic. You scratch my back and I will scratch your back. You know,
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:10.240]   this kind of, I will do good things and then the gods will give me good things. If I do
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:17.160]   something wrong, I offend the gods, then I will suffer because I did some bad things.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:23.040]   So good things lead to good stuff that I will receive. Good things lead to benefits I will
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:31.160]   receive from the gods. If I do something bad or unintentionally I step the toes of the
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:39.160]   gods, then I will suffer. If that's the case, then I have to do something better,
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   do something good so I can appease the gods. So many times, as you can see, even in today's
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:53.880]   world, in the ancient world or in the contemporary world, this kind of principle is what we assume.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.080]   Sometimes this principle works, right. We do good things, you know, there's a good
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:04.640]   return. But many times, as you can tell, it doesn't work, right. We are in the midst
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:10.240]   of pandemic, right. We are suffering because of other people's wrongdoing, right. Because
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:18.120]   of other people's mistakes. That's why in the entire book, Job continues to maintain
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:28.000]   his sinlessness, his integrity. He even demands to interview God because he, Job himself,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.200]   he wants to understand why he suffers. He has done nothing wrong, he said. So after
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:45.040]   30 some chapters, God finally shows up. He did show up and answer to Job. But the way
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:50.560]   he answered is very interesting. It's not really answering the question of suffering.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:57.120]   It's not really trying to explain the reasons why the innocent suffer, why Job suffered.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:05.520]   Let's take a look. 38 verse 1 and 4. The Lord Yahweh answered Job out of the storm. So God
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:13.160]   showed up. Verse 4. He asked a bunch of questions. One of the first questions is, "Where were
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:20.400]   you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me if you understand. If you're wise enough,
[00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:28.320]   tell me where were you when I created the world? Since you question my policy of running
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:35.320]   the universe, running the cosmos, where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?"
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:41.680]   And a bunch of questions about creation, all the awesome things that God has done since
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:49.920]   the beginning of time. And then 38, 25. This is really interesting. It's a rhetorical question.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:17:00.160]   It means the answer is always assumed. 25. God presents the questions. "Who cuts a channel
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:07.080]   for the torrents of rain and a path for the thunderstorm to water a land where no man
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:17.840]   lives, a desert with no one in it, to satisfy a wilderness, a wasteland, a desolate wasteland,
[00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:24.480]   and make it sprout with grass?" You see what is going on here? God is saying, "Do you
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:31.880]   know the principle of rain in this earth?" God is saying, "Do you even notice there are
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:40.080]   times when rain falls on no man's land? No one will get the benefit. No one will get
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:49.720]   to drink the water." And God's way of operating the universe is beyond the so-called retribution
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:57.040]   principle. Good things lead to good return. Good things lead to good stuff and benefits.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:05.000]   And God is saying, "Take a look at the rain and the snow. Sometimes it falls on no man's
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:10.400]   land. No one will get the benefit." Why? Do you understand why? It's way beyond the principle
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:17.800]   of retribution. And then 39, 13. This is one of my favorites. Talk about the big birds.
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:30.920]   Talk about the ostrich. 38, 39, 13. "The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but they
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:40.320]   cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork. She lays her eggs on the ground
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:49.120]   and lets them warm in the sand." Understandable, right? Very wise. "But unmindful that a foot
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:56.920]   may crush them." Sometimes the mother ostrich crushes the eggs and kills the birds, kills
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:03.160]   the babies. What is going on here? Sometimes a wild animal will come by and pick up the
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:13.200]   eggs and destroy the babies. If God creates everything out of his retribution principle,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:20.720]   such things would not happen, should not happen. If God creates everything in his wisdom, we
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:26.760]   should be able to understand why. And this question is saying, we just don't understand
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:34.360]   why God would do such things. God would create stupid ostrich, right? They are so stupid.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:42.040]   They are not of wisdom. And why God created them in such a way? Now all these questions
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:50.240]   God presents to Job is saying rhetorically, you know the answers? We just don't know.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:59.320]   It's way beyond our finite wisdom. We just cannot comprehend, cannot fully understand
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:06.400]   the wisdom of God by which he managed the universe. And then at the end in chapter 40,
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:16.840]   verse 3, Job, after hearing all the questions being challenged by all these rhetorical questions,
[00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:23.520]   Job answered the Lord, "I am unworthy. How can I reply to you? I put my hand over my
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:34.720]   mouth. I spoke once, but I have no answer. Twice, but I will say no more." So why suffering?
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:43.400]   Why Job suffering? At the very end of the book, there's no answer. The book is not
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:51.360]   intent to help us how to think about suffering. It doesn't give reasons for suffering. It
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:21:00.000]   doesn't really, it doesn't even defend the actions of God, right? Called theodicy. Defending
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.120]   the deeds of God, why there is suffering in the world if there is a good and all powerful
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:12.840]   God. Why evil exists? Why suffering exists? The book of Job doesn't really give a philosophical
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:18.680]   analysis of the question of suffering, the question of evil. So the book is not about
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:27.720]   how to think about suffering. The book is about how to think about God in our suffering.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:38.000]   It's not to help us think about suffering. It's to help us how to think about God in
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:46.240]   our suffering. The book expands our theology, expands our understanding of God. Presenting
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:54.960]   to us God is wise, God's wisdom is infinite. How he ordered his cosmos, how God managed
[00:21:54.960 --> 00:22:02.640]   the universe is beyond our finite mind, is beyond our comprehension. We cannot fully
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:09.160]   understand it. God's wisdom is higher than our wisdom. It's ultimately incomprehensible.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:16.560]   When I was in seminary, one of my teachers, one of the best teachers was John Frame. Dr.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:21.320]   John Frame is one of the best theologians out there. He said one thing that changed
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:31.920]   my way of worship since then. One of his theology classes, he said, "God is incomprehensible."
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:37.600]   We were studying theology. We were studying the attributes of God, the character of God.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.880]   We always focus on God is love, God is righteous, God is truth. All those things are good and
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:50.440]   they are all correct and biblical. But here, Frame says, "So often we forgot that one
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:58.000]   of the attributes of God is incomprehensibility." God is incomprehensible. And Frame continues
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:07.840]   to say, "If God is incomprehensible, his incomprehensibility is incomprehensible."
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:16.280]   How incomprehensible God is, is way beyond our comprehension. It's incomprehensible.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:27.640]   We are finite and God is infinite. God is to be trusted and his wisdom is to be trusted.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:33.720]   Even though we don't know all the answers, especially the answers for the question of
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:41.840]   suffering, the question of evil. Now, ultimately, the book of Job doesn't really offer much
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:50.160]   encouragement or comfort to suffering. Now, many Psalms in the Bible do, especially Laments
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:56.280]   or Psalms of Confidence and all those Psalms. You go to the book of Psalms, there are many
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:04.640]   Psalms that help us to get encouragement and comfort in our suffering. But the book of
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:11.440]   Job is not designed to do that. It just doesn't cut it. The book of Job doesn't really offer
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:18.360]   a defense of God in the midst of suffering. There's no philosophical analysis to human
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:25.480]   suffering. If you approach the book with such expectations, why I suffer, why the righteous
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:32.440]   suffer, why are we in the pandemic? We will be disappointed because the book is not about
[00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   how we think about suffering. The book is about how we think about God in the midst
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:45.200]   of suffering. How do we think about God in tough times? How do we think about him, our
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:56.440]   theology? That determines our life, our ethics. Theology determines ethics. How we understand
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:00.760]   God determines how we behave, how we live our lives.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:10.640]   Now, let's go back to chapter one, the valid question presented by Hasatan, the challenger.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:20.080]   Verse 9, chapter 1. Does Job fear God for nothing? It's a valid concern, it's a valid
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:28.640]   question. The question is how we think about ourselves, how we relate to God in our suffering.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:39.000]   Do you worship God because you get benefits from him? Does Job worship God, fear God for
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:48.760]   the benefits that he has? Or he really worships God and fears God for nothing, not for his
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:26:01.960]   own benefit? Is there something called disinterest righteousness, disinterest faith goodness
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   that is not concerned by our own benefits, the good things that we can get? Does Job
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:17.440]   worship God because he gets the benefits from doing so? Does Job worship God only when he
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:26.280]   experiences prosperity, blessing from God? Is Job's righteousness really disinterest?
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:33.920]   Does Job worship God no matter what, good times or bad times? That is the most important
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   question we should ask. Do we follow Christ all because of the benefits that we have?
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:50.280]   Now, don't get me wrong, we got a lot of benefits from being in Christ, right? We believe
[00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:55.280]   in Jesus, we believe in Christ, we receive the redemption. I think there are a lot of
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:04.080]   benefits that we have. Eternal life, spiritual blessings, the honour and dignity for being
[00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:11.120]   children of God, the privileges to approach God directly in Christ in prayers, the will
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:18.480]   of God that we know from the will of God. These are all the benefits that we have from
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:27.200]   being in Christ. But remember this, all of these benefits are not earned by us. We don't
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:41.000]   deserve them. And they are freely given to us in Christ, in the cross. The book of Job,
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:50.920]   essentially, is not a book on suffering. Again, there are no answers to the question, why
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:28:00.920]   we suffer. The book of Job is not a book on suffering. The book of Job is a book on discipleship.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:09.840]   Discipleship in the midst of tough times. The question, do you worship God, do you fear
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:15.360]   God for nothing? Or do you fear God because you want to get good stuff from him? When
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:25.240]   good stuff is taken away, we leave God alone. It's a book on discipleship. Discipleship
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:34.360]   in tough times. In calling us to follow Christ even in tough times, not just in good times.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:42.640]   Perhaps this is the more important question we need to begin asking as we start a new
[00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:52.160]   year. Perhaps this is the most important question. Why do you worship God? Is it because of the
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:29:01.480]   benefits that you receive? That's why you follow Christ? Or if God is God, he is worthy
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:10.400]   of our worship no matter what. He is worthy of our attention no matter what. He is still
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:17.440]   the centre of our lives no matter what. Do we follow Christ even without the benefits?
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:26.800]   This is a question of purifying our faith. Centring our faith on Christ alone. Not on
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:35.120]   the good stuff that we have we get from Christ. Again there are many benefits but remember
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:45.160]   we don't earn them. Freely given to us in grace. But do we really worship God for nothing?
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:52.840]   That should be the essence of faith. God is awesome. He is worthy of our worship. Christ
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:30:01.800]   is worthy of our following, of our faith and obedience no matter what. Thick or thin. That
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:08.320]   is the essence of faith. This is the most important question we should ask as we celebrate
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:16.880]   New Year. As we start a new year. We can set a lot of goals whenever we come to New Year.
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:25.120]   You want to lose weight. You want to live a healthier lifestyle. You want to hit this
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:30.640]   goal or that goal in your career or in your school. Those are really good and worthy goals.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:36.960]   But the most important question we need to ask is presented by the book of John. Do you
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:50.000]   fear God for nothing? Is God really worthy of your worship no matter what? I read a New
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:59.080]   Year's prayer written by someone anonymous. I find this prayer really meaningful and I
[00:30:59.080 --> 00:31:11.160]   would like to end today's worship by reading this prayer together. A New Year's prayer.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:18.600]   May God make your year a happy one. Not by shielding you from all sorrows and pain, but
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:27.880]   by strengthening you to bear it as it comes. Not by making your path easy, but by making
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:36.800]   you sturdy to travel any path. Not by taking hardships from you, but by taking fear out
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:45.880]   of your heart. Not by granting you unbroken sunshine, but by keeping your face bright
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:52.000]   even in the shadows. Not by making your life always pleasant, but by showing you when people
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:59.080]   and their causes need you most and by making you anxious to be there to help them. God's
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:09.280]   love, peace, hope and joy to you for the year to come. Let's all pray together.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:20.000]   Dear God, you are the awesome and greatest God. You are the creator. You are everything
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:31.240]   and you are infinite and ultimately incomprehensible. You are worthy of our worship, worthy of our
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:43.320]   attention, worthy of our obedience. And God help us as we start a new year. As this prayer
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:51.320]   is not by praying that you take all these bad things and sickness and pandemic out of
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:33:00.120]   our lives. Of course that's a worthy prayer, but that is not the main thing. It's that
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:09.020]   no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in, with sorrow or with pain, with darkness
[00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:21.600]   and struggles, we pray that you will grant us faith. Grant us obedience. Help us to follow
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:31.920]   you no matter what. In good times or in bad times. In good times or in tough times. Help
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:38.920]   us to follow you faithfully and worship you. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:48.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
