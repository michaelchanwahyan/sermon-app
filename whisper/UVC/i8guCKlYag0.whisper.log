[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   And here's the announcement.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Let's welcome Pastor Mark for today's sermon.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Welcome everyone.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   And again, I want to remind you on your way out,
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   there will be a table, there will be some products, CDs and media products featuring sun music.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   And please go pick it up. It's not free.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   You have to pay for it.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   And I think it's worth for you to support a ministry like this, right?
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   To have strong and solid spiritual hymns and contemporary songs, worship songs, serving for the church.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   And we want to praise God and thank God for using Brenda in the past many years and writing so many songs.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And Cantonese songs or English songs or Mandarin songs, right?
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Mandarin songs. Wasn't it a beautiful song?
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   What was it?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   The Mandarin song I'm talking about. Yeah, the third one.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Okay, those of you who don't know Chinese, it's okay.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   It's still beautiful, right?
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   It's still beautiful.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And we want a ministry like this to grow and to work with the church and support the church
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   so that churches around the world can sing praises to our Lord, right?
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Amen?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So please do support the Sun Music ministry.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   By the way, they have a YouTube channel and go Google it.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Sun Music, S-O-N, Son of God, S-O-N, God's Son, Jesus Christ, S-O-N Music, okay?

[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Go and subscribe, please. Go and subscribe, all right?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And support her ministry and it's really a bless to have her in the past weekend.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   And we got five people last night to come forward and made the decision to come to know Jesus.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Amen to that, right?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Thank God for that.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And today, I know my time is very limited and I'll make it short.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And I want to start with this question.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   It's a big question.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I wonder if you read the Bible, you try to understand the Bible,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   have you ever asked yourself a question, "What does God really want?"
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   What in the world does God desire the most?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You know, look at Genesis 1 to the last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   There was a theme underlying all of these books.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Now, there are 66 books in the Bible, 39 books in the Old Testament, and 27 books in the New Testament.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   But among all of the books from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   there is an underlying central theme that runs through every single book, every single passage.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And what does God really want?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And that theme that underlines and links every single thing together,
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   one of those themes is that God wants to make His home among us.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   He wants to live among us, among His people.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Whenever we worship, whenever the church gathers,
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   we sing praises to the name of Jesus, we exalt the name of the Lord.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   When we worship together, God lives among us.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And that's one of the major themes underlying the entire Old Testament and New Testament, entire Bible.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Do you realize that even though there are 66 separate books in the collection,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   what we call Bible, is actually a big story, a big narrative,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   big narrative to introduce to us who God really is.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I want you to pay attention in the next five to seven minutes as I cut this sermon into a very condensed form.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   I want to give you a very, very quick summary.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   What the Bible is all about, what God really wants, is to live in your life.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   God wants to fill your life with His love, His joy, and His peace, and His kingdom.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That's what God really wants. That is what God really desires.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   God is not some kind of transcendent concept out there somewhere and doesn't care about you.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   God cares about you deeply. God wants to make His home in your heart.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   And He wants to make His home in His people, in the churches, in all of God's people.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   I want you to pay attention to three circles.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And these three circles is a very, very condensed summary of what the entire Bible is all about.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   And you ever use a napkin, a piece of napkin?
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   You can put the entire Bible on a piece of napkin.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   This is a napkin theology, all right? Napkin theology.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   You can just do it during lunch or during dinner.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   On the dining table, take a piece of napkin, and you can summarize the entire, entire story of the Bible.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   And this three circles is, you have to imagine, the first circle is on your upper left,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   is that God created this world good and orderly.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   God created everything, the entire cosmos, the entire universe, out of love.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Do you realize that God is Trinity, right? Three persons in one God, right?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   That's kind of interesting. That kind of defiles our logic, right?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   There is no way for us to wrap around what is going on.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   God is one, but He's also three. God is also three, but one, right?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Isn't that interesting, right? But that is what God in His essence.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   He is not a lone person. He is a community, one community, united together, and love one another.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   The Father loves the Son, and the Son loves the Spirit, and the Spirit loves the Son and the Father.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And there's a mutual community of the God Himself.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   God is three in one, Father, Son, and Spirit.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   How many of you have children? How many have children? Yeah.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   A few of you, yeah. You should understand, right?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   First, when we first gave birth to the first child, what did we do? What did we do?
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   We prepared the crib, we prepared the diapers, we prepared the bottles, we prepared everything.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   And we set aside a room for her, and we set aside so many things, and put the child in your first priority.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   At least, you know, ten months or so before the birth of the child, right?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And why do we do that?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And you have to know, parents are doing this, not only they want to set up the physical space, the house.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   God, parents, parents want to do a home.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   You know, house and home are different, right?
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   We have some brothers and sisters moving around in the summer, in the past year,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   moved from house one to another one, and they bought another house,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   or they rent another house and moved to another place.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Those of you who are students, you move out of your dormitory, and then move to another apartment,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   and then you move from here and there, right?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Those are house stories, just physical space.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Now, this is what's interesting to us, because we opened the Bible, Genesis 1.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   God created the heaven and the earth, the entire cosmos.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And so often, we treat the story, Genesis 1, as a house story.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   We think that God is simply just creating all the physical structures, right?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   That's the planet Earth, and you've got different planets and different stars, and sun and moon, and all that stuff.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   It's all about material that we think about.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   But Genesis 1, the Bible tells us, is not a house story.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Genesis 1 is a home story.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   God wants to create humankind so that He can enter relationship with those created in His image.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   That is not a house story.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   That's a relational story, right?
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Much like parents preparing the arrival of the child.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   You know what the child needs?
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]   It's not the physical space. It's not just that.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   It's not just buying stuff for him or her.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   It's the relationship.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   You want a child to be born in a home that is warm and welcoming.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   That is, you find relationship in it, peace in it, love in it.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   That's what Genesis is all about.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   That's what God's creation is all about.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   God created you and me because He wants to enter into a relationship with us.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   So that we can worship Him, and we'll be His people.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   And God's life will dwell among us.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   It will dwell in your heart.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   So God created everything good.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   And as you can tell, if you trace the entire story of the Bible, things didn't go well.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Quickly, humankind rebelled against God.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   They want to say to God, "You are no longer God. I am the God."
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   "We are the gods. We are the little gods. We are the bosses."
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   "And we take charge of our own life. You create it for us."
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   "No, you don't be our God. We will be our own God."
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And that's why they were in exile.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And if you trace the entire story of the Bible,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   God is not giving up His desire to dwell among you.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   To dwell in your life.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   You trace the story of Genesis, Exodus, and all that.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   All the Old Testament books.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   God is trying to make His dwelling.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   God is trying to make His home in His people.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So after Eden, you got Abraham.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And God called Abraham out to form a nation out of him.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   So that through this nation, Israel, everyone in the world will be blessed.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   In the sense that everyone, every nation, will be brought back to God.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   To His fellowship so that God can live among them.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   So that when Israel was saved by grace from Egypt,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   God was telling them, "I'm going to walk with you."
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   "I'm going to be present with you."
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   "That's why I have my tabernacle among you."
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   The book of Exodus.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Chapter after chapter.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Talking about how to build a tabernacle.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   A tabernacle is simply a portable tent.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   A portable home.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Because they were in wilderness for 40 years.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   And God said, "I'm going to be with you."
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   "I'll be your God and you will be my people."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   And then finally they arrived at the promised land.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   The book of Joshua.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   They settled down in the promised land and God fought the battles for them.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And let them settle down in His good land.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And finally, ultimately, they arrived at Jerusalem.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   And King David brought the Ark of the Covenant to the capital, Jerusalem.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   And then his son, Solomon, built the first temple.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And you read the account of the building and dedication of the first temple.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   You find that God's glory filled the earth.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   He filled the entire temple because God finally made His home in His people.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   It was so glorious and everybody saw His glory.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   And of course things didn't go well.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Soon after, the kingdom split.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Right?
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   And they abandoned God and they followed the false gods.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   They worshipped idols.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   And then finally they brought the end to their nation.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   So Israel was gone.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   And then Judah was gone.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   And then the entire people of God was in exile.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   However, God did not give up.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   God dwelt among the exiled people in Babylon.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   After 70 years of exile, they returned back to the land of promise.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   They returned to Jerusalem.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   And God continued to dwell with them in the second temple.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And after decades and centuries, God finally showed up.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   It's Jesus.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Jesus Christ, the Son of God.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   He came and dwelt in His people.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   So that's the first circle.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   That's the first circle.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   And we sinned and we did rebellious things.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And we're going to set up ourselves as gods.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And that's why the world has so much suffering.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   The world has so much brokenness.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   I read an article not too long ago.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   It says in the 21st century, mental health has become a crisis and is on the rise.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Now this is nothing new to you.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   And the article tried to capture what is going on in our broken world because of sin.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   The author said it's brokenness.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   You observe around our world, you see brokenness everywhere.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Family is fragmented.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   We live in an age, the author said, an age of alienation.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   We are aliens to one another.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   We are separated. We are broken off from one another.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   And most of all, broken from God, our Creator.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   And that's why Jesus came.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Jesus came and offered a way so that we can come back to the home of God,
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   to the relationship of God.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   And whosoever repent and whosoever believe in the name of Jesus,
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   our life will be restored.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   And that is what the gospel is all about.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And because of the gospel, we are recovered, we are reconciled with our Creator,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   the good home, the owner, the Lord of the home.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   And that is what the gospel is.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Gospel of John 1.14
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   "So the Word became human and made His home among us.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And we have seen His glory, the glory of the Son of God,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   the glory of the Father's one and only Son."
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Pay attention to those words.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   "The Word became human and made His home among us."
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   By the way, the original text, the original language,
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   "made His home among us" is actually tabernacle.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   He made His tent, His home in the midst of His people.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   That is what the gospel is all about.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   If you yield to God, if you repent and return to God,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   and say yes to God, then God will dwell in your life.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   And you will see His glory.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   And the glory we see is on the cross.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   He came in humility and He died in your place.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   The righteous one became sin for all of us.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   So that He could bear all the wounds and brokenness
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   and all the sins on the cross.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And by the cross we are redeemed.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   And that's what the gospel is all about.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   God wants to dwell in your life, to write His story in your life.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Back in the 1960s, and I used this illustration last night.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Back in the 1960s, the Russians,
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   they were successful in sending a man to outer space.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   So they sent a man on a rocket, and a man went to outer space,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   and then returned.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   So as the Russian returned, he talked to the news outlet.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   In the news conference, he said, "Oh, we have been to outer space,
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   and we didn't find God, or we didn't find heaven.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   So God does not exist."
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   That was his conclusion.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Or maybe God did exist, but He doesn't care about us anymore.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   He's not there anymore.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   So he made this news, this kind of conclusion in the news conference.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Now back then in the 1970s, '60s, in England,
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   there was a literature professor, a Christian theologian.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   His name is C.S. Lewis.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And C.S. Lewis has been a very good writer, a very creative writer.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And he responded to the Russian, and he said,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   "So this guy being sent to outer space, and then returned,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   he said this guy is looking for God in the outer space.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   It's kind of like Hamlet looking for Shakespeare in his own world."
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   You know Hamlet and Shakespeare?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   How many of you have heard of Shakespeare?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   You did, right? Yeah.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   How many of you read some of the works of Shakespeare?
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   Okay, wow, you guys are really educated.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   (Laughter)
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   And one of the main characters in one of the plays
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   written by Shakespeare is Hamlet.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   It's a character full of life, right?
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   A character inside the story of Hamlet,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   and he had to make a lot of decisions, life and death,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   be or not to be, that's the question, that kind of thing, right?
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   He went through so much ordeal.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   And Hamlet, think about it, in the story of Hamlet,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   in the world of Hamlet, he has no way to get to know Shakespeare.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Because if you read the entire story, the entire play of Hamlet,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   you won't find Shakespeare in Hamlet's story.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   So C.S. Lewis was saying,
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   "If the guy, the Russian, went to outer space, and then returned,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   he couldn't find God,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   it's kind of like Hamlet looking for Shakespeare in his own world."
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   The only way Hamlet can get to know Shakespeare
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   is for the author himself to write himself his story
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   into the story of Hamlet.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   That is the only way.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   That is the only way for the character to get to know the author
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   is for the author to take the initiative
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   to write himself into his story.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   You know, if you think about it, what C.S. Lewis has said,
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   it's actually the gospel.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   The gospel tells us God enters our world in Jesus
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   and meets us where we are.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   He came to live among us, and God literally writes his story,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   writes himself into your story.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Jesus is willing to humble himself to be known by you
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   so that you can have a relationship with God.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   And that's what God desired from the original plan.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   God's desire has always been to live among us
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   so that we can worship him.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   John 1:14, "So the Word became flesh,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   became human just like us, and made his own among us."
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   I tell you, the world needs to see the glory of God.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   How do they see it?
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   See through you that the life of Jesus can live inside of you.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   And the church has a lot we need to do.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   There are so many things we need to do together.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   When we worship together, when we live in Christ together,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   we learn how to love one another,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   we learn how to fellowship with one another,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   to love each other as Christ loves us.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   In this community, then God will be shown.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Last night we had a sister, Lily.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   She was a devout Buddhist.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   And it's just amazing to hear her story again and again,
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   how she came to our church and how she came to know Christ
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   because of the community that live out the gospel.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   And let's do that.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   When we worship, when we gather,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   when we form a community in Christ,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Jesus lives among us and God made his home in the midst of us.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   Let's all pray together.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   And I ask the praise team to come here to sing the last song as a response.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   Father, we give you thanks because of your desire to be with us.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   And you humble yourself in your son, Jesus Christ,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   to write yourself in our story.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Thank you for being our living God.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   May our community continue to display your glory,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   to tell the world that you are real,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   to tell the world that you are in our midst.
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   Thank you. In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
