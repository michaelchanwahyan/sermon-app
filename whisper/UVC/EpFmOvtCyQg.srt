1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Right here?

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 All right.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Okay.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Today we're going to look at a passage that I had asked Kelly.

5
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 I said, "Hey, Kelly, when was the last time you preached this passage?"

6
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Because I wanted to make sure that it's been two years since we looked at Judges chapter 6.

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 And when I first looked at the story of Judges 6 with Gideon,

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 we looked at the idea of tearing down the altars and putting the proper altar in its place.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 But today we're going to talk about a topic that I think applies to every single one of us in the room,

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 is the idea of work.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 60% of all of our time throughout the entire week is spent at a job.

12
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,000
 And a lot of times within that job, some of us may love what we do.

13
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 Some of us may just sit in there and say, "Man, is this all there is to my life? I hate my job."

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 And we're left wondering, "Lord, what is it that you're calling us to do in the idea of work?"

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 Faith, work, integration is so important for us as Christ followers

16
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 because we do that all the time for a good chunk of the rest of our lives.

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 We're at work until you decide to retire.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 Whether it's at 60 or whether it's 75 or 80 years old, you will be working.

19
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 And I wish that some of us were probably sitting there, could be like David,

20
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 where Samuel calls out and is trying to select the next king.

21
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 And David shows up and he whispers to David, "You're going to be the next king."

22
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 But it doesn't always happen, does it?

23
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 Some of us are like Joseph, where we kind of land in exactly at a time when God uses us.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 Joseph is a guy that for some odd reason, his brother sold him into slavery.

25
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 And now he is a slave.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 And somehow or another, God has given him the skills to rise up in the ranks in the palace

27
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
 of where he sold in slavery.

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 But then his boss's wife accuses him of sexual malpractice and that he's thrown into prison.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And later on, because of all the things that are happening,

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 he rises up to be the chief of staff in the political system.

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Some of us are like Nehemiah, who is a cupbearer to the king.

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 He tastes food so that the king, his boss, doesn't get poisoned.

33
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 And somehow or another, God uses the cupbearer to the king

34
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 to then rebuild the walls of Jerusalem because he has given him that burden.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 Or then some of us look at the two tax collectors in the Gospels.

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 There's the tax collector of Matthew, where Jesus says to Matthew,

37
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 "Pack up everything and follow me."

38
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 But yet at the same time, he says to Zacchaeus, who climbs up a tree to see him,

39
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 "I want you to follow me by staying as a tax collector."

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 So how do you know when to be a tax collector?

41
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 How do you know when to drop everything and follow Jesus?

42
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 How do you know when to be a king?

43
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 How do you know when to do all these different things?

44
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 All of us are on the journey, aren't we?

45
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Some of us are called to be like Pastor Mark is a full-time vocational ministry.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Some people are called to be a stay-at-home mom.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 Some people are called to be a teacher or a nurse.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Some people are called to be an engineer, an entrepreneur.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:17,000
 How do we begin to know what God has gifted us to be?

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 And it becomes a journey that he leads all of us on.

51
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 And sometimes within the journey, there's different chapters in our life within that journey.

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And within those chapters, is that where you want me to be?

53
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 Maybe, but maybe not.

54
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 And so sometimes he'll ask us to pivot, and 20 years from now, we'll look back at our life and say,

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 "Wow, that's what you've been preparing me for."

56
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:50,000
 I think I've told all of you guys I spent the first 10 years of my life building cell towers.

57
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 Then from that point on, I spent about three years working in a Korean church,

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 while at the same time, also at that point in time before that,

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 serving in a church over in Chinatown at CCUC.

60
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 And then from that point, I worked at Moody Bible Institute for a number of three years.

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 And then now for the last 10 years, I work at Resource Global,

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 and Wheaton College, Northern Seminary for a period of time.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Lord, is that what you're calling me to do?

64
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,000
 I thought it was building cell towers, or rather that.

65
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 I went to college thinking I was going to medical school.

66
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 God calls us to do different things.

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 So today, he calls this particular person,

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
 and we're going to look at that person,

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 and we're going to glean some stories that he talks in.

70
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 What the whole idea is, what is God calling you to do right now?

71
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 And can you and I be faithful to where God has placed us in?

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 Because God, for a period of time, has called you at that point in time,

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:57,000
 at that point in place, to make a difference for the gospel.

74
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 We start in Judges 6.

75
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 I studied this for a number of years.

76
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 And it is such a powerful--it begins with this whole idea,

77
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 "The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.

78
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years.

79
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel.

80
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 And because of Midian, the people of Israel made for themselves

81
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,000
 the debris that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds.

82
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 For whenever the Israelites planted crops to Midianites and the Amalekites

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 and the people of the east would come up against them.

84
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land as far as Gaza

85
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey.

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 For they would come up with their livestock in their tents.

87
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 They would come like locusts in numbers.

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 Both they and their camels could not be counted,

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 so that they laid waste to land as they came in.

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And Israel was brought very low because of Midian.

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 And the people of Israel cried out for help in the Lord.

92
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Don't ever misinterpret how God uses events in our life to turn us back to him.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 And too often with the Israelites, time and time and time again,

94
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 the Israelites go and do whatever they want to do.

95
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 But yet God uses situations and circumstances in our life

96
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 to call and draw us back to them.

97
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 And some of those circumstances may be trials in hard times.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And here we see an example of that in the hands of the Midian.

99
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 When the people of Israel in John chapter, Judges chapter 6, verse 7,

100
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 when the people of Israel cried out to the Lord on count of the Midianites,

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel, and he said to them,

102
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 "Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel,

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 'I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of bondage,

104
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,000
 and I delivered you from the hands of the Egyptians

105
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 and from the hand of all who oppressed you,

106
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 and drove them out before you and gave you their land.

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 And I said to you, 'I am the Lord your God,

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 and you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell,

109
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 but you have not obeyed my voice.'"

110
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 And now the angel of the Lord, when the angel of the Lord appears,

111
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 you listen to him, "came and sat down on the terebth at Oprah," in verse 11,

112
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 "which belonged to Joash the Abyssalite,

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 to hide it from the Midianites."

115
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 And here's a key verse, and we've looked at it before, verse 12,

116
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 "And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and says to him,

117
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 'The Lord is with you, O mighty man of valor.'"

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 In verse 12, "The Lord says to him, 'The Lord is with you, O mighty man of valor.'"

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 If you were to look at the NIV, I'm reading from the ESV,

120
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 if you were to look at the NIV, it says, "O mighty, mighty warrior."

121
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 "The Lord is with you, O mighty warrior."

122
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,000
 And when you're looking at that, your first thought is,

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 "Wait a minute, Lord, why are you calling him a mighty warrior?"

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 That is the verse that sticks out.

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Why is the angel of the Lord calling him a mighty warrior?

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 Why is that?

127
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 He's threshing wheat in a winepress.

128
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 That and being a mighty warrior don't go hand in hand.

129
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 And you're wondering why.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Because if you go into it, it's harvest time, right?

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 It is harvest time, the wheat is ready to be harvested,

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 and you're pulling out all of the wheat, and you pull out all the stalks

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 and everything like that, and you usually grab all your wheat,

134
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 and you lay out on top of a threshing floor.

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And a threshing floor is usually an inclined space out in the open,

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 on a hill and everything like that, and you'll understand exactly what it is,

137
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 and you'll lay out all your wheat on the threshing floor.

138
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:14,000
 And from that point on, if you have a lot of wheat, you'll get your oxen,

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 you'll get your horses, you'll get all that stuff,

140
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 and you're going to stomp on it, stomp on it, stomp on it.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 If you have a tiny little harvest, you'll take a little flail or hammer,

142
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 and you sit there and you'll hit the wheat over and over and over again,

143
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 and it separates the stalks and it separates the head.

144
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 And from that point on, once you do that, remember it's out in the open,

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 you'll take a little rake or a winnowing fork, and you'll sit there

146
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 and you'll lift it high and you'll throw it high up in the air.

147
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 And it separates the two areas.

148
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 It separates the heavier grain on one side and the straw on the other side.

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 And then there's seed covering the chaff, and as you're throwing it up

150
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 with this winnowing fork, it's blowing all over.

151
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And that's why it has to be up on an inclined space out in the open

152
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 where there's a lot of breeze that blows everything away.

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 And that is threshing wheat on the threshing floor.

154
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 But where is this guy at? He's in--what? He's threshing wheat where?

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 In a wine press. What's a wine press?

156
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 It's literally a hole, a rectangular hole, in which when I stand in there,

157
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 it goes up to my waist, and you lay out all your grapes right there.

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 And you sit there and you stomp on it.

159
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 And there's a little hole which leads to a set of cisterns or jars

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 and everything like that.

161
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 And as soon as you sit there and you stomp on it and you stomp on it

162
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 and you stomp on it, all the juice rolls into a cistern.

163
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 But yet it's not an inclined space.

164
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And yet he is threshing wheat. In where?

165
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 In a wine press.

166
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 And the angel of the Lord, the Lord, the angel of the Lord calls him,

167
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 "The Lord is with you, mighty warrior."

168
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 And when you're sitting there in verse 12, looking at it,

169
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 you're sitting there, "Okay, Lord, what are you seeing?

170
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 He's not a mighty warrior.

171
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 He's afraid. He's a coward.

172
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 So why are you calling him a mighty warrior?"

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 Two things, two things, two very important things.

174
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 Number one, the Lord sees you differently.

175
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 The how you see yourself and not how others see you.

176
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 The Lord sees you differently to how you see yourself

177
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 and how others see you.

178
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 The Lord sees in him Gideon, a mighty warrior.

179
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 We see in him a guy who's afraid.

180
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 That's why he's threshing wheat on the wine press.

181
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 We see a guy who's scared.

182
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 We see a guy who lacks courage.

183
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 And we don't understand what God is trying to say to him.

184
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 "The Lord is with you, almighty man of valor.

185
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 The Lord is with you, mighty warrior." Yes!

186
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 Because God sees you differently

187
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 to how you see yourselves and how others see you.

188
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 That's number one.

189
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 Number two, in terms of this, God has a name for you.

190
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 God has a purpose for you.

191
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 God has a vision for you.

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 For Gideon was a mighty man of valor, mighty warrior.

193
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 What's the name that he has for you?

194
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 What's the name that you believe that he's calling you to be?

195
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 If we all sat here in a group and had an exercise

196
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 and we got a chance to brag each other,

197
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 and I know a lot of times primarily with us Asians

198
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 and other stuff is we don't like to talk,

199
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 we don't like to brag about ourselves,

200
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 but we are familiar with what skills and gifts we do have.

201
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 What's the name that he's given to you?

202
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 What vision does he have for your life?

203
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 For Gideon is the mighty warrior.

204
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 Maybe for Mark, a lot of times, it's leadership

205
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,000
 or it's shepherding or something like that, administrative.

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 Maybe it's the ability to convene people.

207
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Maybe it's the ability to inspire people.

208
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Maybe it's the ability to build together a team

209
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 or whatever it is.

210
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Maybe a lot of times your intellect is so brilliant

211
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
 because that's how God is going to--

212
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 he's using you to do things and change education.

213
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 Maybe it's because your skill, you're going to change healthcare.

214
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Whatever it is, what is that vision?

215
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 Maybe it's being an engineer to create innovative tools.

216
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 What is that vision in your life?

217
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 As we continue to seek the Lord,

218
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 what is he calling us in our life?

219
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 There's this one lady that I got a chance to meet.

220
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 She's Filipino, and if you came, she's very quiet,

221
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 and she would just sit there, and you probably wouldn't even know her.

222
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 Her name is Nikki.

223
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 But what you don't know about Nikki is she is a brilliant lady.

224
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 She is extremely talented, teaches part-time at Stanford University.

225
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Then she's an entrepreneur, started working in education,

226
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 worked in colleges and universities and the executive level,

227
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 but then she started realizing she doesn't have a medical degree

228
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 and all that stuff.

229
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 She was great at entrepreneurial things.

230
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 She was great at starting up and launching different ideas.

231
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 Now she teaches part-time at Stanford.

232
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 She's the founding CEO of a company that is working with

233
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 artificial intelligence and nanobots to replace--

234
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 Kelly, what is that thing when you put oxygen in your--

235
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 - [Kelly] The nasal canthopathy?

236
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 - Something like that, where it puts oxygen in your--

237
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 You can breathe through oxygen, right?

238
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I completely blanked on it.

239
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 That's what she's working on right now.

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 And why in the world was she doing that?

241
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 Because during COVID, her mother died because she wasn't getting

242
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 enough oxygen in her body.

243
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 And she's a single older lady, and she started searching

244
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 while she was in San Francisco with her mother passing away.

245
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 How do we address this problem?

246
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Because her mother was at older age, and she wasn't able to get

247
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 enough oxygen.

248
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 They weren't able to put enough oxygen in her body, and she

249
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 passed because of COVID.

250
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 And God used that experience as hard as it was as a Christ follower

251
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 to look and address the problem.

252
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 And she started finding out these different doctors and what they're

253
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 doing, and through her entrepreneurial skill, launched this entire

254
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 company that she's doing to change how she integrates her faith

255
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
 in her work.

256
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 What is the name that God has given us?

257
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 Gideon, it was "Mighty Warrior."

258
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 What is the name that he has given you?

259
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 Because how God looks at you, how God sees you, is different than

260
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 the picture that we see of ourselves and that others see us.

261
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Go on, and Gideon says to her, "Please, sir, if the Lord is with

262
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 us, then why then has all this happened to us?

263
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 And were all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us

264
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 saying, 'Did not the Lord bring us up out of Egypt?'

265
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of

266
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 Midian.'

267
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And the Lord turned to him and says, 'Go in this might of yours

268
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 and save Israel from the hand of Midian.'

269
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 Do not I send you?'

270
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And verse 15, "And he said to him, 'Please, Lord, how can I save

271
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 Israel?

272
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 Because my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in

273
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 my father's home.'"

274
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 Take a look at that.

275
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 You know how Gideon saw himself?

276
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 The angel of the Lord, the Lord sees him as mighty warrior.

277
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Gideon himself sees him as the weakest clan and him as the

278
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 weakest in the weakest clan.

279
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 "Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh."

280
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 Of all these clans that we have here, my clan is the weakest, and

281
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 I am the least in my father's home.

282
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 You don't understand this.

283
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 My clan of all the clans is the weakest, and I am the weakest in

284
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 the weakest clan.

285
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 You know where that put me?

286
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Dead last, dead last.

287
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 That's how Gideon sees himself.

288
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 That was the name that he has given himself.

289
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 He has defined himself as someone who couldn't accomplish much

290
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:04,000
 because I am the weakest in the weakest clan of everyone, and I

291
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 am last, and what in the world can you do for me?

292
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 And now here I am threshing wheat in a wine press because I'm

293
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,000
 scared of the Midianites, and even though this threshing wheat

294
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 on the threshing floor is not gonna cut it in the threshing,

295
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 I'll take whatever I can get because my name is defined by

296
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 being in the weakest clan and me being the weakest.

297
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 What defines you?

298
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 What are the insecurities that you have?

299
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 How do you see yourself?

300
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 How do you look at yourself in the mirror?

301
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 Are you not the smartest?

302
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 Are you not the brightest?

303
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 And you may have all of these ideas, and if you look at the

304
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 story in verse 16, the Lord said to him, "But I will be with you,

305
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 and you shall strike the Midianites as one man."

306
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Do you not see what's happening here?

307
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 When you look at the verses, you know what the Lord never says

308
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 to Gideon?

309
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 He never disagrees with him.

310
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 When he says to him, "My clan is the weakest, and menace I am,

311
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 and the weakest in my weakest clan," the Lord never disagrees

312
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 with him.

313
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 The Lord doesn't say to Gideon, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, your clan's

314
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 not the weakest.

315
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 So-and-so, I think, is the weaker one.

316
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 Look, you're not the weakest of the weakest clan, all right?

317
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Maybe you're not the weakest, but you're not the weakest.

318
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 So-and-so probably is weak."

319
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 No, he doesn't disagree with him.

320
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 He doesn't say otherwise.

321
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 He agrees with him.

322
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 He says, "Go in the strength that you have."

323
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 That when you and I sit here, "Lord, I'm not that smart."

324
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 You know what the Lord says?

325
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 "I know.

326
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Lord, I'm not that talented.

327
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 I know.

328
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 Lord, do you not know the history that I came from?

329
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Do you not know how bad I was, my family, the path I came in?

330
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Yes, I know.

331
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 Lord, I came through a poor family.

332
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 My parents immigrated here.

333
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 My parents immigrated in '72, and a lot of times, I don't know

334
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 how to operate in these worlds.

335
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 I know.

336
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 You don't have that experience.

337
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 I know, I know, I know.

338
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Lord, I'm a little socially awkward.

339
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 I get a little shy.

340
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 I don't know what to say.

341
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 I know.

342
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 I know.

343
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 I know.

344
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 You know why I know?

345
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 Because I made you.

346
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
 I created you.

347
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 I painted your life.

348
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 I designed your entire path in your life.

349
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 I know what's going to happen in your life.

350
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 I know these things.

351
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 I gave you your strengths.

352
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
 I gave you your weaknesses.

353
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 You're stuck, Gideon, that you just see what you have.

354
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 You come from the weakest clan, and you're the weakest in the

355
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 weakest clan.

356
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 But despite all that, Gideon, you're a mighty warrior, because

357
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 that's the vision I have for you.

358
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 What's the vision that he has for your life?

359
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 And how is that manipulated by sometimes the name that we have

360
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 given to ourselves?

361
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 My biggest encouragement to each one of you, and those who are

362
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 watching, those who are sitting here, don't you ever, ever let

363
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 anyone say anything, because your age, your sex, the color of

364
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 your skin, your education, how wealthy you are, how bright you

365
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 are, the quality of your work, your job title, all of that,

366
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 don't ever let people look down on you.

367
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 You come before the Lord each and every single day.

368
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 You say, "Lord, what is it that you're calling me to do?

369
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:38,000
 And whatever path you ask me to do, I will be faithful to that,

370
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 and I will give you the best I can to glorify and honor you,

371
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,000
 because you have called me to do it with excellence and to

372
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 continue to pursue the calling that you have for your life."

373
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 And we may not know what that calling is.

374
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 God may not reveal to you what that calling is.

375
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 It may take 20 years.

376
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 It may take five years.

377
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 But we're pursuing every single day, and we are faithful every

378
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 single day, and we are coming before the Lord to seek what

379
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 that means.

380
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 Let me give you an example of that.

381
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 Here's an example.

382
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 And I hope as I tell you this story, you're going to sit

383
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 there, "Tommy, what are you trying to do?"

384
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 It's not me bragging about myself, but this is what I

385
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 learned about faith, work, integration, right?

386
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 When I graduated from Washington University in St.

387
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 Louis, I actually didn't know what I was going to do.

388
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 I had no job.

389
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:46,000
 And so I got introduced to a guy who introduced me to a

390
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 company that built cell towers for a living.

391
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 And so a lot of times I got a job.

392
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 I had no engineering degree.

393
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 I was a general management major.

394
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And a lot of times, where am I going to go to work?

395
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 I don't know.

396
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 So I get an introduction.

397
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 I get an interview.

398
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 I sat with this guy named Mike Mitchell, and he's a director

399
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 at Tower Operations.

400
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 Later on, I reported this guy named Dan.

401
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 But Mike sits there, and he looks at my resume, and he

402
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 says, "Did you have an internship?"

403
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 "Nope."

404
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 "Do you have an engineering degree?"

405
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 "Nope."

406
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 "Do you have any experience in the cell phone industry?"

407
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 "Nope."

408
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 And he puts it down.

409
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 He says, "Tell me why I need to hire you.

410
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 Just give me a reason why."

411
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
 And I said, "There's no reason why you should hire me."

412
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 And he looks at me, and he says, "Really?"

413
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 "Yes, there's no reason why you should hire me, but give

414
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 me one year.

415
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 I will work as hard as I can, and I will give you everything

416
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 I have, and I will learn this business, and in one year,

417
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 I will make a difference in this company."

418
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 He says, "Oh, yeah.

419
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 I like your answer.

420
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 You're hired."

421
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 And so the first thing that he says, I get to work, and he

422
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 says, "We just acquired 200 towers from Verizon Wireless,

423
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 and those cell towers and all the file folders and all the

424
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 construction drawings all came in, but here's my problem.

425
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 They didn't put any order to it, so they're all in different--

426
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 they're all in this room.

427
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 Your first job for the next five months, go organize

428
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 the file room."

429
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 I'm a college grad from Washington University in St.

430
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 Louis.

431
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 I was a pre-med major.

432
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:30,000
 You want me to be a file room, yes?

433
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And the Lord said to me, "Tommy, wherever I put you, may

434
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 you be faithful to where I place you."

435
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,000
 And so I went, and I had the best attitude because, "Lord,

436
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,000
 I don't know why you put me here, but whatever it is, let

437
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 me be faithful to where you have put me."

438
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 And I learned that file room really well, and I learned to

439
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 tell the difference between FAA, FCC, environmental, structural

440
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 analysis, everything.

441
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
 But what I didn't realize during all that time was God was in

442
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 the midst of working and creating me the habits, the

443
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,000
 discipline of looking at details and being organized and seeing

444
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 structure every single day for five to six months.

445
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 I had to look at these details.

446
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 After that five months was over, a lot of times they promoted me

447
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 over to scanner guy.

448
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
 I had to scan all these documents.

449
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
 I said, "Oh, my gosh, I've got to scan everything, create a

450
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 system to scan everything."

451
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 So I did that for another four months.

452
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 During that period of time, I had this one guy named Dan.

453
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 He was our project director, and he says, "Tommy, you've done

454
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 really well.

455
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 Get some files and meet me every single day," and we did this

456
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 for three months at 5 o'clock, and I will show you what it

457
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 means to be a project manager.

458
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,000
 We did that for another three months.

459
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 So all together, I'm now in my company for nine months, and

460
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 after that, they promoted me as project manager with no

461
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 engineering skills or anything like that.

462
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 Here's a couple of other things as well, too.

463
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 Now I had a rough boss, but, Lord, are you helping me?

464
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 Are you working with me?

465
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 Are we faithful to where our -- the one thing I encourage you

466
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 wherever you are, are you faithful to where God has

467
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 placed you to be?

468
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 Here I am as a project manager, and now I am working on the

469
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Sprint project, and usually a lot of times you're building

470
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 20 towers.

471
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 This year, I had to build 40 towers, and then one day, I'm in

472
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 a deployment meeting at Sprint, and there's this guy named

473
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 Sonny Peterman.

474
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 He's the vice president of our region.

475
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Sonny, you should never work for a boss like that.

476
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 The guy was a crook.

477
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 I mean, the guy was just terrorizing.

478
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 So he walks in, and he sits down unannounced, and the guy

479
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 from Sprint -- now, back in the days, we had audio

480
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 conferencing and he says to me, "Tommy, can you get this done?"

481
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 And I said to him, "I will try my best."

482
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Sonny then says to the guy at Sprint, "Let me mute you, and

483
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 I'll get right back to you."

484
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 And he mutes him, and he says, "Tommy, can you get this job

485
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 done?"

486
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 And I said to Sonny, "I will try."

487
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 And you know what he says to me?

488
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "I don't care if you try.

489
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 I didn't hire you to try.

490
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 I hired you to get this job done.

491
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 Now, if you can't get this done, I will fire you right now and

492
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
 replace you with someone who can.

493
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
 Can you get the job done?"

494
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
 I says, "I will."

495
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 And he unmutes me and says, "We'll get the job done."

496
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 He walks out of there and says, "Always remember, don't try

497
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 hard.

498
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 Get the job done."

499
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 And he walks out.

500
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 A year later, and this is the biggest lesson I learned, and it

501
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
 ties in with everything that we're talking about a year

502
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 later.

503
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 Sonny comes in, and we have an employee gathering, and he says,

504
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 "This year's Employee of the Year is Tommy Lee."

505
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 And he says, "Tommy Lee, wherever I go, in all of the

506
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 travels, and all the -- when I talk with clients like AT&T,

507
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 Sprint, and Verizon, they all say, 'If Tommy Lee's on the job,

508
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 we'll hire you and give you the business.'

509
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 All of the sales development, all of our -- and when I talk

510
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 with the janitors, they all know who this guy is.

511
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 And then I talk with him, and all of us go out to the bars on

512
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 Fridays, but this guy goes to his church and works with his

513
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,000
 youth.

514
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 That's why I hear him.

515
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,000
 And he says to this, he says, "I don't follow Jesus, but if this

516
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
 is what it means to follow Jesus, then sign me up."

517
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 And he says that.

518
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 And you know what happened after that?

519
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 I had a girl who comes over to me, and she was my admin.

520
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 And she says, "Tommy, how are you so joyful?

521
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
 I've had three miscarriages.

522
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 How do you see God in the midst of all these things?"

523
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 I had another guy, his name was Patrick.

524
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 Patrick would go out to the bars all the time.

525
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 Patrick was always getting drunk.

526
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 And he says to me, "Tommy, what keeps you going?

527
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 What's your purpose in life?

528
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 Because I haven't found it yet."

529
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:24,000
 My boss, Dan, who promoted me as project manager, calls me up one

530
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 day and says, "Tommy, I need you to stay after work.

531
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 I need to talk with you about something."

532
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 I walk in after work, and he says, "Hey, Tommy, my daughter

533
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 has been diagnosed with a heart issue.

534
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 Can you pray for me?

535
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 Can we spend some time praying?"

536
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 And during Christmas, I would give their names,

537
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 give them all Bibles.

538
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 And that was what I did for Christmas, and I would put their

539
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
 name on it and gave it to each one of them.

540
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 And during my cancer journey when I was gone,

541
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 I got these Facebook messages.

542
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
 And this is now 10 years later.

543
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And I get these Facebook messages.

544
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 One of them was from Erin, the girl who had three miscarriages,

545
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 and says to me, "Tommy, I have three beautiful daughters now.

546
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,000
 I lead the VBS in their church.

547
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 I came to know the Lord, and I read your Bible.

548
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 Your Bible's still with me."

549
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 The other guy, Patrick, Patrick says to me, "Tommy, I'm still,

550
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 like, going out all the time and drinking, but I got married.

551
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 But I did start going to church, and your Bible's the one that I

552
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
 bring to church every single day."

553
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 Dan, these are all 10 years later, his wife calls me up

554
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 and says to me, "I saw on Facebook that you were

555
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 struggling with cancer.

556
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 Your former boss, Dan, is also struggling with cancer.

557
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
 Can you call him because your Bible is still sitting right

558
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 there by his bedside?"

559
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
 You never know how God uses you.

560
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,000
 You never know what God is calling you to do,

561
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 all because you do your job well.

562
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 And you are faithful to wherever God has called you to be.

563
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 Whether it's a job that you can't stand,

564
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 whether it's a job that you hate,

565
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,000
 whether it's a job where you just don't like the industry,

566
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 where you don't like your characters, all of those things,

567
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:24,000
 are you faithful to where God has placed you at?

568
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 And are you always praying and asking,

569
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 "What is that vision that you have for me?

570
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 What are you preparing me to do?"

571
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 For Gideon, he leads him on this journey.

572
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 This guy who is at the weakest of all of the clans,

573
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
 that he is the weakest, he is the lowest of all the clans,

574
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 God is preparing him to be the leader of--

575
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 to fight against the minions.

576
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 He is going to be their victor.

577
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,000
 What is God preparing you to be?

578
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 And how is God using all the things that you're doing right

579
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 now in your job to prepare you for what you're doing right now?

580
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 Because you don't know.

581
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 He may call you now.

582
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 He may be calling you 10 years from now,

583
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
 do something unique or--

584
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 what he's calling you to do is be faithful.

585
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 If you look at Nehemiah, he didn't call him until the late

586
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 '70s, but he was faithful as compared to the king.

587
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 And when it was time to rebuild the walls,

588
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 do you know what the king did?

589
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 His boss, the king, gave him time off,

590
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 gave him all the money that he need,

591
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 gave him all the papers that he need to get all of those

592
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:38,000
 different things, and gave him all the resources and materials.

593
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 Why?

594
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:42,000
 Because he liked Nehemiah and he had nothing better to do?

595
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 No.

596
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 He was faithful as compared to the king.

597
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 Do your job well.

598
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 Be faithful day in and day out in your job.

599
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,000
 Make such a difference and impact in your job that you leave

600
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 a lasting impact on the lives of people around you,

601
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
 that when you walk away from that job,

602
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,000
 they're going to sit there and say, "Wow, look at that person.

603
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 I'm able to see Jesus through that person."

604
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 That's what it means to be a Christ follower.

605
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 That means you treat the janitors well.

606
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 That means you treat the admins well.

607
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 That means you treat your boss well.

608
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 That means that every single person you treat well,

609
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 that you do a good job, that you are productive,

610
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 that because God has put me in that situation,

611
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 I will honor my boss by doing my work with such excellence.

612
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 It glorifies God in all that we do.

613
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And during that time, you are always praying,

614
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 "Lord, what is that vision that you have given me?

615
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 What are you calling me to do?"

616
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 Because God may choose and show you different things

617
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 that he wants you to do.

618
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
 That's so important about faith and work.

619
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
 Sixty percent of our day is spent at work.

620
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 God calls us to work.

621
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:20,000
 God calls us to flourish and redeem.

622
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,000
 God has given you skills and talents to change your city,

623
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 to change your community, to change your work,

624
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 to make this world a different place.

625
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 What is God calling you to do?

626
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 What is the picture and name that he has given you?

627
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,000
 For Gideon, it was "Mighty Warrior."

628
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 But too often, our insecurities causes us to look past

629
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 what God is calling us to do.

630
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 And for Gideon, he had to get past that insecurity

631
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 of being from the weakest clan

632
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 and being the weakest in the weakest clan.

633
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 What is God calling you to do?

634
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 We are motivated by grace.

635
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 We are saved by grace.

636
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,000
 The cross causes us, motivates us to be where we are.

637
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 Our job now is to take that grace that we have in our life

638
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 and to make a difference in all that we do.

639
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 In Christ we pray. Amen.

640
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 Father, thank you for how you continue to serve and use us,

641
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:32,000
 how you've created us to become the person you want us to be.

642
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 And so, Lord, may you continue to paint that journey over to us

643
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
 and allow us to see what that name that you have given us is, Lord.

644
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 What is that name you have given us?

645
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 How have you uniquely designed us to flourish

646
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 and change this world and redeem this world for you?

647
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 I pray all of us will be in that journey to see you.

648
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 In Christ we pray. Amen.

649
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 Thank you. Thanks, Mark.
