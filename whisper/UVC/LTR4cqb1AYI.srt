1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Here we go. Let me turn this on.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 We'll have a point with that one, Mark. I will promise I am not making a mess today, Mark.

3
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Good morning. Today we finish up our series on Elijah.

4
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 And so we've been looking at chapters 17, 18, and 19.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 They span about three years of Elijah.

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 And it is interesting how, for some odd reason, God works in mysterious ways.

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I think all of us who are sitting here and when I travel and talk with different leaders around the world,

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 they all want to know what God is calling them to do.

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 But you look at the life of Elijah, and it was in that three-year period that he says,

10
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 "Okay, Elijah, this is what I want you to do. That's my calling."

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
 Whatever he did had such a ripple effect that we're still reading about him today.

12
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 We're still studying what he did in that three-year period.

13
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Very similar to Jesus, very similar to Joseph or Moses, a certain period in time.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 And after that, Elijah is whisked away, and we don't see Elijah until the Transfiguration,

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 when he's there with Jesus and Moses.

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 And so, but at the same time, he calls Elijah to be faithful and continue to call us to continue to live your life,

17
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 to be faithful each and every single day.

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 And for all of us, if there is anything we remember about Elijah, is that there are defining moments in your life.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 You don't know when those defining moments are coming.

20
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 You don't know when God calls you to do something.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:05,000
 And when he does call us, it'll come out of nowhere, but we have to be faithful during that whole period of time

22
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 in terms of waiting and anticipating for what God calls us to do.

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 But for all of us, he continues to call us each and every single day to live as Christ would be,

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 to be faithful in how you act, how you think, how you treat other people,

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 because the gospel motivates all of us to do that.

26
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 You look at Elijah, we first start in chapter 17, right?

27
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
 And he just comes out of nowhere. There's nothing about Elijah beforehand.

28
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,000
 And you guys have heard me summarize this over and over again.

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 This guy is the Tishbit of Tishbe in Gilead.

30
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 That is the first description of Elijah.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 He comes out of nowhere. He comes out of this rural area.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 He's a Tishbe, and the author doesn't really know where he's at, but he says it's somewhere in Gilead.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,000
 And this guy, this rural guy, who's not very presentable, rough around the edges.

34
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 He's not tall and strong like Saul. Somehow he gets a meeting with King Ahab of the Northern Kingdom.

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 There's a Northern Kingdom. There's a Southern Kingdom.

36
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 And Ahab is the king of the Northern Kingdom. He gets a meeting with the king.

37
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 And he tells the king that there will be neither dew nor rain until my word.

38
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 And we will see that there is a huge drought that takes place for the next three years.

39
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And he reminds him, "Why am I doing this? I represent the God before whom I stand."

40
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 That's it. That's my motivation. That becomes a theme of Elijah's life.

41
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 The God before whom I stand.

42
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 And after that, he's whisked away to Shareth.

43
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 And there he lives in solitude. He's fed by the ravens.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 He's fed drinks from the brook until it dries up.

45
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 And he stays there. And after that, God says, "You know where I need you to go?

46
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:06,000
 I need you to go a hundred miles. I need you to walk a hundred miles to Zarephath.

47
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 I see where you are. I know where you are. I see you.

48
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 I know where you're going. You want me to walk a hundred miles to Zarephath,

49
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 the hometown of Queen Jezebel, the wife of King Ahab, who is the worst of all the kings? Yes.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 And there you're going to encounter a widow. And that widow will provide you for all your needs."

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 So he shows up, and this widow is sitting there. She's not of the faith and says to him,

52
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 "Hey, I'm not sure if you are here because you need food. I have no food.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 I have a little flour. I have a little oil. I'm collecting sticks so I can make a fire.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I'm going to make a little bread so my son can eat it and die."

55
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 "Really, Lord? You sent me this?" "Yes. I know where you're going.

56
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I know what you need. But you're going to have to overcome first impressions.

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You're going to have to overcome physical impossibilities."

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 Later on, as the story goes, the widow's son dies, and she blames him.

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:15,000
 And she says, "Your God did this to us. He is punishing me for one of my sins."

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 And he lives with that fear. Elijah takes the boy up, brings him to his room.

61
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 And you know what? He doesn't know the answer.

62
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 He comes and lays the boy before the Lord and says, "Lord, whatever, can you please heal him?

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Because I don't know what's going on. I don't know what you're doing."

64
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 There's a genuine relationship that Elijah has with the Lord.

65
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 And somehow the Lord heals the boy. And the widow says,

66
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 "If you guys look at the end of chapter 17, this woman who didn't know who the Lord was,

67
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 was not part of the religion, says to him, 'Clearly you are a man of the Lord.

68
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Clearly the Lord is present in your life.'"

69
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 She doesn't say, "Look at you. You're such a powerful man. You're such a strong man."

70
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 No, no. "Clearly, clearly the Lord is present. You are a man of the Lord."

71
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,000
 18 comes in. It's the last time I saw you guys, Mount Carmel.

72
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 There, a lot of times after three years, God says, "Go confront Ahab."

73
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 Yes. Time, drought is over. And then they meet and Elijah says to him, "Let's have a showdown.

74
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 You bring all your prophets to Baal. Bring all your prophets to the Asherah.

75
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 And I will bring my God. And we're going to ask those gods to come and bring fire.

76
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 And whoever calls on the Lord and they bring fire, that is the true God.

77
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 Yes, let's do it." And everyone comes. And all the Israelites of that land comes.

78
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 And if you remember, Elijah looks upon the Israelites.

79
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 And he says to them, "Are you limping between two different opinions?"

80
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 And they said nothing.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 And it's an illustration for us, is for all of us, are we limping between two different opinions?

82
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 And also, do you even care to do something about it?

83
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 Story goes, the prophets of Baal call upon their God. Nothing happens.

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:23,000
 And they keep calling and calling and calling. Nothing happens.

85
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 Now it's Elijah's turn. And the word over in 1st Kings tells us he repaired and rebuilt the altar.

86
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 Are you limping between two different opinions?

87
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Do you care to do anything about it? And so how do you repair and rebuild your altar?

88
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 And also, are you asking God to show up?

89
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And boy, does God show up.

90
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 And the fire comes down from heaven, and it consumes all of the burnt offering.

91
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 It doesn't bring judgment on the people for their disobedience.

92
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 It consumes the burnt offering.

93
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 And this is where we are in chapter 19, as we wrap up our series of Elijah.

94
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 And so the story goes, "And in a little while, the heavens grew black with clouds, and wind, and there was a great rain.

95
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 The drought is over. After three years, the rain is finally there.

96
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel.

97
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he gathered up the garment and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel."

98
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 Why does Elijah show up to Jezreel?

99
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,000
 Now, the capital city is in Samaria. We talked about that, right?

100
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Capital city is in Jezreel. But there are little remnants of a small little palace in Jezreel.

101
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 People believe that Ahab and Jezebel probably had a summer home, a small little home over Jezreel.

102
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 And it's about 20 miles away from Mount Carmel.

103
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 And so a lot of times Elijah goes there. Why?

104
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 Look at how the Lord works. He brought fire to Mount Carmel.

105
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 He destroyed all the prophets of Baal.

106
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,000
 The people of Israel are going to turn back to God.

107
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 Ahab, Jezebel, they're all going to turn back to God.

108
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 And I'm going to be there to see it. This is the triumphant return of our Lord after this three-year drought

109
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 because of everything that happened at Mount Carmel.

110
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 And so he gathers up his garment, and he gets to the entrance of Jezreel.

111
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 But that's not what happens.

112
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 The people of Israel doesn't come back.

113
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 Ahab and Jezebel don't turn their lives back to God.

114
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 But rather Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword.

115
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 It's funny. We talked about how all the 19 kings, Ahab was the worst.

116
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 But we truly see who the true villain of the story was.

117
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Jezebel had all the power, and Ahab goes crying to her.

118
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah saying,

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 "So may the God do to me more and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this day tomorrow."

120
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah,

121
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 and left his servant there.

122
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 Point number one, there are times when things do not go according to plan.

123
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 There are times when things don't go according to plan.

124
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 Elijah had it mapped out perfectly.

125
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:10,000
 Elijah thought, "After three years, I make my triumphant return.

126
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 Lord, I've obeyed you. You've followed me. I mean, you've listened to me.

127
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 We've done all these things.

128
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
 I've gone to Jareth. I've gone to Zarephath. I've come back.

129
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Mount Carmel, I've called upon the name.

130
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 Clearly, this is the time. Clearly, this is what you're going to do."

131
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 And he goes over to Jezreel, and he is expecting everyone to turn to the Lord.

132
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 But that's not what happened.

133
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Things don't go according to the plan that we want at times.

134
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 And when that happens, are you okay with that?

135
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 When we expect God to work in a certain way,

136
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 when we expect God to do what we want him to do,

137
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 and it doesn't go according to plan, are you going to be okay with it?

138
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 How are you going to react to it?

139
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 It's like the story of Dave and Goliath, isn't it?

140
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 We've talked about this before.

141
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 The story of Dave and Goliath, because here's this young shepherd boy

142
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 who is the one person that no one ever expected would battle Goliath.

143
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 He's the underdog in the story, and he kills Goliath.

144
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
 And suddenly, we think he is going to be--

145
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 songs are sang about him, stories are written about him,

146
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 and this is his time to shine.

147
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 He's going to be the best warrior.

148
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 Saul is going to cede him the kingdom.

149
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Saul is going to retire, and David now truly becomes king.

150
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 That's not what the story happens.

151
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,000
 Saul becomes jealous of him, and eventually Saul takes away his job,

152
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 and Saul goes after him, wanting to kill him.

153
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 David runs to his wife. Saul goes after him.

154
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 David then runs to his mentor Samuel. Saul's after him.

155
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 He runs to his son Jonathan, who runs to his best friend Jonathan,

156
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 who is the son of Saul. Saul finds him there.

157
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 He goes to the city of Gath, where Goliath is--that's his birthplace, his hometown.

158
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 He stays there for a period of time, pretending to be a crazy man,

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 and he ends up in the cave of Adullam by himself,

160
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 where he writes Psalm 57 and Psalm 132.

161
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 Things don't go according to plan.

162
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 And when things don't go according to plan, how are you going to react to it?

163
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 I remember in my own life as well, too, when I first started Resource Global.

164
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
 This was about 10 years ago.

165
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 The premise of Resource Global was that young Christian marketplace leaders,

166
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 young Christian business leaders--not pastors, not seminary students,

167
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
 not ministry leaders--young Christian marketplace leaders

168
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 would be the catalyst for gospel growth all around the world.

169
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
 That was the catalyst. That was my thought.

170
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 And the Foundation says, "Tommy, I love this idea.

171
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Here's some funding." And we started in Jakarta, Indonesia.

172
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 And the plan is once we start with the Chinese Indonesians in Jakarta, Indonesia,

173
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 and then we started one in Chicago, and then we're going to do something in Malaysia.

174
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 We're going to do something in Hong Kong. We're going to do something in Nairobi.

175
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 We're going to do something in LA. That was the plan.

176
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 And I had it all laid out.

177
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And I remember I brought in my first team of people.

178
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 I hired a director of communications. I hired a program manager.

179
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 That was the plan. That's what I believed that God was calling me to do.

180
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 But that plan didn't work out.

181
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,000
 I didn't really get along with those individuals.

182
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 We were on the same page. We were constantly disagreeing.

183
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 And I thought, "Lord, you told me to do this. I really believe you told me to do this."

184
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 I hired a team. Why isn't this happening?

185
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 So we got rid of the team. And I said, "Okay, okay.

186
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 I probably misinterpreted you, right? I'm going to bring in a second team.

187
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 And I'm going to bring in a team who's completely different to me in terms of personality.

188
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 That will work." It didn't work. It didn't work.

189
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 "Lord, I'm so sure that you called me to do this."

190
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Next thing you know, as the story goes, that was about five, six years ago,

191
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 I was diagnosed with cancer, and then I had to leave for eight months.

192
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 And I thought we were going to shut it down.

193
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 But that's when the ministry started growing.

194
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Jakarta started growing when I wasn't around.

195
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Then from that point on, Malaysia started. Singapore, when I was just starting.

196
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Nairobi started when I wasn't around.

197
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 Our young leaders in Jakarta became the leaders in their city.

198
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 They became the mentor. They became the donors.

199
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 They became the board members.

200
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 All because they started rising up to the challenge.

201
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Now here we are, 13 cities later.

202
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,000
 We just started Cluj. We're working on Tokyo at this point right now.

203
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 I'm off to Cluj in a couple weeks.

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 And I look back and I said, "I would have never scripted this."

205
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 It doesn't go according to plan.

206
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 That doesn't work in the way that you think it'll work.

207
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 Elijah had to understand this.

208
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
 Elijah gets up there and he thinks that Mount Carmel, everyone's going to go according to plan.

209
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 You're going to respond. Everyone's going to turn back to the Lord.

210
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 It didn't happen that way.

211
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 And when it doesn't go according to plan, are you okay with it?

212
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Another thing also as well too is, and so Elijah then in verse 4,

213
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 "But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness.

214
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 And he came and sat down under a broom tree.

215
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 And Elijah asked that he might die, saying, 'It is enough now, O Lord.

216
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Take away my life, for I am no better than my father's.'"

217
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 Here's something, a side note as well too.

218
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 Different people respond in different ways, right?

219
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 Different people respond in different ways.

220
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And that's something we have to honor and respect.

221
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Sometimes with different people, when we come across a situation,

222
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 we just always have to understand that people respond in different ways.

223
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 One of the things that we have seen, and I think a lot of times you're going to see as we map out the story,

224
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 Elijah gets discouraged easily.

225
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 And that's okay. It's understanding that personality.

226
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 But here's another personality I want to show you.

227
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 Isaiah chapter 6. You don't need to turn into it.

228
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Isaiah chapter 6 talks about this story.

229
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 And here's where it begins with. Isaiah 6, and right in verse 10.

230
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 "And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, 'Whom shall I send, and who will go forth for us?'"

231
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 That's what the voice of the Lord says.

232
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 Isaiah says, "Here am I. Send me."

233
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 And here's what the Lord says to him. Isaiah 6, verse 10.

234
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,000
 "Keep on hearing, but do not understand. Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.

235
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
 Make the hearts of the people dull, and their hearts heavy.

236
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 And blind their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,

237
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 and understand with their hearts, and turn, and be healed."

238
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 Then Isaiah says, "How long, O Lord?"

239
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 And he says, "Until cities lie waste without inhabitants, and houses without people,

240
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 and the land is a desolate waste, and the Lord removes people far away,

241
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 and the Israelite places are many in the midst of the land.

242
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 And though a tent remain in it, it will be burned again."

243
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Do you understand what Isaiah is saying as well too?

244
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Here, Elijah gets mad because he sees everything that's happening.

245
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 He's all discouraged, right?

246
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Isaiah is literally being told in Isaiah 6, "I'm sending you,

247
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 and when you preach, you will see no results.

248
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 You will keep putting all this effort, and you will keep preaching the Word of God,

249
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 and you'll keep serving, and serving, and serving,

250
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 and you will never see a lack of results."

251
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 And Isaiah is saying, "So how long am I doing this?"

252
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 "Until nothing remains.

253
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 That's when you'll be done."

254
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 But Isaiah is strong.

255
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 Different people respond in different ways.

256
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,000
 And we see here with Elijah, a lot of times, it's nothing wrong,

257
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 but he just needs a little encouragement along the way,

258
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 which leads us to the next point.

259
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 Because when things--when we get discouraged--

260
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 I love what Tim Keller says on this one.

261
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 He says, "If you look at this passage in Isaiah--in Elijah in 1 Kings 19,

262
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 God uses the story in Elijah where he encounters both the angel--

263
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 an angel--and the Lord.

264
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Both of those guys are showing up in this particular situation,

265
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 and we see God ministering to Elijah in three ways.

266
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 He ministers to him physically.

267
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 He ministers to him mentally.

268
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 And he ministers to him spiritually--

269
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 physically, mentally, and spiritually.

270
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 Let's go through that and see what this means.

271
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 Verse 5, "And Elijah lay down, and he slept under a broom tree.

272
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,000
 And behold, an angel touched him.

273
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 And he said to him, 'Arise and eat.'

274
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake

275
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 baked on hot stones in a jar of water.

276
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 And Elijah ate and drank and lay down again.

277
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 And the angel of the Lord came again a second time

278
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 and touched him and says, 'Arise and eat,

279
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 for the journey is too great for you.'

280
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 And he arose and ate and drank

281
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights

282
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 to Horeb, the Mount of God."

283
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 So I know Horeb is a very special place.

284
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 It is the place where Moses received the Ten Commandments.

285
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 That's where Elijah goes.

286
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:56,000
 So how does God minister in the midst when we get discouraged,

287
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
 when we get frustrated for some reason or another?

288
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 And here in this situation, there are unmet expectations

289
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 that Elijah is dealing with.

290
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,000
 And after all the things that's happening, he is frustrated.

291
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 But God, in the midst of our frustration,

292
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 ministers to us in three different ways--

293
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 physically, mentally, and spiritually.

294
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 For the physical part, he comes to Elijah,

295
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 and he allows him to sleep.

296
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 That's number one.

297
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 He allows him to sleep.

298
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 Sometimes we just need to--

299
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 when we're in the midst of situations, when we are discouraged,

300
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 we just need to walk away for a little bit.

301
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
 We have to do something different.

302
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 We have to regroup ourselves.

303
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 He allows him to sleep.

304
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 He also feeds him, not once but twice,

305
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 "Arise, get up, and eat."

306
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 That cake sustains him for forty days

307
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 while he travels to Mount Horeb.

308
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 And then from that point on, he touches him.

309
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 I love what one author says to him,

310
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 is that we are physical beings

311
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 who live in the physical world.

312
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 The things of words of affirmation,

313
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,000
 touch, all of those things,

314
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 mean something to us because we are physical beings

315
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 in the physical world.

316
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 When I worked at Moody Bible Institute,

317
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 I remember I got a report about the number of books

318
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 that Moody-- in terms of their revenue sales, right?

319
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 And so did you know under Moody Publishers,

320
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 there is one book that makes up 90% of their revenue

321
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 every single year?

322
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 If you guys could guess, that book is

323
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 The Five Love Language by Gary Chapman.

324
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 After all these decades,

325
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 The Five Love Language of Gary Chapman,

326
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 which is, I think, in its eighth revision,

327
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 in eighth edition or something like that,

328
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 makes up 90% of the revenue.

329
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 And that man is about 80 years old,

330
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 and he is still out there,

331
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 and that message never gets old.

332
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 Why? Because we all want to know how we're wired.

333
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,000
 We all want to know how to love.

334
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 We all want to know how to show love and to receive love

335
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 because we are physical beings in a physical world.

336
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 God ministers to us physically.

337
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
 Secondly, another thing is,

338
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 he ministers to us mentally, emotionally.

339
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 What does he say to us?

340
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And a lot of times this goes back to Elijah.

341
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 Remember, he gets discouraged easily.

342
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 He says, "Arise and eat," in verse 7.

343
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 For what?

344
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 The journey is too great for you.

345
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 The journey is too great for you.

346
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 For some of us who are parents,

347
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 for some of us who are counselors,

348
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 for some of us who are teachers,

349
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 for some of us who are leaders,

350
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
 have to manage staff,

351
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 you'll understand what I'm trying to say.

352
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 We manage people differently.

353
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Different people are managed differently

354
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,000
 according to their persona, personality, all of that.

355
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:29,000
 A good parent, a good leader, a good counselor, a good boss,

356
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 understands how each person reacts to different situations.

357
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 You'll understand.

358
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 What do I mean by that?

359
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 There are some people,

360
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 I have my two daughters here with me this morning,

361
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 and so there are some people where you just have to encourage them.

362
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 They just need a lot of encouragement, right?

363
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 There are some people we manage,

364
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 there are some people, some of our kids,

365
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 or there are some people that we work with, youth and all that stuff,

366
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
 where you have to be very direct with them.

367
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 You've got to be very hard on them,

368
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 and a lot of times what helps them

369
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 is when you're sitting there and telling them the truth.

370
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 Some people, they just need a lot of encouragement,

371
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
 but there are some people who you've managed,

372
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
 you kind of let them fail.

373
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 You don't say anything to them,

374
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 because you know the best way for them to learn

375
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 is when they fail and they're able to work through their situation.

376
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 They know what to do,

377
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:24,000
 but they just need you to support them.

378
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 Each person is managed differently.

379
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 The angel, the Lord, God knows us so uniquely sometimes,

380
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 where not only does he heal us and minister to us physically,

381
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 we see here a concrete example

382
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 where he ministers to us mentally and emotionally.

383
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
 He knows how Elijah is wired.

384
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 He needs encouragement.

385
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 Elijah doesn't need someone to tell him

386
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 and lecture him of what he needs to do.

387
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 What he does need someone is to tell him, reaffirm him,

388
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 I know the journey is too great for you.

389
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 Rest, rest, because the journey is too great for you.

390
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 Exit angel, get to Mount Horeb.

391
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 He comes before her in the cave, and now the Lord comes to him.

392
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And the Lord says to him in verse 9,

393
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 "What are you doing here, Elijah?"

394
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 It's very similar to Genesis chapter 3,

395
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 where God says to Adam and Eve, "Where are you?"

396
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:38,000
 Did God not know where Adam and Eve was?

397
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
 Did God not know what Elijah's doing?

398
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
 No, no, no, no.

399
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,000
 He's asking questions, which forces Elijah to reflect.

400
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 All of you who have counseled people

401
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 and come alongside people, you realize

402
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 the worst thing when someone is dealing with a problem,

403
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 they are not expecting you to sit down

404
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 and tell them all your answers.

405
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 When my wife sits there and tells me about her day

406
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
 and tells me a problem with her kids in her first grade class,

407
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 she is not expecting me to solve her problem.

408
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 She is expecting me to listen.

409
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And sometimes in the midst of doing that,

410
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 you ask clarifying questions to lead them to the point.

411
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And sometimes the best counselors are the ones

412
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
 who allow people to talk 80% of the time,

413
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 and now you're talking 20% of the time.

414
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 You're asking them, you're leading on a journey.

415
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 That's what's happening here.

416
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 "What are you doing here, Elijah?"

417
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 It forces him to think.

418
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 It forces him to reflect.

419
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
 It forces him to come upon his own conclusion.

420
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 God ministers to us physically.

421
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 He ministers to us emotionally.

422
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 And he ministers to us spiritually.

423
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,000
 Here the story comes, and one of the best parts

424
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 of Scripture that I love.

425
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 If you have never, ever read this part of Scripture,

426
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:18,000
 it is a story that I love where God shows up.

427
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Verse 11, God says to him, "Go out and stand on the mount

428
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 before the Lord."

429
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 "And before and behold, the Lord passed by."

430
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:30,000
 He is now Elijah's Mount Horeb.

431
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,000
 That is the place where Moses got the Ten Commandments.

432
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 "And a great and strong wind tore the mountains

433
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 and broke the mountain in pieces,

434
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,000
 the rocks before the Lord.

435
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 But the Lord was not in the wind.

436
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 And after the wind, an earthquake.

437
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
 But the Lord was not in the earthquake.

438
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And after the earthquake, fire.

439
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 But the Lord was not in the fire.

440
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 And after the fire, the sound of a low whisper.

441
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak

442
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,000
 and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.

443
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
 And behold, there came a voice to him that says,

444
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 "What are you doing here, Elijah?"

445
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 God ministers to us spiritually.

446
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 He reminds Elijah, and he reminds us,

447
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 "You expect that I'm going to come in power.

448
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 You perceive power in the form of a wind,

449
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 an earthquake, and fire.

450
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 That's not how I'm going to show up.

451
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 You expect me to come in the form of judgment.

452
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 That's not how I'm going to show up.

453
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 You got to hear my voice."

454
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 And that voice is surrounded by grace.

455
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 And that voice is soft.

456
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 And that voice comforts.

457
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 And through that voice, you experience my presence.

458
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 It's sort of like the gospel, isn't it?

459
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
 In Matthew chapter 11, when Jesus comes and starts ministering,

460
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,000
 John the Baptist, if you guys remember the story of John the Baptist,

461
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 what was he saying to the Israelites?

462
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,000
 "Behold, someone greater than me is coming.

463
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 The ax is at the root of the tree.

464
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 Repent, repent, repent.

465
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 The ax is at the root of the tree."

466
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
 John gets imprisoned.

467
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 In verse 11, he hears about all the things that Jesus is doing.

468
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 He sends his disciples over to Jesus.

469
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 And he relays a message, and they say, "John wants us to ask you,

470
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 are you the one who is to come,

471
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 or should we expect someone else?"

472
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:04,000
 Because Jesus' message was about healing and grace and forgiveness.

473
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 John was expecting someone who was going to be sitting there with fire and brimstone

474
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 and was going to preach judgment.

475
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
 And that's why he was telling everyone to repent.

476
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
 But Jesus, you're coming to heal your--

477
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
 wait, are you the one who's supposed to come,

478
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 or should I be expecting someone else?

479
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
 Elijah, when I come in the form of you think I'm going to be in the wind,

480
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
 you think I'm going to be in the earthquake,

481
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 you think I'm going to be in the fire,

482
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 these are all forms of judgment.

483
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,000
 You've got to hear my voice,

484
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 and that voice is surrounded by grace.

485
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 And as we end here, he wraps up,

486
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 and he tells them, "Here's what I need you to do,

487
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 because I have a plan.

488
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,000
 Not only am I going to minister to you,

489
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 but here's our plan.

490
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 After all, in verse 15, "And the Lord said to him,

491
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 'Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus,

492
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,000
 and when you arrive you shall anoint Hazel to be king over Syria,

493
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over--

494
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel,

495
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
 and Elisha the son of Shabbat of Ebo-Meholah

496
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 you shall anoint to be prophet in your place.

497
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:38,000
 And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazel shall Jehu put to death,

498
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,000
 and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall put Elisha put to death.

499
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Yet I will leave 7,000 in Israel,

500
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 all the knees that have not bowed to bow,

501
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 and every mouth that has not kissed them.

502
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 Elijah, you think I had no plan?

503
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 You think you are the only one left?

504
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 I have 7,000 people waiting for me to be used to them,

505
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 and I have a plan to put all these kings in place,

506
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 and I've also found your replacement in Israel too,

507
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 so you're out of a job.

508
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 That's my plan.

509
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
 You think you're the only one left.

510
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 You think after Mount Carmel all of these things were going to happen.

511
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 That's not what's going to happen.

512
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 Because things don't go as we expect it to be.

513
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 We think that we could put God in a box,

514
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:52,000
 and all these things that will happen will go according to plan,

515
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 but it doesn't happen the way we expect it to go.

516
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,000
 That's the stories of Elijah's life, isn't it?

517
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 That's the way--it's interesting.

518
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 Three years of this man, right, comes out of nowhere.

519
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:12,000
 He kind of shows up, and he goes from place to place to place,

520
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 all of these places, and at the end of the day,

521
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:20,000
 God ultimately has a plan.

522
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 He knows what's going to happen.

523
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 Don't put God in a box.

524
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 Sometimes your plan of what you expect God to do,

525
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
 it may not go according to plan.

526
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 And when that happens, are you okay with it?

527
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 That's the story of Elijah,

528
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 the Tishbit of Tishbe in Gilead,

529
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 who comes out of nowhere,

530
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,000
 who we didn't expect him to do anything,

531
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,000
 shows us what it means to follow the Lord,

532
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:04,000
 to be obedient to the Lord.

533
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000
 In summary, you're wondering,

534
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 "What in the world is he doing with this,

535
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 and why is he putting water in this?"

536
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 That when we look at Elijah, we look at who he is,

537
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
 don't put a person in a box.

538
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:22,000
 Just because he's some real guy who comes out of nowhere,

539
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 and he's kind of not fancy, and kind of rough around the edges,

540
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 God could use that person.

541
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 Don't put a person in a box.

542
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 Sometimes when we do things, and we see God work,

543
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:36,000
 or we try to perform God, we sit there and do all these things,

544
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 and we come before the Lord expecting certain things to be done,

545
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 but things may not go according to plan.

546
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 And that's okay, because sometimes,

547
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 no matter how much water we put in,

548
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 it may not even work.

549
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 God works in mysterious ways.

550
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:14,000
 Oops, we're going to have to work on the illustration.

551
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 That's the story of Elijah.

552
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,000
 That's the story of what God calls us to do.

553
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 The tishbit of tishbi in Gilead.

554
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Let's pray.

555
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 Father, thank you for this time.

556
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 Thank you for the story of Elijah.

557
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
 Thank you for what you taught us.

558
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 Thank you for how you ministered to us.

559
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 Thank you for the example that you gave,

560
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 and how you showed how one person worked,

561
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
 and for you truly followed after you.

562
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 May our theme of constantly, no matter what,

563
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
 even when we don't understand,

564
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
 allow us to seek after you.

565
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 In Christ we pray, amen.
