1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,240
 Hey guys, happy Father's Day to all of you.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,040
 And I'm sure today's Father's Day,

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,120
 you probably want to hear something about some Father's

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,800
 Day story, right?

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,640
 Anyone?

6
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,240
 Yeah.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,320
 OK, all right.

8
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,600
 A couple of Father's Day stories.

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,760
 Again, it's not about-- as preachers,

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,720
 sometimes we use our children as our [INAUDIBLE]

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,360
 and without their permission.

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,880
 But here, I give you a couple of stories.

13
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,520
 It's not about them, OK?

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,720
 So it's not about them, it's about me.

15
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,760
 It's about me.

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,600
 As a father, you probably would realize

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,840
 that we are broken as well, right?

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
 We are broken as much as anyone else.

19
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,760
 And we need the grace of God.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,160
 So I've got a couple of stories of brokenness

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,160
 to share to you on this Father's Day.

22
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,920
 I shared a couple of stories in the 10 o'clock service,

23
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:05,480
 so maybe I should just do this right here, right?

24
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:12,320
 The first story, when my daughter was about one year old,

25
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,880
 I remember there was one afternoon I was working really,

26
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,520
 really hard.

27
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,720
 It probably was a Saturday.

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,280
 And as you know, as a pastor, the most busiest day

29
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,840
 of the week is Saturday, right?

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,440
 It's Saturday.

31
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,760
 You're getting ready for today, right?

32
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,840
 So I was preparing sermon.

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,520
 And for some reason, the little girl

34
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,160
 was making some weird noise.

35
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,920
 And for 10 minutes straight, I don't know,

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,440
 she was not crying, was not in pain or anything like that.

37
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,840
 But she was just in the crib, and she was just

38
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,840
 making some noise.

39
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,920
 I don't know why.

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,840
 So I was kind of--

41
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,960
 if you know me enough, I can be an angry man.

42
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:05,480
 I can be very, very angry in moments of weaknesses.

43
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,880
 I can unleash my anger.

44
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,920
 So that's the broken part of me, right?

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,680
 So I went into the room, and I started pushing to her.

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,080
 So I had a 10-minute impromptu sermon, right?

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,240
 I forgot what I preached, but I think the central idea was

48
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:29,000
 that you cannot be selfish, right?

49
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,680
 You need to care for other people.

50
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:31,760
 We have needs, too, right?

51
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,140
 I need to get things done, right?

52
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,760
 So I unleashed that angry sermon for 10 minutes straight.

53
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,880
 So I will remember that.

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:47,480
 And then I came back to my room and kind of calmed down.

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,280
 And then I said to God, dude, that was my broken moment.

56
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
 I shouldn't do that, right?

57
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,960
 So I confessed my sin and went back to the room.

58
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,960
 I said, I'm sorry.

59
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,520
 I was angry, right?

60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,560
 My anger was not checked, right?

61
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,600
 And of course, I don't think she remembered that.

62
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,720
 But that's OK.

63
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,480
 I think fatherhood is vocation, right?

64
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,800
 You know what vocation means?

65
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:27,200
 Vocation means calling, right?

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,520
 Calling.

67
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,000
 It's a calling that God has on us

68
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,640
 as fathers for a certain period of time in our lives,

69
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,200
 sometimes shorter, sometimes longer.

70
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,280
 But we are being called to be a father, right?

71
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,480
 But I want to tell you, if you're a father,

72
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,360
 or you have a father, we're not perfect.

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,480
 And we don't need to be perfect.

74
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,080
 We all need the grace of God, right?

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,200
 Amen?

76
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,800
 We all need the grace of God.

77
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:07,520
 And believe it or not, fathers, daddies, God loves you, right?

78
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,920
 God accepted you.

79
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,480
 Entirely.

80
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,280
 Not because you're perfect.

81
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,400
 Not because you're better.

82
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,040
 Just because who you are, right?

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,280
 We're sinners.

84
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:23,000
 First story of Father's Day.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,240
 Second story is about my son.

86
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:32,960
 This I also vividly remember.

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,760
 I think he was about five to six years old.

88
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:45,200
 And as Asian families, we want our kids to learn instruments,

89
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,200
 right?

90
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:50,080
 A lot of Chinese and Asian families,

91
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,840
 they don't really appreciate music.

92
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,680
 But they just want their children to learn music, right?

93
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,840
 That's very ironic.

94
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,080
 But I'm not one of those.

95
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,800
 But I have my daughter and son go through piano lessons.

96
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,480
 I remember one afternoon before the piano teacher arrived,

97
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:14,920
 and he was practicing some very simple song, right?

98
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,880
 Very simple song.

99
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,000
 But for some reason, he didn't get it.

100
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,040
 He didn't get it.

101
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:22,000
 He just have that note wrong, right?

102
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,160
 Well, if you know me, I'm quite a self-disciplined person,

103
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:27,920
 right?

104
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,280
 I know if I put myself into doing something,

105
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,680
 I will get it done, right?

106
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,640
 A lot of fathers are like that, right?

107
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,640
 And that's a good thing.

108
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,880
 That's also a bad thing, right?

109
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,160
 Because if you know me as a friend,

110
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,160
 you probably would not think I'm too imposing, right?

111
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,800
 But in my family, everyone else knows that I'm kind of--

112
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,240
 I want to impose.

113
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,920
 I demand, right?

114
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:04,680
 And to live with me is quite an experience.

115
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,200
 It's quite--

116
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,040
 For real?

117
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,120
 For real, yeah.

118
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,200
 People suffer because I have high demand on other people,

119
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,400
 especially family members.

120
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,560
 So he was practicing piano, and he was doing this chord,

121
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,920
 and something like this, right?

122
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,960
 [PIANO PLAYING]

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,520
 Yeah, and he kept doing it wrong.

124
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,440
 And to me, this is unacceptable, right?

125
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,400
 And at that moment, it was a broken moment.

126
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
 It was a moment of weakness.

127
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,520
 I unleashed my anger again.

128
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,480
 So I'm yelling at him, right?

129
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,440
 Yelling at him.

130
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,680
 I said, there's no way you cannot do this.

131
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:53,280
 If you repeat that phrase, that measure, for 50 times,

132
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,440
 then you will do it, right?

133
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,960
 And then I forced him to repeat that once and twice and third.

134
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,800
 After quite a few times, I realized

135
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:09,760
 that there was something wrong with me, right?

136
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,760
 And it just dawned on me.

137
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:18,880
 What I want him to do, does it really

138
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:24,240
 matter compared to what God wants him to do?

139
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,920
 Do you know what I'm saying?

140
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,680
 It's not that important what I want.

141
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,080
 It's what God wants, right?

142
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,960
 So after that heated moment, it was really heated.

143
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,360
 Again, he doesn't remember that.

144
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,520
 God is good.

145
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,440
 [LAUGHTER]

146
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:52,480
 After that piano lesson, I walked again.

147
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,840
 I prayed, and I confessed my sin.

148
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:03,440
 And I said, God, give me courage to apologize.

149
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,640
 You know how that goes?

150
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:12,960
 A 37-year-old man, you need to apologize to a five-year-old?

151
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,080
 Like a real apology?

152
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,320
 It's not like, I'm sorry.

153
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,880
 No, it's a real apology, right?

154
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:24,600
 So I walked up to him and I said, I'm sorry.

155
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,120
 I was angry.

156
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:31,000
 Can you forgive me?

157
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,840
 It was a humbling experience.

158
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,880
 Humbling experience in the sense that we are all broken.

159
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,800
 I'm broken.

160
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,520
 I need the grace of God, right?

161
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,360
 We all need the grace of God.

162
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,200
 Now I'll share these stories to you on Father's Day,

163
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:49,880
 because of course, some of us are fathers.

164
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,040
 And some of you have fathers, right?

165
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,560
 They're still alive, right?

166
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,000
 Living with your father, living with your daddy.

167
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,800
 We are broken.

168
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,920
 We need to share the grace of God.

169
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,960
 So that's the first I want to share with you before we

170
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,800
 go to the Apostles' Creek.

171
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:14,760
 And no matter where you are in your life stage,

172
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:17,400
 our fathers are broken.

173
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,800
 We, as fathers, we are broken.

174
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,680
 And we need the love of God.

175
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,680
 And the love of God is there.

176
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,360
 1 John 3, verse 1.

177
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:31,320
 "See what great love the Father has lavished on us,

178
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,800
 that we should be called children of God."

179
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,880
 And that is what we are.

180
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:45,480
 The great love of our heavenly Father has lavished on us.

181
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,480
 So that is a happy Father's Day to you.

182
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,960
 But I want you to know that God loves you.

183
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,840
 God's grace is always sufficient, right?

184
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:00,640
 Great love, lavishing on us.

185
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,160
 Well, let's come to the loving presence of God.

186
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,560
 Let's pray.

187
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,360
 Father, we give you thanks because you love us so much.

188
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,800
 You love us so much that your Son, your only Son,

189
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,200
 died on the cross for our sins, for our brokenness.

190
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,680
 And we thank you.

191
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,640
 Thank you for your loving presence.

192
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,800
 Thank you for this relationship that we have,

193
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:25,160
 that we are called your children, children of God.

194
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:32,040
 In our brokenness, in our humbleness, in our sinfulness,

195
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,880
 we meet your grace.

196
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,040
 We experience your love.

197
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:39,960
 And thank you for the cross.

198
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:44,160
 Thank you for what you have done for all of us.

199
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,160
 I especially want to pray for the daddies and fathers

200
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,640
 in our congregation.

201
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:55,200
 I pray that your grace will be lavishing on them,

202
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,720
 that it is not easy to be a father, especially

203
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,400
 in this generation.

204
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,480
 I pray that your grace will be sufficient for them

205
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,600
 to meet those challenges.

206
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,000
 And even though they are not perfect,

207
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:13,240
 even though we are broken, we know that you love us fully.

208
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,480
 You accept us at the foot of the cross.

209
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,400
 And we thank you for this grace.

210
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,720
 In Christ's name we pray.

211
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,840
 Amen.

212
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,080
 All right, so the end of Father's Day sermon.

213
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,640
 OK, all right.

214
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,720
 So we go back to the Apostles' Creek.

215
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,880
 All right, I'll cut it short.

216
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,600
 And I'll make sure we get out after 1225.

217
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:45,720
 OK, we come to this section, the virgin birth of Jesus Christ.

218
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,080
 The Apostles' Creek, again, is 12 statements.

219
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,000
 It's like a road map of what Christianity is all about.

220
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,560
 And here it says, "I believe in Jesus Christ as only Son,

221
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,120
 our Lord.

222
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,080
 He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit

223
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,240
 and born of Virgin Mary."

224
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,480
 Jesus' birth is a miracle birth.

225
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,800
 Now, as modern people, we hear miracle birth, all right,

226
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,160
 virgin birth.

227
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,480
 We automatically think in scientific terms, right?

228
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,320
 Have you ever asked the question,

229
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,640
 what's the DNA of Jesus?

230
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,920
 Right?

231
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,840
 Now, definitely not from Joseph, right?

232
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,360
 But where's it from, right?

233
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,720
 What does it look like?

234
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,600
 Now, we come to the virgin birth or miracle birth

235
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,880
 with the scientific thinking.

236
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:41,480
 But I think for the biblical readers of this first audience,

237
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,040
 they would not think in terms of scientific DNA

238
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,520
 and all that stuff.

239
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,880
 They would be thinking along the line of the Old Testament.

240
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,440
 The Old Testament, if you remember,

241
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:56,440
 there were tons of miracle birth stories, right?

242
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,560
 Can you name some of them?

243
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,080
 Isaac, right?

244
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,760
 Jacob and Esau.

245
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,560
 And there are many other miracle births.

246
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:09,400
 If you track the miracle birth stories

247
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:12,160
 of the entire Old Testament, every time there's

248
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,880
 a child miraculously birth, it is

249
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:20,760
 because God is advancing another chapter in his redemption

250
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,680
 plan for mankind.

251
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,080
 Isaac was born, opened another new chapter in Abraham's story,

252
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,600
 in the story of Genesis.

253
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,920
 And then Esau and Jacob was born as the twin brothers,

254
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,480
 miracle birth again.

255
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,000
 And another chapter was open.

256
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,480
 So they would be thinking about God is doing something new.

257
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:47,680
 So when the Bible talks about the virgin birth of Mary,

258
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,120
 when Jesus was birthed, the Bible

259
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,240
 is talking about finally God is fulfilling his promises.

260
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,560
 Whatever he has said in the entire Old Testament,

261
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,400
 the covenant with Abraham, the covenant with David,

262
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,520
 and all this stuff, God is faithful.

263
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,840
 And only God can do that.

264
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:12,280
 That is why the birth of a child is a miraculous birth.

265
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:18,600
 Virgin birth, of course, is the miracle birth, right?

266
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,320
 So again, we don't come to the Bible always

267
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,080
 with our modern mindset, right?

268
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,600
 I think I have talked about it in the past few parts

269
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,800
 of the sermon series.

270
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,840
 I think it's sad.

271
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:36,680
 It is really sad that even today, in 21st century,

272
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:44,840
 we always think that faith and science are in disharmony.

273
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,880
 They don't go together.

274
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:49,760
 And they must be being polarized.

275
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:53,320
 Again, when we come to the miracle birth of Jesus,

276
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,440
 virgin birth of Mary, we don't need

277
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
 to think in scientific terms.

278
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,920
 There is no contradiction between miracle

279
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:05,880
 and how the natural world works.

280
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,360
 They can be in harmony.

281
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,480
 I was born-- I grew up in a very conservative church.

282
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,040
 And I remember back then in the Bible studies

283
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,520
 and in Sunday schools, we always have

284
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,800
 to feel the tension, the huge tension,

285
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:29,000
 between faith and reason, faith and intellect.

286
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,160
 We opened the Bible, the first few pages, Genesis.

287
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,000
 There's always this harmony, kind

288
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,720
 of a tension between what Genesis 1

289
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,640
 has to say about the beginning of the universe

290
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,520
 and then what natural science has to say.

291
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:47,120
 Now, I want to tell you, I want to emphasize this.

292
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,040
 I think this is really, really sad that we have

293
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,360
 to pitch one against the other.

294
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,600
 There's no such thing, because the Bible is not

295
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,160
 a scientific textbook.

296
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:01,440
 It doesn't tell us what the early history

297
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,320
 of the physical universe.

298
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:06,240
 The ancient people, the biblical world,

299
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,240
 does not concern with scientific questions

300
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,340
 that we concern about.

301
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:16,200
 So there has to be some way we can bring the two together

302
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,160
 in harmony.

303
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
 Again, as I said before, Genesis 1

304
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:24,320
 is answering the who question, not the how question.

305
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,720
 The how question is answered by scientific enterprise.

306
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,160
 The who question, the theological enterprise,

307
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,840
 is what scripture is trying to do,

308
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:38,760
 trying to tell us who behind the universe

309
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:40,960
 and who we should worship.

310
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:45,340
 In 2020, I mentioned this before,

311
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:51,440
 Dr. Francis Collins accepted Templeton Prize.

312
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,640
 It was during COVID.

313
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:57,640
 It was a huge concern, so it was a private kind of event.

314
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,040
 It was live streamed on YouTube.

315
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:06,080
 And Collins said, as a medical doctor, in his whole life,

316
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,080
 he has been atheistic.

317
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:10,320
 He doesn't believe in God.

318
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,720
 And then one day, he was challenged by his patient.

319
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:21,320
 And then it just dawned on him that science did not help much

320
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:25,440
 with the profound question of meaning.

321
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,200
 What do you live for?

322
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,560
 The meaning of life, the value, right?

323
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,760
 Science cannot offer much help.

324
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,760
 And Collins said, at that time, he

325
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,560
 realized his atheism is dangerously thin.

326
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:47,920
 He was quoting Chesterton, one of the great theologians

327
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,280
 in the 19th century.

328
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:55,560
 He said, atheism is the most daring of all dogmas

329
00:17:55,560 --> 00:18:00,720
 because it is the assertion of universal negative.

330
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,760
 There's no God.

331
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:09,880
 So he became a believer in two years,

332
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:12,840
 something written by C.S. Lewis and talking to other people.

333
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,560
 And then finally came to faith in Jesus Christ.

334
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,320
 Take notice of the acceptance speech.

335
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,840
 The title is "In Praise of Harmony."

336
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:31,160
 Harmony between science-- he's a top-notch scientist--

337
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,760
 and faith, an evangelical Bible-believing question,

338
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,600
 these two can go together.

339
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:49,600
 So these two, faith and reason, can go hand in hand.

340
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,320
 And I hope this is your experience as well.

341
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:58,880
 There's no need to just deny human reasoning when we come

342
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,840
 to faith in Jesus Christ.

343
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:07,760
 So virgin birth is beyond our finite human reasoning.

344
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,120
 It is beyond.

345
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,800
 But that does not mean it's unreasonable.

346
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,960
 That does not mean it's irrational.

347
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:22,320
 When something goes beyond our finite reasoning,

348
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,040
 we do not need to conclude that this is irrational.

349
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,440
 It can be-- probably the best term

350
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:35,120
 is trans-rational, beyond our rationality.

351
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,360
 Our brain is finite.

352
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,200
 Our mind is finite.

353
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,200
 But God can go beyond all of this,

354
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:46,880
 surpassing our finite rationality.

355
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:50,120
 In fact, when the angel announces the virgin birth

356
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:55,400
 to Mary, how did Mary respond?

357
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,920
 Luke 1, 29.

358
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:02,320
 "Mary was greatly troubled by what the angel said to her

359
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,520
 and wondered what kind of greeting this might be.

360
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,400
 But the angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary.

361
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,680
 You have found favor with God.

362
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:15,960
 You will be with child and give birth to a son.

363
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,280
 And you are to call his name Jesus.

364
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,840
 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High.

365
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,800
 The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.

366
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,520
 And he will reign over the house of Jacob forever.

367
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,560
 His kingdom will never end.'

368
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,800
 And Mary responded by saying, 'How will this be?

369
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:41,080
 How will this be since I am a virgin?'"

370
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,280
 The angel continues.

371
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:48,920
 "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, will have power on you.

372
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:53,080
 So the Holy One to be born will be called the Son of God.

373
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,120
 Even Elizabeth, your relative, is

374
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,160
 going to have a child, another miracle child,

375
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:01,280
 in her old age, which is John the Baptist.

376
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:07,920
 She who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.

377
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,040
 For nothing is impossible with God.

378
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,000
 I am the Lord's servant, Mary answered.

379
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,040
 Finally, she obeyed.

380
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:24,040
 And she said, 'May it be to me as you have said.'"

381
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:28,600
 Mary's faith, Mary's obedience, the first step

382
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,920
 to take in what the angel has said to her,

383
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,360
 what God is going to do through her life.

384
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:44,200
 Now, here's the first takeaway, the doctrine of virgin birth.

385
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:50,360
 First, Jesus came to this world in a humble manner.

386
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:53,200
 That's why we come to God.

387
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,440
 We come to Jesus.

388
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,200
 We need to be humble as well.

389
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,760
 Now, I don't have a picture here in Israel,

390
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,600
 in the town of Bethlehem.

391
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:10,680
 Today, there is a church called Church of Holy Nativity.

392
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:17,520
 Holy Nativity, meaning remembering the birth of Jesus.

393
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,440
 You walk in that church, it used to be a really, really big door

394
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,840
 to welcome people.

395
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,640
 But century after century, there's renovation,

396
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,680
 there's changes to the door or the structure of the church.

397
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:33,240
 Now, it became a really, really small door.

398
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:36,400
 And you have to duck to go in.

399
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:44,440
 And the door is called the door of humility.

400
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:48,840
 You come to see the birth of Jesus, the place he was birthed,

401
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,880
 according to traditions.

402
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,000
 And your first action you need to do is to be humble.

403
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,280
 And that's the first takeaway.

404
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,360
 And God is infinite, and he's beyond our finite mind.

405
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:07,200
 Yes, we cannot understand how it works,

406
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,960
 but God demands our humble trust.

407
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,360
 So there's nothing irrational about Jesus' birth.

408
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,440
 Yeah, it's trans-rational.

409
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:24,200
 But I think the second takeaway is from another passage

410
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,840
 talking about the virgin birth of Jesus

411
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,520
 in the Gospel of Luke, chapter 2.

412
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,080
 Now, you know what happened here is that Joseph and Mary,

413
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:36,720
 they're traveling from their workplace in Nazareth

414
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:40,120
 in the north and all the way to Bethlehem

415
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,280
 while Mary was still pregnant.

416
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,520
 What happened was the Roman Empire

417
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,280
 imposed some sort of taxation census.

418
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,120
 So everybody has to go to their hometown to register.

419
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,880
 It's kind of an imperial policy.

420
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,840
 So those who are being oppressed by Joseph and Mary,

421
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,680
 the normal, typical Judeans, they

422
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:05,560
 have to go back to the hometown.

423
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,240
 This is how the story goes, chapter 2, verse 4.

424
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,880
 So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth in Galilee

425
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:17,360
 to Judea, to Bethlehem, his hometown, town of David,

426
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,320
 because he belonged to the line or house of David.

427
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:22,960
 He went there to register with Mary, who

428
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:27,920
 was pledged to be married to him and was expecting a child.

429
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:31,320
 While they were there, the time came for the baby to be born.

430
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,440
 And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.

431
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:42,600
 She wrapped him in cloths and placed him in the manger

432
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,360
 because there was no room for them in the inn.

433
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,520
 Or I guess the better translation is the guesthouse.

434
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,520
 No matter how you understand it, maybe there's

435
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,160
 a Motel 6 in Bethlehem, and it was full.

436
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,240
 There was no vacancy for them.

437
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,000
 Or they couldn't book the Airbnb at Bethlehem

438
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,360
 or whatever that is.

439
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:12,680
 I think it can be translated properly as a guesthouse

440
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,200
 because in the typical Palestinian house, even today,

441
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:20,640
 sometimes-- so often, they have two floors.

442
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:24,920
 And the upper floor, as you can see in this reconstruction,

443
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:29,400
 is the guest room, the bedrooms.

444
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,200
 It's up there.

445
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,200
 Down there, the lower level, is where the manger is,

446
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,520
 where the production happens.

447
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,400
 They would cook, or they would have the animals in there,

448
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,600
 especially in wintertime.

449
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,240
 They would keep them warm.

450
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:52,280
 That's how a typical Palestinian house looks like.

451
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:57,320
 And the guest room, the Gospel of Luke says, has no room.

452
00:25:57,320 --> 00:26:01,080
 Now, you can imagine in that sort of census

453
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,080
 across the Roman Empire, everybody

454
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,960
 is going to their hometown.

455
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,760
 And it's so crowded.

456
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,120
 There were other relatives, there

457
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:11,560
 were other friends who were staying at the so-called Airbnb

458
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,760
 on the second floor.

459
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,960
 And Mary showed up with Joseph.

460
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,120
 And he was about to give birth, right?

461
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:24,640
 So she went down to the first floor.

462
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,920
 However you want to interpret it, in or guest room,

463
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:32,760
 it really doesn't matter because the message is the same.

464
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:40,880
 He was born in the manger, down there, where the animals are.

465
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,080
 Not in the palace.

466
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,960
 That's another takeaway.

467
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,200
 The Son of God came to our world, our broken world,

468
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,440
 in the manger.

469
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:56,400
 We draw close to God every Sunday.

470
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:02,240
 We better check our attitude when we come to worship.

471
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:08,840
 Sometimes we come to worship as if we come to a concert.

472
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:15,960
 Sometimes we come to worship as if we are watching a show.

473
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,400
 There's always customer reveal at the end,

474
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,600
 because I'm the center.

475
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,680
 I come to be entertained.

476
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,040
 I come to be--

477
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,120
 somebody has to satisfy me, right?

478
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,160
 Well, we go to a restaurant after worship service,

479
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,920
 go to a restaurant if the service is bad, right?

480
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,040
 What do you do?

481
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:39,240
 You walk away, right?

482
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,200
 What do you do?

483
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,400
 You give them one star, right?

484
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:47,560
 But not so in the church.

485
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,520
 Not so in worship.

486
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:55,000
 Worship is all about exalting God.

487
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,840
 And we come and we bow.

488
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:04,400
 We need to learn the lesson of humility,

489
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,200
 because the Son of God came as a lowly, lowly man,

490
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,440
 born in the manger.

491
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:18,600
 Next, we should consider what the Catholic tradition has

492
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,160
 to say about Mary.

493
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,800
 That's another takeaway.

494
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:25,120
 Now, the Apostles' Creek, as you can tell,

495
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:30,360
 is different from creeks or statements

496
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,200
 issued by the Catholic tradition.

497
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,960
 In the Catholic tradition, in the general official teaching

498
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:46,320
 of the Catholic church, Mary is the co-redeemer.

499
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,840
 Mary is the co-redeemer who brings the Messiah

500
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,560
 into the world, right?

501
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:59,240
 And Mary, accordingly, was sinless.

502
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,760
 The perpetual virginity of Mary--

503
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,800
 you've probably heard of that--

504
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,160
 she remains pure in the rest of her life.

505
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,520
 And some traditions in the Catholic teaching,

506
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,520
 Mary never died.

507
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:19,560
 She fell asleep, and she was taken up to heaven.

508
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:23,240
 Now, all of this are unfortunate,

509
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:29,160
 because as you can see, there's no biblical warrant

510
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,920
 for all this teaching or all this concept.

511
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:38,920
 There's nothing intrinsically special about Mary.

512
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:43,520
 Now, in Jesus' day, Mary was probably a high school girl--

513
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,240
 16, 17, or even 15, 14-year-old, right?

514
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:53,000
 This is a young girl, young Hebrew faithful girl.

515
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,040
 The angel told her, Messiah will come through you.

516
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:02,880
 And she responded with obedience, with faith.

517
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,400
 So there's nothing intrinsically special about Mary.

518
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,240
 It's not about Mary's status.

519
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:19,840
 What is praiseworthy about Mary is not about herself.

520
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:25,520
 What is praiseworthy is about her faith.

521
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,840
 It's her obedience.

522
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,520
 That is special.

523
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:35,560
 Luke 1, 45-- Elizabeth was meeting with Mary.

524
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:36,800
 Both of them are pregnant.

525
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,400
 And Elizabeth, you remember, was pregnant with John the Baptist,

526
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,440
 the cousin of Jesus.

527
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,760
 And then Mary was pregnant about to give birth to Jesus.

528
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,000
 Both mothers met together.

529
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,200
 And Elizabeth, the mother of John the Baptist,

530
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,560
 speaks about Mary in this manner--

531
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,360
 45-- "Blessed is she who believes."

532
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:07,760
 Blessed is she who believes.

533
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,800
 It's her faith that matters.

534
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,320
 It's her faith that is our example.

535
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:20,920
 Now, I don't know your relationship with God recently.

536
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:25,400
 Maybe God is calling you to do something,

537
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:30,200
 to witness to someone, to serve in a certain capacity.

538
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,200
 No matter what God is calling you, maybe you're struggling.

539
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,120
 Maybe you're waiting.

540
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:40,680
 I'll tell you this.

541
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:50,160
 God is advancing His plan through you.

542
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:50,660
 God will.

543
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:57,880
 But you're called to obey.

544
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,680
 You're called to respond.

545
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,160
 It's your faith that matters.

546
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,120
 Sometimes we struggle with the calling of God.

547
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,080
 Well, this is mundane, right?

548
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:12,320
 Mundane stuff I'm doing, maybe in my workplace,

549
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,040
 maybe in my family.

550
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:18,480
 Just go through the routine day after day and day after day.

551
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:22,120
 Nothing is really happening, right?

552
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:25,080
 But think about it.

553
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:31,040
 She who believed, she said yes to God.

554
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,320
 Yes, your will be done.

555
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:39,920
 And God-- only then God can use us in our neighborhood,

556
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:43,400
 in our church, in our workplace.

557
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,360
 We just say yes to God.

558
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,760
 All the details, God will figure out.

559
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,720
 But you need to trust in Him, right?

560
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,760
 Whether you're moving away, whether you're

561
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:02,960
 serving or stick to some sort of commitment, trust in God.

562
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,200
 And God will work out the details.

563
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,120
 All right, let's pray together.

564
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:11,520
 Father God, we give you thanks for you

565
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,560
 are working in this world.

566
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,760
 Sometimes we cannot see it.

567
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:20,280
 And most of the time, you seem invisible.

568
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:25,760
 But in scripture, story after story, page after page,

569
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,400
 you tell us you are faithful.

570
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:32,920
 And you are actively doing something.

571
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,760
 And you want to do it through us.

572
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,800
 And we pray that no matter what we are struggling with,

573
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,080
 give us faith.

574
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,240
 Give us the-- just to fully trust in you,

575
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,160
 that you will be working out your purposes in our lives.

576
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:57,040
 You will be fulfilling your plan in our lives.

577
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:59,520
 We pray that we will learn to be faithful.

578
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,120
 We will learn to trust in you.

579
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:05,720
 Thank you for being our faithful, faithful father.

580
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,720
 Thank you for being our loving God.

581
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,120
 In Christ, we pray.

582
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,600
 Amen.

583
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:11,440
 Well, God bless you.

584
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,680
 And remember, happy--
