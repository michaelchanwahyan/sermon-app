[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   I'll give real briefly a little bit of background
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.560]   of this passage here.
[00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.680]   This is the letter that Paul wrote to the Ephesian church
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.480]   and to the churches in the region of Ephesus.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.840]   And if we think about that church
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.640]   and what was going on in that region,
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.520]   he was writing to a group of believers
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.840]   that were in an urban context.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.600]   They were a group of believers that were in a pagan context.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.200]   Ephesus was, throughout the known world at that time,
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.640]   was known for the temples that were there.
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.800]   And so it was a place where people were
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.560]   practicing a lot of unhealthy and sinful things
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.720]   that were not in line with God's word and God's truth.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.560]   This is the type of church that Paul is writing to here.
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.720]   So obviously, he's writing to us.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.880]   Those are things that we can identify with,
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.600]   being in a context like that.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.560]   And he begins, very interestingly enough,
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.720]   in this letter, with worship.
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.600]   So we're gonna look at this passage in verses three to 14.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.040]   Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus,
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.480]   who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.200]   in the heavenly places, even as he chose us in him
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.120]   before the foundation of the world,
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.760]   that we should be holy and blameless before him.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.720]   In love, he predestined us for adoption to himself
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.680]   as sons through Jesus Christ,
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.080]   according to the purpose of his will,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.000]   to the praise of his glorious grace,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.880]   with which he has blessed us in the beloved.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.960]   In him, we have redemption through his blood,
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.600]   the forgiveness of our trespasses,
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.800]   according to the riches of his grace,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.360]   which he lavished upon us in all wisdom and insight,
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.040]   making known to us the mystery of his will,
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.360]   according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.840]   As a plan for the fullness of time,
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.480]   to unite all things in him,
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.880]   things in heaven and things on earth.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.600]   In him, we have obtained an inheritance,
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.080]   having been predestined according to the purpose of him,
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:08.700]   who works all things according to the counsel of his will,
[00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.880]   so that we who were the first to hope in Christ
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.720]   might be to the praise of his glory.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.080]   In him, you also, when you heard the word of truth,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.920]   the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him,
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.520]   were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.080]   who is the guarantee of our inheritance,
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.920]   until we acquire possession of it
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.360]   to the praise of his glory.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.160]   So this letter begins with this expression of praise.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.560]   It follows the form of a Hebrew barakah, or blessing,
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.320]   and it's different than the way that Paul
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.520]   normally begins his letters.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.400]   He normally begins with kind of a greeting,
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.720]   a thanksgiving, and a prayer.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   And one of the things I like about this opening
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.160]   is it's kind of an outburst of praise.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.080]   It seems like Paul began to give thanksgiving
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.840]   and praise to God, and then he just couldn't stop,
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.080]   so he just kept going.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   It's made of one really long sentence of 202 words.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.960]   It's just an outburst of praise.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.400]   And it begins with the word blessed,
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.400]   to denote the exaltation of God,
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.560]   and then proceeds to focus on all that God
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.280]   has done through Christ, and the blessings
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.880]   that we as believers have received in Christ,
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.560]   and God's plan for the future in Christ.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.520]   And some theologians believe that this may have functioned
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.840]   as an early Trinitarian hymn, that the early church
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.240]   would have used it in that way.
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:42.520]   But this expression of praise also sets the tone
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.640]   for the entire rest of the letter.
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.200]   And in this letter, Paul is speaking to the church
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.000]   about the church, about what it's like
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.840]   to have a healthy church, and all these things
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.520]   that are so important to us, and he sets the tone
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.160]   for the entire letter with this opening
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.800]   of verbal praise and worship.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.800]   And I think there's a lot for us to learn here.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.600]   There's kind of a template for us to think about worship,
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.800]   and about verbal praise and worship,
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.200]   and about how important it is,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.320]   and how essential it is in our lives.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.920]   It's an essential part of our gathering
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.760]   when we get together like this,
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.760]   but it should also be a part of just the rhythm
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:22.640]   of our daily lives.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.900]   We should be praising and worshiping God verbally.
[00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.480]   It's an essential part of our lives as believers.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.120]   And I'm using the term verbal praise and worship
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.840]   intentionally to kind of make a distinction there,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.400]   because we know Romans 12 one talks about the fact
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.380]   that our whole life is supposed to be worshiped to God,
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.000]   and that is certainly true,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.240]   and that's how we should be living.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.880]   We should be worshiping God in our work,
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.320]   in our relationships, in every part of our life.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.240]   But this morning we're specifically talking
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.840]   about verbal praise and worship,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.600]   when we speak or sing praise to God.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.040]   And it's clear in this passage that that's supposed
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.760]   to be a part of who we are as believers.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:05.840]   It's supposed to define us in a lot of ways.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.060]   I'll also be using the term genuine worship
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.060]   just to remind us that our verbal praise and worship
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.800]   can be hollow and insincere.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.060]   Just because we're verbally praising God
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:20.060]   doesn't mean it's genuine,
[00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.380]   doesn't mean it's coming from our heart.
[00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.380]   And we know that that's actually one of the things
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.700]   that Jesus often chastised the Pharisees about,
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.940]   because they were observing God's law
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:33.820]   and doing things externally that God had asked them to do,
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.940]   but it wasn't genuine, it wasn't coming from their heart.
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.820]   And so in the church we desire to genuinely worship God
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.940]   from a place of spirit and truth
[00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.540]   that the scripture talks about.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.180]   And Paul gives us a really beautiful template here
[00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.520]   for how to think about what that looks like in our lives,
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.740]   what it looks like in our gatherings.
[00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.760]   The first thing we see here is that we worship
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.800]   and praise God.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.280]   Now that seems like a very obvious point, right?
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.740]   But it's actually important for us to think about.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.240]   Who are we worshiping?
[00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.380]   And Paul makes it clear in this passage
[00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:17.500]   that we are worshiping the almighty creator God of the Bible.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.860]   He starts talking about that right away.
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:26.820]   This expression of praise is Trinitarian.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.460]   So look at verses three, he talks about God
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.700]   and the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:35.360]   In verse five, he's talking about
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:37.780]   what God has done through Jesus.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.380]   In verse 13, he's talking about the Holy Spirit
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.540]   that has sealed us.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.860]   So he's making it very clear who he's talking about
[00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:48.820]   and what God he's talking about.
[00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.420]   The Trinitarian God of the Bible.
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:56.100]   This worship is gospel-focused.
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:01.100]   Verses five to 12 are all about what God has done
[00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:03.280]   through the gospel, through the good news of Jesus,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.300]   that Jesus came and by his grace,
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.860]   he saved us, we've been redeemed,
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.860]   that he has given us forgiveness in verse seven.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.180]   And in verse eight, he has lavished on us
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.520]   that forgiveness in all wisdom and insight.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.840]   He's uniting all things in Christ.
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:28.540]   It's really focused on the gospel.
[00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:33.340]   That's a great template for us to think about
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.180]   in our worship.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:38.500]   And one of the things we see here in this expression
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.140]   of praise that Paul gives us is that genuine worship
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:44.560]   is not ambiguous about who God is.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.540]   And that's actually important in our culture.
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.960]   We say, okay, we praise and worship God, that's obvious.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.220]   We don't even have to talk about that.
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:53.020]   But in our culture, sometimes we do
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.020]   because people worship a lot of things
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:01.540]   that are not the God that Paul is talking about here.
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:05.420]   And not just the obvious things like materialism
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.260]   or money or power or success.
[00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:10.140]   Yes, people worship those things and orient their lives
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:12.520]   towards those things and follow after those things.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:16.140]   But even at times in the church,
[00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:21.140]   we can begin to make God in our own image,
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:25.140]   to try to come to God in worship on our terms.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.460]   And we can't do that.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:31.040]   God is a God of grace and mercy and love.
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.780]   But he is God.
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:34.300]   So when we approach him in worship,
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.820]   we approach him on his terms.
[00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:41.020]   And we worship God for who he is,
[00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:42.740]   not for who we want him to be.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:46.120]   And we worship God for who he has revealed himself to be.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:48.420]   And we find that in his word.
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:52.880]   So if we are worshiping a God or a belief in our mind
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.240]   that is not God as he has revealed himself to be,
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:58.060]   that is just God as we want him to be
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.140]   or God as we feel like is comfortable
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.080]   or palatable for us culturally,
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:06.360]   or we say, well, this makes sense to the people around me,
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.860]   so this is how I think God is,
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.900]   then we're not really worshiping God
[00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.020]   in the way that he calls us to worship him.
[00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:17.260]   No God's made in our own image.
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:19.300]   That's one of the 10 commandments, right?
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.740]   And that's one of the first cornerstones of genuine worship.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.620]   If we're gonna worship and praise God,
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:29.580]   we need to make sure that we are worshiping him
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:32.420]   for who he is as he's revealed himself to be.
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:38.000]   The next thing we see here is that we worship and praise God
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.360]   because he is worthy.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:43.360]   And there's two aspects of God's worthiness
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.840]   that are really clear in this passage.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.480]   The first is God's majestic greatness.
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:50.680]   Paul points us towards that.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.320]   He talks about God's eternal nature in verse four,
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.120]   how God chose us before the foundation of the world.
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:10:00.500]   He talks about God's love for us in verse four,
[00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:03.360]   that what he did was in love.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:07.280]   He talks about God's omnipotent will in verse five,
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.260]   that God is all-powerful,
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:12.520]   that his purposes in the world cannot be thwarted
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.160]   and will not be thwarted.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.760]   He talks about God's wisdom in verse eight.
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.040]   He talks about God's redemptive plan
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.520]   to heal all brokenness in verse 10.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:26.280]   That's a beautiful expression of God's greatness.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.120]   He talks about God's goodness in verse three,
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.020]   in verse six, in verse eight, in verse 11,
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.100]   verse 13, verse 14, throughout the passages,
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.800]   talking about God's goodness.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.740]   And when we genuinely encounter God's greatness,
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.460]   then worship becomes spontaneous.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.540]   We don't have to convince ourselves to worship God.
[00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.960]   When we have an encounter with God's power,
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:54.540]   it's kind of like if you think about seeing something
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.940]   that's just kind of really awe-inspiring or amazing
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:58.700]   if you stand next to the Grand Canyon
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.380]   or you go to Niagara Falls or something,
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.740]   and it's not hard to just feel excited about it.
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.580]   It's not hard to turn to the person next to you
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:09.500]   and say, "Wow, I can't believe this."
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:13.940]   You know, it's not hard to have something to say about it.
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.020]   It's spontaneous.
[00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:18.980]   And that's true when we are beholding God
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.420]   and really encountering God's greatness.
[00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:24.440]   It's gonna come out.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.300]   It's spontaneous.
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:27.400]   We're gonna begin to worship.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.000]   These attributes that Paul describes in this passage
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.760]   of who God is, those things never change,
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.200]   regardless of our circumstances,
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.880]   regardless of what's going on in our world.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.080]   Those things never change.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:45.080]   And that means that God is always worthy of our worship,
[00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:47.800]   every day of our life, no matter what's happening.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.040]   Even when we're going through really difficult times,
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.540]   God is worthy of our worship.
[00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:54.240]   Even when the world is falling apart and things are crazy
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.160]   and we're frightened, God is worthy of our worship.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:01.040]   Even when we feel pain, God is worthy of our worship.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.720]   And we know that we have that testimony in scripture
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.560]   of the saints that worship God through lament
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.640]   as well as through joyful praise.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.460]   So verbal praise and worship doesn't just have to be
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:16.640]   a joyful expression.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.640]   It can also be an expression of lament.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.360]   But we can always worship God,
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:25.720]   regardless of what we are facing in life.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.160]   And we're called to do that.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:29.680]   And if we're gonna do that,
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.080]   if we're gonna encounter God's greatness,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.800]   even when we're going through difficult things,
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:38.280]   we have to take our eyes off of our circumstances
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:40.540]   and begin to look at God,
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:42.620]   begin to orient ourselves towards God.
[00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:45.960]   And one of the things that's true in my life,
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:48.320]   and I think it's true for a lot of us as believers,
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.880]   is that if we're struggling to worship,
[00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:51.960]   if we find ourselves in a place where we're saying,
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.660]   I just don't feel it, I don't feel in church,
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:56.160]   I don't feel it anywhere else, it's just not there.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.500]   Yeah, I can say the words, but it's not meaningful to me.
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:00.880]   If we're struggling to worship,
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.240]   it's often because we're not seeing God's greatness.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   We don't see how great God is.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:09.320]   We don't see how powerful he is.
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:14.040]   We're not looking at that vista that's in front of us.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:17.520]   Because like I said, if we're seeing that,
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.720]   then it's easy for us to begin to worship.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.700]   The other aspect of God's worthiness that we see here
[00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:27.520]   is God's amazing grace.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.840]   Throughout this passage, it's talking about God's love,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.960]   God's lavish forgiveness, his grace, his mercy,
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:40.800]   his wise and holistic and good plan for our good,
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.160]   for our physical, our spiritual, emotional good,
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:44.600]   and not just for us personally,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:48.920]   but for the redemption of all things.
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.320]   How God is gonna unite all things in Christ.
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:57.320]   God's plan to glorify himself through his people,
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:01.420]   through us, God's gonna use us as a part of his plan,
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:03.880]   God's destiny for our future.
[00:14:03.880 --> 00:14:07.780]   And if we're in Christ, if we have a relationship with him,
[00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.720]   that means that we are experiencing God's grace.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:14.400]   We can't say, well, I know God's got a grace,
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:16.940]   but there's no grace in my life.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:20.300]   If you are in Christ, if you have a relationship with him,
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.880]   you already have experienced his grace
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:27.560]   and you are experienced it moment by moment, day by day.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.860]   And so that's something that God is worthy.
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:31.660]   We can praise him because of that.
[00:14:31.660 --> 00:14:40.040]   When we encounter the depth of God's grace,
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:46.000]   we start to see how much we need God.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:51.220]   And we see how, we become aware
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.520]   of how much he's done in our lives.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:58.380]   And that's a part of seeing God and his worthiness
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:03.080]   and who he is, is saying, okay, this is the reality of me,
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.260]   this is the reality of who I am,
[00:15:04.260 --> 00:15:07.660]   both my sin, all my mess, all my junk,
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:10.380]   but also just the ways I fall short,
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:11.860]   the ways I'm not who I wanna be,
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:16.860]   the ways that I am not gonna get where I want to go.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.100]   I need God so much.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.340]   And when we see that, we begin to say,
[00:15:21.340 --> 00:15:23.660]   wow, God has given me so much grace.
[00:15:23.660 --> 00:15:25.220]   God has forgiven me.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:26.540]   God has changed me.
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:27.820]   God is at work in my life.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:30.100]   God is filling in all these gaps.
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.460]   We can look around the world
[00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.660]   and see others who are struggling,
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.900]   and instead of having a heart that says,
[00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:41.140]   well, I'm just better than that person,
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:45.260]   so I can feel good about myself,
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:46.260]   I can feel proud about that,
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:48.080]   we can look at someone else and say,
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:50.980]   you know what, I would probably be in the exact same place
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:53.660]   if it wasn't for God's grace and God's work in my life,
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.300]   and that can cause us to worship.
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:00.440]   Honestly, we don't know what we don't know
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:02.380]   about our destiny apart from God's grace.
[00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:03.940]   It's true of all of us.
[00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:07.440]   We really don't know where we would be without God's grace
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:10.100]   if God hadn't saved us, forgiven us,
[00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:11.660]   brought us into his family,
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:16.020]   began to transform us and change our desires
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:16.860]   to honor Christ.
[00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:18.540]   If God wasn't doing that,
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.420]   we really have no idea where we'd be.
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:26.820]   And so again, I'll say that if we're struggling to worship,
[00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.580]   a lot of times it's because we're not seeing
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.060]   the depth of our need for God
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:32.580]   and the depth of his grace for us.
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:36.300]   If we really are seeing how much God has forgiven us
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.420]   and how much we need him
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.760]   and how much he is at work in our life day by day
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.620]   and all of the wonderful things he is doing for us,
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:45.500]   then we're gonna begin to worship.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:51.140]   So what we see in both of those areas,
[00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:52.240]   looking at God's greatness
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.340]   and looking at God's grace in our lives,
[00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:59.060]   is we see that if we will look at God and who he is
[00:16:59.060 --> 00:17:03.960]   and behold him, then we'll begin to genuinely worship.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:07.660]   Next thing we see in this passage
[00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:12.660]   is that we worship and praise because it is good for us.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:15.980]   It's so healthy and good for us
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.700]   to take our focus off of our circumstances
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.500]   and our mess and our struggles and our challenges
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:24.340]   and turn towards God and look at who he is
[00:17:24.340 --> 00:17:25.940]   and see his greatness and see his grace.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:27.420]   It's so healthy for us.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:31.420]   Psalm 147, the first three verses say this.
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.040]   Praise the Lord for it is good to sing praises to our God
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:37.100]   for it is pleasant and a song of praise is fitting.
[00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.380]   The Lord builds up Jerusalem.
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.100]   He gathers the outcast of Israel.
[00:17:40.100 --> 00:17:42.900]   He heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds.
[00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.300]   What do we see in that passage?
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:48.300]   We see people who are brokenhearted,
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.260]   who have wounds, who are outcasts,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:54.420]   people who, things are difficult in their lives,
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:18:00.500]   and it says it is good for them to sing praises to our God.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.380]   It's pleasant, a song of praise is fitting.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.340]   Ephesians chapter five, later on in this letter
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:10.340]   that Paul has written, he tells the believers
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.060]   to address one another in psalms and hymns
[00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:13.940]   and spiritual songs, singing and making melody
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.420]   to the Lord with your heart, giving thanks always
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:18.460]   and for everything to God the Father
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.020]   in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:26.020]   It's so healthy and good for us to praise God
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:31.140]   and to do that in song like we just did,
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.700]   but also just to do it in speaking with one another
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.180]   and encouraging one another, talking about God's goodness
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:40.500]   in our lives, talking about how we see God at work
[00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   in someone else's life, how we're grateful
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.340]   for what God is doing in their life,
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:47.260]   how we're grateful for the way God is using them
[00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:51.140]   or how we are seeing God taking them through something
[00:18:51.140 --> 00:18:53.660]   or supporting them in some way.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:58.060]   Those are all ways that we can express worship to God
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:02.100]   and it encourages one another and it encourages us.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.180]   When we're in some of our most difficult moments
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.020]   and life is terrible and we feel like everything
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.620]   is going wrong and we've lost our job
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:14.260]   or we have experienced a relationship
[00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.380]   where someone has said terrible things about us
[00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.780]   or maybe we've experienced a loss,
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.500]   someone that we love has passed away,
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:25.360]   whatever we're going through, even in those moments,
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.580]   if we're in Christ, then we are loved,
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.540]   we're redeemed, we're forgiven, we're accepted
[00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:34.980]   and we have a future hope, we have a blessed inheritance
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.240]   like this passage talks about and we have
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:42.860]   an eternal destiny of victory and of fellowship
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.960]   with God in heaven.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.500]   That's the truth about everyone in this room.
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:50.860]   If you're in Christ, that's the truth about you.
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:53.180]   And so even if you're going through something
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:56.460]   really difficult, I'm not talking about saying,
[00:19:56.460 --> 00:19:58.980]   well, I can just ignore my problems and wish them away.
[00:19:58.980 --> 00:20:03.540]   No, life is challenging, it's hard and that's real.
[00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.940]   And there are times when we feel that brokenness
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.540]   so heavily and we're discouraged.
[00:20:07.540 --> 00:20:09.460]   I'm not saying that we don't.
[00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.780]   As believers, we feel that.
[00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:11.900]   That's why, like I said earlier,
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:14.100]   there are all the scriptures of lament
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:17.860]   because life comes in on us just like anybody else.
[00:20:17.860 --> 00:20:21.660]   But even in those moments, we know that we are loved
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:25.000]   and forgiven, we're redeemed, we're accepted,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.820]   that God is at work in our life for his glory,
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:30.020]   for our good, that we have a future hope,
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:34.700]   that we have this destiny of victory
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:37.260]   and fellowship with God in heaven.
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:40.700]   And we can worship and it's good for us to think about that.
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.820]   In the darkest moments of our life,
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:47.720]   when we're really struggling, it's good for us to say,
[00:20:47.720 --> 00:20:52.720]   yes, this is hard and it hurts and I'm being crushed by it,
[00:20:53.300 --> 00:20:58.300]   but God loves me and I'm forgiven and he's redeemed me
[00:20:58.300 --> 00:21:01.380]   and even all my mess, he's at work
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:03.220]   and he's making something good out of it.
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.000]   He's transforming me and I'm not gonna be
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:07.320]   in this place forever.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:11.600]   God's gonna change me into something new
[00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:13.260]   and that's gonna happen in this life,
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.780]   but ultimately, God's gonna take me on to heaven
[00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.380]   in the future.
[00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.500]   And so even the pain that I'm feeling right now
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:21.900]   is a temporary pain.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.740]   It's good for us to know that.
[00:21:24.740 --> 00:21:26.740]   It's good for us to say that.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.420]   It's good for us to say that to one another.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:31.300]   It's good for us to say that to ourselves.
[00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:33.420]   And we do that when we worship.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:36.220]   The songs we were singing this morning,
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:40.180]   singing about how we have a savior who's mighty to save.
[00:21:40.180 --> 00:21:41.300]   That's what we're doing.
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.900]   We're saying, hey, life is tough,
[00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:46.660]   but Jesus is bigger and he's powerful and he's mighty
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:50.020]   and he can save us out of all the challenges of our life.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:51.860]   It's good for us to say that to each other.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.700]   It's healthy.
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:53.940]   It encourages us.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:55.780]   It keeps us going.
[00:21:55.780 --> 00:22:00.380]   Worship and praise is so good for us emotionally.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.320]   It's so good for us physically.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:03.920]   It's so good for us spiritually.
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:06.460]   And then the last thing we see here
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:09.780]   is that we worship and praise
[00:22:09.780 --> 00:22:11.820]   because it's a witness to others.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:16.260]   Some of the earliest second century texts
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:18.180]   talking about the early church
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.720]   agree that the worship gatherings of the early church
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.360]   that happened on Sunday were first and foremost
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.480]   what they called Eucharistia or Thanksgiving.
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:32.280]   That was what defined those gatherings
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.320]   was that they were about thanksgiving to God.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:40.200]   Worship and praise to God and talking about who God is
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.520]   and how good he is and exalting him
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.260]   and talking about his work in our lives
[00:22:44.260 --> 00:22:47.940]   has always been a defining characteristic
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.820]   of the church of Christians from the very, very beginning.
[00:22:51.820 --> 00:22:54.060]   In the second century,
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:56.800]   there was this pagan writer named Celsus
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:58.140]   who didn't like Christians.
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:00.180]   He was a critic of the church.
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.420]   He was writing to someone else
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:03.300]   and he commented in this letter
[00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.540]   that he didn't like Christian worship
[00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.780]   because the chants and the songs that they sang
[00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.940]   were unfamiliar to his ears,
[00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:15.420]   but they were also so beautiful
[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:20.300]   that he felt that they dulled his reasoning faculties
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:23.340]   and made him more open to the Christian arguments.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:27.620]   From the very beginning,
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.560]   we as a people, followers of Jesus,
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.100]   have been known as people who worship
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.820]   and sing and sing beautifully.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:37.840]   That doesn't mean that we all necessarily
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:40.540]   know how to play instruments or even sing on key,
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.660]   but it's beautiful because it comes from our hearts
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:45.540]   and it's genuine and it's worship to God.
[00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:49.940]   That's been a part of who we are from the very beginning
[00:23:49.940 --> 00:23:53.220]   and it's a part of who we are now.
[00:23:53.220 --> 00:23:56.460]   In Acts 2, verses 46 and 47, it says this.
[00:23:56.460 --> 00:23:58.300]   Day by day, attending the temple together
[00:23:58.300 --> 00:23:59.460]   and breaking bread in their homes,
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.040]   they received their food with glad and generous heart,
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:04.580]   praising God and having favor with the people
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.140]   and the Lord added to their number day by day
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:08.060]   those who were being saved.
[00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.840]   That was the very first church.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.240]   Every day, they were getting together,
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.620]   doing different things and one of the things
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:15.260]   they were doing was praising God.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.200]   And one of the powerful things about worship
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.600]   is that genuine worship and praise to God,
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:25.600]   it can't be duplicated or counterfeited in the world.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:29.420]   We see that in American culture.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:32.660]   We have this beautiful tradition of gospel music
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:37.380]   in the US that comes from the African American church.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:39.460]   Well, there's a difference between someone
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.700]   singing that song in church
[00:24:41.700 --> 00:24:44.060]   and someone just singing it on the stage
[00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:46.400]   at an award show who doesn't know Jesus.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:47.980]   It's two totally different things.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:52.580]   You can't counterfeit genuine worship
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.180]   and the world around us notices that too.
[00:24:55.180 --> 00:24:56.060]   It's a witness.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:58.500]   When we are genuinely worshiping God,
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:24:59.780]   they say that's something beautiful
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:03.540]   and that's an expression that you don't find anywhere else.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.980]   It can't be duplicated.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:09.140]   And genuine worship and praise to God
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:11.620]   is always focused on God, not on us
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.700]   and that's another reason it's a witness.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:15.540]   Genuine worship and praise to God
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:19.860]   is some form of saying, listen, this is who I was
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.780]   and then this is who God made me or is making me to be.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.300]   This is my present situation
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:27.760]   but this is what God has for me.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:29.980]   This is what my future used to be
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:34.020]   but now because of Jesus, this is what is in my future.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:36.380]   Those types of statements define our worship
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:39.660]   where we're saying, look, it's about God.
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:41.380]   God did this.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:42.740]   It's not about me.
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.580]   The focus is on him and how good he is
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:47.620]   and how great he is and all that he's done in my life.
[00:25:47.620 --> 00:25:50.180]   That's what we see in these verses three to 14
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:51.220]   of Ephesians one.
[00:25:51.220 --> 00:25:55.300]   And that type of worship is always a witness to other people.
[00:25:55.300 --> 00:25:58.060]   The people around us, they may think it's strange,
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.260]   they may think it's unusual but they'll notice it
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:04.460]   and people will say, that's different.
[00:26:04.460 --> 00:26:05.480]   What are you talking about?
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:06.580]   Why are you talking about it?
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.220]   Why are you joyful?
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.300]   Why are you talking about your God
[00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:14.660]   even when life is terrible and I can see that it's terrible
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:16.020]   and you're going through a time of lament
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.180]   but you're still worshiping in that?
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.820]   Those things are all a witness to the people around us.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:27.460]   So I wanna close out with application for us.
[00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.380]   Like I said, this passage gives us
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:32.020]   this beautiful expression of worship.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.380]   It's a great template for us to think about
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:38.260]   and it makes it clear that this should be a part
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:41.600]   of our lifestyle and clearly in the church,
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.460]   just like we worship this morning,
[00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:45.380]   but it should be a part of our lifestyle every day.
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:47.940]   We should verbally be praising God,
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:51.340]   talking to ourselves, nothing wrong with talking to yourself
[00:26:51.340 --> 00:26:52.580]   if you're gonna preach the gospel
[00:26:52.580 --> 00:26:54.020]   or talk about who God is to yourself.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.460]   That's a healthy, good thing.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.020]   We should be doing that,
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:59.180]   especially when we're going through difficult times.
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.540]   We should be telling ourselves, you know what?
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.540]   It's hard but God's at work in my life.
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:06.840]   God loves me, I'm forgiven, I'm redeemed.
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.900]   That should be a part of our life rhythm.
[00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:11.540]   But I know it's not always easy.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:12.380]   So how do we do that?
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:14.380]   How do we make that happen?
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.480]   I want us to think about something for just a minute.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   To illustrate this, we can take a mental excursion real fast
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:25.780]   so let's pretend, you know, if you go down Halsted here
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.420]   to 31st and then you just go east on 31st,
[00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:31.740]   as far east as you can go, you get to the lake
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:33.260]   and there's the beach park there, right?
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.940]   Everybody been to 31st Street Beach?
[00:27:35.940 --> 00:27:38.420]   And it's a really pretty beach park.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:40.740]   There's that point out there where the marina is.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.100]   You can walk out there and they have kind of
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:45.180]   these big boulders for breakwater.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.340]   You can look back towards the city.
[00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:48.580]   If you haven't done it, you should do it sometime.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.820]   It's a really, really cool spot.
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.320]   It's a great spot to take pictures of the skyline.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:58.020]   But if you go out there and if I asked each one of you
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:01.740]   to describe what you would see when you're there,
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:07.600]   your answers would vary depending on how you were oriented.
[00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:09.540]   If you're looking straight east from out there,
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.260]   all you're gonna see is water.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:13.580]   You're just gonna see the lake, which is beautiful.
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:15.080]   That's all you're gonna see.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.800]   If you're looking back to the west,
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:18.500]   then you're gonna see the city skyline.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.980]   You're gonna see Lakeshore Drive.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.260]   You're gonna see something totally, totally different
[00:28:23.260 --> 00:28:26.020]   depending on how you're oriented.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:31.100]   And I think that's really instructive for us in worship,
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.500]   especially when we're struggling to worship.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:35.560]   We're saying, I know I need more worship in my life.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.920]   I wanna express praise to God,
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.500]   but it's not coming naturally right now.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.020]   I don't feel it.
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.740]   We need to think about what are we oriented towards.
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:51.860]   And sometimes in life, we need to turn the eyes of our soul
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:57.340]   away from our problems, away from our success,
[00:28:57.340 --> 00:29:01.940]   away from our failures, away from our relationships,
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:04.340]   away from our entertainment,
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:06.980]   away from all our social media feeds,
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:10.520]   and say, I'm gonna orient myself towards God.
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:11.460]   I'm gonna look at God.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.900]   I'm gonna behold God.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:17.420]   And we do that as we look in His word.
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:19.900]   We do that as we look into our hearts
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:22.420]   and recount God's grace in our life.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.340]   And we say, you know what?
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:26.140]   This is what God has done for me,
[00:29:26.140 --> 00:29:27.980]   and this is what God has done in the past.
[00:29:27.980 --> 00:29:30.020]   Or we look at the lives of other believers around us
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:33.420]   and say, I see God doing this in someone else's life,
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.820]   and it's a beautiful thing.
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.220]   I see something encouraging happening
[00:29:37.220 --> 00:29:39.180]   with a brother or sister.
[00:29:39.180 --> 00:29:41.820]   When we do those things, we begin to orient ourselves
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.820]   towards looking at God.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:48.820]   And when we look at God, then we can begin to worship.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:51.740]   The scripture talks about this.
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:54.380]   Psalm 75, one says, we give thanks to you, O God.
[00:29:54.380 --> 00:29:55.920]   We give thanks for your name is near.
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:29:58.100]   We recount your wondrous deeds.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:01.980]   Psalm 124, one says, if it had not been the Lord
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.240]   who was on our side, let Israel now say.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:10.740]   And so I would challenge and encourage all of us
[00:30:10.740 --> 00:30:14.100]   to do that and to seek ways to do that in our lives.
[00:30:14.100 --> 00:30:17.900]   Begin to orient our soul towards looking at God.
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:20.840]   There's a lot of stuff for us to look at in the world.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.860]   Way too much.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.140]   We can't take it all in.
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:26.900]   And sometimes we need to turn away from those things
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:28.340]   and orient ourselves towards God.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:30.420]   And if we'll do that, it'll be so good for us.
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:31.820]   It'll be life for us.
[00:30:31.820 --> 00:30:33.100]   It'll be life-giving.
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.980]   It'll be a witness to those around us.
[00:30:37.980 --> 00:30:40.460]   And ultimately, it's an identity that God has given you
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:44.580]   as one of his children, is to worship him as a worshiper.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:45.400]   That's who we are.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:47.240]   We are worshipers.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.080]   Let's pray.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:52.260]   God, we thank you for your greatness.
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:53.420]   We thank you for your grace.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.680]   We thank you for who you are,
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.980]   all that you have done in redemption.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.820]   We thank you for all that you have done in our lives,
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.760]   and we are undeserving.
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:03.520]   We need you desperately, God.
[00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:10.220]   And God, you love us and have redeemed us and forgiven us.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:12.600]   I pray that you would help all of us
[00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:14.440]   to orient our souls to look at that,
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.460]   to look at you, to look at what you've done for us,
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:20.820]   to look at your grace, and may worship come out of us.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.740]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:25.820]   (gentle piano music)
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.320]   (piano music)
[00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.840]   (gentle music)
