00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 - Hey guys, we will turn to the book of Genesis chapter 37.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:09,140
 If you have your Bible,

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:13,080
 turn with me to the book of Genesis chapter 37.

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,200
 And today we are going to begin a new topic.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,400
 This topic is called the providence of God.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,560
 So we're gonna read the story of Joseph.

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:28,480
 Now, anyone has any idea what the word providence means?

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:30,580
 What does it mean?

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,280
 It's actually two words together, right?

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,360
 Combined compound word, right?

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:40,640
 Meaning pro, ahead or beforehand,

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,640
 and then seeing, where we get vision, right?

13
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,480
 That is the providence of God.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,680
 And this is a precious teaching found in the Bible.

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,680
 At times we might think or mistaken providence as fate

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,160
 or some sort of blind destiny.

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,460
 Everything is set, past, present and future,

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,960
 and everything is predetermined in your life, in our life.

19
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,460
 Everything is pre-decided mechanically.

20
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:14,240
 So we're just going through our journey of life

21
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,600
 and every day is already preset.

22
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,840
 Sometimes we have this wrong idea,

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,280
 but in the Bible, providence refers not

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,160
 the blind mechanism of the universe or in your life.

25
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:35,120
 Providence means God is caring and seeing ahead of time

26
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:39,600
 in whatsoever comes to pass, whatsoever.

27
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,500
 The people that you meet, the coffee that you had today,

28
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:47,940
 driving here, right?

29
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,480
 Some more people got in your way, right?

30
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,120
 You probably yell at some people.

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,120
 You come here and join the worship.

32
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,200
 Everything whatsoever comes to pass.

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,060
 That is the biblical definition of providence.

34
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,960
 It's not a mechanical, you know,

35
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:11,640
 everything decided and predetermined kind of fate

36
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,100
 that we're going through our lives,

37
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,800
 but God is seeing ahead of time and caring for you.

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,280
 So that's what it means, providence.

39
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,400
 And there are a lot of different Bible verses

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,600
 that has to do with providence.

41
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,360
 For example, Psalm 139, one of the favorite Psalms, right?

42
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,400
 "Oh Lord, you have examined my heart

43
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,280
 "and know everything about me."

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,960
 Everything, see the key word here?

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,080
 Everything.

46
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,960
 You know, when I sit down or stand up,

47
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,960
 when you sit down, take a break,

48
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,480
 when you're standing up, doing something, working,

49
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,560
 Lord, you know my thoughts, even I'm far, far away, right?

50
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:59,360
 When you're traveling, we are not home.

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,320
 Lord, you see me when I travel, when I rest at home.

52
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:07,240
 That's NLT, by the way.

53
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,860
 And you know everything I do.

54
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,600
 That is providence, isn't it?

55
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,440
 Right?

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,640
 Many scriptures teach the providence of God

57
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,220
 or the doctrine of divine providence,

58
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:23,220
 that your life is under the beforehand seeing of God,

59
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,900
 beforehand caring of God.

60
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,420
 Whether you believe it or not, right?

61
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,540
 Now there are also different Bible verses

62
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,540
 we're not going to dig into them,

63
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,740
 but this is something unique about the biblical culture

64
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,140
 or the Hebrew culture.

65
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,500
 Even today, when you ask a rabbi a question,

66
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,400
 usually you don't get a direct answer.

67
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,380
 The rabbi probably will respond, "Let me tell you a story."

68
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,260
 That's interesting, right?

69
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:56,580
 It's kind of different from our Western

70
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:00,020
 or urban kind of linear, you know,

71
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,460
 we all want to outline things

72
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,500
 and bullet points and all that, right?

73
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:08,140
 We're more abstract in our thinking,

74
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,260
 but in the Hebrew culture or Bible culture,

75
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:13,060
 they will tell you a story, right?

76
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,540
 Remember the prophet Nathan,

77
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,560
 when he was about to confront David

78
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,500
 for the great sin that he committed,

79
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,460
 what did Nathan do?

80
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,700
 (audience murmurs)

81
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,820
 He told him a story, told him a parable, right?

82
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:31,900
 And Jesus did a lot of parables, illustrations, right?

83
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,580
 Daily life illustrations

84
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:38,180
 in order to flesh out some of the truth, right?

85
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,660
 So today we're going to read story, all right?

86
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:43,820
 Big chunk of it, right?

87
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,060
 Biblical story of Joseph.

88
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,180
 You ready?

89
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:50,820
 Let me tell you a story, all right?

90
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,540
 Chapter 37, verse two.

91
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,020
 This is the account of Jacob and his family.

92
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,700
 When Joseph was 17 year old,

93
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:02,900
 he often tended his father's flock.

94
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,500
 He worked for his half brothers,

95
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:08,580
 the sons of the father's wives, Belhar and Silpah.

96
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:11,100
 But Joseph reported to his father

97
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:13,540
 some of the bad things his brothers were doing.

98
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:18,220
 Jacob loved Joseph more than any of his other children

99
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:22,260
 because Joseph had been born to him in his old age.

100
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:27,260
 So one day, Jacob had a special gift made for Joseph,

101
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:30,260
 a beautiful many color robe.

102
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,260
 But his brothers hated Joseph

103
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:38,460
 because their father loved him more than the rest of them.

104
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:42,960
 They couldn't say a kind word to him.

105
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,040
 This is interesting.

106
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,660
 The Hebrew here is they cannot say shalom to him.

107
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,300
 So they can't say good morning or hi to him.

108
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,500
 Can't say a kind word to him, can't say shalom to him.

109
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,580
 And then the following context reports

110
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,460
 about the two dreams that Joseph had.

111
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,100
 And we're not going to go into it,

112
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,580
 but the main idea is that someday,

113
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,340
 the dreams are foretelling the future, right?

114
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:12,800
 Ahead of time, that Joseph will be greater

115
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,460
 than all his family members, his father, his mother,

116
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,580
 and all the brothers.

117
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:21,980
 And that's why the brothers hated him, right?

118
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,500
 Imagine your little brother telling you,

119
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:27,020
 "Someday you're gonna worship me."

120
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,380
 No way, right?

121
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:32,220
 Your little brother or your younger sibling

122
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,220
 saying to you, "Someday I'm going to have

123
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,520
 "all your investment, all your bank accounts."

124
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,340
 No way, right?

125
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:45,580
 That's why the brothers hated him.

126
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,980
 And then verse 14.

127
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:52,180
 Now what happened here is Jacob said to Joseph,

128
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,620
 "Go and see how your brothers

129
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,820
 "and the flocks are getting along.

130
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,860
 "Then come back and bring me a report."

131
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,900
 So Jacob sent him on his way,

132
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,260
 and Joseph traveled to Shechem

133
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,620
 from their home in the Valley of Hebron.

134
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,620
 When he arrived there, a man from the area noticed him

135
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,420
 wandering around in the field or countryside.

136
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,300
 "What are you looking for?" he asked.

137
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,760
 "I'm looking for my brothers," Joseph replied.

138
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:25,020
 "Do you know where they are pasturing their sheep?"

139
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,760
 "Yes," the man told him.

140
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,260
 "They have moved on from here,

141
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:33,460
 "but I heard them saying, 'Let's go to Dothan.'"

142
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,540
 So Joseph followed his brothers to Dothan

143
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,060
 and found them there.

144
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:40,140
 Verse 18.

145
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,380
 When Joseph's brothers saw him coming,

146
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,500
 they recognized him in the distance.

147
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,940
 As he approached, they made plans to kill him.

148
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,820
 "Here comes the dreamer," they said.

149
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,680
 "Come on, let's kill him

150
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,180
 "and throw him into one of the cisterns.

151
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,920
 "We can tell our father a wild animal has eaten him.

152
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,100
 "Then we will see what becomes of his dreams."

153
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,940
 Right?

154
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,740
 21.

155
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,900
 But when Reuben pulled up the scheme,

156
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,460
 he came to Joseph's rescue.

157
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,380
 "Let's not kill him," he said.

158
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:16,580
 "Why should we shed any blood?

159
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,500
 "Let's just throw him into an empty cistern

160
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,180
 "here in the wilderness.

161
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,740
 "Then he'll die without our laying a hand on him."

162
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:28,380
 Reuben was secretly planning to rescue Joseph,

163
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,500
 and return him to his father.

164
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,180
 So when Joseph arrived,

165
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,180
 his brothers ripped off the beautiful robe he was wearing.

166
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:42,220
 Then they grabbed him and threw him into the cistern.

167
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:47,220
 And the pit was empty, and there was no water in it.

168
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:50,980
 Then, just as they were sitting down to eat,

169
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,860
 how can you eat with your little brother in the cistern?

170
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,700
 Crying out.

171
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,020
 They're having fast food here.

172
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:02,960
 They look up and saw a caravan of camels in the distance

173
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,700
 coming toward them.

174
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,280
 It's a group of Ishmaelite traders

175
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:10,660
 taking a load of gum, balm, aromatic resin

176
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,940
 from Gilead down to Egypt.

177
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:18,820
 Judah said to his brothers,

178
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,860
 "What will we gain by killing our brother?

179
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,820
 "We have to cover up the crime.

180
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,760
 "Instead of hurting him,

181
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:28,440
 "let's sell him to those Ishmaelite traders.

182
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,360
 "After all, he is our brother,

183
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,740
 "our own flesh and our own blood."

184
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,440
 His brothers agreed.

185
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,260
 So when the Ishmaelites, who were Midianite traders,

186
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:42,420
 came by, Joseph's brothers pulled him out of the pit

187
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,220
 and sold him to them for 20 pieces of silver,

188
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,700
 and the traders took him down to Egypt.

189
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,380
 Now, sometime later,

190
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:57,780
 Reuben returned to get Joseph out of the pit.

191
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,220
 When he discovered that Joseph was missing,

192
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,580
 he torn his clothes in grief,

193
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:03,940
 and he went back to his brother and lamented,

194
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,900
 "The boy is gone.

195
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,840
 "What will I do now?"

196
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,880
 Then the brothers killed a young goat

197
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,320
 and dipped Joseph's robe in his blood.

198
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:14,820
 They sent the beautiful robe to their father

199
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,780
 with this message, "Look at what we found.

200
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,160
 "Doesn't this robe belong to your son?"

201
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,280
 And then we skip to 36.

202
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:26,280
 Meanwhile, the Midianite traders arrived down in Egypt,

203
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,760
 where they sold Joseph to Polypher,

204
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,800
 an officer of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.

205
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,420
 Polypher was captain of the palace guard.

206
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:39,720
 Now, this is a long story, right?

207
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:43,580
 Whole chapter 37, pretty much we read every single verse.

208
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:47,760
 It clearly tells us the older brothers of Joseph

209
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,880
 were ill-intent.

210
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,480
 They wanted to kill Joseph.

211
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,360
 Remember the pit, the cistern?

212
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,920
 What happened to it?

213
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,760
 Was there any water?

214
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,840
 No, there was no water, right?

215
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:03,840
 According to the Palestinian climate,

216
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:06,240
 this should be the end of summer.

217
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,400
 No water at all.

218
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,800
 They wanted to kill him,

219
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:14,280
 but they changed their mind and agreed with Reuben.

220
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:18,060
 And Reuben, all of a sudden, he intervened and said,

221
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:21,320
 "Hey, let's put this boy into the pit," right?

222
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,120
 Where there's no water.

223
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,120
 And he actually intended to come back and to rescue Joseph.

224
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,720
 However, as the story goes, some traders,

225
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,800
 some international traders, Ishmaelites or Midianites,

226
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
 they came by and they decided,

227
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,040
 according to Judah's suggestion,

228
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,080
 sell Joseph to the trader and bring him down to Egypt.

229
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:57,120
 As you know, the story of Joseph runs very, very long,

230
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,440
 right, 37, chapter 37 to all the way to the end,

231
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,240
 chapter 50, end of the book of Genesis.

232
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,560
 And we all know the end, right?

233
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,460
 Well, let me spoil it, yeah.

234
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:15,920
 Chapter 50, verse 20, finally,

235
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,320
 even the brothers and Jacob,

236
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:21,120
 the whole family came down from Canaan to Egypt

237
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,040
 because of famine, right?

238
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:28,040
 And just eventually, Joseph rose from the pit

239
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:33,160
 to being the second in command in the nation of Egypt.

240
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,240
 And he was kind of a savior.

241
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,560
 He saved his whole family.

242
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,900
 And eventually, all the brothers reconciled.

243
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:43,320
 And Joseph said to his brother, "That is the end,

244
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,880
 "almost the end of the story," chapter 50, 20.

245
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,020
 "You guys intended to harm me,

246
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:52,320
 "but God intended it all for good.

247
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,580
 "He brought me to this position

248
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,580
 "so that I could save the lives of many people."

249
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,320
 That's just a long story.

250
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,720
 We will go through it, you know, chapter by chapter.

251
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,700
 But this is how the Bible works.

252
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:12,700
 Tell your story, a very complicated, very detailed story

253
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,520
 so you can chill upon it.

254
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,800
 You can return the story again and again

255
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:21,160
 and think about the topic here, the theme here,

256
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,000
 the providence of God in your life.

257
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,040
 Providence of God in your life.

258
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:32,040
 Somehow God is seeing or caring for you way ahead of time

259
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,680
 before you can see how your life unfolds.

260
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:40,220
 God sees ahead of time.

261
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,240
 So there are actually two points I want to bring out.

262
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:48,240
 First, if you read the story, just read chapter 37,

263
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,640
 what I want to point out is everyone in the story

264
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:56,120
 is free to make choices, right?

265
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,560
 Jacob, the father, he probably worries about, you know,

266
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,040
 the flock and the brothers,

267
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,040
 and send his beloved son, Joseph, to check on them, right?

268
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,680
 Nobody forced Jacob to make any choice.

269
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,980
 He was a free agent.

270
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,520
 He chose to send Joseph, right?

271
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,900
 Completely free.

272
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,640
 So he made that choice.

273
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,000
 And then the brothers were tending the flocks in Shechem.

274
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,120
 Shechem, by the way, is in the north.

275
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,960
 So he started, Joseph started in the south, Hebron,

276
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:33,480
 all the way up, probably walk three, two days,

277
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,960
 three or four days, to reach up north in Shechem.

278
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,280
 And as I said, it was probably late summer

279
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,640
 because the pit was dry.

280
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:46,640
 And then the brothers made their own choice as free agents.

281
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:50,700
 They moved from Shechem to another place called Dothan,

282
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,460
 which is further up north.

283
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,360
 Probably they were trying to find water for the sheep.

284
00:14:56,360 --> 00:15:01,980
 But in any how, they were free to do so, right?

285
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:03,800
 Nobody forced them.

286
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,920
 They made their own choices.

287
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,820
 And then Joseph, the beloved son,

288
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,640
 he obeys his father and goes to Shechem.

289
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,440
 And they're kind of wandering, he got lost.

290
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:21,440
 And then finally he reached the brothers at Dothan, right?

291
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,580
 Joseph made free choices as well.

292
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:30,780
 And then the brothers were held fully accountable

293
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,180
 for victimizing Joseph.

294
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:37,640
 The story lays blame on brothers,

295
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,740
 not Jacob, the father, not Joseph, the beloved son, right?

296
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,060
 No matter how Joseph is lovely or not,

297
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,340
 he's getting along with the brothers or not,

298
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:54,180
 or he's just a very wicked person or not, right?

299
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:55,820
 Good or bad.

300
00:15:55,820 --> 00:16:00,820
 The story lays blame only on the elder brothers, right?

301
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:04,940
 So everyone in the story is free to make choices.

302
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,700
 However, some things happen in the story

303
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,360
 out of expectation.

304
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,200
 Nobody would have thought how the story unfolds.

305
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,960
 For example, Joseph goes to Shechem,

306
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,560
 try to find his brothers, right?

307
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,960
 He's lost.

308
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:28,800
 Probably he has wasted some time, or a day or so,

309
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,960
 wandering in the wilderness, in the field.

310
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:36,840
 And then surprisingly, a dude passes by.

311
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,840
 And this dude, no name, right?

312
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,860
 Unnamed character in the story.

313
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:46,600
 Just happened he heard what the brother said.

314
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,880
 Remember what the brother says?

315
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,960
 Let's go out of Shechem and go to Doton, right?

316
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:56,480
 And then just, he heard about it.

317
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,080
 He heard about it, and then surprisingly,

318
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:02,000
 he found Joseph getting lost, right?

319
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,040
 This young boy getting lost in the field.

320
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:08,000
 And then surprisingly, he goes to Joseph and ask,

321
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,080
 "Hey, what are you doing?

322
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,400
 "What are you looking for?"

323
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,240
 Right?

324
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,720
 And then Joseph reply, "I'm looking for his brothers."

325
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,320
 "Oh, I heard about your brothers."

326
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,800
 You know, they just went from Shechem here

327
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,360
 to someplace else, to Doton.

328
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:23,680
 So some things happen in the story

329
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:28,000
 out of expectation for anyone, anyone in the story.

330
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,440
 Secondly, the brothers.

331
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:31,760
 Now I talk about Joseph, right?

332
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,200
 Wandering, wasting some time.

333
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,300
 And then the brothers, the brothers meant to kill Joseph.

334
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,360
 No question about it, right?

335
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,360
 But surprisingly, Reuben, the firstborn, intervenes.

336
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,280
 He intervenes, "Don't kill him, don't commit murder."

337
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,560
 And Joseph end up in the pit, right?

338
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:57,560
 Now, why did Reuben think so?

339
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,200
 I don't know, I don't know.

340
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,680
 Probably just, you know, spirit of the moment, right?

341
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,640
 Let's not kill him, let's not kill our brother.

342
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,480
 Throw him in the pit, right?

343
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,260
 So the brothers, to them, something surprising happened.

344
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:18,520
 Three, the cistern, the pit was dry, the end of summer.

345
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:23,600
 If Joseph was left in the pit for too long,

346
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,680
 he would have died, right?

347
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:31,220
 Even he asked for help, nobody would have heard him

348
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,760
 because he would be too weak, right?

349
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,080
 The cistern was dry.

350
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,520
 Nobody planned that, right?

351
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,820
 But something out of expectation happened.

352
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:47,240
 And then finally, some of the merchants came by, right?

353
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,320
 Who were those guys, right?

354
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,400
 Medianites or Ishmaelites or whatever, right?

355
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,560
 Some international traders came by and said,

356
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,600
 didn't really talk to the brothers,

357
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,320
 but the brothers were having the, you know, fast food lunch.

358
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:06,320
 And they saw these guys going down to Egypt.

359
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:10,660
 And out of expectation, Judah did not plan this.

360
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,840
 And he had an idea, let's sell our brothers, Joseph,

361
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:18,840
 to the traders, and the traders brought him down to Egypt.

362
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,640
 So unexpectedly, Joseph did not die in the pit.

363
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,660
 Eventually sold to Egypt.

364
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,220
 Now, the Hebrew Bible has a special word in the story

365
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:39,200
 to catch our attention.

366
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,200
 And usually this word is translated,

367
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,620
 behold or look, right?

368
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:46,540
 Some of the English translations, to my surprise,

369
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,980
 misses that.

370
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,480
 And it's a word called hinei.

371
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,140
 Hinei in the Hebrew word means

372
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,300
 trying to catch your attention, right?

373
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,600
 And they look, behold.

374
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,220
 And in this story, in chapter 37,

375
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,780
 hinei happens again and again.

376
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,860
 Let me give you some example, 15, verse 15.

377
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:13,860
 A stranger, a guy, found Joseph and hinei.

378
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,060
 He was wandering, he got lost in the field.

379
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,220
 And the stranger asked him,

380
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,260
 and there was some, you know,

381
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,780
 correspondences between them.

382
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:26,060
 Verse 19, the brothers said to one another, hinei.

383
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,180
 Actually, the brothers did not expect

384
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:30,380
 Joseph would show up, right?

385
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:33,100
 'Cause Joseph is the beloved son.

386
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,580
 He didn't have to work, right?

387
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,140
 He's always on the lazy boy playing games, right?

388
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,980
 He's beloved by the old father, right?

389
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,380
 Didn't expect Joseph would come and see how they're doing.

390
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,220
 Hinei, he comes the dreamer.

391
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:51,040
 And then they try to scheme to kill him.

392
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:55,300
 25, the brothers sat down to eat their meal.

393
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,940
 As they raised their eyes, hinei.

394
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,820
 Raised their eyes and looked.

395
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,620
 Hinei, look, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites,

396
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:09,380
 the traders, coming from Gilead.

397
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:13,180
 Gilead is up north, and then they're going down to Egypt.

398
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:15,220
 Now, these guys, these traders,

399
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:17,860
 were not slave traders, right?

400
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:21,140
 With all of the commodities they are trying

401
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,220
 to bring to Egypt, they have no interest

402
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:26,800
 in slavery.

403
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:34,100
 Judah got the idea and sold Joseph to those traders.

404
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:39,660
 And then Reuben came back in 29.

405
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,200
 Now Reuben returned to the cistern,

406
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,940
 and hinei, look, surprisingly,

407
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:51,000
 Joseph was not in it, so he torn his clothes.

408
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,740
 Surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise.

409
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,740
 At least there are four times here,

410
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,180
 hinei, the worst chosen.

411
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:02,140
 So in the entire chapter, 37,

412
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:03,820
 especially the latter half,

413
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,580
 talking about the selling of Joseph

414
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,740
 or whatever he encounters,

415
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:14,260
 you get the idea that everything somehow is orchestrated.

416
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:20,500
 Everything is working together

417
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,480
 down to the finest detail.

418
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,040
 Joseph got lost in the field.

419
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,680
 He wasted a day or two,

420
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:34,520
 and that's why he did not die in the pit.

421
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,880
 And he was sold to Egypt for a greater purpose.

422
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:42,140
 Providence, by means of a beautiful story,

423
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:47,040
 it tells you that providence includes getting lost.

424
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,200
 Have you ever got lost?

425
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,680
 Providence includes getting lost and wasting time,

426
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,560
 wasting time.

427
00:22:56,560 --> 00:23:00,740
 Have you ever, you know, stand in line in DMV?

428
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:06,280
 That's like the most frustrating hell on earth, right?

429
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,760
 Providence includes wasting time.

430
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:17,400
 Now, how many of you are good chess players?

431
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,520
 How many of you are good chess players?

432
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,160
 I'm very bad.

433
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,600
 I'm very bad.

434
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,060
 I just don't know how it works, right?

435
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:30,240
 When I was younger, I hate playing chess with my dad

436
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,360
 because he's much better.

437
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,080
 He's a good chess player.

438
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,260
 And I hate playing with him because I,

439
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,820
 well, you know, playing with my dad,

440
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,600
 a better chess player, and I'm so bad,

441
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,280
 I am absolutely free to make any move.

442
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,940
 But my opponent often puts me into some sort of situations,

443
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,940
 some sort of positions that I have to respond

444
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,640
 with another move, right?

445
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,820
 Some sort of moves.

446
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:05,740
 But I find that quickly, my moves lead to further

447
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:10,280
 his strategy to have him win.

448
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,180
 And he, of course, he wins at the end.

449
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:18,340
 Or have you ever played chess with computer?

450
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,760
 AI, can you beat it?

451
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,780
 Probably not, right?

452
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:30,300
 Compared to God, we are all like bad chess players.

453
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:34,720
 We're really, really bad.

454
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:37,600
 Because we can only see a step or two ahead.

455
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,500
 But God see the whole thing.

456
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,280
 God see the whole game.

457
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,500
 But there's a difference.

458
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,220
 No, me and God, you and God, in his providence,

459
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,400
 there was a difference.

460
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,240
 Because God's moves in your life

461
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,600
 are not mechanically programmed.

462
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,780
 He's relating to you, interacting with you all the time.

463
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:10,020
 And another difference is God is not in your life

464
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:12,480
 in order to defeat you.

465
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:16,620
 That is not the intent of our Karen father.

466
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,480
 Our Karen father is driven by his compassion for us.

467
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,400
 His loving plan for you and for the world, right?

468
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,780
 Don't you find this doctrine, providence,

469
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,780
 comforting, encouraging, especially in times of difficulty?

470
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:43,880
 That you are not under the control of any blind faith.

471
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,860
 You're not under control of any blind destiny

472
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:51,460
 that is predetermined.

473
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:55,380
 Yes, there are things out of your control.

474
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,800
 There are things that you pray for,

475
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,740
 you hope for, didn't happen.

476
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:02,940
 But your life, the Bible says,

477
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,980
 is not under some sort of blind faith.

478
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:11,420
 The school that you're going to,

479
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:16,080
 or the school that you apply and rejected you, right?

480
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:20,160
 The girl you try to approach, rejected you.

481
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,360
 I had that a lot when I was younger.

482
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:29,940
 The people that you try to relate to,

483
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:35,840
 give you a cold shoulder, or whatever you encounter.

484
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,720
 Don't you find it comforting

485
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,560
 if you know the biblical teaching of providence?

486
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:42,620
 Right?

487
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,200
 Now in the history of the church in the last 2000 years,

488
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,520
 many people, theologians,

489
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,960
 have tried to understand this mysterious,

490
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,300
 mysterious but comforting doctrine.

491
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,340
 And they try to take through different places of the Bible

492
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:03,360
 and try to summarize it, right?

493
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,380
 And one of the great summaries of providence

494
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,260
 is found in something called

495
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:11,320
 Westminster Confession of Faith.

496
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,340
 Now, what is Confession of Faith?

497
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:19,060
 It's actually a kind of a systematic summary

498
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,020
 of biblical teaching.

499
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,900
 And this document is a very comprehensive document

500
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:27,360
 about all things related to the teaching of the Bible.

501
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,900
 And it was drafted in the 17th century

502
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:33,220
 in the beautiful Westminster Abbey in London.

503
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,420
 In chapter five, article one,

504
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,860
 here is what it says about providence.

505
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,060
 Now I want you to pay attention to some of the words, okay?

506
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,460
 Let me read that.

507
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:47,780
 Five one, Westminster Confession of Faith.

508
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:52,780
 God, who created everything, also upholds everything.

509
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:59,260
 He directs, regulates, governs every creature,

510
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,120
 action, and thing.

511
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,100
 From the greatest to the least.

512
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,340
 By his completely wise and holy providence,

513
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:15,120
 he does so in accordance with his infallible foreknowledge

514
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,920
 and the voluntary, unchangeable purpose of his own will.

515
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,760
 All to the praise of the glory of his wisdom,

516
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,940
 power, justice, goodness, and mercy.

517
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:32,380
 God orchestrates from the greatest

518
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,180
 to the least.

519
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,140
 Everything is under his sight.

520
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:43,580
 Nothing is out of his vision, his providence.

521
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,700
 Here, this summary is only one paragraph

522
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:51,460
 out of the many paragraphs that talks about God

523
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,860
 and his providence in this document.

524
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,140
 Here it says, God, the creator,

525
00:28:57,140 --> 00:29:00,460
 transcends the creation.

526
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,580
 He's beyond us.

527
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:10,140
 But notice this, transcendence means his works

528
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,960
 are mysterious at times, right?

529
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,460
 Because he's beyond us.

530
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,620
 He's outside time and space.

531
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:17,600
 This is our God.

532
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,580
 This is the God of the Bible.

533
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,380
 He created us all.

534
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:25,420
 He orchestrates everything in our journey.

535
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:31,860
 Because he's beyond us, sometimes his works are mysterious.

536
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,180
 But not irrational, because transcendence

537
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:41,100
 does not mean his absence, right?

538
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,260
 His beyond us does not mean God is absent.

539
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,740
 He's here.

540
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,460
 He's here in your life.

541
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:52,520
 And secondly, from this paragraph,

542
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:58,520
 we notice, or chapter 37 of Book of Genesis,

543
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,120
 God never condones evil and sin.

544
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:05,840
 We are all accountable, just as the older brothers of Joseph,

545
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,480
 accountable to God.

546
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,440
 But God can use the good deeds of the people

547
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,600
 to accomplish his will.

548
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:18,000
 He, God, God can use the evil actions of the people

549
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,160
 to accomplish his holy plan.

550
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,800
 God can use both.

551
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,800
 Use our good works and the evil plans and actions of others.

552
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:40,440
 Number three, God orchestrates, sometimes directly

553
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,520
 and often indirectly, all the things

554
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:48,320
 from the greatest to the least in our life.

555
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,360
 But he's not inactive.

556
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,480
 He is not silent.

557
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,720
 He is always there.

558
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,760
 And this paragraph says there's a purpose to it.

559
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,360
 The purpose is for the praise and worship of God.

560
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,560
 If we really understand and really sink in

561
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:14,560
 this teaching of providence, we should find comfort

562
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,720
 and peace, even in times of difficulties and uncertainty.

563
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:22,320
 Yes, we all have our moments that we doubt

564
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,880
 what is God doing and where am I heading, right?

565
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,560
 Especially when we think of our future, right?

566
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,720
 But the teaching of providence encourages us,

567
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:40,400
 even invites us to join the plan of God,

568
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,600
 to participate in the advancement of God's plan,

569
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,680
 preaching the gospel, building up the church,

570
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,280
 serving in obedience, working with God,

571
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:51,680
 cooperating with God.

572
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,360
 He's orchestrating everything in my life,

573
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:58,640
 and that's why I can surrender my will to him.

574
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,680
 I can pray to God, God use me, right?

575
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:07,560
 Guide me, help me follow you, help me obey you, right?

576
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:11,520
 All the things, what does it say?

577
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:14,560
 From the greatest to the least,

578
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,800
 by his completely wise and holy providence.

579
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:23,080
 We're gonna end today with our response song,

580
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,760
 and I wanna invite the worship team to come up here.

581
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:30,640
 Great is our God, and because he's so great,

582
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,600
 that's why we bow down and fall down before him to worship.

583
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,320
 That's why we can lay our lives before him,

584
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:46,160
 because he is greatest, and he is holy and good.

585
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:50,080
 We can trust in him.

586
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:54,280
 No matter life throw at you, you can still trust.

587
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,800

 Father, once again, we give you thanks

609
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,640
 because everything in our life,

610
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,920

00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:18,720
 is under your careful watch.

612
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,400
 Thank you for being our Lord and our Savior.

613

 Thank you for this comforting truth

614
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,880
 that we can lay our lives before you.

615
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,880
 God use us, send us.

616
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:39,440
 Send us to where you want us to be,

617
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,600
 to be your instrument.

618
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,720
 And in times of difficulties and uncertainties,

 we pray that we will trust in you.

620
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,920

 and in your providence,

622
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:01,320
