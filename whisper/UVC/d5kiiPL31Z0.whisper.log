[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.080]   Pastor Mark for our spiritual today. Hey guys, good morning. Uh, one wish it has to one another
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.000]   some of the neighbors, uh, right next to you. Um, good to be, uh, together as the people of God to
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.360]   worship together. And, um, yeah, today, uh, we're going to, uh, talk about this topic. Uh, we're
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.600]   going to continue this series on new, new heaven and new earth. Try to picture what heaven looks
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:34.720]   like. Try to picture what heaven is like. Right. And, um, there were a lot of different images
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.120]   found in the Bible, especially in the new Testament that talks about what our future home
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.640]   looks like. I will like the, uh, the weekly devotional is tied to our preaching series.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.600]   Uh, it's on our future home. Uh, last time we were talking about John 14 and, uh, Jesus was saying,
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.760]   I'm going to, uh, prepare homes for you and a place for you in heaven, in my father's house.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.880]   And we're going to continue this topic because the Bible has so much to say about our future home.
[00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:12.880]   In the old Testament, in the book of Isaiah, it talks about the future kingdom, new cosmos,
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.680]   new creation is going to be without pain and without tears, without crying, without all this
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.760]   suffering. And it will be a righteousness dwelling in the new heaven and new earth.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.400]   That's the book of Isaiah. And then in the book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible also
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.080]   talks about the new heaven and new earth. And we'll get to that in the future. But today we're
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:46.000]   going to understand one of the images of new heaven and new earth that Jesus gave. Uh, it is
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.240]   about wedding, a wedding banquet. All right. Um, I'm sure you have been to a wedding banquet, right?
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.200]   Haven't you? To a wedding banquet, to a wedding feast, uh, go to a ceremony and all that. And
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.880]   Jesus has something to say about it. So there are three points I want to cover today. It's the
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:16.480]   importance of the banquet in Jewish wedding, especially. And the second point I have is the
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.640]   invitation to the, to the wedding banquet. And then the third one, how do we prepare to be part of
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.520]   the wedding banquet in heaven? The first thing is the background. We need to understand how
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:37.600]   important this for the Jewish people in Jesus' days, how they see, uh, the Jewish, uh, wedding,
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:46.480]   you know, uh, the entire, uh, Jewish wedding and marriage custom can be understood in three stages.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:55.840]   The first stage is, uh, what we call the arrangement. Now in the, uh, in the old days,
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:02.960]   in, in the first century, uh, people would have their marriage arranged when they were about,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.600]   for guys, uh, about 17, 18 years old. They're going to build a family together. And girls
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.880]   probably would get married about 14, 15 earliest. So it's pretty, pretty, uh, early compared to our
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.040]   modern, modern lifestyle. Uh, well, when you are 17, 18 year old, you know, you're building a family,
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.680]   you're an adult, right? Today is kind of different, right? You know, men who are probably 50 years
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:37.920]   old, they're still adolescent. Uh, they're still teenagers. Uh, today is different, but, uh, in
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.040]   the first century, uh, before you're 20 years old, you're, you're, you're going to get married and,
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.920]   uh, you're going to build a new family. And that is what the, uh, parents of both sides,
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.280]   they will come together and do some arrangement. And the arrangement is very, very serious because
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.920]   in the first century in the Jewish society, marriage is a transaction. It's an economic,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:08.320]   financial transaction, especially for those who are, uh, from the rich families, uh, those who
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:16.160]   are from the priests or the sacred families. Uh, they will, uh, have a lot of terms to lay out,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:23.760]   especially for both sides of the parents. They will come together and talk about money. Now, uh,
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.640]   today, how much do you spend average on a wedding? How much spend on a wedding?
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:38.800]   You remember? How much do you spend on your wedding? Today, probably, uh, I think the low,
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:50.000]   the low end is about maybe 50,000. No? 50,000. Yeah. Uh, something like that. Right? Well, the,
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.320]   the, the sky is a ceiling. Uh, it's a lot of money. So in the old days as well, when they talk
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.880]   about marriage, when they talk about wedding, they need to talk about finance and usually, uh,
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.720]   because it was in the patriarchal society, usually you think the man's side going to pay for it or
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:15.920]   the, uh, the, uh, the bride's side going to pay for it. Who's going to pay for it in Jesus day?
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:26.960]   Usually the man's side going to pay for all the major expenses. Right? Now, if, if, if I live in
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.440]   that kind of society, I better not have my son get married. Uh, my daughter is okay. Yeah. Um,
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.640]   so this is the arrangement side. And after they lay out all the terms and then, um, they were
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.200]   going to the second stage, be troval, which is kind of like today's engagement. But in those
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.120]   days it was a little bit more serious. You remember Joseph and Mary, Jesus, father, mother,
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:06:01.840]   Irving, father, mother. Yeah. They were in, in this stage, they were engaged and legally speaking,
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:10.000]   they were already husband and wife. So, uh, so it was kind of tricky when Mary report to Joseph,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.600]   Hey, I got pregnant by the Holy spirit. Uh, it's going to big bomb for, for Joseph. Right? So he
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:20.960]   has to go to the court, uh, probably some local court to get some certification to a divorce.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:27.520]   Right. But he didn't, right. He didn't. Anyways. Uh, so this, this is the second stage and it's
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:35.360]   kind of like today's, uh, engagement and from, uh, our, our first part of this series, I talk,
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:42.160]   I talk about the farewell discourse of Jesus. Remember the book of John chapter 14 to 17,
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:49.680]   there was long passage talking about, uh, recording Jesus' speeches to the disciples. He said,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.360]   I'm going to leave you now, but I'm not going to abandon you because I'm going back to the
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:07:00.720]   father's house to prepare a home for you. And this is what the, uh, the, the groom will do
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:08.480]   in this stage after they were engaged. After they enter into the second stage of betrothal,
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:17.280]   the groom, the man will, will promise the bride, I'm returning to my father's house and by my
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:23.920]   father's house, I will build another house. I will prepare a place for you. And, but I will come back
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:32.240]   usually one year later to take you. I will come back for you. This is the background why Jesus
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:38.480]   was talking, uh, in such terms to his disciples. I'm going to prepare a place in the father's
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.720]   house for you. There were many places for you, but I'm not going to abandon you. I promise you,
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:50.880]   I will come back and we'll take you. And the, and the groom also beside, you know, preparing a place
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:58.800]   in the father's house is to make some deposit, usually in some valuables, maybe a wedding ring,
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:08.880]   maybe, maybe there were some properties, uh, some commodities that would, uh, give the bride
[00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:16.560]   some sort of promise, some sort of security. Um, so, uh, not only building the father's house,
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:24.000]   but also, you know, deposit, depositing some gifts as a security deposit, so-called. Um,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.600]   you remember the farewell discourse. Actually, that's what Jesus did. He said, I'm going away,
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:37.760]   return to my father's house to prepare a place for you. And also there was some other sermons,
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.240]   some other things that Jesus said. If you check one of the key words
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:50.080]   occurring in the farewell discourse in those chapters, one of the key words always pop up
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.840]   is giving. I'm going to give you this, and I'm going to give you that. For example, he said,
[00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:03.920]   I'm going to give you the Holy Spirit and the Holy Spirit, the counselor will be with you.
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.560]   So you will not feel abandoned. God is with you. The Spirit of God will be with you.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:19.040]   In chapter 14, Jesus said, I leave you my peace, peace that I grant and I give to you.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.360]   In this world, you shall have tribulation, remember, but you will have peace.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:32.080]   And that is the background of Jesus' farewell discourse. That is the second stage.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:37.760]   And the third stage of the wedding custom is about one year later, the house is ready,
[00:09:37.760 --> 00:09:45.920]   and the groom will go to the bride's village and to take the bride. And of course, in this stage,
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:52.320]   wedding, wedding ceremony, and then of course, come to the conclusion in the banquet,
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:10:01.360]   the focus is on the couple, right? Focus is always on the couple. Actually today as well,
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.480]   you know, some weeks ago, I was officiating a wedding for a couple, a lovely couple. And
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.840]   we were about to start because everybody gets so, you know, so, so, so,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:24.480]   they want to make sure their wedding, wedding service and wedding program goes well, right?
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.720]   So everyone is so tight. Everyone is talking about, okay, we have to do this,
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.440]   we don't get it wrong and make sure the order of service is correct, right? And I was,
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:40.640]   I was staying there and a couple of photographers, I'm sure they're not very experienced,
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:49.280]   new young people doing photography for the wedding. And they come to me and say,
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:56.000]   because I'm the officiant, right? And the girl said, "Hey Pastor, your shirt has some wrinkles.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.800]   That is not right. Yeah, can you cover it or something like that?" Right? And you know,
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:09.280]   as an experienced pastor, you know, I officiate a lot of weddings. I, you know, I gently remind her,
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:17.360]   I said, "Nobody would pay attention to me because everyone's attention is on the couple, right?"
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:23.200]   So lo and behold, after the wedding, you know, I got all the photos, right? I got all the pictures,
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:28.480]   very beautiful pictures on the bride and the groom. None of the picture has me on it.
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.560]   Nobody actually pay attention to the pastor, you know, but that's okay. I officiate it.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:45.360]   So everyone focus is on the couple. It was so in Jesus' day, but of course the,
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   when the groom going to take the bride to his home, there was a big processional going on,
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.280]   right? All the people and all the bridesmaid and all the groomsmen, all the relatives and friends,
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:11.120]   they were in the processional. And when the bride and the groom about to enter, return to home,
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:19.520]   in their hometown, in their home village, they will have an other team of bridesmaid coming out
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:26.880]   to meet them, right? Remember the parable of 10 virgins? That's what happened. The 10 virgins,
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:35.680]   they prepare oil and they oil them and they were about to receive the new couple into their home
[00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:41.840]   and they will enter into the big banquet hall and there will be a big celebration.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:54.000]   And in this stage, the last stage, probably, the banquet stage and the host family will prepare
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:03.760]   all the food and all the wine and all of the items that is needed to give honor to the new couple.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:11.840]   That is the background of John 2. Remember the miracle of Jesus turning water into wine,
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:21.600]   right? That is not some magical thing that Jesus did. When they were running out of wine,
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:31.200]   in those days, as in today, in those days, it was a big social shame. And Jesus did that miracle,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:37.120]   turning water into wine is to save them from social shame. He displayed His glory,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:44.480]   at least in the sense that would give the host family the social honor that is needed.
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:49.520]   But remember that miracle is only the first miracle recorded in the gospel of John,
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:56.320]   right? First of the seven. And remember what John says? Something along that line of,
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:03.040]   you know, this is the first miracle, but it is a pointer to something more glorious coming.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:08.800]   And the gospel of John is the second part. It's the most glorious of all miracles.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:19.440]   It's Jesus dying on the cross, feeling no shame, but glory, glory and honor from God,
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:27.280]   because He loves us so much. He was willing to die. And that is the most glorious moment
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:33.360]   in the gospel of John. But you remember the, if you keep that in mind, the cultural background,
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:38.240]   the context, you understand what is going on, right? It's not an isolated story.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:48.480]   For those who are invited to the banquet, they had already RSVP. They were already invited.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:54.800]   They got the invitation. And as I said, the host family will prepare everything that is ready
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:02.560]   for all the guests to come. And of course, if we enter into the banquet, if we go to the banquet,
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:06.960]   what do we need to do? What do you need to do when you go to a wedding banquet?
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:16.000]   You need to bring some money, right? You better bring some money, right? Some gift money, right?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.800]   Because this is a social honor, right? You don't go there empty-handed, empty stomach,
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:26.160]   and then you devour the food and then you leave. No, that's not how you, that's not how it goes,
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:35.040]   right? You need to bring some gifts, some monetary gift so that you can honor the host family, the
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:44.480]   couple. Without doing that, it will be a dishonor. It will be a shame. And of course, on top of that,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:53.280]   if you are invited and you RSVP and you miss the meeting, you did not show up, this is a shame to
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   the host family. It's pretty much what we experience today, right? But with a, you know, a bigger
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:09.680]   magnitude in those days, in Jesus' day. So the wedding banquet is very, very important. That is
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:18.880]   the conclusion of the entire custom. You got to do a big banquet at the end. Because this is so
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.280]   important in Jesus' day in their culture. That's why Jesus picked on some of the images to describe
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:32.880]   the future kingdom, the future heavenly home. When we go there, when we're looking forward to go
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:41.760]   there, Jesus said, it's kind of like, very much like a heavenly banquet. I'm sure you've been to
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:51.760]   a wedding banquet. Multiply it infinitely. That is the glory of the future heavenly banquet.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:17:00.320]   And Jesus used this image or the New Testament Bible uses many of this wedding banquet images
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:06.080]   to describe our future home. And one of the passages today, we're going to read that quickly,
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.720]   is talking about the invitation to the wedding banquet. Matthew 22. Let me read that.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:18.400]   Jesus also told them other parables. He said, "The kingdom of heaven can be illustrated
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:24.720]   by a story. A story of a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:33.360]   When the banquet was ready, he sent out his servants to notify those who were invited,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.480]   but they all refused to come. So he sent other servants to tell them, "The feast has been
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:46.640]   prepared. The bulls and the feline cattle has been killed. They are ready. Everything is ready. Come
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:54.560]   to the banquet." Now what is going on here? This story parable talking about the king preparing a
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:18:05.040]   banquet for his people. Those who are invited, they should have the royal honor to attend. And
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:11.600]   they have already RSVP, right? They reply to the email or click the link, you know, "I'm going to
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:19.360]   come." Right? "Come in." And all that. But it's very strange. These sort of people, they are not
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:25.440]   willing to come. They are not willing to attend. Now in those days, in the ancient days, there was
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:34.160]   no refrigerator. Once you cook something, you got to consume it. Right? You have to have it.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:42.640]   You got to finish it. Because you can't put it back into the fridge and then bring it out again
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:47.760]   next day or two and then put it in the microwave. No, you can't do that in the ancient Palestinian
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:57.040]   society. So you have to consume it. That's why the king prepare everything for the banquet and
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:02.640]   quickly send out his servants to the nearby neighborhood and say, "Hey, come on. Guys,
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:10.000]   this is ready. And you need to come right now." Usually it happen in the evening, at night.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:16.320]   Now pay attention to who are being invited here. Who have RSVP here?
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:27.840]   It says those who are already invited. To notify those who were invited, RSVP, right?
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:34.000]   It's very strange. They promised to come, but they never come. They're not willing to come.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:39.440]   What are the excuses do they have?
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:48.240]   The story continues. It just said, but the guest, he had invited, he had RSVP,
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:55.520]   ignored them and went their own way. One to his farm, another to his business. Other people,
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:20:01.680]   other guests, seized the servants, the messengers, and insulted them and killed them.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:12.160]   So the king sent out another team of servants and trying to urge them, "Come now. This is the
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:20.000]   moment. You accept the invitation. You need to show up." The excuses are two. One's going to the
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:28.160]   field, to farm. The other one's going to do his business or do some trading. And these two excuses
[00:20:28.160 --> 00:20:34.000]   are lame excuses. You know why? Because I told you some of the background. The banquet happens
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:43.680]   at what time of the day? In the evening. At night, right? You never go to, even today, you never go
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:52.400]   to a wedding banquet in the morning, right? Usually it's at night. At night, there's no opportunity
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:21:00.720]   that you have to go to your farm, right? There's no way you can do some trading, right? We work
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:08.080]   nine to five. It's after five, right? There's no way you can do all these things and excuse yourself
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:19.200]   from attending the royal banquet. The excuses reveals their idols, and the idols is in their
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   heart. Essentially what they're saying is, "The banquet is not important. It's not worth it.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:36.800]   I'm going back to my work. I'm going back to my farm." You understand when we are confronted
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:47.120]   with the heavenly invitation, when the invitation is sent to you by God, usually our excuses
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:59.440]   reveal our priority. What's most important? What is worthy in your mind? It is always revealed when
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:06.560]   we try to respond to the invitation of the kingdom. When the gospel is presented to you,
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:14.480]   you can think of a lot of different ways, excuses, or reasons to reject or refuse it.
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:23.280]   But you need to understand in the Bible, those excuses, those reasons, are usually indicators
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:31.920]   of what is truly your God. What is God to you? What is most important to you? Now I admit to
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:45.440]   all of you, myself included, we are all idols, manufacturers. Remember, I think 400 years ago,
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:51.200]   I think 400 years ago, 400 or 500 years ago, there was a reformed theologian called John Calvin.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:59.040]   John Calvin describes human nature, human beings, as idol manufacturers.
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:06.960]   We manufacture our own idols. We create our own idols. And we put idols on our exotic place,
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:14.240]   and we worship it. And we spend all of our time consuming our energy. And that is your God. That
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:24.160]   is your idol. When I prepared this sermon, I was reminded of some of the books that I read from
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:31.360]   an atheist called John Paul Sartre. John Paul Sartre was a French existentialist.
[00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:41.120]   Now what does it mean? Existentialism, simply put, means I want to do whatever I want.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:49.360]   My freedom is not, there's no boundary. There's no accountability in my freedom. That is the true
[00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:57.200]   freedom that I have. And John Paul Sartre was saying that. And many of his novels talk about
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:24:08.480]   the death of God. That God is dead. You know, we don't have to regard God as anything, anyone
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:14.960]   worthy in our life. You just erase it from your life. You know, reject him from your life. And
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:25.520]   John Paul Sartre said, "Belief in God makes my morality impossible." My morality of existentialism.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:33.520]   I want to be free. I don't want to be kept accountable. If God exists, He will keep me
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:39.520]   accountable. That's why if I believe in God, it will make my morality impossible, Sartre said.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:49.120]   To which a Dutch theologian replied, "Sartre's morality makes the non-existence of God a necessity."
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:25:00.080]   It is a necessity for an atheist, for an existentialist, that God does not exist.
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:06.640]   It's not because it has been proven that God does not exist. That is not the conclusion,
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:12.000]   not the last part of the equation. That the non-existence of God, that God does not exist,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.800]   God is absent, is my presupposition, not my conclusion. It is my worldview. It's my own
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:30.000]   belief that will etch out God. That is a necessity. I have to etch out God so that I can have my own
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:37.600]   life. That is what atheism in his version. Now think about it, this is not just philosophy.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:44.720]   That is essentially what Jesus said in the parable. Those people who have RSVP, they reject
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:53.200]   to attend the banquet. It's not because they cannot attend the banquet. Essentially they will not.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:03.760]   It's not because we cannot come to the kingdom. Standing in front of the foot of the cross,
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:12.320]   at the foot of the cross, it's not because we cannot accept the invitation.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:24.560]   The invitation of love and grace is not the ability. It is our will. Whether you will come
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:31.440]   or not. Now it's explained in the first part. In the ancient society, in Jewish society in Jesus'
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:40.160]   day, being invited and RSVP and you are willing, you are not willing to show up, that is an insult
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:49.200]   to the host family. Remember Jesus' parable? It's not just one guy, any dude trying to create or
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:56.640]   set up a banquet. It's not a certain dude on the street. It's the king. The king is preparing a
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:03.520]   banquet for his son. Because his son is getting married. You follow that line, you understand
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:10.800]   what the big deal about this banquet. It's the king's son's marriage, wedding banquet.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:18.960]   Now the son is getting married, that means the son will inherit the kingdom. He will have the
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:26.640]   kingship. The son is getting married, he will be the king of the kingdom. Not showing up
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:38.720]   does not mean social shame alone. It means treason. It means rejecting the kingship.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:49.440]   That is treason. 22.7. The parable goes on. The king was furious and he sent out his army
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.960]   to destroy the murderers and burn their town. And he said to his servants, the wedding feast is ready
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.080]   and the guests I have invited are not worthy of the honor. So go out to the street corners and
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:07.920]   invite everyone you see. So the servant did that and they find everyone they could find, good or
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:17.120]   bad alike and the banquet hall was filled with all the people. Now why Jesus told this parable at this
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:22.000]   point? If you understand context, as we read the Bible, we have to understand context, right? It's
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:27.920]   not to isolate the story. This is chapter 22. What happened in the previous chapter, chapter 21?
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:39.440]   Jesus riding on the donkey entered Jerusalem as a humble king, as the loving king. Matthew 21.
[00:28:39.440 --> 00:28:49.760]   He is the king. He is riding the donkey entering the holy city. He is the true king. So he went
[00:28:49.760 --> 00:28:56.000]   into Jerusalem and he cleansed the temple and there were so many debates and controversies between
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:06.960]   Jesus and the authorities of Jerusalem, the Jewish people. This parable is ironic because this
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:16.320]   parable is trying to condense the entire Old Testament story into 10 verses. What happened
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:23.520]   in the entire Old Testament story, Jesus said, is that the king has already, has been inviting
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:34.640]   his people to come to his feast to enjoy the time together, to enjoy his food. But his people have
[00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:42.720]   been refusing to come and kill all the servants and those of the Old Testament prophets,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:49.440]   from the first one to the last one, John the Baptist, they killed them all because they are
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:58.240]   not willing to honor the son's kingship. And finally they killed the son and crucified him
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:06.000]   in Jerusalem. Now this is the last week of Jesus' early earthly life. This parable is trying to
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.280]   tell us the entire Old Testament story and it ends really bad because in AD 70,
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:25.120]   the Romans did come and they came to destroy the temple, Jerusalem. And the temple crumbles
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:33.520]   and the people scattered. Jesus is trying to tell us the entire Old Testament story, God and his
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:40.240]   people. And because they refused, because they reject the gospel invitation, now the door is
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:46.880]   open to other people. Who are they? The Gentiles, right? The Gentiles would come.
[00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:52.720]   All the nations will come because of Jesus, because of the grace.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:59.760]   Then they come to the banquet. That is the invitation. If you reject it,
[00:30:59.760 --> 00:31:07.520]   not because you can or cannot accept it, because you will not accept it,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:14.960]   the consequences are there. AD 70. That's what happened to the Jewish people.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:22.960]   Now the parable could have ended at this point, verse 10. But Jesus continues. Now this is very
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:29.360]   interesting because you find similar parables from other books of gospels. But Jesus put on
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:38.640]   a twist here. He continued with verse 11 and he talks about how do we prepare to go into the
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:45.280]   banquet, to be part of this banquet. Verses 11 and following. But when the king came in to meet
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:52.320]   the guest, he noticed a man, there was a dude who was not wearing the proper clothing for the wedding.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:59.680]   He asked, "Friend, how is it that you are here without the wedding clothes?" But the man had no
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:07.760]   reply. Then the king said to his servants, "Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:15.120]   darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. For many are called, but few are chosen."
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:24.240]   Now I've talked about the wedding banquet. Usually it lasts for almost seven days. Can you believe
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:30.560]   that? If you have a wedding banquet in the Jewish society on Jesus' day, you have to host a banquet
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:40.000]   seven days. This is crazy. I attended one of my friend's wedding. The groom is from the Vietnam
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:49.440]   family background. They did host for 10 days. It's quite a bit of food. A lot of guests coming in
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:57.920]   and out, in and out. But when you attend a banquet, what do you need to do in terms of preparation?
[00:32:58.880 --> 00:33:04.000]   At least you need to dress up a little bit, right? You can't just go with a fit flop, right?
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:11.280]   That would be a dishonor to the guests. It's the same way in Jesus' day. They need to dress up.
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:18.080]   Now there are different interpretations of why this dude without the proper clothing.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:28.800]   Perhaps one of the most convincing arguments is that the point is not how he ended up this
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:38.160]   way. The point is what his clothing, the proper wedding clothing symbolize. What does it mean?
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:48.640]   Now you flip the pages of the New Testament. You'll find proper clothing to enter the kingdom
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:34:02.000]   is the robe of righteousness, the white robe that is provided by Jesus. He died on the cross. He
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:09.200]   sacrificed himself. He redeemed you. And so to speak, you have a new cloth on you. God is not
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:16.800]   looking at you. If you are in Christ, if you believe the gospel, God is no longer looking at
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:25.360]   you, you know, in your filthy way. You're not a sinner anymore. God look at you just as he looks
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:34.720]   at his own son, his perfect holy son, Jesus Christ. That is what we call justification by faith, right?
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   Justify fully righteous standing in front of God. That is probably what the wedding
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:53.760]   cloth is all about. In any case, this parable add a twist at the end that you have believed in Christ.
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:35:04.080]   You supposed to be sitting in the banquet, but you are not with proper clothing.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:09.280]   That means your relationship with God is a little bit shaky.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:18.160]   Maybe you really don't know Christ. You have not really accepted him as your Lord and your Savior.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:27.760]   Now there are phrases like outer darkness, you know, gnashing and weeping.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:36.880]   Now, what does it mean? If you turn to other passages in the gospel of Matthew, you would
[00:35:36.880 --> 00:35:45.200]   not be surprised. Same phrases are being used as so often in the context of going into entering to
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:52.400]   future kingdom. And you find those places, you understand Jesus is saying,
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:59.840]   I don't really know you. Who are you? You go out to the outer darkness.
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:10.720]   Gnashing of teeth, right? Weeping. You are not going into my banquet because you do not know me.
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:19.600]   You have not really put in your faith in me. Now this parable ends with this twist.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:27.440]   It's a great reminder for you and me that we come to the church and we even think that
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:35.040]   we are sons and daughters of the King. Are we really? Right? Are we really?
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:43.520]   In the gospel of Matthew, it talks about believing in Christ is much more than lip service
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:54.080]   in the Word of God. To listen and to walk, right? Of course, God is not looking for a perfect man or
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:37:01.440]   woman. We can never be perfect in this life. In this side of heaven, we cannot be fully sanctified,
[00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:07.680]   100% sanctified, right? We are clothed by Christ's righteousness. That's why we can enter
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:15.120]   into kingdom. But foundationally, in the bottom of your heart, you have this inclination,
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:23.760]   the willingness to say to God, yes, you are my Lord. I come before you constantly, regularly.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:32.400]   I want to turn my life to you. I want to obey you. Yeah, help me. Help me. That is your most
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:37.840]   fundamental change when you come to Christ. And that is the robe of righteousness. That is what
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:44.720]   this parable is all about. You see in the banquet, you better be making sure that you are part of the
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:56.560]   honored guest, properly clothed. The future kingdom is like a banquet. If we refuse the invitation,
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:05.280]   it's essential, it's essentially, it's like you can try it. Stand at the foot of the cross
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:12.160]   and you look at the cross. Jesus sacrificed himself and shed his blood for you.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   That you are unworthy. You don't deserve it. But you stand in front of the foot of the cross.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:26.800]   You're saying to the Jesus who died for you on the cross, you said you're not worth it.
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:36.640]   Come on. You know, I don't care. This is essentially what the refusal of the kingdom
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:46.880]   is like. How can we turn away such a great salvation, such a great, wonderful grace, right?
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:54.160]   The parable reminds us we better be sure right now, right? It has been said that
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:02.960]   there will be three wonders when you go to heaven. Three wonders when you step into heaven,
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.320]   you know, the new world, the new heaven and new earth. The first wonder is that
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:19.120]   you will see many in the kingdom whom you did not expect to see. You step into the kingdom, hey,
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:27.600]   why are they here? I didn't expect that. But they were here indeed because of the grace of God.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:36.960]   That's the first wonder. The second wonder is that you do not find many whom you expect to see.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:45.760]   I thought they should be here, but they're not here. Why? Because essentially they rejected the
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:57.120]   king. That's the second wonder. The third wonder is the greatest wonder of all. When I step into
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:09.040]   the kingdom, the greatest wonder should be I find myself there with my robe of righteousness,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:17.680]   credited to me because of what Christ has done for me and knowing I don't deserve.
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:28.080]   And that is the greatest wonder. And friends, I want to end this note just as Jesus ended.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   The invitation is out there. You are our SVP. You are our SVP by your faith in Christ.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:46.800]   Make Jesus Christ your Lord today. Make him your leader, the leader of your life.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:59.200]   Bow before him and say, "My heart is right here. Please be my Lord. Guide me and help me listen to
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:08.800]   you. Help me obey you." We're going to end today with a chameleon. We'll do it once a month.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:15.920]   And we'll put it right at the end today. And there's a long tradition in the church that
[00:41:15.920 --> 00:41:26.160]   chameleon is a foretaste of the future heavenly banquet. And let us pray and prepare our hearts.
[00:41:26.160 --> 00:41:33.120]   This is a foretaste. It's like an appetizer. The future kingdom, the banquet, the perfect,
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:44.800]   glorious banquet is ready for us. Take it. Let's all pray. Lord Jesus, we ask that you will make us
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:55.760]   one as your church until the final victory of the second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:04.240]   We want to give you thanks because we are invited. We can be at your table. We can feast at your
[00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:11.200]   banquet table. All honor and glory to you. And once again, we pray that
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:20.640]   that Jesus Christ, our Lord, will be the Lord of all. He is the one
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:26.640]   who has the lordship over everything in our lives.
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:36.720]   We're going to school, but our school life is under your lordship. Please help us to do so,
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:44.240]   to glorify you. Our family, our marriage, our church, our ministry, everything, our career.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:53.680]   You are the Lord. You are the Lord of all. And I pray that today we'll accept this invitation
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:43:02.880]   to taste, to foretaste of your glorious, heavenly banquet. Thank you for the invitation.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:10.160]   And we're going to accept it with our will. In faith, we put our trust in our dependence
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:17.600]   on our Lord Jesus Christ. All glory to you in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:25.600]   We have a communion table back there. If you're ready to take this foretaste, the appetizer
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:31.840]   of the future banquet, you can go ahead and go to the table and get the packet.
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:35.840]   And we're going to partake together.
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:42.800]   So,
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   so,
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   so,
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.720]   so,
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:16.720]   so,
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:29.680]   so,
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:36.080]   but this is the foretaste of the kingdom, the kingdom banquet. Let's partake the bread together.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:49.120]   And the cup as well.
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:57.680]   Let's pray a final time. Father, once again, we give you thanks because of the great love that
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:04.480]   you have for us. We are standing at the foot of the cross and we are amazed and wonder by your love.
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:14.800]   Thank you for accepting us. Thank you for, for, for your righteousness, that we are fully justified
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:21.520]   because of what your son has done for us. And thank you for this hope of future banquet.
[00:45:21.520 --> 00:45:30.240]   And I pray that our life will turn to you, will obey you, will listen to your word.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:39.280]   In Christ name we pray. Well, God bless you all and grant you peace in this Labor Day weekend.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:44.480]   Right? Yeah. Thank you for coming. And I hope to see you next week. And we're going to have some
[00:45:44.480 --> 00:45:51.120]   normal Bible study. We're going to have some fun as a fellowship. Okay. You're invited,
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:55.840]   right? But you have to pay for it, pay for your own. We're going to barbecue next.
