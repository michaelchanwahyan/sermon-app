[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Hey everyone, how's it going?
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   How's it going?
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Good?
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Alright, why don't we say hi to our neighbors?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   And I want to thank Patrick for doing the announcement.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   We want more people to be part of it.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   And let's go around, look around and see your neighbor and say hi, okay?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   (Translated)
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Okay, we'll give her a high five or something.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   (Translated)
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Okay.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Alright, so good to see you all.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And perhaps you have been to church for years, for many, many years,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   and perhaps you are new to the church.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   And from time to time we need to make sure we understand what church is all about.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   (Translated)
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   So last week I was in Toronto and Montreal for a few days.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   And I paid a ticket to visit a church.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   And this is a 200 years old church, and a historic church called the Church of Notre Dame in Montreal.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   And it was a beautiful church, beautiful.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And it's just a wonderful place to be.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And I spent some time there and I was totally taken by all the stained glass and Gothic style building.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   And it was a beautiful church.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   (Translated)
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So, you know, as you can see, if I can do it on PowerPoint,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   and I was in the church, in this church, and I spent some time there and I asked the question,
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   "What is a church?"
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And what is the church all about?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   And to many people, to many of us, sometimes we got messed up
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   because we, sometimes we believe that the church is a place that we go to.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   And that's why I want to ask the question, you know, "What is the church?"
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   You know, even though there's some truth to we go to church today, but what is the church?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   (Translated)
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   So, this is a beautiful church, right?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   (Translated)
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And, but, you know, there's also a huge misunderstanding what the church is all about.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And, you know, the Bible says the church is not a place, the church is not a building.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   And we have to ask, "What is the church in the Bible?"
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   (Translated)
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   In fact, the church is us, the people, the people of God.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   (Translated)
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So today, in this message, I want to emphasize three basic points in this sermon.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And the three basic points is all about how do we become the church.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   (Translated)
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   And the first point is we are all sinners.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   (Translated)
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And we have been reading the book of Acts this year,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   and it's clear from the book that the church is not a group of perfect people.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   (Translated)
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   And you remember in chapter 2 of the book of Acts, Peter preached the first sermon,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   and he pointed out that we are all sinners, and we sin against God,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   and Jesus died on the cross for our sins, and He rose from the dead for all of us.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   (Translated)
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And then the people listened to Peter's first sermon, and their hearts were cut,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and they felt that they need to respond, and they asked Peter what they should do.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   (Translated)
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And then, you know, the people were being said that, Peter said,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   "Repent and be baptized, and every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of sins, of your sins."
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   (Translated)
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   And these are very bold statements, okay? And they confront us with two statements of truth.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   (Translated)
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   The first one is we are all sinners, and the second one is only Jesus can save us.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   (Translated)
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Now, you have to understand, the church, even our church, is not a museum of saints.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   The church is home for real people, and we have real problems, okay? We have real brokenness.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   And we're not here because we got it all together, but because we know we can.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   (Translated)
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Now, imagine a hospital. Imagine a hospital. Have you been to a hospital?
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   That might not be a good thing, but, you know, the hospital is full of sick people,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   and they want to get well, but, you know, the hospital is not for healthy people.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   The church is kind of like a hospital.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   (Translated)
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And we are all forgiven, and we are all healed by the grace of God,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   because of what Jesus has done for us on the cross.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And the one, the one condemned on the cross, Jesus himself, should have been you and me,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   because we are sinners.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   (Translated)
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   And the good news is, God healed all of our sins on Jesus on the cross, and all of our sins are crucified.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   (Translated)
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Now, the Bible is really clear on this.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   The Bible, God loves us and sends his son to die on the cross, so that your sins,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   every bit of your sin, will be forgiven.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   (Translated)
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So, that's the first truth, is that we are all sinners, we are all broken people.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   And the second is, we are saved by the grace of God.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   (Translated)
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And this second truth, we have to note that, you know, many people think that,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   "Okay, only if we try, only if I try harder, if I do more good things than bad things, then I'll be okay."
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   (Translated)
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Now, the truth is, you know, sin is not a scale of balance.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   It's a debt that we cannot pay, and even one sin makes us guilty before a holy, sinless, holy, infinite God.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   (Translated)
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Now, imagine an ocean, okay, endless ocean.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And you are in the sea, and the waves are high, and the current is very, very strong.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And you have no strength left, and there's no land in sight.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   You are right in the middle of the ocean, and you cannot swim back, and you cannot save yourself.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   (Translated)
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Now, in this kind of situation, what you need is someone else, someone else to rescue you.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Now, sin is like that. Sin is like an ocean. It's like an endless ocean.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   It pulls us away from God, from the land.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And there's no amount of effort, good deeds, or good religion, or self-improvement can bring us back to the shore.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Now, without a rescuer, we will drown to death.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   (Translated)
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   In the book of Romans, chapter 3 here, it says,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   "This righteousness, the righteousness from God, comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe."
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And there is no difference, for all of us have sinned, and we fall short of the glory of God.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   (Translated)
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Now, we often have a misunderstanding here. We always think that what the Bible is all about,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   and we think that the Bible is to tell us to be a better person.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   In fact, the Bible never does that. The Bible never tells you to become a better person.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   The Bible is not a self-help moral book.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   (Translated)
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Okay, say it with me. The Bible is never a self-improvement book. All right?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   The Bible is never a self-improvement book, so that we can do better,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   and we can reach out to this holy and infinite God.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   (Translated)
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   The Bible, though, tells us that we can never be good enough,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   and we may be better than someone else.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   You know, look around your neighbor, and you may be better than your neighbor in some sense.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   The Bible never tells us that. Okay?
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Or you may say, you know, look at that person, look at this person.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   You know, he's worse than me, and I'm glad I'm better.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   (Translated)
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   The fact is, the Bible tells us we are all sinners. We fall short of the glory of God.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   And we don't stand righteous before God.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   And we stand, all of us, we stand condemned in the presence of God.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   (Translated)
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Now, we can never be good enough to meet God's standard,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   and we cannot be good enough to stand in front of God.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Now, that is true, and that is also bad news, right?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   (Translated)
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It seems like drowning in the ocean, and there's no land inside,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   and you can't reach the shore on your own.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   (Translated)
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   So we have to ask the question, what can we do as sinners in front of God?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   What can we do when we cannot save ourselves?
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   (Translated)
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Now, that's all the bad news, but the good news comes from the Bible.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   It says, "God came to save us."
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   God came to save us. Not we can save ourselves, but God came to save us,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   and we are all saved by the grace of God alone.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   (Translated)
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   So the third point here is that only Jesus can save us.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   (Translated)
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Now, in chapter 4 of the book of Acts, if you remember, or if you go back and check,
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   the religious leaders in Jerusalem, they crucify Jesus on the cross,
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   and they confront Peter about Peter's right to preach the gospel.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   (Translated)
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   And Peter responds by saying this verse in chapter 4, verse 12.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   It says, "Salvation is found in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   given to mankind by which we must be saved."
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   (Translated)
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Now, why only Jesus can save?
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   (Translated)
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Because Jesus is the only one who lives a perfect and sinless life.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   (Translated)
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And Jesus is the only one who died as a substitute for our sins.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   (Translated)
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   And third, Jesus is the only one who rose from the dead and defeated death for all of us.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   (Translated)
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   Think about it. You know, there's no, there's none.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   There's no leader in the world, in history.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   There's no political leader or no philosophy.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   No self-effort can deal with our sin.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   (Translated)
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Only Jesus can bridge the holy God, sinless God, and us broken sinners.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   Only He can be the bridge, and only Jesus has the power to forgive
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   and to give us the life of God, the eternal life.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   (Translated)
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   So we have to ask at the end of the sermon is to ask ourselves, "What must we do now?"
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   (Translated)
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   What must you do? What must we do?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   The Bible tells us something very simple, but life-changing.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   (Translated)
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   The Bible tells us at least three things.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   First is to repent.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   Which is turning away from our sin, our brokenness, by trusting in God Himself.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   (Translated)
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   So the first step is to repent. Repent from our sin and our brokenness,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   and make a U-turn back to God.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   And secondly is to believe, which is trusting in Jesus Christ Himself,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   alone as our Savior and our Lord.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   (Translated)
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   And be baptized, that's the third step, which is a decoration,
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   a perfect decoration of our faith and our new life in Jesus.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   (Translated)
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Now, I don't know if you have been baptized or not, but you know, what is baptism?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   So often we have some misunderstanding about what baptism is all about.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   We think baptism is a graduation ceremony.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   (Translated)
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And we think that, okay, once we're baptized, we graduate, like graduating from school,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   and we don't have to go back, and we upgrade or something.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   (Translated)
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Baptism, no, it's not like that. Baptism is not like graduation ceremony.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   (Translated)
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Baptism is a perfect decoration of our faith in Jesus.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   (Translated)
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Now, baptism means we say to the world that, yes, I'm a sinner, I'm broken,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   but I have experienced the grace of God, and by the grace of God, I stand righteous before God.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   (Translated)
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   When you believe in Jesus, your sins are forgiven, and we are given the new life, the eternal life.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   (Translated)
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   And sometimes the Bible, especially the book of Acts, describes the eternal life as the gift of the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   (Translated)
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   And the gift of the Holy Spirit was that it's actually God's own presence in our life,
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   and God is living with you, living in you.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   (Translated)
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Now, my final question is, if you have made Jesus your Savior and Lord,
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   you have accepted Jesus as your Lord, and it is time for you to restart your life, restart your commitment.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   (Translated)
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   If you have never done that, and now is the time to turn to Jesus.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   (Translated)
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And on my last slide, there's a very simple prayer, and I hope that we can restart our life by trusting in Jesus.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   (Translated)
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And it's a very simple prayer.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   It says, "Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner, and I cannot save myself.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   I believe you died for my sins and rose again for me.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   And I now turn from my sin and trust you as my Savior.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Forgive me and help me follow you the rest of my life.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Would that be your prayer today?
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Would that be your prayer?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   And we can pray this prayer and trust in God, trust in Jesus.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   (Translated)
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   If you can, you can pray with your heart.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Or you can pray out loud with me.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Let me read this prayer again.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   I cannot save myself.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   I believe you died for my sins and rose again.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   I turn from my sin and trust you as my Savior.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Please forgive me and help me follow you the rest of my life.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   Amen.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Let's pray.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   Father, you heard our prayer.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   And we want to trust in you.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And thank you for being our Lord and our Savior.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Thank you for dying for our sin on the cross.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   And you rose from the death for all of us.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   And help us to follow you.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Because you are the Lord of our life.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Amen.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   Now, last note I want to give to you is that if you did pray this prayer,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   and you have questions about faith, you have questions about the Bible,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   you know, God, Jesus, you know, please stop by and talk to one of us, one of our staff.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   (Speaking Chinese)
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   Okay, so we have a freshman out there,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   and we want to thank the Brothers and Sisters for preparing that.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   (Speaking Chinese)
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   Please spend some time to get to know one another.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   (Speaking Chinese)
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   Alright, God bless you.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   (Speaking Chinese)
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   (Music)
