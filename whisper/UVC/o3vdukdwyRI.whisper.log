[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   Good morning, UV, it's good to be here.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.040]   Excited to worship with you today
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.040]   and getting the word together.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.600]   And thank you, Jason, for leading us this morning.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.920]   We're gonna be looking in Ephesians chapter two
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.440]   this morning, Ephesians chapter two.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.760]   If you wanna look there, turn there,
[00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.600]   look there in your Bible app.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.840]   We're gonna be looking at the first 10 verses
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.360]   of Ephesians chapter two.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.360]   And we're gonna be talking about our identity
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.480]   and knowing our identity, these verses give us
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.320]   this powerful picture of who we are in Christ.
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.480]   So we're gonna read these verses together
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.960]   and then apply them to our lives
[00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.800]   and specifically what they mean for us in the church
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.320]   as a group of people who share this identity in Christ.
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.160]   So let's read this.
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.000]   We're gonna begin in verse one of Ephesians chapter two.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.600]   And you were dead in the trespasses and sins
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.560]   in which you once walked, following the course
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.720]   of this world, following the prince of the power of the air,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.520]   the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.760]   among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh,
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.920]   carrying out the desires of the body and the mind,
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.040]   and were by nature children of wrath
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.760]   like the rest of mankind.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.280]   But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.240]   with which he loved us, even when we were dead
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.120]   in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.280]   By grace, you have been saved and raised us up with him
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.160]   and seated us with him in the heavenly places
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.760]   in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages,
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.760]   he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.800]   in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.760]   For by grace, you have been saved through faith
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.320]   and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God,
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.480]   not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.280]   For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.920]   for good works, which God prepared beforehand
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.240]   that we should walk in them.
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.800]   Let's pray real briefly.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.680]   God, thank you for your word and for the truth
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.120]   that it has for us.
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.360]   I pray that you would speak to our hearts this morning
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.520]   and make your truth plain and clear
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.160]   and that we would be changed by it.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.480]   I pray that your truth would change our hearts this morning
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.400]   and through that change, it would change our actions.
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.520]   I pray that we would go from this place different
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.560]   than when we came in, in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.960]   All right, so this is probably kind of a familiar passage.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.520]   Maybe you've heard it before, read it before,
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.840]   maybe you've read it many times, I hope so.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.400]   This passage is such a powerful statement
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.040]   of God's grace and of salvation, redemption
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.720]   that we have in Christ and where it comes from.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.640]   And we could spend a lot of time here
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.120]   just talking about that, about the grace of God
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.120]   and what this passage tells us about the grace of God.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.360]   But this morning, we're gonna talk specifically
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.120]   about what this passage on the grace of God
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.880]   tells us about who we are
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.840]   and specifically about who we are in the church.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.440]   And that's important because this letter
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.720]   was written to believers in churches,
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.040]   obviously in a very different time
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.240]   and a different culture than where we are right now,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.000]   but in a lot of other ways, people just like us,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   people who were probably in large cities
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.920]   surrounded by what we might call secularism,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.340]   it was really paganism.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.800]   They were surrounded by idol worship,
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.200]   they were surrounded by people chasing
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.080]   after destructive things in their life,
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.840]   they were surrounded by people who rejected
[00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.680]   the God of the Bible and sought their own happiness
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.000]   and pleasure and fulfillment in all these other things.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.920]   They were surrounded by people who disagreed with them
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.560]   and who mocked their beliefs.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.020]   So in a lot of ways, the experience of these believers
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.440]   was very similar to ours.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.540]   And Paul's writing to them and he's telling them things
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.400]   that are important for them to know
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.660]   and then he's telling them things
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.840]   that are important for them to live out.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.240]   And in the rest of chapter two,
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.200]   he's gonna talk about how important it is
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.960]   for them to live out unity in the church
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.520]   and how Christ has broken down these walls
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.280]   that divide us as human beings
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.200]   and made us into this new family.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.880]   He's gonna go on and talk about that.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.840]   But this is where he starts.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.920]   He doesn't start with unity and with breaking down the walls.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:46.380]   Before he gets to that, he starts with identity.
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:51.140]   And he starts with identity by talking about grace.
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.640]   And that's the most significant thing
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.660]   for us to understand about our identity
[00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:03.660]   is that in Christ, we are given this grace-based identity.
[00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.120]   That's who we are.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.360]   We see it in this passage.
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.860]   There's this exchange from death to life
[00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.440]   that Paul makes really clear.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:19.880]   And notice there are no qualifiers in these verses.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.040]   Every believer who comes into relationship with God
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.920]   has been given this exchange.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:29.320]   Every one of us has been brought
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.240]   from a state of spiritual death
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.900]   into a state of spiritual life.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:40.280]   If you look at the first five verses here of the chapter
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.520]   and summarize them kind of in one sentence,
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.680]   it would be you were, but God, you are.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.280]   That's the theme of what he's saying here.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.240]   He's saying this is who you were.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.320]   Then God intervened in your life.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.640]   Now this is who you are.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:00.240]   You have been changed.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.440]   Your identity has been changed.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:07.240]   And this is not an exchange of function or vocation.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.760]   He's not saying you guys were peasants
[00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.360]   and now you're farmers.
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.980]   You guys were servants and now you're royals.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.700]   He's not talking about a vocational change.
[00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:18.980]   And that's important for us to understand
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:23.980]   because in 21st century, especially in North America,
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.740]   we tend to identify ourselves by our vocation.
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.060]   We think who we are is what we do.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:33.260]   So we think our job is our identity
[00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.640]   or our relationships are our identity
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:40.100]   or some choices that we make in our life are our identity.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.040]   That's not what we're talking about here.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.320]   It's not a change of our vocation or our function.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.880]   It's a change of our essence.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:52.440]   Death to life is a change of essence.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.300]   It's a change of a state of being.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.900]   It's not a change in your job.
[00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:58.460]   And that's what he's talking about.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.740]   He's saying you were something before
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.700]   and God intervened and now you have
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.140]   a completely different essence,
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:09.220]   a completely different identity.
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.380]   And this is the gospel.
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.260]   This is the doctrine of regeneration.
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.180]   This idea that there's this supernatural work of God
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:20.940]   through the Holy Spirit whereby God gives life
[00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.760]   to sinners who had rejected God
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.700]   and were in a state of spiritual death.
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.980]   Our nature is fundamentally changed
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.440]   out of salvation by the grace of God.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.600]   That's what we're being shown here.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:36.820]   And we're further being shown that this exchange
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.980]   is made solely by God on the basis of his grace.
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.980]   We don't do anything to deserve it,
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.140]   to earn it, or to make it happen.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.220]   That's really clear in these verses.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:51.020]   Now, like I said, hopefully we all
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.660]   at least have heard that before
[00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.940]   and thought about it a little bit.
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:58.940]   And I'll be perfectly honest,
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:01.460]   all of us should meditate on that
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.840]   and really reflect on it a lot more,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.660]   myself certainly included,
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:09.500]   because this is really the basis of our relationship with God
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.380]   is the basis of our relationship with one another.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.620]   And so even though we've heard it before,
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.020]   we're like, yeah, I get it.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:15.900]   For by grace are you saved, it's not of works,
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.900]   I know the verse.
[00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.420]   Still, we need to really reflect on that,
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:23.480]   consider it, and let it sink into our hearts
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.760]   and begin to change who we are.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.140]   And that's, I think, what he's trying to communicate,
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.460]   why he's starting with our identity.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.400]   He's telling us our identity
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.440]   is completely based in God's grace.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.800]   It's founded on God's grace.
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.760]   That's where it comes from, that's the source of it.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.660]   It's founded in God's unmerited favor towards us.
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.640]   We're forgiven because of God's grace,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.480]   we're cleansed because of God's grace.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.720]   What Jesus did on the cross,
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:52.920]   the sacrifice on the cross for us.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:56.000]   We're accepted in the family of God because of God's grace.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.400]   We're made like Christ, transformed into his image,
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:00.880]   sanctified as we live out the Christian life
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.220]   and as we follow Jesus,
[00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:05.280]   that process is also because of God's grace.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:08.380]   And that's the essence of what it means
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.320]   to be a follower of Jesus
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.220]   and what it means to be in the church.
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:14.380]   I'll also just say this,
[00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.340]   it's not really where we're headed today,
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.700]   but it's just something important
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.420]   to understand about identity,
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:22.900]   is that the security of your identity
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:26.660]   is only as secure as the source of your identity.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:28.220]   And that's important for us to understand.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.140]   Even as believers, we can place our identity
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:31.420]   in other things.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:32.940]   We can place it in our vocation,
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.380]   we can place it in our relationships,
[00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:35.700]   we can place it in our achievement,
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.980]   our education, our status.
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.400]   We can place it in our financial position,
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:44.020]   we can place it in our class,
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:46.700]   we can put our identity in all types of things.
[00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.580]   And the problem with that is,
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.420]   those things are all earthly, temporal things
[00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.340]   that can change and pass away.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:57.420]   Our relationships can change,
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.980]   people that we love can move or they can age.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.460]   And if our identity is in a relationship,
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.660]   even if it's in our own family,
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.500]   that can be taken away, that can be shaken.
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:11.180]   If our identity is in our job, we can lose our job.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.680]   If our identity is in our possessions and our wealth,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.820]   that can all disappear.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.940]   If our identity is in our ability
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.260]   and the things that we're good at,
[00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:21.680]   that can be changed.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.100]   We may have great beauty
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:28.140]   or we may have great athletic prowess
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:30.620]   or we may have great intelligence,
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.340]   but those things can go away, right?
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:35.820]   Our beauty fades with time
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.900]   and so does our physical strength and vigor.
[00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:44.540]   And our intelligence,
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:46.700]   we can still be outsmarted,
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.540]   we can still make a bad decision.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:52.180]   All those things that we place our identity in
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:54.500]   ultimately end up being insecure.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.200]   And that's why it's so important for us as believers
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.460]   to place our identity in Christ,
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.620]   because Christ is the only source of our identity
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.200]   that's not gonna change
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:03.740]   and it can't be taken away from us
[00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:08.380]   and won't be corrupted or won't disintegrate or diminish.
[00:11:08.380 --> 00:11:11.060]   And so if we have our identity in Christ
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:14.340]   and we lose our job, our identity is still secure.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.540]   If we have our identity in Christ
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.660]   and someone mistreats us in a relationship,
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.660]   our identity is still secure.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.820]   If we have our identity in Christ and we get old,
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.140]   our identity is still secure.
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.300]   And so it's really important for us as believers
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:30.860]   to put our identity in Christ,
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.380]   because the source of our identity
[00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:35.700]   determines the security of our identity.
[00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:38.160]   And that's the only place for us to be.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.660]   But if we're placing our identity in Christ
[00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:45.460]   and understanding his grace,
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:48.820]   it has real significance for the way
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.300]   that we relate to one another, especially in the church.
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.820]   And that's what I want us to consider today
[00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:55.900]   because I think that's really why Paul starts here
[00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.980]   with identity and with grace
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:00.300]   and then moves on towards unity.
[00:12:00.300 --> 00:12:03.340]   So let's think about this.
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:08.340]   First, in Christ we're given this equality of identity.
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:12.720]   We're all equal in the grace that God has given us.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   But not necessarily uniformity of expression,
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:20.420]   and that's important for us to understand.
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:24.140]   In the first few verses here between verse one and three,
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:26.400]   there's a shift in speech from you to we.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.300]   In verse one, Paul is speaking to the Gentile believers
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.820]   in Ephesus and speaking to them as a Jewish person.
[00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:36.620]   That's why he's saying you.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.580]   You were in this condition.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.560]   In verse three, he's being careful to make it clear
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:42.700]   that Jews were also in the same condition
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.800]   of sinfulness, fallenness, and need for Jesus.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:49.340]   As he does this, what Paul's doing
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:51.660]   is he's both acknowledging the distinction
[00:12:51.660 --> 00:12:56.660]   between Jew and Gentile and also erasing
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.220]   the inferiority, superiority dynamic of the distinction.
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.680]   That's important for us to understand.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:09.680]   We're all given this equal identity of grace in Christ.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:15.220]   We have equal worth in the essence of our redemption,
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:19.140]   but we're still different in different ways.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:20.660]   We still have different expressions
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:21.620]   of God's work in our life,
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.020]   and that's okay.
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:24.260]   We still have different cultures.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.300]   We have different ways of doing things.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:30.940]   We have different ways of expressing the gifts
[00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:31.780]   that God's given us.
[00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.580]   We have different gifts,
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.860]   and those are all beautiful things.
[00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.260]   The scripture's really clear about this.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.340]   First Corinthians 12, verses four to seven says this.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:41.740]   Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same spirit.
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:43.740]   There are varieties of service, but the same Lord.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:45.060]   There are varieties of activities,
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:47.980]   but it's the same God who empowers them all and everyone.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.960]   To each is given the manifestation of the spirit
[00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.460]   for the common good.
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:55.980]   That means even though we're equal in Christ,
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.960]   we have this shared identity,
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.660]   our God-given distinctions and diversity are preserved,
[00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.000]   and that's a good thing.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.540]   Our physical differences, our personality, our skills,
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.940]   our talents, our abilities, our spiritual gifts,
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:12.180]   even our cultural background and expressions,
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:15.580]   all those things are preserved and valued in the church,
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.860]   in the community of God's people,
[00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:21.840]   and that affects our relationships, right?
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.960]   When we understand, hey, I've been saved,
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:27.480]   I've been brought into this family by grace.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.120]   My brother or sister,
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:31.480]   they do some things differently than me.
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:32.440]   They have different gifts.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.840]   They have different things that are important to them.
[00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:39.480]   They have different ideas about how we should connect
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.880]   with the community and serve,
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.840]   or what the worship service should look like,
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:46.760]   or whatever it is, but I can value them
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.800]   because they were also brought into this community by grace,
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:54.060]   and they were saved with the same grace that I was,
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:56.480]   and so even though there's a different expression,
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.460]   we share that identity of grace.
[00:15:00.460 --> 00:15:04.140]   There's no inferiority or superiority here,
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:05.820]   and that's clear throughout the New Testament.
[00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.020]   Galatians 3, Paul talks about that.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:12.020]   He says, in verse 27, this is Galatians 3, 27, 28.
[00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:13.740]   For as many as you were baptized into Christ
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:15.500]   have put on Christ, there's neither Jew nor Greek,
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:16.500]   there's neither slave nor free,
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:17.700]   there's no male nor female,
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:22.200]   for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.140]   That's what he's saying.
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.580]   He's not saying that once you come into the church,
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.260]   those things don't exist,
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.620]   that there's no longer Jewish people and Gentile people.
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.740]   Obviously, they still existed as Jews and Gentiles
[00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.220]   in the first century church.
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:36.780]   He's not saying that there were no men and women
[00:15:36.780 --> 00:15:37.620]   in the church.
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:41.020]   Obviously, they still existed as men and women in the church,
[00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:45.360]   but he's saying there's no dynamic of inferiority
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:48.740]   or superiority, that each one of you has equal worth
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:53.620]   and value and redemption and grace through Christ,
[00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:55.260]   and that when we come into the church,
[00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:56.820]   yes, we're still different,
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.840]   and we express that in different ways,
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.180]   we serve God in different ways,
[00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:03.700]   but each one of us has the same identity
[00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:05.500]   of grace and forgiveness.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.860]   Now, obviously, we have to submit our differences
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.080]   to God's word.
[00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:13.620]   Sometimes we have differences of preference
[00:16:13.620 --> 00:16:14.940]   and things like that,
[00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:17.180]   that may be unbiblical,
[00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:18.540]   some of them may be unhealthy,
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:21.140]   so we have to submit those things to God's word.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:24.080]   We have to say, okay, what are the things
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.540]   that are a part of my preferences or my background
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.620]   that maybe I need to let go of,
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.460]   maybe I need to release?
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:36.300]   We need to understand that all of us, as believers,
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:38.220]   are beautiful and broken.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:39.880]   We're redeemed, but we still have sin,
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.540]   we still have brokenness,
[00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:45.140]   and so we have to submit those things to God's word
[00:16:45.140 --> 00:16:48.700]   and lift up the beautiful God-honoring things
[00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:50.140]   in our community of the church
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.460]   and be willing to lay down the broken things
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:53.620]   in the community of the church.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.800]   There are things that we have to say,
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.900]   okay, this is a part of who I am,
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.500]   but it's actually not honoring to God,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.660]   and so I'm gonna lay this down
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:03.800]   for my brothers and sisters in the church,
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.960]   but maybe there's something else
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.900]   that is not a part of who I am
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.540]   that's a part of my brothers and sisters,
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:11.660]   but there's nothing wrong with it,
[00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:13.660]   it's actually a beautiful thing, I can lift that up,
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:15.940]   even though it's unfamiliar to me,
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.660]   it's still something that I can celebrate
[00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:22.340]   because we have the same identity of grace,
[00:17:22.340 --> 00:17:26.100]   we have the same essence of forgiveness,
[00:17:26.100 --> 00:17:31.660]   and those things ultimately, those different expressions,
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.260]   even if they're unfamiliar to us,
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:35.700]   like I said, as long as they're not unbiblical,
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:38.400]   as long as they're not in a violation of God's word,
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:41.440]   those things become adornments to the gospel,
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:43.760]   and the New Testament's clear about that,
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:48.760]   that God desires a host of people
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:51.720]   from every nation, every background,
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.840]   with all different types of skills and talents and abilities
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.200]   and all different types of people
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.600]   to be in his family and to worship him,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:01.840]   and that's really clear in the New Testament,
[00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:05.480]   and so if God wants that, then we can be okay with that too.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.140]   We can say, you know what,
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.300]   my brother and sister,
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.800]   they do it a little bit differently than me,
[00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.700]   have some different ideas than me,
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.760]   but they have the same redemption that I have,
[00:18:17.760 --> 00:18:20.360]   they've been brought into the same family of God
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:22.600]   that I have been,
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:25.360]   and so I can value and love and respect them,
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.440]   and even experience fellowship with them
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.880]   because we have this same redemption in Christ.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.640]   Our grace-filled identity's really important.
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.300]   To our unity.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.540]   We see in verses four to seven
[00:18:41.540 --> 00:18:44.140]   the equality of that redemption in Christ.
[00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:47.660]   That God, being rich in mercy because of the great love
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.700]   with which he loved us even when we were dead
[00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.760]   and our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.900]   And by grace you have been saved and raised us up with him
[00:18:58.900 --> 00:19:01.420]   and seated us with him in the heavenly places
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.740]   in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.960]   he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.400]   in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:12.800]   Everyone in the church who truly knows God
[00:19:12.800 --> 00:19:15.760]   and has relationship with him experiences the same grace.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:20.340]   There's no one who gets like class one salvation,
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:22.880]   there's no first class salvation,
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.960]   an economy class salvation.
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.380]   We all get the same grace,
[00:19:27.380 --> 00:19:30.160]   we all get the same forgiveness,
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:35.160]   we are all accepted and embraced by Jesus in the same way.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.980]   We're all welcomed and valued into the family of God
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:39.900]   in the same way.
[00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:44.940]   We all have equal worth and equal value before Christ.
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:49.940]   And every person in the church matters equally.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.580]   Sometimes that's hard for us to understand
[00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.700]   because we say, well, there's different roles
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:58.660]   and there's different functions in the church.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:01.020]   And so it seems like one role or function
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:02.420]   is more important than the other.
[00:20:02.420 --> 00:20:04.380]   There are different roles and functions in the church,
[00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:06.260]   that's biblical.
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.240]   The Bible lays that out for us
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.620]   and it gives us those things so that the church
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:14.960]   can function well in pursuit of its mission
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:17.340]   of glorifying God, knowing him,
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.640]   and reaching the world, making disciples.
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.540]   So that's something that we should have.
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:27.100]   But we shouldn't misunderstand and think that
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.020]   because there are different roles and different functions,
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.580]   that that means people have different worth
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:33.900]   in the body of Christ.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.000]   It's not true at all.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.620]   Just because someone is a part of serving in the church
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.500]   or because they stand on the stage,
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.340]   doesn't mean they have more worth.
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.020]   They don't have more worth in God's eyes,
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.340]   they don't have, like I said,
[00:20:49.340 --> 00:20:52.320]   they don't have a higher level of salvation.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:54.380]   All of us are given the same grace
[00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:58.500]   and all of us are valued equally before our savior.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.220]   And each one of us matter in the same way.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.860]   And everyone is essential to the body.
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.860]   Again, in 1 Corinthians 12, talking about the unity
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.380]   and the working of the church,
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:11.180]   in verse 20 and 21 it says this,
[00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:13.260]   "As it is, there are many parts, yet one body,
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:16.000]   "that I cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you,
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.780]   "nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:23.380]   Everyone who is a part of the church
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:25.640]   is essential to the body.
[00:21:25.640 --> 00:21:27.440]   Even though the roles are different.
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:31.200]   And I love that illustration that Paul uses
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.140]   of the physical body,
[00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:33.860]   because there are parts of our physical body
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:36.100]   that we think are more important, right?
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.660]   Like we think our hand is more important
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.240]   'cause it does so much stuff.
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.700]   But there are other parts of our body
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.860]   that we may notice much less,
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.260]   but they're essential to the working of our body.
[00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.780]   And that's this illustration in the church.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:52.100]   We can't look at different roles and say,
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:55.340]   this is worth more, this person has more value
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:57.600]   in God's sight, that's not true.
[00:21:57.600 --> 00:21:59.860]   Every one of us is essential to the body.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:04.420]   And in verses four to seven,
[00:22:04.420 --> 00:22:08.940]   we also see as he's talking about what God has done for us,
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:11.860]   he's shown us the immeasurable riches of his grace,
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:15.780]   that that is again given to all of us.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:16.600]   Think about that.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.300]   In the church, all of us are given the same Holy Spirit,
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.360]   all of us have the same access to God relationally.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.260]   Now that doesn't mean we all walk with God in the same way,
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:29.380]   and that doesn't mean that all of us are at the same place
[00:22:29.380 --> 00:22:30.980]   in our walk with God, right?
[00:22:30.980 --> 00:22:32.780]   There is such a thing as spiritual maturity,
[00:22:32.780 --> 00:22:35.740]   and there are people who are walking with God
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.380]   in a deeper way than others.
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.180]   And again, that's biblical.
[00:22:40.180 --> 00:22:42.440]   But we're all given the same access.
[00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:45.260]   We all have the same access to God.
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.940]   We all have the same opportunities to know God.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:51.740]   We all have the same privileges and spiritual riches
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.180]   as children of God.
[00:22:53.180 --> 00:22:55.900]   God doesn't say, well, I'm gonna give some blessings
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.380]   to this person 'cause they're really special,
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:01.900]   but the other believers don't get to have that.
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:06.900]   No, we all have those same privileges as a child of God.
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.700]   We all have those same spiritual riches
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:12.340]   that we have access to.
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.260]   And we all have the same destiny in heaven.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.700]   Bible's clear about that.
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:19.700]   Now, that doesn't mean everything is the same
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:20.860]   in our lives, right?
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:22.420]   And again, that's okay.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.380]   The Bible speaks to that.
[00:23:24.380 --> 00:23:26.580]   We're gonna have different experiences in our life.
[00:23:26.580 --> 00:23:28.380]   We're gonna go through different things.
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:31.620]   Some of us are gonna grow in spiritual maturity
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.200]   at a different rate, and that's okay.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:40.660]   But what we need to understand is that our physical resources
[00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:43.780]   and opportunities and the things that we go through
[00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:48.780]   on this earth do not mean that we matter more
[00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:54.840]   or have more worth in God's eyes.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:57.540]   And that's been a problem in the church
[00:23:57.540 --> 00:23:58.620]   since the beginning, right?
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:00.460]   James talks about it, how we're not supposed
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:04.700]   to show partiality when someone comes into the church
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:07.020]   and we say, oh, this person's wealthy or influential,
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:08.900]   so we're gonna make sure this person
[00:24:08.900 --> 00:24:11.460]   has the first-class experience.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:13.500]   And he says, don't do that, that's wrong.
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.340]   Because that's always been a part of who we are as humans.
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:18.780]   We're tempted to say, well, this person,
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.340]   their physical experience, their life experience
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:23.340]   here on earth, they have more wealth
[00:24:23.340 --> 00:24:25.620]   or they have more influence or there's someone with power
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.740]   or there's someone, so maybe we should treat them
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.220]   like they have more worth in the church as well.
[00:24:31.220 --> 00:24:32.220]   But that's not true.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.580]   And that's what we have to remember.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.860]   It's fine that we have different experiences,
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.940]   that we have different resources,
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.280]   that we're in different places in life.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:44.420]   That's fine.
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.840]   But don't get confused and think that that makes people
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.380]   worth more in the eyes of God, because it's not true.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.620]   What we're seeing in this passage is that in Christ,
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:00.380]   the foundation and the ground of our equality,
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:05.380]   which ultimately results in unity, is one of grace.
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.500]   Verses eight to 10 make that so clear.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.340]   For by grace you've been saved through faith,
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:13.680]   and what you're doing is the gift of God,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:16.160]   not a result of work, so that no one may boast,
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.660]   for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.080]   for good works, which God prepared beforehand
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.280]   that we should walk in them.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:26.520]   None of us have room for pride or to think
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.080]   that we're better than someone else.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:29.580]   That's what he's saying there.
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:34.800]   In the church, this equality of worth that we have
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:37.560]   before Christ comes from grace.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.000]   And that's really important for us to understand.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:44.520]   We live in a world that really wants equality, right?
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:46.160]   It's an important value in our world,
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:47.640]   and people are seeking it.
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:50.480]   Unfortunately, people usually seek it in the wrong ways.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:54.920]   And one of the really backward conceptions
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.360]   that the world has of equality that just doesn't work
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:03.360]   is we're trying to seek after an equality of exaltation.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:08.400]   We're saying, who is the person that has the most,
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:11.520]   and let's try to raise everybody to that level, right?
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.760]   We think that would be fair.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.920]   That's not what the Bible does.
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.640]   The Bible gives us a true equality,
[00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:18.000]   but it's totally different.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   The Bible says, hey, everyone's equal,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:23.840]   but not in exaltation.
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.140]   Everyone's equal in need.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.480]   Everyone's equal in brokenness.
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.360]   The most equal place in the universe
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:34.160]   is the ground at the foot of the cross,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.960]   where we come before Christ, and every one of us,
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.720]   regardless of our background or our family heritage
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.160]   or our culture or our possessions, our wealth,
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.120]   regardless of all of that,
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.880]   every one of us is at the foot of the cross saying,
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:51.920]   I have no hope.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:53.640]   I'm spiritually dead.
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:55.720]   I'm separated from God.
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:56.560]   I'm broken.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:58.720]   I'm in need.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:01.480]   And everything else about me, my money, my background,
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.020]   whatever, can't help me, and I need a savior.
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.700]   And that's the place where we find really true equality,
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:13.080]   because that puts us in a place
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.360]   that is really an antiseptic to our pride.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.140]   It destroys that pride that we have,
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.920]   thinking like, well, I'm better than someone else
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.420]   because I did this or I did that.
[00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:25.380]   No, at the foot of the cross, we did nothing.
[00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:26.920]   We earned nothing.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:29.920]   There's nothing for us to boast in,
[00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.380]   as this passage tells us.
[00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.420]   At the foot of the cross, we can't look at someone else
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:39.260]   and think, well, there's kind of a moral hierarchy here.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.260]   I'm better than them in some way, because we're not.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:46.540]   Even if we're a person who knows Jesus
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.860]   and we're following him and God's at work in our life
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:50.300]   and there's good works coming out of that,
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.060]   because that's what verse 10 says is gonna happen,
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.420]   even if we're that person, we have to say, wait a second.
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:59.800]   Even any good work coming out of my life
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:02.980]   is because of Christ.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.660]   So I don't get to look at anyone else,
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:09.780]   think I'm better than them.
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.580]   There's no room for pride, there's no room for boasting.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:18.260]   Those types of things are poisonous
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:20.620]   to a spirit of equality.
[00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:22.940]   They're poisonous to a spirit of unity.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:26.500]   And that's why Paul is starting with this.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.300]   He's saying, look, if you guys are gonna be unified
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:31.100]   in living out the mission God has for you,
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:34.340]   you gotta understand who you are in Christ
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.500]   and where that comes from.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.180]   It comes from grace.
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.220]   And because of that, you can treat one another
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.820]   like everybody matters just as much as you do,
[00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.580]   because that's the truth.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.500]   And you can treat one another like the only way
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.260]   you got in the door was because of Jesus.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:51.280]   That's the truth.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.400]   No one got in the door because they were wealthy.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.860]   No one got in the door because they were well-connected.
[00:28:56.860 --> 00:28:57.700]   No one got in the door
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.960]   because their family knew somebody.
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.540]   No one got in the door because they were smart.
[00:29:02.540 --> 00:29:04.860]   No one got in the door because they were gifted
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:09.860]   or a celebrity or they were beautiful or none of that.
[00:29:09.860 --> 00:29:15.140]   In the church, we only come in
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:19.940]   because of Jesus and what he did for us
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:21.940]   and because of his grace and the forgiveness
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:24.180]   and acceptance that he offers us.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:29.600]   And that's so important for us.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:33.500]   And so in closing, I want us to just think about that
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.320]   for a minute.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:39.740]   So much of identity is enculturated.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:42.460]   It's as we grow up, it's the water we swim in
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.260]   and we're taught that, right?
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:47.780]   You can, I'm sure, remember instances like that
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:51.260]   from when you were a kid when maybe you had a question
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.580]   about why do we do this?
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:56.740]   And your parents said, "That's what we do, right?
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.480]   "This is who we are.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.560]   "This is why we eat what we eat.
[00:30:00.560 --> 00:30:01.760]   "This is why we go where we go.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:04.220]   "This is why our house looks like this."
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:08.460]   So much about our identity and who we are
[00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:12.340]   is just taught to us as we grow up
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.900]   and then we live it out, right?
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.500]   But think about that in the church
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.160]   and think about that in light of these 10 verses.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:25.700]   If we start to live out this culture
[00:30:25.700 --> 00:30:28.200]   that Paul is pointing us towards here,
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.880]   where our identity is grace-based,
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.660]   where it has, it's nothing to do with our performance
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.420]   or our possessions or anything else.
[00:30:41.420 --> 00:30:43.700]   It's just grace-based.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.860]   What kind of culture does that build, right?
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:48.740]   'Cause in our human cultures,
[00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:51.640]   we can build identities that have beautiful things
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.180]   but also very broken things in our human cultures, right?
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.920]   We see that in our human cultures.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.820]   But Paul is putting in front of us
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:03.180]   something that's, there's no brokenness in it.
[00:31:03.180 --> 00:31:05.660]   This is the grace of God.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:09.520]   And if we built a culture based on this in the church,
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:15.540]   that would be something, that would be truly beautiful
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:19.220]   and would be truly life-giving to people who are in it
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:22.060]   and people who are outside it and would see it
[00:31:22.060 --> 00:31:24.180]   and would wanna be part of it.
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.280]   And it certainly would lead to the type of unity
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.820]   that is discussed later on in this chapter.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.120]   And this is where it starts.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:35.400]   It starts with this identity of knowing
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.680]   that we are here because of God's grace.
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.920]   And because of that, we can have that same grace
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:46.720]   and humility and love and care for everyone else
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:50.220]   that God has put in our church, in our local body
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:52.040]   as we live life together.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.540]   We can treat them with that grace
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.520]   because that's why we're all here.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:32:00.040]   And each one of us has received that from Christ.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.960]   None of us earned it, none of us got it.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.240]   We all were given it by Jesus.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:09.340]   And each one of us got it.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:11.400]   No one got it halfway.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:14.720]   That's who we are, and that's how we can live
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.680]   into our relationships with one another in the church.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.520]   Let's pray.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.200]   God, I thank you for the truth of your grace,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:26.400]   and I thank you for the way that it levels our pride
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:32.440]   and it turns us towards one another with a heart of love.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.580]   And I pray that would be true in our lives, God,
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:40.380]   as we live out what it means to be your followers,
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:45.380]   your church, both in this setting where we come together,
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:48.780]   we gather with one another and we're facing one another,
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:52.060]   but also then tomorrow and through the week
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.840]   as we go out into the world and we face the world.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.780]   God, may we, in both of those places,
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:01.460]   may our identity be grounded in your grace.
[00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:05.420]   May we see that we're only here
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:07.720]   because of what you did for us.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.400]   And that's true of everyone else in the room,
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.240]   and may we really love one another
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.320]   and be unified and care for one another
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.740]   because we see the grace that you've given
[00:33:19.740 --> 00:33:21.020]   to each one of us.
[00:33:21.020 --> 00:33:24.460]   God, we just thank you and praise you for what you've done.
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:26.080]   In Jesus' name, amen.
