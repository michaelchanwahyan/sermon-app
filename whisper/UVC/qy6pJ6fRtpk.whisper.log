[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.880]   Hello everybody.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.260]   God is good.
[00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.260]   And all the time.
[00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.260]   Amen.
[00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.880]   I didn't know if I was going to have to explain that.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.880]   Okay, awesome.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.880]   Sweet.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.840]   So, I want to thank God and I want to thank you guys for having me here, allowing me the
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.960]   opportunity to come before you and just share a message, bring you God's word.
[00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.960]   Today, we'll be in James chapter 1, starting from verse 19 through 27.
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.560]   I listened to the live stream last week and I was excited to see that Caleb did James
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:47.640]   1 because I love the book of James and I figured this is great.
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.880]   I can continue on this and pick up on where he left off.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.080]   So, thank you Caleb for your word last week.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.640]   I was deeply encouraged by that.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.640]   Before we get into the word, I'll ask if you guys would just pray with me real quick.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.360]   Holy Father, our Lord, our God, thank you.
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.600]   Thank you for your faithfulness.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.700]   Thank you that you are a good father.
[00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.560]   Thank you that you loved us enough to send your son to die in our place, that we might
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.120]   have hope in this world, that we would have peace, that we would have comfort in the midst
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.400]   of a world that is full of uncomforting things.
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.260]   We thank you for waking us all up this morning, acknowledge that not everyone did.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.920]   We thank you for the life that you give us.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.800]   We thank you that in you we live, breathe, and have our being.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:44.280]   So thank you God for this life and the eternal life and hope we have in your son, Jesus Christ.
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.080]   I pray that you would open our hearts, that we would receive your word, that we would
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.720]   respond to your word in such a way that Jesus Christ would be glorified in and through our
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.920]   lives.
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.800]   So be with us today, teach us today that it wouldn't just be my words, but that it would
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.440]   be your words simply spoken through me and to me.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:06.360]   And so all these things I pray in the precious name of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.360]   Amen.
[00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:15.960]   Okay, so as I said, I'll be in James chapter one, starting from verse 19 through the end
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.960]   of the chapter.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:25.240]   It says this, "Know this, my beloved brothers, let every person be quick to hear, slow to
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.680]   speak, slow to anger.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.480]   For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.880]   For put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.800]   which is able to save your souls.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.200]   But be doers of the word and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.640]   For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.920]   at his natural face in a mirror.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.160]   For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.880]   But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres being no
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.000]   hearer who forgets, but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.520]   If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.440]   this person's religion is worthless.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.660]   Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this, to visit widows and
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.440]   orphans in their affliction and to keep oneself unstained from the world."
[00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.280]   So brothers and sisters, today I want to focus in on this passage and specifically the verses
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.400]   in the middle, 22 through 25.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.920]   And by God's grace, do the best I can to draw out what it means and what it would look like
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:46.480]   for us to become doers of the word of God.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:52.920]   So I mentioned I was excited about Caleb preaching James because the letter of James is one of
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.160]   my favorite books in the Bible because of the impact it's had on me, my faith journey,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.200]   my walk with Christ, and because the book itself is just so full of practical wisdom
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.280]   for how to live out our Christian lives.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.720]   There's a lot of really good allusions to the Psalms, to the Proverbs, even to the teachings
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.860]   of Jesus that James uses in his writing.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.040]   And we'll focus on some of that today.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.040]   But from the writings of the four gospels, we know that James was a brother of this dude
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.560]   named Jesus who maybe you've heard of him.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.720]   It was kind of a big deal a few thousand years ago.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.540]   Of course you guys have heard of Jesus.
[00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.440]   But the interesting thing about James is that even though he was Jesus' own brother, he
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:38.680]   didn't believe in him.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.600]   Initially he doubted the things that Jesus taught, the things that Jesus did.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:49.000]   And there's a passage in the Gospel of Mark that tells us Jesus' family actually thought
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.080]   and said that he was out of his mind for the things that he was doing, having all these
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.140]   people come to the house and hear him preach and teach.
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.220]   So they thought he was out of his mind.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.200]   His brothers doubted him.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.440]   But eventually something happens to James following the crucifixion and the burial of
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.800]   Jesus that radically changes his outlook on Jesus.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:20.520]   He goes from a denier, a skeptic, into a believer, a denier to a follower, a detractor to a leader
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.840]   of the early church.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:26.680]   Whatever it was that happened, whatever it was that transformed James, it was so convincing
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.660]   that he was even willing to die for his newfound belief in his brother, the Lord Jesus.
[00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.560]   And we know this because according to Jewish historian Josephus and a few other early church
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:45.440]   historians, James was martyred for his faith, for not denying faith in Christ.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:51.200]   When I think about this, you know, going from the brother of Jesus who doesn't believe in
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:57.240]   Jesus to a believer, a leader in the early church and even a martyr for the faith, I
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:02.120]   can't help but think that such a drastic transformation to me is one of the most compelling pieces
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.860]   of evidence for the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.520]   You look at James' transformation, you look at Paul's transformation.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.280]   What could cause someone to change so drastically?
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.040]   And I've heard it put this way, so I want to ask you guys, how many of you have siblings
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.040]   in here, brothers or sisters?
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.640]   Okay, obviously I know you guys do.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.240]   So I'm going to point you out.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.280]   Rachel, think about this now.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:32.720]   What would it take for you to be convinced that Nathan is the son of God?
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.840]   No way, right?
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.600]   Now we're talking about Jesus here, like, you know, I'm sure James grew up with him
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:42.480]   as a brother and I'm sure as a brother he wondered, like, why doesn't Jesus ever get
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   in trouble with, you know, mom and dad?
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.160]   He's such a goody two-shoes.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.720]   But still, he didn't believe he was the Messiah.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:49.200]   He didn't believe he was God.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.960]   But something so drastic happened, he began to believe and would even die for this belief
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.940]   that Jesus truly was God in the flesh.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.920]   And truly, what else besides seeing a man once dead, buried in the tomb for three days,
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:10.480]   alive in front of your very eyes, bearing the marks of crucifixion, what else could
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.400]   cause such a drastic transformation in a person?
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:22.880]   So you see, James' encounter with the living, resurrected, eternal word of God changed James.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:29.080]   He was a man who once only heard the teachings of Jesus and doubted them to a man who believed
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:30.760]   the words and acted upon them.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:36.000]   In the same way, James in this passage is encouraging his audience, his audience then
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:42.160]   and his audience today, encouraging us to not only hear the word of God, to also respond
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.160]   to it.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.960]   So that's what I will be encouraging for all of us today.
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.080]   So I mentioned that James has a lot of allusion to other passages of Scripture, to Jesus'
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:08:00.520]   own teaching, and Jesus himself taught this point about being a doer and not a hearer.
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:06.680]   At the end of the Sermon on the Mount, one of his most well-known, powerful sermons,
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.760]   which 2,000 years later, still to this day is shaping the ethics and morality of our
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:12.840]   world.
[00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:18.040]   And at the end of this massive sermon, you know, Matthew chapter 5 through 7, he ends,
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.640]   he gives an audience this warning.
[00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:26.680]   He says this, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.480]   but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:35.200]   On that day, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:39.200]   out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name?'
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.760]   And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.080]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:50.960]   Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.120]   built his house on the rock.
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:57.880]   And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat on the house, but
[00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.960]   it did not fall because it had been founded on the rock.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:06.220]   And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.680]   man who built his house on the sand.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.620]   And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and beat against the house
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:15.000]   and it fell.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.240]   And great was the fall of it."
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.440]   You can hear how James is echoing the words of Jesus, hearing and doing.
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:24.760]   So the point that he's making is pretty clear.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:30.280]   Just because you hear the words of Jesus doesn't mean you are truly a disciple of Jesus.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:35.700]   Just because you attend church regularly or listen to sermon clips and podcasts doesn't
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.560]   really mean you truly know and are known by Jesus.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.440]   There's more to this faith of ours than hearing the word.
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:49.040]   Let's look, for example, at the disciple who betrayed our Lord.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.860]   Judas heard just about as much of Jesus' teaching as anyone else.
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:57.460]   He heard more of it than we ever have.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:10:01.680]   But how much good did that do Judas just to hear the teachings of Christ?
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.760]   It didn't really do him a lot of good because, as James puts it, he didn't receive the implanted
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:10.360]   word with meekness.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.480]   Judas was no doer of the word.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.020]   Although he heard it, he was not moved by it.
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:18.260]   He experienced no repentance, no change.
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:22.820]   We can see that he still had this love of money that was strong enough to cause him
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:30.660]   to betray his brother, to betray his rabbi, his Lord for 30 pieces of silver.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:36.340]   There was no obedience flowing from Judas' heart, no love of God that would cause him
[00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:39.160]   to follow God.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:42.640]   And James says that such people are only deceiving themselves.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:48.840]   And as easy as it is for us to look back and kind of single out Judas, you know, and pick
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:54.780]   on Judas, I think it's pretty easy for us to fall into the same deception.
[00:10:54.780 --> 00:11:01.920]   How easy is it for us to go to church on Sunday, get a good word in, praise God, feel really
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:08.300]   good about ourselves, and then we go back on Monday to a week of inaction or indifference
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.220]   to the things that we were so encouraged about the day before.
[00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:18.220]   How often do we quench the Holy Spirit and stop the word from truly penetrating our hearts
[00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:21.620]   in such a way that it then plays out in our lives?
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:28.580]   It's pretty easy to hear a sermon about controlling our tongue and then leave and find ourselves
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:32.860]   gossiping or slandering somebody or speaking harshly to somebody.
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:39.620]   It's pretty easy to hear a sermon on, let's say, James chapter 1, be slow to anger, and
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.780]   on the way home, driving through traffic, someone cuts us off, and then we quickly find
[00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:46.160]   ourselves angry.
[00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:47.760]   And I speak from experience.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.260]   My wife is always reminding me about how I drive.
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:59.040]   So it's easy for us to find ourselves hearing these things, sermons and scriptures that
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.900]   address the hate in our heart, the pride in our heart, love of money, love of the things
[00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:09.620]   of the world, and by the end of it, feel very motivated, very encouraged.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:15.560]   But do we ever actually experience any change beyond that emotion, beyond that feeling and
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.560]   that agreeing?
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:21.560]   A lot of times we hear these sermons and we read the scriptures and we agree wholeheartedly,
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.920]   "Yes, that's true.
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.120]   Yes, that's so good.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.560]   I should make that change in my life."
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:31.200]   And then two, three, four weeks later, do we actually make that change?
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:37.400]   And even as I'm speaking, I'm feeling convicted because the other day I found an old notebook
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:38.400]   of mine.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.120]   It has pages and pages full of sermon notes for the past three years, and I thought to
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   myself, "When is the last time I even reviewed this?
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.440]   And when's the last time I actually wrote sermon notes on Sunday and then a week, two
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:57.960]   weeks later, went back and checked in to make sure I was still doing those things?"
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:03.640]   So the question I'm asking is, do we simply hear or do we also do?
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:09.520]   And this topic, this scripture, another reason I love James so much is because I can attest
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:13.440]   to this kind of lifestyle very personally.
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:19.120]   Just telling you a little bit about myself, for a majority, 20 plus years of my life,
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.800]   I was nothing more than a half-hearted, lukewarm hearer of the word.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:29.920]   You see, even though I grew up going to church, I would go to church on Sundays, youth group
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   on Wednesdays, prayer night on Fridays, it didn't really make a difference to me.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.400]   You see, my dad is a pastor.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.080]   I was hearing the word constantly, if not daily, and yet it never impacted my heart.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:48.600]   I had a lot of knowledge of God in my head, probably not as much as I thought I did, but
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.160]   it didn't actually affect my heart.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.660]   It didn't really cause any change.
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:58.520]   So by the time I went to college, I was living in complete rebellion against God.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:03.040]   I was a cheater, a liar, a thief, a drunkard.
[00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:08.320]   I tell people this, if you go to the book of Galatians chapter five, there's this beautiful
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:15.360]   list of the fruit of the spirit, love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, kindness, faithfulness,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:17.720]   gentleness, self-control.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.360]   That was not who I was.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.680]   If you go a few verses back, Paul gives you another list, and he calls it the deeds or
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:32.000]   the works of the flesh, envy, dissension, rivalry, drunkenness, immorality.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.440]   If you read through that list, just about every single one of those describes my life.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.440]   That's who I was.
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.200]   That's how I was.
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.240]   And the saddest part of that is that if you would have asked me at that time in my life
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:47.240]   when I lived like that, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.840]   I would have been able to look you dead in the face, completely serious, and tell you,
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:53.580]   "Of course I'm a Christian.
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:54.580]   Of course I'm a Christian.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.000]   I grew up going to church.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   My dad's a pastor.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.480]   I got baptized when I was eight.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.280]   John 3:16, "For God so loved the world."
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.200]   I know that one.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:09.240]   Because of those things, because I heard those things, I was so self-deceived, as James describes.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.640]   I thought I was saved.
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:18.640]   And it wasn't until I was about 22 years old that God opened my eyes and showed me just
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.280]   how deceived, just how lost I had been all my life.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:26.760]   Because there's more to being a disciple, being a follower of Christ, than hearing His
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:27.840]   Word.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.560]   There's even more to it than simply agreeing with His Word.
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.400]   There's another piece to it where you live out His Word, where you humbly submit to His
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:37.520]   Word and follow His Word.
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:44.560]   There's another passage in James that's not part of this section, but I recall reading
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.760]   Scripture when I finally decided, "Okay, my life is like totally off here.
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.960]   I need to get into God's Word and learn where I went so wrong."
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.600]   As I'm reading through James, he says something along the lines of, "You believe.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.600]   Good for you.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   God is one.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.920]   Even the demons believe and they shudder."
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:05.960]   And that really hit me because there's a difference in hearing and believing the Word of God and
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.640]   doing and responding in humility to the Word of God.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:17.200]   And so my life is a great example of somebody who was self-deceived.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:23.000]   Never in my entire life did I have any desire to be anything more than a hearer of the Word.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.120]   But in light of all that Christ had done for me at the cross, how could I not respond to
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.320]   the gospel?
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.960]   How could I not be forever changed, transformed from the inside out?
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:40.000]   Hearing His Word week in and week out, failing to respond to it, neglecting to put it into
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:46.640]   action, it's as foolish, James says, as looking in a mirror intently, really staring, analyzing
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.320]   yourself in a mirror, and then walking away and forgetting what you look like.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.880]   And I'm glad that I have my wife, Kiamia, to help me with this kind of thing because
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.480]   I'm very forgetful and I have like little to zero fashion sense.
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.000]   So if I look in a mirror to decide, "Does this outfit look good?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.580]   Does this match with this?"
[00:17:03.580 --> 00:17:05.720]   I look in the mirror.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.840]   I think it looks good, but maybe I go and I change and I put something else on, forgetting
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:11.560]   how the outfit matched.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.800]   If it wasn't for my wife, I would be walking around Moody's campus looking ridiculous because
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:17.600]   I just, I just, I can't do it.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   So I thank God.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:19.600]   Thank you, Kiamia.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   But that's what it's like.
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:21.600]   It's foolish.
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:25.200]   If you, let's say you went out to eat, you know, you went out to dinner with some very
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:31.040]   important people in your family, in your job, and you had the best salad of your life, and
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:34.680]   you went to the bathroom and you looked in the mirror and you realized, "How long have
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:38.000]   I had this piece of lettuce stuck between my teeth?
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.800]   Have they all seen me with this lettuce in my teeth?
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.080]   Why did no one tell me?"
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:44.480]   And then you walk out of the bathroom, but you don't remove the lettuce.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.160]   You just forget it's there.
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.160]   You look silly.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.160]   You look foolish.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.000]   In the same way, James is saying it's foolish for us to be little more than hearers of the
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Word.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.600]   So again, my encouragement is that we would not simply and solely be hearers of the Word
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   of God.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:01.960]   Let us become doers.
[00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:08.080]   Let us be moved like James to respond to the Word of God, to turn from whatever sin may
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:11.640]   be hindering our walk in relationship with Christ.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.760]   Let's apply the things that we're learning.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:16.040]   I know you guys here are learning some really good things.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.460]   I've listened to the sermons.
[00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.720]   I've been here before.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.240]   I know Pastor Mark.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.880]   He's a man who loves the Lord.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:22.880]   He loves you guys.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:24.280]   He loves the Word of God.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.440]   So I know you guys are getting really good teaching.
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.440]   Let's respond to it.
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:34.960]   Let's act in response to the teaching, being not just hearers, but hearers and doers of
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.760]   the Word of God.
[00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:42.120]   When we become doers of the Word, when we put the principles of God into practice, we
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:50.200]   show that our profession of faith is genuine, and we show ourselves to not be deceived.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:52.260]   So what would it look like?
[00:18:52.260 --> 00:18:56.660]   What does it look like to be a doer and not just a hearer of the Word?
[00:18:56.660 --> 00:19:02.740]   Thankfully James in his practicality throughout his letter, he gives us a few examples that
[00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:03.740]   we can go off of.
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:09.060]   And so he says this, "If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue
[00:19:09.060 --> 00:19:13.940]   but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:18.300]   Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this, to visit orphans and
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:23.180]   widows in their affliction, to keep oneself unstained from the world."
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:27.940]   So what James is saying is that it's pointless, it's worthless to think that you're religious,
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:31.700]   to think you're something, to think you're right with God and you're so spiritual and
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:37.400]   you're so mature, or to tell people that and only be a hearer of the Word, not backing
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   it up with action.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.700]   It's one thing to talk the talk, it's another thing to walk the walk.
[00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:47.980]   And if you look in the Gospels, this is what Jesus is constantly confronting the Pharisees
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.980]   on.
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.740]   You know, they have so much knowledge of the Word of God, and he'll ask them, "Have you
[00:19:52.740 --> 00:19:53.900]   not read?
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.220]   Did you not know?"
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.060]   He's being rhetorical because if there's anyone who had read the Word of God, who knew what
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:04.180]   the Word of God said, it was the scribes, it was the Pharisees, the teachers of the
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.620]   law, the experts.
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:08.360]   But even though they knew it, they chose not to do it.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.680]   They chose to do their own thing, follow their own tradition.
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:15.020]   And so Jesus is constantly critiquing them.
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:20.080]   So one of the examples James gives is controlling our tongues, exercising wisdom in what we
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:23.680]   choose to say and what we choose not to say.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:30.800]   If we can't keep ourselves from slandering others, gossiping, crude, inappropriate jokes,
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:33.640]   you know, everywhere we go, we're cussing here and there.
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:39.740]   One, it affects our witness, our testimony to the world that we're disciples of Christ.
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:43.620]   And so there, you know, I can tell you how much of a Christian I am, and I want to tell
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.900]   you about Jesus and how much he's changed me, but at the same time, I'm going to tell
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:53.380]   you some inappropriate jokes or gossip about this other person that we know or, you know,
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.620]   use foul language.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:56.620]   It's pointless.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.980]   It's worthless, James says.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:05.780]   All true religion, all true faith in Christ is marked by a changed heart, a heart that
[00:21:05.780 --> 00:21:11.820]   responds to the word of God with love and with obedience, a heart that is moved to care
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:14.380]   about the things that God cares about.
[00:21:14.380 --> 00:21:18.400]   And as you read through Scripture, I mean, from the beginning, Genesis to Revelation,
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:23.780]   you see clearly that one of the things that God cares about is helping the helpless, being
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:27.060]   a defender of the defenseless, a father to the fatherless.
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:32.060]   And so showing compassion on those on the margins of society is one of the things that
[00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:33.580]   God cares about.
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.780]   And as those who want to hear God's word and respond to God's word, James is saying that
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:45.080]   we also should care about those like orphans, like widows, who are oftentimes on the margins
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:47.020]   of society.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:52.560]   James also tells us that true religion is marked by a heart moved to repentance, a turning
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:22:00.660]   away from and separating oneself from sin, beginning to hate the things that God hates,
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:05.540]   controlling the tongue, helping the helpless, avoiding the wicked ways of the world.
[00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:10.420]   Three really great examples James gives, but there's so much more to being a doer of the
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.900]   word than just those three examples.
[00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:18.340]   Because in general, being a doer of the word is a heart posture of humility that says to
[00:22:18.340 --> 00:22:24.620]   God, "I hear your word and I agree, I believe your word, help me to respond, help me to
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:30.780]   apply this to my life, help me to respond to the conviction of the Holy Spirit by agreeing
[00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:34.300]   with you and doing the things that you want me to do, turning from the things that you
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.320]   want me to turn from."
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:41.460]   That is what it means to be a hearer of the word, is responding in such a way to the word
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.460]   of God, whether it's in your private time reading scripture, whether it's a sermon you
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:50.900]   heard, a podcast you heard, applying to the lessons and principles in such a way that
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.180]   Jesus Christ is glorified in the life you live.
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:59.260]   That's what it means to be a hearer and a doer of the word of God.
[00:22:59.260 --> 00:23:04.220]   So again, over and over and over again, I say this, I encourage you and I challenge
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:11.020]   you guys with two things here that we can evaluate for ourselves in being doers and
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.780]   hearers of the word.
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:19.060]   The first thing is this, ask yourself and be honest with yourself, how have I done this
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:25.220]   past month, the past two weeks with responding to the word of God, whether it was a sermon
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:31.940]   you heard here, a podcast clip, your own personal devotion time, scripture reading, how have
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.260]   I done in responding to what God was teaching me in that word?
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.180]   How have I responded?
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:39.420]   Did I simply hear it?
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:40.580]   Did I simply read it?
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:42.020]   Did it sound good to me?
[00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:46.820]   Did I just acknowledge the truthfulness that was in the word?
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:52.140]   Did I just gain knowledge about Jesus and his will for my life or did I act upon that
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:53.140]   knowledge?
[00:23:53.140 --> 00:23:57.980]   Did I step in alignment with the will of God for my life?
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980]   Was I a doer?
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.980]   Did I act upon this word?
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:05.460]   Did I put any points of application into practice in my life?
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:09.940]   I'm sure you guys know all about, you know, the end of a sermon, three points of practical
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.220]   application.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:15.500]   I told you I have a notebook full of them and I don't always go back and look at them
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.140]   and evaluate with myself or with others how I'm doing in applying those to my life and
[00:24:20.140 --> 00:24:25.940]   so that's my first encouragement is to just evaluate, you know, how have I been doing,
[00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.340]   putting God's word into practice in my life?
[00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:32.380]   Have I been humble in responding to the Holy Spirit's conviction?
[00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:37.420]   Did I follow the ways in which God prompted me to be more like his son and less like the
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:38.420]   world?
[00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:43.620]   And get honest, get brutally honest with yourself as you ask the question and regardless of
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:50.780]   how pretty the answer is or isn't, let's resolve and dedicate ourselves to be doers of the
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.100]   word and not just hearers.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:59.700]   Again, I know personally how easy it is to live a life only being a hearer and being
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:01.460]   content with that.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:05.340]   Let's challenge ourselves to be hearers and doers.
[00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:11.040]   And the second thing I ask, the second encouragement and the challenge is this, simply because
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:16.380]   I don't know a lot of you guys very well, I do know some of you, but from personal experience
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:23.580]   I know that you can never really be too sure, I ask this question.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:28.380]   To everyone here, have you ever truly responded to the word of God?
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:34.980]   Have you ever truly been a doer of the word or are you merely a hearer?
[00:25:34.980 --> 00:25:38.300]   Church, please listen to me.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:44.300]   Being a hearer, only hearing the word of God, it's possible that you could fool other people
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.660]   and have them thinking, "Man, you know, look at George.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:52.540]   He sure knows his Bible and he really gets into the worship and he raises his hands and
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.140]   yeah, that's a great Christian there."
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:59.540]   But if I'm only a hearer, it doesn't matter what I know about God or what I can tell you
[00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:03.100]   about God if I don't act upon that.
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:10.180]   And so the truth of the matter is that there will be many, many hearers of the word of
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:12.260]   God in hell.
[00:26:12.260 --> 00:26:20.620]   There will be many church attenders in hell, many Bible memorizers, 10% tithers, worship
[00:26:20.620 --> 00:26:28.820]   leaders, pastors, kids, pastors in hell because not everyone who calls out, "Lord, Lord,"
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.380]   is truly doing the will of God.
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:36.900]   And what does Scripture teach us the will of God is to believe in his son, to trust
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:39.820]   in Jesus, to repent of our sin and turn to him.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:49.460]   James puts it this way, "Therefore, put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness," that
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:55.060]   is repent, look at the sin in your heart, respond to the conviction that God is stirring
[00:26:55.060 --> 00:27:01.060]   up within you about the things in your life you know are wrong and turn from those sins.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:08.180]   And then James says to do this, "Receive with meekness," that's to receive with humility
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.820]   the implanted word which is able to save your soul.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:12.940]   And what is that?
[00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:17.220]   But the gospel of Jesus Christ, the gospel of grace that you're a sinner and there's
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.120]   nothing you can do to save yourself.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:20.720]   So Christ did it all for you.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:22.500]   He lived the perfect life.
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.900]   He truly was the son of God despite what his brothers might have at one time thought.
[00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:32.500]   And being the son of God, he went to the cross humbly, willingly, dying on the cross, paying
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:38.460]   the price of your sins, the price you couldn't pay so that by believing in him, trusting
[00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.380]   in him, turning from the world, turning from sin, turning to him, you would be saved, you
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.700]   would have a promise of eternal life.
[00:27:45.700 --> 00:27:47.140]   This is the word of God.
[00:27:47.140 --> 00:27:53.380]   This is the implanted word which when received with meekness and humility is able to save
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.520]   our souls.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:04.800]   So again, in light of this, the question that stands is, are you, am I, are we doers of
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:14.380]   the word of God or are we hearers only?
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:19.540]   The last thought I want to leave you guys with is again, looking back to the example
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:24.980]   of James and even the example of Paul, if you're familiar with his transformation, their
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:33.260]   lives were undeniably radically impacted by the grace of God once they believed in the
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:34.580]   Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:40.140]   And I'm not saying that all of us will have such a drastic conversion experience as Saul,
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:41.260]   as Paul.
[00:28:41.260 --> 00:28:45.180]   I personally don't know anybody who walked around blind for three days with scales on
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:50.700]   their face, but spiritually speaking, we will have that transformation because it's the
[00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:57.420]   same Holy Spirit that changed James' mind, the same Holy Spirit that changed Paul's mind.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:02.340]   Scripture even says the same Holy Spirit which raised Christ from the dead lives inside of
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.860]   us and will cause transformation inside of us so that we can go from those who only hear
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:13.700]   the word and are unaffected at the core of our being to those who hear the word and humbly
[00:29:13.700 --> 00:29:17.580]   receive it and respond to it in our lives.
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:23.980]   James and Paul, their lives bore fruit which testified to the fact that they were not merely
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:29.620]   hearers of God's word but doers who acted and responded upon it.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:35.780]   So the only answer, the only question that I can really leave you with is this, are you
[00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.860]   a doer of the word of God?
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.860]   Amen?
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:40.860]   Amen.
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.100]   Thank you.
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:42.940]   Thank you.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:52.940]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
