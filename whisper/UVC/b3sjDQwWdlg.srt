 (speaking in foreign language)

241
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:07,600
 Mind shift.

242
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

243
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,280
 Like a thinking bubble.

 (speaking in foreign language)

263
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:24,000
 A substitute, a lamb.

264
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,080
 The ultimate lamb, that's Jesus.

265
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:33,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

266
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:37,280
 I can't do it alone.

267
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:39,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

268
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,800
 I need help.

269
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

270
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,480
 I need help from God.

271
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

272
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,240
 I need Jesus.

273
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

274
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,600
 Because he's perfect.

275
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

276
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,680
 He can substitute me for my sin and things I've done wrong.

277
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,480
 Whoa.

278
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:05,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

279
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,200
 What do you mean?

280
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

281
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:24,600
 Friendship, stories.

282
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:28,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

283
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:32,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

284
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,240
 When our attitude and our hearts change.

285
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

286
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,440
 God knows.

287
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,480
 So I could send Jesus.

288
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:41,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

289
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,000
 We are touched by love.

290
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:48,400
 And that's hard sometimes.

291
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

292
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,000
 Mind shift.

293
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

294
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,280
 Extension time, extension time.

 (speaking in foreign language)

296
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,200
 Family Sunday school.

297
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

298
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,240
 Okay, here we go.

299
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,120
 Extension time.

300
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:21,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

301
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:23,080
 Friendship.

302
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:26,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

303
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:30,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

304
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:44,400
 Miracles.

305
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

306
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

307
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:17,880
 Stories.

308
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

309
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,800
 Mind shift.

310
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

311
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

312
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:56,720
 But through it all.

313
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

314
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,080
 We don't, adults don't,

315
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,320
 but to go through the journey together.

316
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,160
 Okay?

317
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

318
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,960

320
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:21,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

321
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:29,680
 All right, good.

322
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:30,800
 Okay, after you go,

323
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

324
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,000
 Okay, coming up next, Chinese time.

325
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

326
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

327
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,280
 American-born Chinese.

328
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

329
00:28:52,200 --> 00:29:06,120
 So, (speaking in foreign language)

330
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,480
 it's okay.

331
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

332
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

333
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,320
 Counting words.

334
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:25,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

335
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:28,840
 What is the difference?

336
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:32,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

337
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

338
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:53,080

 Okay, here we go.

342
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:06,560
 Why is (speaking in foreign language)

343
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:10,880
 as in pen, pencil, marker, (speaking in foreign language)

344
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,840
 You can't say (speaking in foreign language)

345
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,960
 but you can't.

346
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,280
 That doesn't make sense.

347
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

348
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,080
 And then, (speaking in foreign language)

349
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,560

352
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:23,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

353
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,680
 This is how I remember.

354
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

355
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

356
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,320
 It's like a (speaking in foreign language)

357
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:29,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

358
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,920
 is like a branch, like a stick.

359
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,000
 Right?

360
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,840
 Stick.

361
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

362
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,120
 Branch, a stick of wood.

363
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:44,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

364
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:51,480
 Lipstick.

365
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,240
 Oh, big clue.

366
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,080
 Stick.

367
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

368
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,440
 Chapstick.

369
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:00,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

370
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,320
 That's when you use (speaking in foreign language)

371
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,160
 Okay?

372
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,320
 Yeah.

373
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,560
 That's my clue for you.

374
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,960
 Another thing.

375
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:10,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

376
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:15,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

377
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,320
 Sheets of paper.

378
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,640
 50 sheets.

379
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

380
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,320
 100.

381
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

382
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,440
 150.

383
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

384
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,680
 How many sheets?

385
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

386
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:27,320
 So sheets.

387
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,440
 Like this.

388

00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,280
 Not my fault, this is Chinese.

401
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,440
 At least.

402
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,800

00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:05,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

440
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,280
 Whoa.

 I know.

451
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,360
 This is why.

452
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,560
 Cantonese is not easy.

 That's all I got, guys.

486
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,920
 Hope that helps your Chinese, folks.
