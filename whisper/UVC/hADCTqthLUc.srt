1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,100
 back. All right, now let's welcome Tommy Lee.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:12,400
 Good morning everyone. All right, Kelly emailed me this past week and says, "Hey Tommy, we

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,320
 have a special announcement we're going to add in addition to the staff, but secretly

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,240
 I think she says you have 25 minutes." I think in her own way she says, "Make it short, don't

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,520
 bore everyone, and you have 20 something minutes because we have some translation." So we're

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,360
 going to dive in, go in and look at the passage and see what it is and get out of there so

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,080
 we can have our special announcement as well too. But I got the message from Kelly, don't

8
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:44,840
 bore everyone. Thank you. Jesus walks in and he enters Jerusalem and everyone's cheering

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,880
 him, but boy do they turn on him pretty quick. Boy do they turn on him pretty quick. They

10
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:56,800
 had an expectation of who Jesus was, what he was able to do, and the problem is he didn't

11
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,200
 meet their expectations. And as a result, the people ended up doing what they did for

12
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:07,600
 him and he ended up crucifying. And in the long run, it became something that opened

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,960
 the doors for what we are experiencing today. We look at the story of Elijah today. Elijah

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,440
 is the one who John the Baptist was the new Elijah who continued to preach Jesus into

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,320
 our lives, but Elijah's life also helps us to understand what that grace means in

16
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:32,160
 our life. A couple months ago I was here and we looked at 1 Kings chapter 17 verses 1 through

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,760
 7. And during that period of time, if you don't, so I'm just going to quickly go

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:41,320
 through it. We looked at the life of Elijah and in the original language, the name Elijah

19
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:51,360
 simply means "My God is Jehovah." That's what Elijah means, "My God is Jehovah."

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,440
 He came from, he's the Tishbit of Tishbi in Gilead. That's what 1 Kings tells him.

21
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:02,720
 He comes from this obscure little city in Tishbi and scholars didn't really know

22
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:08,840
 where it was, so it tells us that it's somewhere in Gilead. It's this rural city. And so

23
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:16,920
 Elijah of Tishbi in Gilead comes from obscurity. And this guy, this rural guy who comes from

24
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:24,280
 obscurity ends up talking with the king, King Ahab of the Northern Kingdom. If you were

25
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,240
 here I explained to you during that period of time, there's a Northern Kingdom and

26
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:33,480
 there's a Southern Kingdom. The story of Elijah takes place in the Northern Kingdom.

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:39,160
 And he says to this king, King Ahab, there's 19 kings all throughout the Northern Kingdom

28
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:47,120
 in its history before it's taken over. Ahab was the worst of all the kings. Jezebel later

29
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,680
 on, his wife, the queen, is worse than Ahab. So this couple is the worst that any of the

30
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:02,080
 regime in the Northern Kingdom ever saw. And Elijah says to King Ahab, "Neither dew nor

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:12,880
 rain except by my word." Why? Because Ahab was worshiping the god Baal, the god of rain,

32
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:18,960
 of storm, of weather, fertility, all of that stuff. Because King Ahab believed that if

33
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,760
 he put all his trust on this king or this god Baal, he was going to produce fertility.

34
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,720
 Fertility produces food, produces money, produces flour, all of that stuff, and it was going

35
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:38,000
 to help him accomplish his goals. And he turned his eyes on the Lord. And so Elijah comes

36
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,800
 and says, "Neither dew nor rain except by my word." And he tells us, and that becomes

37
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:49,560
 the theme of what we talked about, "Before whom I stand." That was his motivation. That

38
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,320
 was the theme, "Before whom I stand." Later on, God ushers him at the end of the verse,

39
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:02,400
 that last part of chapter 17 in verse 7, he ushers him away to Cherith. And there he doesn't

40
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:09,600
 stay, but he rather lives in Cherith for a period of time. God takes him away from seclusion.

41
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,520
 There God protects him. There God continues to work in him. And during that period of

42
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:21,280
 time, he's fed by ravens, and he is fed by the brook in Cherith until it dries, which

43
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,320
 leads us to today's passage in verses 8 through 16. "Then the word of the Lord came

44
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:36,320
 to him, 'Arise, leave Cherith, and go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell

45
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:43,360
 there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you.' So he arose and went to Zarephath.

46
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,600
 And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks.

47
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,120
 And he called to her and says, 'Bring me a little water in a vessel that I may drink.'

48
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,720
 And as she was going to bring, he called to her and said, 'Bring me a morsel of bread

49
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:04,360
 in your hand.' And she says, 'As the Lord your God lives, I have nothing baked, only

50
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:09,100
 a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. And now I am gathering a couple

51
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:15,660
 of sticks that I may go in and prepare for myself and my son that we may eat it and die.'

52
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:21,940
 And Elijah said to her, 'Do not fear. Go and do as you have said. But first make me

53
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:28,620
 a little cake of it and bring it to me. And afterward make something special for yourself

54
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,600
 and your son.' For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, 'The jar of flour shall not

55
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,960
 be spent, and the jug of oil shall not be empty until the day that the Lord sends rain

56
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,420
 upon the earth.' And she went and did as Elijah said. And she and her husband ate for

57
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:51,840
 many days. The jar of flour was not spent, neither did the jug of oil become empty according

58
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,760
 to the word of the Lord that he spoke by Elijah." If you're following after today, we are

59
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:05,640
 reading from the ESV version, 1 Kings chapter 17, verses 8 through 16. If I literally had

60
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:12,960
 to title this sermon, I would literally rename it 3 by 2. And it literally means this. There

61
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:21,800
 are three things that Elijah needs to know. Three things Elijah needs to know. Two things

62
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:28,000
 that he has to overcome. Three things that Elijah needs to know. Two things that he has

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:33,960
 to overcome. Let's talk about those three things. Number one, Elijah needs to know that

64
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:45,400
 the Lord sees him and knows where he's at. Number two, the Lord knows where he's going.

65
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:53,280
 Number three, the Lord knows what he needs. Three things. Number one, the Lord knows and

66
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,120
 sees him and knows where he's at. Number two, the Lord knows where he's going. Number three,

67
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:08,840
 the Lord knows what he needs. Verse 8, "Then the word of the Lord came to him." The Lord

68
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:15,600
 sees you. The Lord sees me. The Lord sees you. There is something so powerful about

69
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:22,500
 knowing that we are seen by God. There is something powerful knowing that the great

70
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:32,120
 omniscient God who controls all of the universe sees you, has a plan for you, and has a unique

71
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:40,520
 plan in your life. It gives us dignity. It gives us worth. It makes us feel special.

72
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:47,360
 We've all learned that ever since we were kids. We've all wanted to seek approval, and

73
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,360
 we've all wanted to be seen by our parents. I have a little girl, her name is Kara. Kara

74
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,840
 is four years old. And in this day, right now, she goes to Puy Taks school, and there's

75
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,800
 an Easter program. And Kara is in the school assembly, and from that point on, she sits

76
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,120
 there, and then later on when they call her, she gets up to the stage. And immediately,

77
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,560
 you guys probably know if you guys have kids what that means. She's looking around. And

78
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,400
 you know what she's looking around. She's trying to figure out where her parents are.

79
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:21,720
 Why? Because she wants to know that we're watching her. She wants to know that we're

80
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,560
 looking and seeing at her. After the program is done, she runs, and Kara's really quiet

81
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,560
 for the most part, pretty shy. But for this time around, she runs and she looks for us,

82
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:38,320
 and she runs to us. And immediately, her first words were, "Did you see me? Did you see me?

83
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:42,240
 Did you see me?" I said to her, "Of course I saw you." She looks at me and says, "No,

84
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,960
 no, did mommy see me?" Because she doesn't really care what I say. She always cares about

85
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:53,280
 what her mom says to her. "Did my mom see her?" We want to be seen. We want to feel

86
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:59,920
 dignity. We want to feel worth. Story in Acts chapter 3, Peter and John. Rarely do you ever

87
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,840
 get Peter and John together. It's a great team up that they have there. Maybe this is

88
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:09,320
 the second story in Acts chapter 3. A man laying from birth was being carried, whom

89
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,720
 they lay daily at the gate of the temple. That is called the beautiful gate to ask alms

90
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:21,000
 of those entering the temple. Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, this

91
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,400
 man laying from birth asked to receive alms. In verse 4, here's a powerful verse, chapter

92
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:37,920
 3, verse 4. Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John. It says, "Look at us." He directs

93
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:43,800
 his gaze at him. You guys, all of us know what that means. When we drive off and we

94
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:51,920
 enter off and exit off Highway 55 into Chinatown, when we go and exit off Cicero to Midway Airport,

95
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,000
 when we get off a highway, what do we always see? We see someone begging for money. We

96
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,120
 see people sitting there banging their buckets asking for money. And immediately, you know

97
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:07,600
 what all of us do? We sit there and we're stopped at a red light and we pretend like

98
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,800
 we're looking at our phones or we're looking straight ahead because we know what that means.

99
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,000
 If we make eye contact, they're asking us for money. And as Asians, we don't want to

100
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,480
 say no, so we don't make eye contact. But here, Peter and John, there's a man begging

101
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:36,440
 for money. Peter and John sits there and directs his gaze at him and he looks at them straight

102
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:46,360
 in the eye and says, "Look at us." He gives a man who is lame, who is begging for money,

103
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:57,040
 dignity. He lets that man know, "I see you." The Lord sees us. The Lord knows where we're

104
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:05,720
 at. Verse 9, "Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there." Second

105
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:11,200
 point is that Lord knows where we need to go. He has a plan. He opens and closes doors

106
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:18,240
 as he sees fit. Joshua chapter 3 is one of the most amazing directions. When Joshua takes

107
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,960
 over the Israelites in chapter 3, they are ready. They've lived in the wilderness for

108
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:29,040
 40 years. And on one day, God says to Joshua, "Tell the people we're going to the promised

109
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,760
 land. Pack up." And after 40 years on that day, they pack up and they're ready to go.

110
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,760
 Can you imagine what they're feeling on that day knowing that after 40 years, they're packing

111
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:44,840
 up? They don't know what they're going to deal with. They don't know what dangers are

112
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:49,280
 in store. They look at the Jordan River. What in the world do we do there? But one of the

113
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 most powerful verses in John chapter 3 is the Lord God says to Joshua, "Tell the people

114
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:04,720
 to follow, to follow the ark of the covenant." Why? Because you've never been there before.

115
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,600
 You've never been there before. Because the Lord knows where you need to go. All of us

116
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:14,600
 who are sitting here, I think a lot of us are older, there's not too many college students

117
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:20,480
 here. All of us have struggled with our career. You may have graduated and you're trying to

118
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,360
 figure out what's next in your life. You may be in a job right now and you just kind of

119
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,040
 just don't like your job. You may be watching right now and says, "Man, I'm trying to figure

120
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,200
 out what's next." But there's no clarity. And you're asking, "Lord, what is it that

121
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:40,320
 you want me to do?" And here's an illustration, right? I had a friend, Ian. I went to Washington

122
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:47,160
 University in St. Louis. Ian was a pre-med major. And Ian, all throughout freshman year

123
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:52,040
 and all the way to senior year, he was studying to become a doctor. That's what his parents

124
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,480
 wanted. And that senior year, he was ready to take MCATs and something just didn't sit

125
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,960
 well with him. He realized, "I don't want to be a doctor. My parents want me to be a

126
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,240
 doctor. I don't want to be a doctor." You know what he wanted to do? He wanted to do

127
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,760
 film. He really loved doing film. And so a lot of times he started doing film on his

128
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,640
 hobby and everything like that, entered the film festival at Washington University in

129
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,560
 St. Louis, won first place in the film festival. And he made the decision, because he felt

130
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,560
 like the Lord was tugging on his heart, to leave medicine, disappoint and frustrate his

131
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:35,200
 parents, and go into film school at Florida State. He graduates from Florida State with

132
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,920
 film. And from that point, he takes all these little odd-end jobs. Doesn't make any money.

133
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,080
 And so he's trying to figure out, "Lord, you brought me out of here to figure and do

134
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:50,320
 film and now I can't find a job. Is this really what you have in store for me?" But he kept

135
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:55,200
 pressing on and pressing on. And pretty soon, he got hired to do this startup program that

136
00:13:55,200 --> 00:14:01,520
 just got released, America's Next Top Model. And so he started filming that. And later

137
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,960
 on, he got another job offer in Los Angeles. They had two shows that they wanted him to

138
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:12,880
 do. They were just starting up shows. It was CSI or Criminal Minds. And he'd go pick

139
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:18,800
 your pick. And that grew into what he's doing today. And he kept telling me, "Tommy,

140
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:28,880
 I didn't know what to do. I just kept praying. Help me to spot what you are asking me to

141
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:36,240
 do, Lord. Help me to continue to see what you are showing me, not my will, but what

142
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:43,960
 yours." The Lord opens and closes doors as he sees fit. My prayer and your prayer in

143
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:50,680
 everything that we do is always saying, "Lord, may we spot those open doors. May we spot

144
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:57,640
 those closed doors. May we be aware of it according to your own time. But may we continue

145
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:04,880
 to take myself, my goals, what I want out of it and continue to seek you. And may you

146
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:11,480
 make that aware of it every single point in time." The Lord sees you. The Lord knows

147
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:19,280
 where you are. The Lord knows where you need to go. But thirdly, the Lord knows what you

148
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:28,520
 need. "Arise, go to Zarephath, and behold, I have commanded a widow there to free you."

149
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:35,640
 He knows what you need to do. Now, it may not be what you want. Really? A widow? Seriously?

150
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:39,040
 Cherith, you're going to go to Cherith and you're going to go to Zarephath. You know

151
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,880
 how that's a hundred miles. You want me to walk a hundred miles out in the open? I hid

152
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,560
 in Cherith this entire time. I was hiding in Cherith away from Ahab because you remember

153
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:59,200
 this, I threatened the king. He's not sitting around waiting for me. He's looking for me.

154
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:07,080
 So now you want me to walk a hundred miles to Zarephath? Yes. And there, who's going

155
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:15,160
 to take care of me? A widow. Really? A widow. The Lord knows what you need. It may not be

156
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,960
 what you want. It may not be what you think you need. But he knows what you need. The

157
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:29,240
 Lord knows where you are. The Lord sees you, number one. The Lord knows where you're going.

158
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,540
 It may not come the way you want it to go. It may take some time to figure out what those

159
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:40,640
 open and closed doors are. And he knows what you need. But at the same time, you're going

160
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:46,440
 to have to overcome two things. You're going to have to overcome first impressions and

161
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:55,600
 expectations. And secondly, you're going to have to overcome what's physically impossible.

162
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,960
 Let me talk about that. So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate

163
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:08,120
 of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and says, "Bring

164
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,800
 me a little water in a vessel that I may drink." And as she was going to bring it, he called

165
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:20,240
 to her and says, "Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand." And she says, "As the Lord

166
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:26,920
 your God lives." Not even as the Lord my God. As the Lord your God. Really? She's not even

167
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:34,560
 of the faith? "As the Lord your God, I have nothing big." Really? "Only a handful of flour

168
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:42,000
 in a jar and a little oil in a jug. And now I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may

169
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,600
 go in and prepare it for myself and my son that we may eat it and die." Really, Lord?

170
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:56,120
 You're going to ask me to walk a hundred miles? A widow's going to take care of me? And that

171
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,160
 widow is not part of the faith? That widow has only a handful of flour in a jar, little

172
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,240
 oil in a jug, and she is going to sit there, make the remaining of the food that I'm supposed

173
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:14,640
 to be eating with her servants and her son so she could go in and die. Yes! Yes! That's

174
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:23,920
 what I want you to do. So along the path of following God, you're going to have to overcome

175
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:33,560
 expectations and first impressions. You're going to have to trust that whatever you see

176
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:42,480
 before you is going to be more than you ever imagined. And sometimes when we have first

177
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:48,240
 impressions, we struggle with it. All of us love food. Hey, look, how many of our friends

178
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,320
 sit there on Instagram and have food collections where you take care of food? And a lot of

179
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,120
 times when we travel to all these different restaurants, right, we sit there and we think

180
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:00,000
 if the menu is kind of expensive, it's very nice, the food must be very good. And if we

181
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,640
 think it's a dumpy restaurant, the food must not be very good. But as many of you guys

182
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,120
 know, especially in Asia, we have all these hawker stalls where they have some of the

183
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:13,320
 most amazing food in these hawker stalls. For some of you who live—I'm 46 years old.

184
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:18,880
 I think Mark is a little bit older than I am, but I grew up here in Chinatown. And back

185
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,360
 in the days in Chinatown, there was this—Mark, I'm not sure if you remember, there was this

186
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,240
 old rundown restaurant called Golden Gate Restaurant. Golden Gate Restaurant was this

187
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:35,280
 hole in the wall where these old Chinese people, including my dad, would go every day. And

188
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,200
 for a dollar, you bought a cup of coffee and some toast, and you bought dim sum for like

189
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:48,160
 a dollar fifty. I still remember going with my dad all the time on Saturday, Sunday. He

190
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,160
 would sit there with his friends, there's cigarettes smoking everywhere, and my brother

191
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:56,120
 and sister and I would sit there in our own little table and eat dim sum for a dollar

192
00:19:56,120 --> 00:20:02,920
 something. It was the oldest, smelliest, dirtiest place you ever went to, right under Poy Tak

193
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:09,960
 Center, it's no longer there, but it had the best dim sum you ever had. But strictly

194
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:16,440
 by going in, you would never know. Because sometimes first impressions, sister says,

195
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:24,440
 "It doesn't allow God to work. Don't judge a book by its cover." It's a whole idea.

196
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:33,800
 And when we go into situations, we have to sit there and overcome expectations, overcome

197
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:40,440
 first impressions to see how God works. And then you're going to have to overcome physical

198
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:46,440
 impossibilities. We see it all throughout scriptures, don't we? Feeding up to 5,000,

199
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,560
 where Jesus takes some bread and some fish and was able to feed the 5,000. We see it

200
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:58,320
 in the walls of Jericho, where the Israelites go and the walls of Jericho come crumbling

201
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:04,000
 down. We see it with the story of David and Goliath, where tiny David, where all of the

202
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:10,960
 Israelite army are running away. But young David is able to defeat Goliath. You're going

203
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:21,440
 to have to overcome physical impossibilities to continue to follow after him. But yet,

204
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:28,320
 at the same time, he says, verse 13, "And Elijah says to her, 'Do not fear.'" And here's

205
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:39,920
 the key phrase as we begin to wrap up. "Go and do." Do not fear. Go and do. Why was Elijah

206
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:47,360
 able to do that? Because there's two things I think Elijah was able to figure out. Elijah,

207
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:53,120
 the Tishbit from Tishbi in Gilead, whose name literally means "My God is Jehovah," knew

208
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:59,920
 God's word. He knew God's word. He knew God's promises. But he also remembered what God

209
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:07,520
 did for him in the past. He rescued him out of Ahab and into Cherith. He watches the Lord

210
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:13,600
 provided for him through ravens and through a book and now sitting there in this situation,

211
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,400
 he knew that God was going to watch him. Probably not in the way he expected to do, so he's

212
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:26,600
 able to go and do. You and I, in the midst of following after God, in the midst of seeking

213
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,400
 God's will in our life, we're going to have to overcome physical impossibilities. We're

214
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:35,760
 going to have to overcome first impressions because God sees us. Now, along the journey

215
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,840
 of life, he's going to call us to do something, which sometimes we may be scared to do or

216
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:46,080
 we're going to face situations where we don't know what to do. And he's going to call us

217
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,480
 to trust in him because he will provide us according to his need. He calls us to go and

218
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:58,880
 do. But we're able to trust him if and when we continue to know God's word and we continue

219
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:05,680
 to remember what God did in the past and cling upon those memories. I leave this with one

220
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:12,560
 final story. I did youth ministry for about 18 years. I had this one student who grew

221
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:16,600
 up, I knew him all the way from junior high to high school to college, and when he graduated

222
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:23,480
 from the University of Michigan, he got married at a young age, 24 years old. He and his wife

223
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:32,760
 moved back to Seattle, and after being married at age 26, 27 I think, one day she had a headache.

224
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,280
 He was at work, he was an optometrist at Costco, and she had a headache. And the headache got

225
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:44,520
 so bad she went to the hospital by herself and she collapsed. And she had went into a

226
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:52,360
 coma and she never woke up. She had a brain aneurysm. And he never got the chance to say

227
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:59,200
 goodbye. He rushed over to the hospital and by then she was pretty much gone. And I asked

228
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,000
 him, I said, "What kept you going during that time? You never had a chance to say goodbye,

229
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,960
 you never even, you walked out of there that day, you never saw her again." She was also

230
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:21,040
 an only child, so her parents had to deal with it. And he says, "I had to choose to

231
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:31,680
 trust God's word in my life, and I trusted and remembered the memories of how he worked

232
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:38,200
 in our life, in our marriage, even though it was a short time. I had to trust that.

233
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:48,600
 I had to choose to trust that. God knows where you are. God knows where you're going. God

234
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:56,240
 knows what you need. But you're going to have to overcome first impressions. You're going

235
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:03,880
 to have to overcome expectations. And you're going to have to overcome physical impossibilities.

236
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:12,920
 The God that we love and choose, whose people in Israel turn on him a couple days later,

237
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:18,480
 who cries and yells to God in the Garden of Gethsemane, "Take this cup away from me,"

238
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:26,000
 which God chooses not to do, who dies on the cross, continues to be our inspiration of

239
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:35,920
 why we do what we do. And that's why as we enter Good Friday, as we enter Easter, we

240
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:42,200
 do have that confidence to overcome. We do have that confidence to overcome physical

241
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:50,400
 impossibility, expectations, because Jesus showed us on the cross of what that meant.

242
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:57,880
 He showed us what it meant to deal with the pain and the punishment so that you and I

243
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:08,880
 can be sitting here this morning. Let's pray. Father, thank you for the story of Elijah.

244
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:17,560
 The story of Elijah teaches us three wonderful things and three things that we need to overcome.

245
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:22,360
 Thank you for the stories that you give us through Scripture that guides us on where

246
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:31,320
 we must go, what we must do. Help us as we continue to go forth in our life to seek you

247
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,520
 every step of the way. Christ, we pray.

248
