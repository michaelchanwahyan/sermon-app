[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.480]   All right guys, let's turn to our Bible and we're going to work on the Apostles Creek and we've been
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:16.360]   Examining the basic of our faith the core beliefs of our faith and when people ask you what is
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.300]   Christianity all about and you should be able to give a ready answer, right?
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.440]   this is what the Creek of Apostles is all about right an ancient Creek almost 2,000 years old and
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.560]   Going back to almost the Apostolic Age
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.240]   So we are working through
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.440]   Possibly line by line
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.680]   Something like that and we started with the first statement and we're going to move on to the next section today
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.760]   But let's reveal the first statement. I believe God the Father Almighty
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.720]   Creator of heaven and earth. All right
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.900]   So I want you to really think about it because the Apostles Creek even though there's there are only 12 statements
[00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:04.220]   It's not a long document is pretty much a pocket size, right? You can fill into one screen on your phone
[00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.320]   But these 12 statements are the core beliefs the foundations of Christianity
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.620]   I believe in God the Father creator of heaven and earth and that statement the first one
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.180]   alone sets apart
[00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.580]   Christianity from all other religions
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.300]   Think about it. It sets apart
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.260]   Christianity from all other religions
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.860]   We live in the time of
[00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.900]   What we call pluralism, right? Everything should be considered equally, right?
[00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.820]   That's what pluralism means
[00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.260]   Or we value diversity
[00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.160]   We live in a time when we always hear people say
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:54.820]   All religions are the same right all religions are helping people to do good
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.460]   Right to help you improve
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.020]   And on all faiths the same, right?
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.740]   That is the cultural script. That is what the culture is telling us all
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.940]   Beliefs all religions are taught are teaching us how to be a better person
[00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.540]   That is the assumption right but this statement actually sets apart
[00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.500]   Christianity from all others think about Christianity and
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.340]   Buddhism
[00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.620]   Or Hinduism or Islam
[00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.780]   Are they all the same this statement says no because these
[00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.700]   Apostles creeds
[00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.100]   Begin with God being the creator of the universe and the world has a beginning
[00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.740]   the world has a
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.660]   beginning of a personal agent
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:56.260]   Someone has started the world God the creator it sets the Christian faith apart from many other
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.300]   Eastern religions
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.780]   for example Buddhism
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.940]   Is it also sets apart the biblical faith?
[00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.540]   from all other secular religions or
[00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.500]   ideologies right religions or ideologies
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.980]   atheism or
[00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.180]   materialism
[00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:18.020]   that belief
[00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.420]   essentially
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.980]   Matter is all there is right from eternal to eternal
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.740]   all
[00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.820]   matters
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.820]   But this statement says no
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.580]   The universe that we live in we are part of the universe
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.020]   exists all because of a
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:41.020]   personal God who created it and
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:43.900]   It has a reason to be
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.740]   This universe and you and me we exist. There was a reason right?
[00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.100]   But as I work through
[00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:00.100]   Some of the passages in the Bible that talks about the beginning of the universe you understand. It's not a scientific report, right?
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.540]   So get this. Okay. This is your take home
[00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.620]   Go out from this church
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.340]   The rest of the week don't even think that the Bible is this scientific report
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.460]   No, it is not is this an ancient document?
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.220]   It is a document from many many years ago
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.100]   however, God used those concepts to
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.660]   To to teach us
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:32.500]   That who is in charge and who started all right. So Genesis 1 and 2 are not
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.540]   Scientific reports. All right
[00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.420]   They are theological report the theological statements telling us who
[00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:44.580]   Is behind all of this?
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.980]   I was reading a very very old book our print book and
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.980]   Written by J. I Pecker. I think he said it's so right. So I want to quote it
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.020]   He in this book I want to be a Christian
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.500]   Written long time ago our print but he said it's so right
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.140]   He said Genesis wanted to tell us who?
[00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.740]   with so many answers about how
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:13.300]   Some today think this is a defect
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.380]   but in a long huge perspective of history our present-day scientific
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.860]   preoccupation with how rather than who looks very odd in itself
[00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.700]   rather than criticizing these chapters
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:32.660]   For not feeding our secular modern contemporary interest
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.940]   Scientific interest we should take from them Genesis 1 & 2
[00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.420]   Needed we built of our perverse passion
[00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:48.500]   For knowing the nature to creation without regard to what matter most mainly nature's creator
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.780]   We are obsessed with the how right?
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.420]   Technology science right they have their place, but we are sometimes
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.660]   totally obsessed by this
[00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:08.420]   We need to be rebuilt because we are interested in the how not the who the Bible tells us we should be concerned about the who
[00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:13.020]   Who do we worship and who do we follow? It's God himself the Creator
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:20.300]   He continues the message of these two chapters is this you have seen the sea the sky
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:23.220]   the Sun moon the stars and
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:30.460]   Wonderful complexity of the creation be it human beings and all that fantastic, isn't it? Well now meet the one
[00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.580]   Who is behind it all?
[00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.100]   Genesis 1 & 2 are telling us. Hey, you have enjoyed these works of art
[00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:42.820]   And now you must shake hands with the artist and you are thrilled by the music
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:46.260]   We now introduce you to the composer
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:51.700]   It is to show us the composer the artist the creator
[00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:56.100]   Rather than the creation. That's what Genesis is all about
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.460]   That's what Genesis 1 & 2 is all about and the Apostles Creek rightly
[00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:04.500]   Says that we believe in this Creator God himself
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:12.740]   Creator of heaven earth creator of our existence our world and then it continues to a huge section about
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.740]   Jesus Christ the Son of God
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:21.380]   Now you can tell from the highlight. This is the longest section of
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:30.100]   The whole Apostles Creek the longest section on Jesus Christ the central section the core of everything
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:38.100]   because there are short statements before the highlight and then there are short statements after it but
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.860]   these short statements
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.140]   sandwiched
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:43.940]   the middle and
[00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:45.620]   It is all about
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.260]   Christ himself Jesus Christ himself
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:50.540]   now Jesus
[00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:53.020]   It's a name. All right, that's the name
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.740]   in Greek
[00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.460]   or
[00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.660]   Greek is for Joshua and Joshua
[00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:05.220]   Was was originally a Hebrew name. So Joshua Jesus
[00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:07.900]   Mean the same thing
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:11.460]   It's a proper name, right just like you can call me mark, right?
[00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:17.740]   Now it tells us from the Bible that Jesus is
[00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.700]   the only Son of God and
[00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:22.940]   was Mary's son
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:24.780]   from virgin birth
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.820]   Now that means it is only possible
[00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.420]   with God's miracle
[00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:33.060]   the birth of Jesus a miracle child
[00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:40.420]   The accomplishment of the plan of God the redemption of God is only possible because God did
[00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:45.420]   Also tells us the humaneness of Jesus Christ his humanity
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:48.100]   He is from Nazareth
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:50.300]   in Galilee
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:53.820]   He was a carpenter a Jewish carpenter
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:09:01.700]   He worked for three years as a rabbi and was put to death as the statement says was crucified and died
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.580]   in a specific time
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:06.980]   in the time of Pontius Pilate
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.860]   right
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.060]   so all the statement tells us that
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:14.140]   Jesus was a
[00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.580]   historical person, right a
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:19.860]   You a historical person
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:27.900]   You are right someday you die. Hopefully you live some footprint in the book or so
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:29.900]   All right on a tombstone
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:32.980]   You are historical
[00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.700]   Jesus was historical but he's more than a historical figure
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:42.500]   Because what Jesus has said or what Jesus has done
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:47.220]   It's beyond what a human could do or could say
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.300]   So Jesus is the centerpiece of the Apostle's Creed
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:57.620]   And then I said Jesus is the name but Christ is a title
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:04.300]   All right, Christ is not a proper name. Just like pastor is not a name, right?
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.580]   You can call me mark, right? This is my proper name
[00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:16.220]   But my proper name is not pastor, right? The title is the pastor Christ is a title, right?
[00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:21.900]   Um, don't mistake it saying Jesus Christ because his last name is Christ
[00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:29.220]   Christ is not Chen. It's not Lee. It's not Smith or any last name, right? It's an office
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:30.780]   title
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:32.780]   It's from the Hebrew Bible from the Old Testament
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:34.780]   Messiah
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:38.540]   So Messiah is the Hebrew and then translated to Greek is Christ
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.620]   meaning anointed one
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:46.020]   In the Old Testament culture in the Hebrew culture whenever a king is being set apart
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.140]   To be to reign on earth to reign on behalf of God
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.860]   He is being set apart by pouring oil on his head on his hair
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.140]   Over his head that is anointment right to
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.340]   To set him apart as king
[00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:05.900]   Now so that's why Jesus Christ
[00:11:06.580 --> 00:11:13.540]   Means Jesus the Messiah, right Jesus the Christ the Messiah the king. It's a title
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:16.860]   only much later in the Christian
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:22.060]   Generations and generations after after Christ
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:25.900]   Christ becomes a proper name, right?
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:28.620]   from a proper
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.260]   Title become becoming a proper name. So that's why
[00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:37.420]   Even in the New Testament Jesus and Christ are synonymous
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:42.500]   You can call Christ Jesus or Jesus Christ, but you do know that the
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:50.660]   Word Christ means he is the king. He is being anointed by God. He died but rose again
[00:11:50.660 --> 00:11:57.860]   So he rightly reigns over all of us and even the universe when he comes back
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:06.660]   So whether we believe in Jesus Christ as the Bible says or not now, we still need to understand who Jesus really is. I
[00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.780]   Once had a conversation with a Buddhist monk in Chinatown
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.220]   Interesting, right?
[00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.100]   So we met in a community meeting
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:25.080]   Something like that and then after the meeting we kind of you know, shake hand and instills one another and then
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:30.140]   You know because they a Buddhist monk has a different dress, right?
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.900]   They got the rope right? I don't right and then I approach him and I
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.020]   Introduce myself. I'm I am
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:43.060]   My name is Mark, right and I'm Pastor Mark
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:51.180]   So he introduced himself and then we try to talk and then try to strike conversation and after the monk
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:55.820]   Learned that I'm a Christian church pastor and our conversation quickly
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:58.460]   Turn into as you can tell
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:04.380]   About our religions, right? And then this monk continues. He said oh
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.020]   Great your church pastor and we are the same
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:11.100]   And I was kind of astonished
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.900]   Yeah, really, you know, I didn't shake my head. Um
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:17.300]   He said we are the same
[00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:22.020]   Both your religion and my religion are essentially the same because we are teaching people how to do good, right?
[00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:28.720]   Oh, that's nice. You know, you're doing your part and I'm doing my part and I quickly answer, you know, respectively, of course
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:32.340]   Right, respectively. I said, um, you know what? Mr.
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.060]   monk, uh
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.460]   I
[00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:42.740]   Forgot his name. I forgot. He has his title. Yes. It's a very formal title. I said, hmm
[00:13:42.740 --> 00:13:45.900]   Not really
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:50.060]   And then he was kind of stunned and you know, I disagree with him, you know
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.620]   And I started to talk about you know, who Jesus is I
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:13:58.140]   Started to talk about who Jesus Christ is
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.700]   Right. He died on the cross to save us
[00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:04.900]   And he rose again. I
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:08.460]   Talked to him. We are being saved not because we do good
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.860]   We have been saved because someone else
[00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:18.220]   Did something on our behalf so that we are justified
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:24.620]   Right, so we become righteous at least positionally we become righteous
[00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:28.580]   so I so I can't kind of counter and then
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:31.740]   finally, you know after
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.820]   my, you know impromptu preaching
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.420]   to him
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:40.140]   He said okay, maybe the two religions are with a different I
[00:14:42.060 --> 00:14:49.220]   Said of course, we're different right what we expect you you try to teach people to do good
[00:14:49.220 --> 00:14:55.420]   But you know is apple and orange right you can't say okay we are
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:02.500]   You know, you don't say you don't say dogs and cats are the same because both of them have four legs, right?
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:11.060]   Simply because of that right the comments the lowest common denominator, right? I think that's a logical fallacy, right?
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.020]   you got to
[00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:18.460]   Compare and contrast right in order to know the essence of the two, right?
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:25.420]   As I said in the beginning our culture is telling us everything is the same all are the same
[00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:27.860]   But you know, I bet to be the differ
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.020]   And the Bible does that too?
[00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:34.100]   Romans 5
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:40.620]   Romans 5 Paul is writing to the church. He said you see at just the right time
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:43.140]   When we were still powerless
[00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:46.580]   Christ died for the ungodly
[00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:55.140]   Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man. Though for good men someone might possibly dare to die
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:16:01.860]   But God demonstrates his own love for us in this look at this
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:05.420]   While we were still sinners Christ died for us
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:08.220]   This is there's not a hint of
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.780]   Improvement. There's not a hint of
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:18.980]   Being better so I can come to Christ. No, there's not a clue here
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:24.080]   We begin with the premise that we are sinners
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.740]   It says we are sinners. We are powerless. We are condemned and
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:32.580]   The pastor says we are ungodly
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:37.580]   Let me focus on this
[00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:44.020]   Emphasize this I emphasize this to many many people even those who have come to church for many many years
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:49.220]   Somehow so we don't get it. You know, let me emphasize this the Bible
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:51.580]   the Bible
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:54.980]   The Bible is not about teaching us to do good
[00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:58.980]   Scripture
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:06.020]   It's not about teaching you and me to do good, all right, so people are pretty stunned when I said this, right
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:10.340]   I remember that one time I was in the church. I was talking to
[00:17:10.340 --> 00:17:14.500]   Quite a few people from from China
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:19.740]   Actually, I was in Tel Aviv. I was in Israel. They have a little Chinese church there
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:27.180]   So I was invited to to speak so after speaking I was just discussing with some some of the people
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:33.380]   There and some of them are Christian some of them are not and I said that in order to stun them, you know in order to
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:39.900]   Shock, you know, I said, you know, we're looking at the Bible right? The Bible is not about teaching us to do good and
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.340]   They were like what?
[00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:49.540]   Because they have some sort of you know, notion of sacredness, right? This scripture, of course is about it's something good, right?
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:56.760]   Something to teach us good. No, I said no, I never found a verse in the Bible that teach us to do good
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:00.420]   They said Willie. I said yes, I'm serious
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:07.780]   Look at me. I'm pastor. Okay. I'm telling you the Bible is not about teaching us to do good to be good
[00:18:07.780 --> 00:18:12.900]   Let me say this again. The Bible the biblical faith is not about self-improvement
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:18.020]   So that we can be a better moral persons
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.260]   No
[00:18:20.260 --> 00:18:23.460]   Never find any word or verse in the Bible. I
[00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:26.620]   Really don't I study Bible for
[00:18:26.620 --> 00:18:29.660]   quite some years
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.020]   I really don't find any self-help
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.300]   moral lessons in the Bible I
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:37.620]   don't
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.940]   The Bible is not telling us to do good. No instead
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:44.940]   the Bible
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:48.740]   Is showing us we cannot do good
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:56.760]   We are not good and never can we be good enough that's what the Bible says
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:19:05.420]   The Bible says you cannot be good and you never
[00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:09.580]   Never can you be good enough?
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.260]   We are sinners
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:15.540]   We are powerless
[00:19:15.540 --> 00:19:17.540]   We're powerless to do good
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:21.260]   We're condemned in our sin in death
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:28.860]   So, what can we do that's what the Bible says Jesus came
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:34.180]   Jesus came to save us. That is the good news
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:39.140]   That is the gospel. That is what the Bible is trying to do
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:45.180]   So when we come to the Apostles Creek trying to understand who Jesus is
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:48.180]   Consider
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:52.420]   Carefully
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:54.420]   Who Jesus is?
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:20:01.500]   If the Bible is the gospel is all about improving ourselves, you know being better so that we can come to church
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.860]   We can come before God
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:06.020]   Then Jesus didn't have to die, right?
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:12.540]   Jesus have to do whatever he has done or say whatever he has said, right?
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:21.020]   As we call in the Bible Jesus has said something and did something and many things that is beyond
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.460]   typical human
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.660]   Can do or can say I?
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:32.300]   Still think the way CS Lewis word this so well in his classic
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:34.900]   mere Christianity
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:41.220]   Now he was talking about who Jesus is and let me quote this kind of a long quote
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.340]   I was CS Lewis
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.420]   Once passed away many many years ago. He used to be a Oxford
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:50.540]   English
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:52.220]   literature guy
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:55.020]   Scholar he wrote this book mere Christianity
[00:20:55.020 --> 00:20:57.660]   He's talking about who Jesus is
[00:20:57.660 --> 00:21:02.580]   He said I'm trying here to prevent anyone saying the worldly foolish thing
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:06.380]   That people often say about him being Jesus Christ
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:12.140]   I'm ready to the people are saying I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher
[00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:16.180]   But I don't accept his claim to be God
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.600]   That is one thing we must not say said Lewis
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.860]   He said a man
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.500]   who was merely a man and
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:32.740]   Said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. Think about it
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:35.620]   He said right if
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:37.620]   Jesus said what he said
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:41.260]   He would not be a great moral teacher. No way
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:44.860]   He is
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.060]   either a
[00:21:47.060 --> 00:21:49.820]   Lunatic or
[00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:52.420]   He would be the devil help
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:59.660]   Think about it. Whatever Jesus said in the full gospel or in the New Testament recorded
[00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:03.860]   He
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.580]   Would not be a great moral teacher no way and
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:11.460]   You must make your choice Lewis continues
[00:22:11.460 --> 00:22:19.660]   Either this man Jesus was and is the Son of God or else a madman or something worse
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:22.180]   You can shut him up
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.820]   for a fool you can spill at him and
[00:22:24.820 --> 00:22:29.060]   Kill him crucify him as a demon
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:37.420]   Or you can fall as feet and call him Lord and God but let us not come with a nonsense
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.420]   About him being a great moral teacher
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:48.100]   He has not left that choice open to us and he did not intend to
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:51.100]   Now that is the well-known
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.260]   Trilemma of says Lewis
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:23:03.900]   Trilemma means there's only three choices that is before us only three choices either Jesus is a lunatic
[00:23:03.900 --> 00:23:06.900]   crazy man or
[00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:09.340]   Jesus is a liar
[00:23:09.340 --> 00:23:14.540]   someone who has deceived many many people even the sensible people or
[00:23:14.540 --> 00:23:17.660]   He is indeed what he came to be
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:23.460]   He's a lunatic or liar or the Lord of all
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:30.580]   He's got himself so think about it. I think this is pretty well word
[00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:34.620]   What the Bible is all about what gospel is all about? I?
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:40.140]   Often hear people say, you know when I invite them to come to church, right?
[00:23:40.140 --> 00:23:46.540]   They often respond. Oh, I'm not good enough to go to church, right? I'm not as holy as you are
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:52.540]   Right, you guys are holy you can come to the church. All right, but you know, I kind of you know
[00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.300]   I'm not gonna come right because this is too sacred
[00:23:57.300 --> 00:23:59.260]   No
[00:23:59.260 --> 00:24:01.260]   No
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.500]   No
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:07.860]   And they always respond oh, let me do better so I can come to church
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:11.420]   We think
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:13.580]   That's not what the Bible says
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:20.340]   And that is the very reason that we are not holy. We sinners that we come to church
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:26.100]   We come to the cross and Jesus died for us. I
[00:24:26.100 --> 00:24:32.220]   Think one of the best passages that talks about the person and work of Jesus Christ is
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:35.340]   Philippians 2
[00:24:35.340 --> 00:24:37.700]   Let me read that and expand on that
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:43.420]   Your attitude should be the same as the attitude of Christ Jesus
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:47.100]   Who
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:54.300]   Being in fairy nature of God did not consider equality with God something to be grabs
[00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.540]   But made himself nothing
[00:24:57.540 --> 00:25:00.540]   But this that this is trickier
[00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:03.340]   the I
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:06.020]   Think in English as well in Greek
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:12.100]   There was some something called reflexive pronoun, you know reflexive
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.780]   meaning of a word
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:20.740]   Reflexive meaning meaning there's an action that you do not to others
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:23.740]   But you do it to yourself
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.020]   That is called reflexiveness, right?
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.820]   Self-reflexiveness
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.820]   He made himself nothing
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:39.020]   He made himself nothing he chose to do that to himself
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:42.740]   No one forced him
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:48.180]   But he did it all because of his willingness
[00:25:48.180 --> 00:25:53.140]   To make himself nothing even though he was very nature of God
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:26:01.180]   He made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness
[00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:06.180]   Being found in the appearance of men
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:13.500]   He humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on the cross
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:16.140]   therefore
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:23.140]   God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name
[00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:30.100]   that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow in heaven on earth and under the earth and
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:37.900]   Every tongue confessed that Jesus is the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord to the glory of God the Father
[00:26:37.900 --> 00:26:41.220]   That is the good news
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:45.380]   That is what the church is preaching
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:48.460]   That is what the Bible is all about
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.460]   Jesus did it
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.500]   To us
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:27:03.320]   Accomplish the salvation for all of us and die for our sins and he did he did it willingly as a slave
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.340]   Without his own self-will
[00:27:06.380 --> 00:27:11.700]   But only will of the Father to save you and me who are powerless in our sin
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:17.300]   So that we can be called children of God now, how how would this good news?
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:22.340]   affect or change our way and our attitude I
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:29.020]   Think it will change and it should change all of us radically
[00:27:29.020 --> 00:27:34.580]   Think about all the relationships that we have with our friends
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:39.620]   Without other church members brother and sister in Christ
[00:27:39.620 --> 00:27:46.980]   In fact what this passage is all about is about church life verse 5 your attitude
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.940]   Your attitude as a church to one another
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:57.060]   Your attitude should be the same as the attitude of Christ Jesus. He did it to himself
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:05.580]   He laid down his own right to die on the cross as a slave. We ought to use this kind of attitude
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.620]   Toward one another to care for one another
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:15.980]   That will affect or that would change our relationship with one another
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:21.340]   To love and to build up each other and forgive one another right?
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:27.660]   Now to extend this application it will affect
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.060]   Our marriages as well
[00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:36.540]   Right two sinners living together broken
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.340]   Not easy
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.660]   But in light of what Christ has done
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:47.780]   Yes, we're broken but we are totally forgiven right
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:56.660]   Because of the grace of God that should change how we relate to one another right how spouses relate to one another
[00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:01.500]   How spouses should forgive one another to the love one another totally
[00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:05.580]   And how it should change our way to live
[00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:10.460]   We are the instrument of God the great price of salvation
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:16.980]   Jesus has paid for is to redeem us so that we do not belong to anyone
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.940]   But God himself alone
[00:29:19.940 --> 00:29:22.900]   We are his instrument
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:25.820]   We are to be used by God himself
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:29.340]   We are the instrument of the gospel
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:35.380]   You go back to your campus you go back to your family you go back to your workplace
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:41.780]   You take a totally different role because God is using us
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:47.780]   Using us as instrument to invite other people to experience the grace of God
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:57.300]   Let me end with the Apostles Creek and if you have the same conviction I invite you to recite
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.780]   The Apostles Creek with me
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.460]   The Apostles Creek
[00:30:04.460 --> 00:30:07.980]   Let's do it together. I believe in God the Father Almighty
[00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.100]   creator of heaven and earth I
[00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.380]   Believe in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord
[00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.940]   He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:27.260]   He suffered under Pontius Pilate was crucified died and was buried. He descended to the dead on the third day
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:31.780]   He rose again. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father
[00:30:31.780 --> 00:30:34.580]   He will come again to judge the living and the dead
[00:30:34.580 --> 00:30:41.340]   I believe in the Holy Spirit the Holy Universal Church the chameleon of saints the forgiveness of sins
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:44.820]   the resurrection of the body and life everlasting
[00:30:44.820 --> 00:30:47.540]   Amen, let's all pray together
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:55.700]   Father we kneel our belief and understanding of your love of your grace and thank you
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:58.780]   For what Christ Jesus our Lord has done
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.860]   He is indeed the Lord of all
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:04.260]   He is indeed our King
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:07.340]   And we pray that you renew
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:10.420]   our sense of your grace
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:19.700]   So great of a salvation that while we were sinners while we were powerless while we were your enemies
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:22.620]   You came to save us
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:30.140]   Forgive all of our sins and our guilt and to heal us and to bring us back to you
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:33.980]   So that you
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.860]   our Holy God
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:37.860]   we can stand before you as
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.100]   justified
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.340]   Righteous all because of what your Son has done for us
[00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:50.740]   And we will give you thanks and praise you because you deserve all praises
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:53.540]   And
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.900]   Lord indeed
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.900]   We are redeemed
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.780]   by your great love and we pray that
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:06.140]   With your great love with your grace you renew and use us
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.940]   In the rest of the week we can be your instruments
[00:32:10.940 --> 00:32:14.500]   To bring peace and love and your grace
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:20.060]   To our family to our marriage to our
[00:32:21.020 --> 00:32:25.260]   Neighborhood to our campuses and pray that you will send us
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:28.380]   send us with this mission and
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:35.020]   Depending on your grace. We will be used by you for your glory in Christ name. Amen
