1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,200
 - Alright, before we turn to scripture,

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,120
 why don't we spend some time to pray together, alright?

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,620
 Why don't we spend some time to pray?

4
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:08,960
 And before we pray, I want to ask you a question,

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,560
 you know, in the presence of God.

6
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,920
 Is there anything, something in your heart,

7
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,340
 in your mind you have to unload?

8
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,940
 Alright, maybe some worries, maybe some issues,

9
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,880
 maybe some challenges in your life.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,320
 Maybe some anger, some depression,

11
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,960
 some of the unhappy feelings.

12
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,960
 God can take it, you know?

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,960
 And this is the best moment we can come before God, alright?

14
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,040
 Let's spend a minute or two, pray to God.

15
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:50,520
 Father, we do come before you knowing

16
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,960
 that you are our loving God.

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,960
 And you can take all the garbage in our mind and our heart.

18
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,120
 No matter what that is, with the worries that we have,

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,720
 the despair that we sense, or the challenges

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,720
 that we are facing, and we are exhausted,

21
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,040
 we are just drained.

22
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,840
 We can come before you knowing

23
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,620
 that we can cast our burdens to you.

24
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,040
 Thank you for being our loving God.

25
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,960
 Thank you for even taking all this emotions,

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,960
 even so-called negative emotions.

27
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,040
 You can take it.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,820
 And thank you for being there to listen to us,

29
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:34,200
 to being with us.

30
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,080
 Thank you for the fact that you are leading our church,

31
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:41,920
 leading our lives, and we come before you to know that,

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,520
 to acknowledge that you are our strength.

33
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,600
 Grant us the strength that we need.

34
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,160
 For those who are studying, for those who are coming

35
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,680
 to the end of the semester, with final exams

36
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:59,520
 and all the assignments, and I pray that you will grant

37
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,320
 each and every one of us the wisdom, the strength,

38
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:07,320
 the discipline to go on, knowing that your grace

39
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,400
 is always sufficient.

40
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,960
 For those who are struggling with family matters

41
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,120
 and the demands from our work,

42
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,560
 we do know that you are our rock,

43
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,720
 and we can depend on you, we can rely on you.

44
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,600
 And that's why we come to worship you.

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,880
 That's why we come to give thanks to you,

46
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:28,920
 to count the blessing that you are still providing for us.

47
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,480
 And thank you very much for being our father,

48
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,120
 being our God.

49
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,280
 And most of all, thank you for the love and salvation

50
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,720
 that we have in Christ Jesus, that we are your people.

51
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,280
 We are your sons and daughters.

52
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,980
 Thank you, in Christ name we pray.

53
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,320
 Now we come to our mini series

54
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,760
 on the pagan kings in the Bible.

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,520
 And last week, we talked about one of the pagan kings,

56
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,400
 who is Cyrus the Great.

57
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,320
 Cyrus the Great is a Persian king.

58
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:05,520
 And today we're going to chapter five

59
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,200
 of the book of Daniel, all right?

60
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,480
 If you have your phone and you have your Bible,

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,480
 please turn with me to chapter five of Daniel.

62
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,760
 If you can find the book of Daniel,

63
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,160
 it is in the Old Testament,

64
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,600
 especially in the prophetical books,

65
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,560
 one of the prophetical books, all right?

66
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,120
 So we're gonna talk about this king,

67
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,760
 it's called Belsasha.

68
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:30,960
 Let's go back to this timeline.

69
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:35,960
 I kind of zoom into this timeline we share from last week.

70
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:39,320
 And we talk about Cyrus.

71
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:43,320
 You can see Cyrus on here, right in the middle,

72
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,880
 right at the bottom.

73
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:49,880
 Cyrus, who became the emperor of the Persian kingdom.

74
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,280
 And at the same time, that was the last,

75
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,320
 very last period of the Babylonian kingdom,

76
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:02,320
 the Babylonian empire from 626 to 539.

77
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:08,360
 And you see on top, there's a bar.

78
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,800
 There were two kings, right?

79
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:14,200
 Nebuchadnezzar and Belsasha.

80
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,080
 And I talked to you about how we going to approach

81
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,240
 studying the figures in the Bible,

82
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,640
 especially the pagan kings.

83
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,960
 First of all, we have to profile them, right?

84
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,280
 We have to profile them from scriptures

85
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,960
 or from sources outside of the Bible.

86
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:29,360
 And then we come to the Bible,

87
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,720
 and let's see what the Bible says about pagan kings,

88
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,840
 about this or this king.

89
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,440
 So in the end of Babylonian empire,

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,520
 there were two kings ruling the empire.

91
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,320
 The top one is Nebuchadnezzar,

92
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,760
 and the guy below him is his eldest son,

93
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,240
 his firstborn son, Belsasha,

94
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,320
 which is mentioned in the book of Daniel chapter five.

95
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:56,480
 And this is a funny story,

96
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,920
 and I want to go through this story with you.

97
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
 But you need to understand

98
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,240
 at the end of the Babylonian empire,

99
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,240
 when the power of Babylon is declining

100
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,760
 and the empire is coming to a crumbling

101
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,560
 and collapsing, and the last king is Belsasha.

102
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,560
 Belsasha is the co-region of his father, Nebuchadnezzar.

103
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,080
 And we are coming to the year 539, 539.

104
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,480
 And some of the background here,

105
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:41,160
 when Nebuchadnezzar became king, it was year 555.

106
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,400
 And for some reason, he ruled the Babylonian kingdom

107
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,520
 for a few years, and then he left the capital.

108
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,280
 And then he moved to an oasis in northern Arabia

109
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,600
 for 10 years.

110
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,880
 And he's kind of a very strange character,

111
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,200
 even for historians,

112
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,400
 is trying to understand why he moved away from the capital.

113
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,840
 And then when he moved away from the capital,

114
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,760
 he gave his kingship and trusted kingship

115
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,600
 to his son, Belsasha.

116
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,500
 So that's why we have two kings there.

117
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,160
 The top guy, number one, is Nebuchadnezzar.

118
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,680
 And then the second guy is called Belsasha,

119
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,360
 his firstborn son.

120
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,920
 And practically, Belsasha in the Bible or in history

121
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:25,440
 is the last king of Babylonian empire.

122
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,220
 So that's when we come to chapter five of Daniel.

123
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,380
 And this is a funny story.

124
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:36,280
 So I want to go through some of the content of this story

125
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,980
 and to think about what the Bible or what God sees

126
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,100
 in this king.

127
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,940
 Chapter five, verse one.

128
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:47,060
 King Belsasha gave a great banquet

129
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,060
 for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.

130
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:55,020
 While Belsasha was drinking his wine,

131
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,020
 he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets

132
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:04,540
 that Nebuchadnezzar, okay, Nebuchadnezzar,

133
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,560
 Nebuchadnezzar's father had taken from the temple

134
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,040
 in Jerusalem so that the king and his nobles

135
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,860
 and his wives and concubines might drink from them.

136
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,760
 What do you think?

137
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,400
 As a big banquet, I don't know if you've been

138
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,680
 to a big banquet before.

139
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,320
 The biggest one I've been to is like 100 tables.

140
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,920
 It's huge in a hotel conference room.

141
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:32,280
 You know, people are so happy and we just drink

142
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,080
 all we want, open bar and all that.

143
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,360
 It's kind of like this situation here.

144
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,780
 Belsasha, chapter five of Daniel.

145
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,200
 So he gave a great banquet to thousands of his noble

146
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,820
 and all his cabinet and new government officials

147
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:50,200
 are gathered together, his wives and his concubine

148
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,160
 and everyone is drinking.

149
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,400
 And then, you know, all of a sudden,

150
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,720
 he gave the order to have the vessels

151
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,360
 that his so-called father or the founder

152
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,280
 of the Babylonian empire, Nebuchadnezzar.

153
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,120
 Oh my God.

154
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,480
 Nebuchadnezzar.

155
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:14,680
 And then he captured the temple of Jerusalem.

156
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,680
 You remember that?

157
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,200
 586 BC.

158
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,160
 And then he took some of the vessels,

159
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:22,160
 gold and silver vessels, or maybe the Ark of the Covenant

160
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,200
 as well, so all the valuables, all the precious things,

161
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,240
 he captured from the temple and he captured them

162
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,280
 to his capital, Babylon.

163
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,840
 Now, Belsasha came much later.

164
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:38,560
 He was having a big banquet and then he was so happy,

165
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,680
 I guess, and then he used some of the vessels

166
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,640
 from the temple of Jerusalem.

167
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:51,200
 So it's a big banquet and then he used some of the vessels,

168
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,080
 you know, cups and plates and instruments

169
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,040
 from the Jerusalem temple to use them to drink wine.

170
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,200
 You see?

171
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,560
 To drink wine.

172
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,440
 Now, a little bit background here.

173
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,600
 Whenever the Bible talks about banquet,

174
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,600
 it's not just a wedding banquet.

175
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,040
 It's not just a happy party together.

176
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,080
 It always has religious and political meaning.

177
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,240
 So when the king gathers his cabinet, right here,

178
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,980
 and he make offerings to all the gods.

179
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,960
 So when they get together having food and feast together

180
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,920
 and then drink together, it has political

181
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,640
 and religious reason.

182
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,120
 And the reason being, they want to please the gods.

183
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:40,240
 Please the gods of the kingdom.

184
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,960
 Please all the gods and the purpose is to secure

185
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:45,920
 the approval of the gods.

186
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,120
 It's to secure their blessing,

187
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,080
 especially for the coming year.

188
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,480
 So usually this kind of banquet, this kind of feasting

189
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,280
 happens in New Year.

190
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,560
 In the New Year, they want to secure the approval

191
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,720
 of the gods for the coming year.

192
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,720
 So that's why they gather the temple vessels,

193
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:10,840
 not only from Jerusalem, but from other places.

194
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,520
 Remember Babylon captured, you know,

195
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,840
 pretty much the whole world back then.

196
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,720
 And then they destroy some of the temples

197
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,960
 and they capture their gold and silver vessels

198
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:26,560
 and brought them to the capital.

199
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,960
 So this is the scene that, you know,

200
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:32,360
 not only the Jerusalem vessels are being used,

201
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,320
 all these other gods' temple vessels

202
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,160
 are being brought together for them to drink wine.

203
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,440
 And what they do is that they will offer sacrifices

204
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,440
 and libation to the gods for the purpose of,

205
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,480
 you know, pleasing the gods so that the gods will bless you.

206
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,960
 So in short, the purpose is to secure

207
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:00,240
 the approval of the deities, to please them

208
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,800
 so that they will bless his plan and bless his policies

209
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,700
 for, especially for the coming year.

210
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:12,680
 So in such a banquet, the king would expect the gods

211
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:17,760
 to be happy, you know, to rob us of their plans.

212
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,520
 So here, this story, the funny thing is,

213
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:28,280
 when the king expected the gods to say something,

214
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,880
 God did show up.

215
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:32,000
 God did show up.

216
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,840
 And that's the most surprising thing.

217
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:37,000
 Verse five and following.

218
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,080
 And suddenly, the fingers of a human hand appear

219
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,440
 and roll on the plaster of the wall

220
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,400
 near the lampstand in the royal palace.

221
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,320
 And the king watched the hand as it rolled,

222
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,760
 his face turned pale and he was so frightened

223
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,760
 and his knees knocked together and his legs gave way.

224
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,320
 Now that's the funny thing.

225
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,640
 You expect gods to say something

226
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,880
 and then here the true gods show up, all right?

227
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:16,880
 So this is a story of the origin of the English idiom,

228
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,520
 writing on the wall, right?

229
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,640
 And that's where it come from, writing on the wall.

230
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,880
 What he saw was there's a hand writing something on the wall

231
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:30,680
 and it is pretty interesting and also surprising.

232
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,880
 If you've been to like British Museum

233
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,600
 or there's a very, very good museum in Chicago,

234
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,600
 you know that?

235
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,640
 It's called Oriental Museum, University of Chicago.

236
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,560
 Anyone been there?

237
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,440
 No?

238
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,680
 Oh my God.

239
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,800
 Oh, you've been there, good.

240
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,120
 That's great, that's great.

241
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,680
 Yeah, there's only one person here.

242
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,040
 This is the Oriental Museum in University of Chicago

243
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,480
 is a world-class museum and it's also free.

244
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,520
 You know, it takes free donation.

245
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:04,280
 Someday maybe we should go there for a field trip, all right?

246
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,240
 There's tons of things you can see.

247
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,080
 If you pay attention to the wall reliefs

248
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:15,680
 in the Assyrian or Babylonian gallery,

249
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,680
 there's no space on the wall.

250
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:23,160
 It's not like our side drywall.

251
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,280
 There's no spaces on the wall you can put something on it

252
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:32,280
 because every single inch of the wall

253
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:34,760
 is filled with either the king's figure

254
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,760
 or the god's figures or trees and the lion hunt

255
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,320
 and all that stuff.

256
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,960
 There's no space in the wall

257
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,480
 and that is the most surprising things.

258
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,920
 There's no space in the wall

259
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,960
 but all of a sudden a human hand show up

260
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:54,360
 and trying to write something on the wall.

261
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,040
 Now, this is from Daniel five.

262
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,840
 And then once they saw the writings,

263
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,560
 no one can interpret the writings on the wall.

264
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,600
 And you can imagine scenes like this.

265
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,440
 This is the famous painting by,

266
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,880
 in the 17th century,

267
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,680
 talking about this story.

268
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,800
 When the king look to the wall,

269
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,600
 all of a sudden there was some writings showing up.

270
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:29,320
 And they're trying to interpret the meaning

271
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,520
 or the significance of those writings.

272
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,000
 And 518, it says,

273
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,880
 Daniel is being called up

274
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,480
 because he is the only guy in the court,

275
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:45,480
 in the empire, who can interpret like this kind of writings.

276
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,840
 What does it mean?

277
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:52,560
 So he's being called up to the king

278
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,280
 and Daniel said,

279
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,920
 O king, the most high God gave your father, Nebuchadnezzar,

280
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:03,080
 sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor.

281
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:08,920
 And he, Daniel also talk about how God had humble his father

282
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,360
 or great grandfather, Nebuchadnezzar,

283
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,840
 when he was filled with pride.

284
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,200
 That is from the previous chapter, Daniel four.

285
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:21,960
 And now, writings show up on the wall,

286
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,560
 writings on the wall.

287
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,880
 And Daniel said,

288
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,160
 no, you have forgotten how God has humble

289
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,640
 your great grandfather.

290
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,640
 518.

291
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,200
 And then 22.

292
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,560
 He said, but you, his son,

293
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,000
 as his later generation,

294
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,760
 O Belsusha, you have not humbled yourself,

295
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,560
 though you knew all this.

296
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:51,760
 Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven.

297
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,920
 You praise the gods of silver and gold

298
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,760
 and of bronze, iron, wood, and stone,

299
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,320
 which cannot see or hear or understand.

300
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:06,200
 But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand

301
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,680
 your life and all of your ways.

302
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:18,040
 You have seen how God had humble previous king,

303
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,880
 and now you are filled with pride

304
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:24,160
 because you took the vessels from the Jerusalem temple

305
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,000
 and you thought that God would approve you

306
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,480
 or God would be pleased.

307
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,800
 No, Daniel said, God is not pleased.

308
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,760
 524.

309
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:38,760
 Therefore, God sent a hand that wrote the inscription,

310
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:42,800
 and this is the inscription that was written.

311
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,680
 Many, many, tickle, passing.

312
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,320
 What do they mean?

313
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,800
 Of course we don't know, right?

314
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,760
 Many, many, tickle, passing is Aramaic.

315
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,960
 Aramaic, it's not Hebrew, it's not Greek.

316
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,240
 Part of the Old Testament is written in Aramaic,

317
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:09,200
 and many, many, or many, many means number,

318
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,400
 counting, one, two, three, four, five.

319
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:14,560
 And it's repeated twice to stress that

320
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:18,200
 God's decision is certain.

321
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,520
 It will be fulfilled because God is counting the numbers.

322
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,360
 What kind of numbers?

323
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,880
 We have to interpret it.

324
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,640
 And then tickle means waiting.

325
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:33,840
 Waiting, like putting things on scale, you know?

326
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:40,120
 Passing means divided, divided or separation.

327
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,600
 So the message literally means numbered,

328
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,960
 numbered, weighted, and divided.

329
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,880
 And those words are, as I said, in Aramaic,

330
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:55,680
 and Aramaic was the international language of the time.

331
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,480
 Remember what year was that?

332
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,600
 539, right?

333
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,440
 Sixth century BC.

334
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,080
 In the ancient New Year's world,

335
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:10,080
 the international language at that time was Aramaic.

336
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,920
 So the king and the officials were actually able

337
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,060
 to read Aramaic.

338
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,400
 Many, many, tickle, passing, they can read it.

339
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,200
 What they don't understand, or they need someone

340
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,260
 like Daniel to interpret, is what it means.

341
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,880
 What does it really mean?

342
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,560
 What those words mean or signify?

343
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,080
 So they need some help, and Daniel is trying to help them

344
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,800
 to give them the interpretation.

345
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,640
 What does it mean?

346
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,940
 Many, many, tickle, passing?

347
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:43,080
 Number, number, weighted, and divided.

348
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:45,040
 And Daniel comes along and he said,

349
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:49,240
 "This is what these Aramaic words mean.

350
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:52,700
 "Many, God has numbered the days of your reign

351
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,280
 "and brought it to an end."

352
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:00,960
 Tickle, you have been weighed on the scales

353
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,120
 and found wanting, so you don't match up.

354
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:11,080
 Paris, or passing, your kingdom is divided

355
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,660
 and will be given to the Medes and Persians.

356
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:19,380
 So these words are actually God's evaluation

357
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:23,040
 of Belsash's kingdom.

358
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,560
 And God is using these words to pronounce

359
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,960
 his upcoming judgment on Belsash.

360
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,840
 529, "Then at Belsash's command,

361
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:37,480
 "Daniel was clothed in purple,

362
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,520
 "a gold chain was placed around his neck,

363
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:44,320
 "and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler

364
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,440
 "in the kingdom."

365
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,800
 Now, why the third?

366
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,640
 Why number three?

367
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,120
 Why number three?

368
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,680
 Remember the background?

369
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:57,680
 The top guy was Nebuchadnezzar.

370
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,600
 Nebuchadnezzar.

371
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,440
 The second guy is Belsash, right here.

372
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,280
 And then because Daniel could interpret

373
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:07,080
 the significance of the message, or the words,

374
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,900
 he is now being promoted to the third.

375
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,280
 You see what I'm saying?

376
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,280
 Now, before the archeologists find the name Belsash,

377
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:20,480
 people are doubting about the reliability of scripture.

378
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,240
 They were saying there's no king called Belsash in this world

379
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:27,160
 and then all of a sudden, some British guy

380
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:32,160
 came to the Middle East some years ago

381
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:37,160
 and then he was taking in the archeological site

382
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,160
 and then they find some cuneiform tablet,

383
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,600
 some clay tablet, and then they translate it

384
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,280
 and then Belsash was being mentioned

385
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:48,120
 as the eldest son of Nebuchadnezzar.

386
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,760
 And now we know why this verse says Belsash

387
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:56,240
 is raising Daniel to the position number three

388
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,320
 in his kingdom.

389
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:00,920
 Because Nebuchadnezzar, Belsash, and then Daniel.

390
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,480
 Now this is also interesting.

391
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,600
 Not only the reliability of scripture,

392
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:10,200
 but it also makes perfect, kind of interesting

393
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,200
 is that Belsash knows that these are the meanings

394
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,360
 of the words I will make, that God is counting down

395
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,120
 his kingdom, but Belsash did not know

396
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,000
 that his kingdom is coming to an end so quickly.

397
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,360
 You know, faster than he imagined.

398
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:40,560
 In the last verse of this passage, verses 30 and 31,

399
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:46,480
 that very night, Belsash, king of Babylonians,

400
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,480
 was slain and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom

401
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,320
 at the age of 62.

402
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,240
 Now Darius the Mede is also another question here,

403
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,920
 but it should refer to Cyrus the Great.

404
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,200
 So that night, that night, that very night,

405
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:11,240
 Cyrus came and Persian kingdom took over Babylon.

406
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:15,720
 And from secular history, we know we can even

407
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,360
 find out what that day is.

408
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:23,360
 It's October 12th, 539 BC, October 12th.

409
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:28,800
 We can calculate so precisely that we know October 12th,

410
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:34,720
 the army of Persian kingdom march into the capital city,

411
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,000
 Babylon, of Babylonian empire,

412
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,900
 and then the empire crumbles and it fell.

413
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,120
 It happened overnight.

414
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,860
 Now what are the take-homes from this story,

415
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:47,760
 this interesting story from Belshasha?

416
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,240
 First, it says clearly that God is sovereign

417
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,440
 over all earthly powers.

418
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,160
 All the earthly kingdoms are in God's hands

419
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:05,560
 and God's power is transcendent over all of them.

420
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,920
 Any kingdom, in the ancient time, Babylonian kingdom,

421
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,920
 Persian kingdom, Greek kingdom, the Roman empire,

422
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:18,820
 any empire, even today, God's power

423
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,100
 is over all earthly kingdoms.

424
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:26,160
 Maybe United States, Russia, China, EU,

425
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:33,700
 all the earthly kingdoms, all of these earthly kingdoms

426
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:39,660
 and treasures come and go, rise and fall of empires.

427
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:44,260
 And so often we think our kingdoms will last,

428
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:48,920
 will continue forever, as long as we live.

429
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:52,420
 No, the Bible says, here the Bible uses a story

430
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:56,300
 to tell you the theology or the philosophy of history.

431
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,780
 This is how God sees history,

432
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:02,300
 how God sees historical kingdom.

433
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,960
 They rise and they fall.

434
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,380
 No king, no kingdom on earth will last forever.

435
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,940
 Only God's kingdom will last forever.

436
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:17,200
 Now this is our pride and our presumption

437
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,040
 that we think our earthly kingdom will last forever.

438
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:24,500
 The story tells us no earthly kingdom can last

439
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,220
 without God's permission.

440
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:33,060
 God can allow a certain king, a certain official

441
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:34,300
 to be in the White House.

442
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:38,780
 God can allow this or that king to rule

443
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:41,420
 over some part of the earth.

444
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,100
 But everything is in God's hand.

445
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:49,220
 Now what God allows does not always

446
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,620
 mean God approves of it.

447
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,780
 God can allow evil to exist.

448
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:58,180
 That's pretty difficult for us.

449
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,860
 God can allow evil to exist.

450
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,540
 However, there's always judgment at the end.

451
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,100
 There's always righteous judgment at the end.

452
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,140
 And judgment often comes as a surprise.

453
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:12,860
 And you would not expect that.

454
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,180
 Here in this story, Belshazzar the king

455
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,100
 thinks that his kingdom will go on

456
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,100
 at least for a little while.

457
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,340
 Why God, of course God is counting down his days,

458
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:25,700
 but he thinks his kingdom will go on

459
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,140
 and business as usual.

460
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:31,020
 Now the king even expects that God

461
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,340
 to show up to approve his plan.

462
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:36,420
 And in this chapter, God does show up.

463
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:39,540
 But God does not approve his plan.

464
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:43,380
 Now think about our lives.

465
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:46,580
 Sometimes we want the approval of God, right?

466
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:49,780
 Maybe we're launching a new career.

467
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,420
 Maybe we have a family plan

468
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,980
 or we have our own personal plan.

469
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:58,780
 We always want God to show up and give us the approval.

470
00:25:58,780 --> 00:26:02,820
 It may, it may not.

471
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:07,140
 Because it is up to the will of God.

472
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,860
 The second point here is that the will of God

473
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,780
 transcends our will.

474
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,580
 Divine will transcends your will.

475
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:21,260
 God's will is over above your will.

476
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,540
 And so often we want the approval of God

477
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,580
 because we like to do this or that,

478
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:29,540
 or we plan for this or that.

479
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,620
 And sometimes we even think that

480
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:35,020
 if we pray hard enough,

481
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:38,860
 if we work hard enough,

482
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,820
 then our intent, our plan will work out.

483
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,900
 God may approve my plan.

484
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,700
 And this is a real temptation.

485
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,300
 This is a real temptation for us.

486
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:54,820
 And it's pride on our behalf.

487
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:58,380
 It's just tempting to even sometimes

488
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,740
 we misuse the name of God for our plan.

489
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:08,100
 Instead of humbly seeking the will of God in our lives,

490
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,580
 sometimes we think we can misuse or abuse the name of God

491
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,620
 so that we'll get the approval from God.

492
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,020
 You know, this story tells us the job of God

493
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,300
 is not to rubber stamp your plan.

494
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:28,140
 God's not here to do a bidding.

495
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:32,180
 God's not here, not necessarily to approve your plan.

496
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,900
 Even you have well intent.

497
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,860
 It may, may not, right?

498
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,380
 The whole point is God is not here

499
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,220
 just to rubber stamp our plan.

500
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:48,780
 God is here to help us and mold us

501
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:53,780
 so that we can yield to him in worship and obedience.

502
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,620
 That's what God wants.

503
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,140
 You know, he's not necessarily here to say,

504
00:27:59,140 --> 00:28:01,260
 "Okay, you can do this.

505
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,620
 "Okay, if you ask me, I will do that for you."

506
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:09,540
 The whole thing is because the will of God matters,

507
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,060
 not our will.

508
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,660
 Now I wanna close this message,

509
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,900
 this story with James chapter four.

510
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,740
 James chapter four.

511
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,580
 When we read this two verses,

512
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,580
 I think it speaks to what Daniel 5 has to say.

513
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:33,660
 Is that the will of God is higher than our will.

514
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:41,580
 The plan of God should transcend your plan.

515
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:45,900
 James chapter four.

516
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,620
 Why?

517
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:52,100
 You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.

518
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:54,060
 What is your life?

519
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:58,460
 You are a mist that appears for a little while

520
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,820
 and then vanishes.

521
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:02,460
 Instead, you ought to say,

522
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:07,460
 if it is the will of the Lord,

523
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:11,180
 we will live and do this or do that.

524
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,040
 No, the scripture is trying to confront our pride,

525
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,580
 confront our priority.

526
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:23,420
 We don't even know we will exist tomorrow.

527
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,780
 It says we are simply a mist.

528
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,980
 You know what a mist is?

529
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:31,860
 Did you wake up early enough this morning?

530
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:35,900
 You look at your alarm, the mist,

531
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,780
 actually talking about our breath, you know.

532
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,980
 When we say things, when we're breathing out, you know,

533
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,020
 that is mist.

534
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:51,020
 The mist will exist for just a little while

535
00:29:51,020 --> 00:29:52,900
 and it will be gone.

536
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:57,420
 And that is your life, that is my life, right?

537
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:01,100
 Then why, if we exist only like a mist,

538
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,180
 why do we think this will happen tomorrow

539
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,900
 or that will happen tomorrow, right?

540
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:07,900
 What is your life?

541
00:30:07,900 --> 00:30:09,740
 James challenges and confronts us.

542
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,740
 You ought to say, rather,

543
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:15,620
 if God allows,

544
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,220
 if this is the Lord's will,

545
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,180
 then we will live.

546
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:23,260
 We will do this or do that.

547
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,700
 No, the Bible is not encouraging us

548
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,940
 not to manage our life.

549
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:32,900
 It's not saying that we don't have to plan

550
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:36,220
 for the next day or the next year or next month, you know.

551
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:39,420
 The Bible is all about, you know, management.

552
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,780
 You know, we need to be good steward, right?

553
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:47,060
 However, the Bible also insists that,

554
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:51,460
 hey, God's will transcends your will.

555
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:56,140
 If God allows, if this is the Lord's will,

556
00:30:56,140 --> 00:30:59,620
 you will live and you will do this or do that.

557
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:03,780
 Why don't we close in prayers

558
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,820
 and I'm sure you have some plans in your life, right?

559
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:12,820
 And so often, you know, our plans trump God's plan, right?

560
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:18,420
 Oh God, I have this or that I need to do, okay?

561
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:20,700
 I'll put you on the side, all right?

562
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:22,700
 Put you on the side for a moment.

563
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,900
 And God, I know you're a king, but hey, you know,

564
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:28,060
 I have this or that to do, you know, I'm so busy.

565
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:30,460
 I'll put you in the footnote.

566
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:34,180
 This is tempting, all right?

567
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:35,020
 This is tempting.

568
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:40,340
 As James says, you ought to say, you ought to pray.

569
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,060
 If it is the Lord's will, I will live

570
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,500
 and I will do this or that.

571
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:49,100
 Let's be humble and come before God

572
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:54,100
 and do away our pride to acknowledge His sovereignty, right?

573
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,380
 Let's pray.

574
00:31:56,380 --> 00:32:14,060
 Father, we come before you to confess our sin, our pride.

575
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:18,220
 And so often, our priority trumps your priority.

576
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:22,180
 Sometimes we just think that our plan is so important

577
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,660
 and you are the least important.

578
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:29,820
 We come before you, we confess our sin of pride.

579
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:33,820
 Yes, we don't control our lives.

580
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:38,100
 We don't even know that we will exist tomorrow.

581
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,780
 We're just like mist.

582
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:43,540
 We appear a little while, we live for a little while,

583
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,300
 and then we'll be vanished and be forgotten.

584
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:51,500
 And yet you, in your grace, allow us to live.

585
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:55,020
 So yeah, we come before you and we pray.

586
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:00,780
 And we say to you, if it is your will, then we will live.

587
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:03,700
 We will do this and do that.

588
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,060
 And Father, confront us.

589
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:12,060
 Do we really have the priority of a Christ disciple,

590
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,940
 putting you as our number one,

591
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,940
 putting you as the most important,

592
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,020
 the most important person that we're gonna follow

593
00:33:20,020 --> 00:33:22,420
 and we're gonna obey and we're gonna worship?

594
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,820
 Father, we come before you,

595
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,700
 we ask that your spirit will remind us

596
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,980
 to reorganize our lives,

597
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,260
 putting you first, putting other things

598
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:38,300
 in the lower priority.

599
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,220
 Help us to please you,

600
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:43,020
 help us to worship you and follow you,

601
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:48,020
 and to be obedient, always seeking your will first,

602
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:49,460
 to listen to word of wisdom,

603
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:52,380
 to listen to your spirit's prompting,

604
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,780
 to help us to live a life that is obedient,

605
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,700
 live a life that will pleasing to you.

606
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:01,500
 Yes, it is your will.

607
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,700
 If it is your will, then we will live

608
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,580
 and we will do this and that.

609
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,540
 And thank you for your blessing,

610
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:12,820
 especially when Thanksgiving is approaching.

611
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,900
 We do need to acknowledge that this is your will,

612
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,820
 this is your permission,

613
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:23,580
 that we can come and enjoy your provision.

614
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:26,500
 Yeah, you are so good, God.

615
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:30,180
 Thank you, thank you for the grace of life

616
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:34,780
 and help us and use our life to honor you.

617
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,980
 In Christ, we pray.

618
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:40,060
 (gentle music)

619
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,580
 - Well, we have some freshmen out there

620
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:45,060
 and please stay a little bit for time of fellowship.

621
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:49,340
 And as Kelly remind us, get your tickets today

622
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:50,980
 and we're gonna have a feast together

623
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,460
 and I'm sure there's no writings on the wall.

624
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:57,580
 So we're gonna enjoy our time together

625
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,660
 in times of Thanksgiving.

626
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:01,940
 And also I wanna remind you,

627
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:04,500
 Thanksgiving is a great reminder for us,

628
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:07,020
 this is God's will and God's provision in our life

629
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,260
 to count His blessing, all right?

630
00:35:09,260 --> 00:35:11,460
 Count His provision and thank God

631
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:15,020
 for everything that we enjoy today, all right?

632
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,380
 Thank you very much and I'll see you next week.

633
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:19,860
 (gentle music)
