[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   All right, guys, we will continue our series on worship.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.840]   And remember we read and studied Psalm 8.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.440]   Remember that?
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.600]   Psalm 8?
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.100]   No?
[00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.280]   Okay, you guys need to improve, okay, in your learning.
[00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.060]   Okay, Psalm 8, I know you know, right?
[00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.900]   I know you know.
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.960]   Psalm 8 is a creation psalm,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.240]   and teaches us how to worship God.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.160]   And last time, in this series,
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.760]   we were at Genesis 2, one and two,
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.000]   and we were talking about the Garden of Eden, right?
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.600]   And we say Eden is like a sanctuary,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.440]   it's like a temple, right?
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.080]   Where is the entrance facing?
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.920]   Which direction?
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.160]   Yes, east, yeah, there you go.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.480]   And who is guarding the entrance?
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.120]   Who is that guy?
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.280]   Cherubim, right?
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.180]   Cherubim, right?
[00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.120]   Cherubim, couple of cherubim.
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.720]   And by the way, cherubim is plural.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.760]   So two, at least two,
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.680]   they're guarding the entrance of the sanctuary, all right?
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.960]   And Eden was like on mountaintop,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.000]   because rivers are coming out of Eden
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.720]   to cultivate the lands nearby.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.360]   And also, there are some wordings
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.160]   in chapter two of Genesis, or chapter three in Genesis,
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.560]   that reminds us this is a sanctuary.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.960]   Because whenever the Bible talks about a sanctuary,
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.140]   a temple, these wordings appear.
[00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.880]   Three, eight, this is after the fall of humankind,
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.580]   after Adam and Eve rebelled against God.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.920]   And it says three, eight,
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.240]   when the cool evening breezes were blowing,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.040]   the man, humanity, representing the whole humanity,
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.040]   and his wife heard the Lord God walking about in the garden.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.440]   Okay, so they were hiding from the Lord God
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.440]   from the tree, in the trees.
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.440]   And hear the wording, walking about, walking alongside,
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.320]   walking in the midst of them.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.800]   That is a special vocabulary in the Bible
[00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.720]   that describes God's presence.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.360]   God is walking in the midst of His people.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.160]   And that kind of wording appears so many times
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.720]   in the Old Testament that talks about the temple
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.200]   or tabernacle or wherever you find the presence of God.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   So you can see from the opening chapters of the Bible,
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.120]   Genesis one, two, and three,
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.820]   you see worship is a main theme.
[00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.760]   People worship God in the presence of God.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.840]   People can walk with God, can have fellowship with God.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.480]   And that's what worship is all about.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.520]   The presence of God is with His people.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.520]   God is walking about, walking in the midst of them.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.560]   So Eden is like a sanctuary.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.840]   So if you have time, you can flip to,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.040]   turn to the last chapters of the Bible.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.960]   The last book of the Bible being,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.280]   what's the name of the last book of Bible?
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.320]   Revelation, yes, Revelation.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.360]   The last chapters, chapter 21, 22,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.220]   talks about new creation.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.440]   It talks about future, our ending.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.000]   You know, we are heading toward that future.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.800]   And that future is gonna be a glorious future.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.840]   And I wanna thank George
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.840]   for preaching a very good sermon last week,
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.040]   reminding us the whole creation is going forward.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.120]   That direction, God is gonna renew everything.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.400]   God is going to renew the whole cosmos.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.920]   And the theme of worship appears again.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.000]   Like 21, three, the book of Revelation.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.560]   John, the apostle, being lifted up into heaven,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   and he saw or he heard something that is otherworldly.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.000]   I heard a loud shout from the throne saying,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.040]   "Look, God's home, the home of God,
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.840]   "is now among His people."
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.340]   God's home, by the way, this is new living translation.
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.140]   I guess it's easier for most of us.
[00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.960]   The home of God, the presence of God, is among His people.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.320]   He will live with them and they will be His people.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.360]   God Himself will be with them.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.720]   Again, that kind of wording,
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.240]   walking in the midst of them, live with them,
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.400]   dwell with them, and God will wipe every tear
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.640]   from their eyes and there will be no more death
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.160]   or sorrow or crying or pain.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:35.660]   All these things are gone forever.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:37.880]   Talking about the new heaven and new earth,
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.000]   the new cosmos, the new creation.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.600]   That's where we are going.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.380]   That's where we're looking forward to.
[00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.020]   That gives us hope.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.120]   But again, if you look at the wordings here,
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.040]   worship is the goal.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.360]   The new creation is full of worship.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.800]   The new creation is full of worshiping God
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.480]   and living in His presence.
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   So as you realize, the Bible is bookended
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:08.840]   by two portions, the opening chapters
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.080]   and the closing chapters, and it's all about worship.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.040]   Bookend by the theme of worship.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.460]   So the Bible, you read from cover to cover,
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.020]   is from worship to worship.
[00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.880]   Now, of course, if you trace the grand story of the Bible,
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.260]   after the fall of humankind,
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.100]   after the rebellion of Adam and Eve,
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.620]   the humankind rebelled against God,
[00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.140]   they lost the presence of God
[00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.980]   and they are kicked out from Eden, right?
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.020]   Got it?
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.280]   Kicked out from Eden.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:48.220]   However, those who know God and those who believe in God,
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.820]   they continue worship.
[00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:53.620]   So these kinds of wording are going to describe
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.960]   some of those people who continue to be faithful to God,
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:01.180]   even though they were the minority.
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.100]   523 Genesis, Enoch.
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.200]   There's a guy called Enoch and he lived for 365 years.
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.180]   By the way, 365 is a symbolic number, okay?
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.760]   All right, he's not like a tree, all right?
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.200]   Never die, all right?
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:19.580]   So you have to read the Bible according to its own term.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.100]   It's written not to us, but for us, right?
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.340]   It's written to ancient people
[00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:27.060]   and they use symbolic numbers, okay?
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:28.380]   But they are real numbers, okay?
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.540]   Real symbolic number, but they have some symbolic meaning.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:35.760]   So Enoch lived 365 years.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.700]   Verse 24, walking with God, right?
[00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:43.620]   In close relationship, in close fellowship with God.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.820]   And then one day he disappeared, God took him away.
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.580]   All right, how cool is that, right?
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.540]   Anyways, and then at the end of the book of Genesis,
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:58.900]   when Jacob was blessing his children, all right?
[00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.840]   His end of, come to the end of his life
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.620]   and Jacob blessed his children.
[00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:08.620]   He blessed Joseph and said, look at how he described God.
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.500]   May the God before whom my grandfather, Abraham,
[00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.780]   and my father, Isaac, walked.
[00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.500]   He walked before them, right?
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.460]   Abraham walked before them, or walked before God.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.100]   Isaac walked before God.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.160]   And Jacob also walked before God.
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.940]   So these people who worship God, who are faithful to God,
[00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:30.620]   they are always described as walking with God
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.980]   and God is walking with them, right?
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:34.880]   So the God who has been my shepherd
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:38.280]   all my life to this very day, right?
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.980]   So even though mankind was being kicked out of Eden,
[00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:46.140]   kicked out of the presence of God,
[00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:50.500]   but God is still walking alongside of them
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.540]   for those who are faithful to him,
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.220]   for those who still believe in, right?
[00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.380]   So it's described them in such verdicts, right?
[00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:03.620]   And then we're gonna trace the Bible from the book of Genesis.
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:05.840]   Remember where the people of God end up
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:08.060]   by the end of book of Genesis?
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:08.900]   Where were they?
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:12.100]   They were not in Chicago.
[00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:12.940]   Where were they?
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.680]   They were in Egypt.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.060]   Got it?
[00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:17.740]   All right, so many things happen,
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:21.100]   but they end up in Egypt for many years.
[00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.580]   And then some days ago, or some day later,
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:27.400]   God appeared to Moses.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.780]   So you got Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and the 12 tribes,
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.860]   and then you come to Moses.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.620]   Many years later, Moses.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.780]   Moses was in exile,
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:45.220]   and he was shepherding his flock in the wilderness
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:49.860]   in the book of Exodus chapter three.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:50.820]   It's a long passage,
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.940]   but we're gonna take a look from the perspective of worship.
[00:08:54.940 --> 00:08:58.800]   One day, Moses was tending the flock of his father,
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.100]   and we're gonna skip to into the wilderness,
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:03.620]   and into where?
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.620]   He came to Sinai, right?
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:08.260]   You got that word?
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.620]   Sinai or Horeb, okay?
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:11.980]   Both referring to the same mountain,
[00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.900]   the mountain of God, right?
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:14.940]   Mountain of God.
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:16.420]   Again, sanctuary.
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:18.460]   There, the angel of the Lord appeared to Moses
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.460]   in blazing fire from the middle of a bush,
[00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.980]   and he stared in amazement.
[00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:24.380]   How cool is that, right?
[00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.580]   Because the bush was engulfed in flames,
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:31.400]   and it did not burn up.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.800]   Do not come any closer, the Lord warned him.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.500]   Take off your sandals.
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:37.340]   Take off your sandals,
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:42.340]   for you are standing on the holy ground, right?
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:47.640]   So this place is holy because God's presence is there.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.900]   Take off your sandal, and I will be with you,
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:54.300]   and this is the sign that I'm the one who sent you,
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:59.000]   sent you back to Egypt to bring my people out of Egypt,
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.180]   and what's the goal?
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.720]   What is the destination?
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:05.940]   You will worship God in this very mountain,
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.820]   Mount Sinai, right?
[00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:09.640]   To do what?
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.540]   To worship God, right?
[00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.780]   So God saves his people from the land of slavery,
[00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.080]   from Egypt, for the purpose of serving him
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.860]   and worshiping him, and as you know,
[00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:24.380]   the book of Exodus, there were tons of things
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.940]   happened there, 10 plagues, right?
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.620]   And all this crazy thing happened,
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:33.620]   and God judged Pharaoh and the nation of Egypt,
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.260]   and saved his people out of Egypt.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:37.540]   So they crossed the Red Sea,
[00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:42.340]   and they crossed the great and fearful wilderness,
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.460]   and they finally, they arrived at the foothill
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.020]   of what mountain?
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.460]   Mount Sinai, right?
[00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:52.340]   Mount Sinai.
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:53.180]   To do what?
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:55.820]   To worship him, right?
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:57.580]   God saved his people out of Egypt
[00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.420]   in order for them to worship him,
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:05.500]   and there at the foothill of the Mount Sinai,
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.620]   God gave them the 10 commandments.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.220]   God gave them the 10 commandments,
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:13.460]   and the 10 commandments is kind of like
[00:11:13.460 --> 00:11:16.080]   the constitution of ancient Israel,
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:18.380]   just like the United States Constitution.
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:22.900]   Those are the basic principle, lay out 10 principles
[00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.860]   that how they are going to conduct their lives.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:27.820]   Now they are the new people of God,
[00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.180]   how are they going to live?
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:31.700]   How are they going to live according to the principles
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.780]   God has given them?
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:36.040]   So that's the 10 commandments.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:42.140]   And then at that moment, God told Moses,
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:46.100]   I'm going to live and dwell among my people.
[00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:49.260]   And the symbol I'm using so that they can see
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.180]   I'm living among them is tabernacle.
[00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:54.340]   Tabernacle, right?
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.380]   Heard that word, right?
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.220]   Tabernacle.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.660]   What is tabernacle?
[00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:01.740]   And this is the topic of the day.
[00:12:01.740 --> 00:12:03.460]   I'm going to talk to you about tabernacle,
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.680]   and what is the tabernacle for,
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.840]   and what does it mean, right?
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.020]   So let's begin by understanding the word tabernacle.
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.060]   Okay, tabernacle.
[00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.580]   Various translation, but it comes from Hebrew,
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.340]   meshkan, all right?
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:23.140]   Tabernacle is English, of course.
[00:12:23.140 --> 00:12:28.140]   And it translates the Hebrew word meshkan, meshkan.
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:33.680]   And meshkan is a noun, comes from a Hebrew verb, shakan.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:37.620]   So Hebrew is a very funny language.
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:40.520]   You add something in the front,
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.600]   or you add something at the end,
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.560]   and then it becomes another form, right?
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:46.680]   Here's one of the example.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.920]   Shakan is living, dwelling, right?
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:55.920]   And you add an M, meshkan, right?
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.460]   Did you get it?
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:00.040]   Meshkan, it becomes a noun.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:03.080]   Means a tent, all right?
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.760]   It means a tent.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.400]   Living in the midst of its people.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.080]   Is it really difficult?
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.080]   It's not that, right?
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.440]   It's not that difficult.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:14.880]   So shakan and meshkan, right, sound the same,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.240]   and that means tabernacle, right?
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:20.960]   God is making his tabernacle among his people, right?
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   Recently I learned that there is something called cramping.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.660]   You heard that?
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:32.980]   Have you ever been to camping, camping trip?
[00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.300]   Do you like it?
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.020]   Do you enjoy it, camping?
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:37.460]   Like pitching a tent, right?
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:38.300]   Yeah.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:41.620]   And then nowadays they have this glamorous camping
[00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:43.900]   called glamping, right?
[00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:45.460]   So they sound the same, right?
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:47.800]   Camping and glamping, right?
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.740]   So that's what I just learned.
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:51.820]   You know, I didn't know that.
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:55.020]   I used to just go camping, right?
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:56.280]   And it's pretty, pretty tough
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.960]   because you have to go for a public bathroom.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.500]   You have to share the bathroom together,
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:03.740]   and it's very dirty and filthy and all that, right?
[00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:06.180]   So nowadays, you know, people are so spoiled.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:08.140]   We are so spoiled.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:10.540]   Americans are so spoiled.
[00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.700]   And we invented this glamping, right?
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.540]   What is that?
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.680]   Glamorous camping.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.660]   That means you have your own bathroom.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.540]   You live in a container.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:23.220]   It's very, very comfortable.
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:29.060]   There's AC, air conditioning, and all that, right?
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:32.620]   It's just living in, like living in a hotel, right?
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:34.440]   But you live in nature
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:37.860]   because the container is in the nature.
[00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.980]   So this is camping, all right?
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.180]   It's rain and very dirty, right?
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.180]   This is glamping, right?
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:53.580]   You know, it's a luxury kind of camping, right?
[00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:55.220]   Which one do you prefer?
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:14:58.940]   Do you prefer camping or you prefer glamping?
[00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:02.160]   Glamping, you know, you gotta pay more, right?
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.540]   What I'm saying is camping and glamping
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.820]   is like Mishkan and Shakan, right?
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:09.100]   They sound pretty much the same.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:13.700]   But what it means is that God is pitching his tent,
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:18.380]   glamping, God is glamping in the midst of his people, right?
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.700]   It's a tent of God, right?
[00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:21.740]   It's the tabernacle, right?
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:26.700]   And in Southern Israel, there's a place, a national park,
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.420]   and you can drive there in Southern Israel, in the Negev,
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:33.940]   and you can visit this park and you can walk around.
[00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:37.860]   And in this park, there's a one-to-one replica
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:41.220]   of tabernacle, one-to-one ratio.
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:42.940]   As you can see right there,
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:46.680]   it's a rectangular shape, glamping, right?
[00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.820]   A tent, kind of a boundary,
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:54.140]   two-to-one ratio,
[00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:58.620]   rectangular boundary.
[00:15:58.620 --> 00:16:00.860]   And inside there, there's also
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:03.740]   an other smaller rectangular shape,
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.260]   you know, with the curtain on top.
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.300]   And then inside is a square, it's the Holy of Holies.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.780]   So what you see here with all the curtains
[00:16:14.780 --> 00:16:19.740]   blocking off the boundary is the outer court of tabernacle.
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:23.700]   And inside the court of the tabernacle,
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:28.700]   there's another, you know, smaller rectangular shape area,
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:32.860]   and you can go into, it's also two-by-one,
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:34.220]   it's called Holy Place.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.500]   And inside Holy Place, there's a square, perfect square,
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.220]   Holy of Holies.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.020]   So let's walk inside, right?
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:44.520]   So you walk inside, you're standing inside the court,
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.500]   inside the courtyard of tabernacle,
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:50.220]   and you see the altar, right?
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:52.580]   The altar where you burn the sacrifice, right?
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:57.380]   Now, altar, practically speaking, is a barbecue place,
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:00.420]   and you burn all the sacrifices, right?
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:04.740]   And you also see the round thing, the round dish, right?
[00:17:04.740 --> 00:17:06.220]   You see that?
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.580]   It contains water, it's a water basin,
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:11.820]   and for priests to, you know, wash themselves
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.960]   and make sure they're cleansed before they enter
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.940]   or doing some rituals in the tabernacle.
[00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:22.600]   So we are in the courtyard.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.740]   Now you wanna go inside?
[00:17:24.740 --> 00:17:30.940]   You go inside, this is a two-by-one smaller rectangular,
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.180]   and you see two guys here.
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:36.540]   You know, that guy leaning in the back
[00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:38.200]   should be one of the priests,
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.280]   and he was doing something here.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.260]   And also another guy in blue robe,
[00:17:44.260 --> 00:17:46.180]   he's the high priest.
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:48.500]   You see the brass plate in front of him?
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.020]   There was 12 stones, right?
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:55.860]   So the priests, you know, they can go into the holy place.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:59.860]   And then you see three different kind of furniture items.
[00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.820]   On the left is the menorah, all right?
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.820]   It's a seven-branch menorah, looks like a tree of life,
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:10.600]   looks like a tree.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:16.000]   On your right is a table called the showbread table.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.400]   So every day they would bake some new bread,
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:22.200]   and they can put it on the table.
[00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:25.720]   You know, that symbolize God is hosting his people, right?
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.360]   You are being invited into the home of God.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.040]   This is the clamping home of God.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:36.160]   You come in and you see on the left is light
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.600]   from the menorah, on the right is the hospitality
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.440]   provided by the king of the universe, showbread.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.040]   In the middle of it is another order
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.280]   called the incense order.
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.840]   The incense order where they burn the incense,
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:54.680]   and the incense, the smoke will go up, right?
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:57.920]   That will represent the prayers of the people, right?
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.440]   That's the holy place.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:03.440]   So being right there, right where you are standing now
[00:19:04.440 --> 00:19:09.440]   is inside the home of God himself, the tabernacle.
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.440]   And then you see the curtains?
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:16.900]   Those figures on the curtain, who are they?
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:19.360]   Who is guarding the holy place?
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.800]   Yeah, yeah, cherubim, there you go, cherubim.
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:25.240]   They are supposed to symbolize cherubim.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.400]   Do you wanna go inside?
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.020]   No?
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.220]   You can't go inside, right?
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:35.260]   Because when the tabernacle was in the midst
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:37.940]   of the ancient Israelites,
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:41.020]   no one can go into the holy of holies.
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.000]   No one can go behind the curtain.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.100]   You can go in only one day per year,
[00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:53.380]   and it's represented by the high priest, Aaron,
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.920]   and his descendants.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.920]   The high priest will go in one day a year on Yom Kippur.
[00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:02.000]   Day of Atonement.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.080]   And he's gonna represent the whole people of Israel
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:09.600]   and go into the holy of holies and to atone the people
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:13.780]   so that the people will find forgiveness of sins.
[00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:16.920]   So only the high priest can enter into the holy of holies,
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:19.000]   which is a square, perfect square,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.720]   meaning holy of holies is a perfect place.
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.520]   Do you wanna go inside?
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:26.160]   For this model, you can go inside, all right?
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:29.840]   All right, so you kind of go through the curtain
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.680]   and inside there's only one furniture item,
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:36.460]   and that furniture item is called the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.560]   All right?
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.520]   It's plated with gold, real gold, all right?
[00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:46.520]   The Ark of the Covenant is actually a box, a chest box,
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:51.640]   and they store one of the items inside the box.
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.160]   And on top of it, there are two creatures, and who are they?
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.240]   The cherubim, yes, the cherubim.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.280]   There's gotta be cherubim everywhere, right?
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:01.760]   Cherubim.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.640]   So they're guarding the holy of holies.
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.360]   Now the Ark of the Covenant is actually God's throne.
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:10.200]   He sits on it.
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:14.400]   That is his chair, that is his oval office, right?
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:18.680]   It's right at the center of the White House.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.160]   That's where the president is.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.080]   That's where the king of the universe is, right?
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:25.600]   Of course, there's no idol,
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.600]   there's no visible symbol for God
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.120]   because God is invisible, right?
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:35.120]   But inside this box, you find two copies of stone tablets.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.920]   All right?
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.960]   And what is written on it should be,
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:44.880]   part of the words should be the Ten Commandments, right?
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:46.320]   There are two copies.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:47.140]   And you know why?
[00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.320]   Because in the biblical time,
[00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:52.520]   when two nations are making covenant together,
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.840]   when two parties are making covenant together,
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.880]   they will come together and talk about
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.800]   the terms of the covenant.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:02.360]   And once they agree with the terms of the covenant,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:05.960]   with all the blessing and curses for obeying it,
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:07.000]   you get the blessing.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.400]   If you disobey, you get the curse.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.560]   And that is gonna protect the covenant relationship
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.500]   between two nations, two parties.
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.880]   When the two parties agree with the terms of the covenant,
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:20.240]   they will make two copies in stone
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.660]   or in some doable material.
[00:22:23.660 --> 00:22:28.660]   They will write down or engrave the terms on the tablet.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:32.880]   So you get a copy, I get a copy.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:35.440]   It's an exact copy, right?
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:38.880]   And you're gonna bring your copy back to your country,
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.300]   and you're gonna deposit the tablet
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:46.300]   into your main sanctuary, your main temple.
[00:22:46.300 --> 00:22:49.680]   So you're gonna put your copy in your main temple,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.280]   in your holy of holies,
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:55.340]   and I'm gonna put my copy in my sanctuary,
[00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.680]   the biggest temple of my country.
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.980]   I'm gonna put it there in my holy of holies.
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:05.420]   And year after year, we're going to renew the covenant,
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:07.520]   and we're gonna read the covenant terms,
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.980]   and make sure we're gonna obey it
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.740]   and maintain our relationship.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.460]   Now, for Yahweh, for God, and Israel,
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.700]   when they make covenant together,
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:18.960]   for the people of Israel, where is their sanctuary?
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:22.780]   It's a tabernacle, right?
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.220]   And that's why you find one copy in the holy of holies,
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.740]   in the Ark of the Covenant, right?
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:32.700]   And for Yahweh, for God himself, where is his temple?
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:36.780]   Also in tabernacle, right?
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:39.420]   Also in tabernacle, the earthly temple is in,
[00:23:39.420 --> 00:23:41.820]   it's a tabernacle.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:45.700]   So Yahweh's copy, God's copy, and Israel copy
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:49.220]   are being deposited into this same box.
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.300]   So you find two exact copies.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:56.100]   That means God and Israel, God and his people
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:59.560]   have a covenant going on, right?
[00:23:59.560 --> 00:24:02.160]   And that covenant will protect their relationship.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:06.040]   And the people are being called to worship God
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:10.620]   because they are his people, and God is their God.
[00:24:10.620 --> 00:24:14.460]   And they are going to honor God and worship God
[00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:19.260]   and serve God with God in their midst.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:22.840]   Now we can come, this is the end of the tour, all right?
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:24.520]   This is the end of the tour.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:27.640]   But we're gonna go to the text, go into the Bible,
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.860]   and see how the Bible describes
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.240]   the building of the tabernacle.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:36.880]   In the book of Exodus, chapter 25 to 40,
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:39.480]   is the long portion of the text,
[00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:43.400]   talking about the plan and the building of tabernacle.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   From chapters 25 to 31, God gave Moses the plan.
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.080]   It's an architectural blueprint, how to build a tabernacle.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.020]   Like how long it is, how wide it is,
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.480]   and what you're gonna use.
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:59.680]   You're gonna use gold and silver
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.520]   for all the things that you're gonna put together.
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.160]   That is the architectural plan, 25 to 31.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:09.920]   And then 35 to 40, the ending chapters,
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:14.040]   describes the actual building of the tabernacle.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:17.880]   All right, so we're not gonna read it.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.060]   But here's the interesting things.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.720]   From 25 to 31, talking about the blueprint of tabernacle,
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.800]   you expect the Bible will continue
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:32.560]   to talk about the actual building of tabernacle, right?
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:37.560]   However, in between 32 and, 32 to 34,
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:41.400]   you find an episode, a very sad episode.
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:44.800]   The people of Israel in the wilderness,
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:46.920]   they worship a different God.
[00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:49.400]   They worship their own idol, golden calf.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:53.120]   However, at the end of this episode,
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:57.600]   God is saying, "I'm gonna still dwell among you."
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.440]   And that is a lesson of grace.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:05.200]   We don't deserve the presence of God in the midst of us.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:07.220]   Only because of God's grace,
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:10.480]   that God is going to have his presence among us,
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:12.400]   so that we can worship him.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.280]   Have you ever thought of that?
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:17.760]   We can worship God, it's not because we deserve it.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.160]   It's not because we earn it.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:23.340]   It's God made a way that is possible
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:27.740]   for us sinners to worship him, right?
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:32.740]   So it's very interesting how the design of the chapters.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:36.840]   After the blueprint, the Bible stops right there.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:41.840]   Hey, remember, God can live among us.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.020]   It's not because we earn it.
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:46.100]   We're sinners, we don't deserve it.
[00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.820]   God, by his sheer grace, he can make his presence among us
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.780]   and we can worship him.
[00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:55.580]   And then you see the building of the tabernacle.
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:27:01.080]   The tabernacle represents the presence of God
[00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:02.940]   in the Old Testament.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.660]   That God is living in the midst of his people
[00:27:05.660 --> 00:27:07.900]   and his people will worship him.
[00:27:07.900 --> 00:27:11.080]   And I wanna bring out two points
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.620]   about worship and tabernacle.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:17.320]   And there are two main points.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.260]   When the people, when Moses received the plan,
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.080]   the blueprint of tabernacle,
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   look how the people are being commanded to do.
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.200]   The Lord said to Moses,
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.460]   "Tell the people of Israel to bring me sacred offerings.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.060]   Accept a contribution from all those hearts
[00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:40.580]   are moved to offer them."
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:42.180]   And here's the list of sacred offerings
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.420]   you may accept with them.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:49.420]   Gold, silver, bronze, all sorts of expensive items.
[00:27:49.420 --> 00:27:54.460]   You're gonna bring them as offerings
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.280]   to build the tabernacle.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:59.400]   Verse eight, God said,
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:03.280]   "Have the people of Israel build me a holy sanctuary
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.020]   so I can live among them."
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.140]   You must build this tabernacle and its furnishings
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:11.540]   exactly according to the pattern I will show you.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:15.740]   God is saying, "I will have the people
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.820]   to build me a sanctuary, build me a camping tent
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.820]   so that I can camp among them, I can live among them
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.820]   so that they can worship me and I can be their people."
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:30.820]   And you're gonna do so according to the plan
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:32.540]   that I have for you.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:35.520]   Here, "Tell the people of Israel to bring me,"
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:38.820]   not the second best, not the leftover,
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:42.260]   "Bring them the best things that they have."
[00:28:42.260 --> 00:28:45.600]   They have gold and silver because when they left Egypt,
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:49.700]   they plundered Egypt, they conquered Egypt,
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:54.700]   and the Egyptians gave them all these good things, right?
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.380]   Treasures, gold and silver.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:01.240]   So they're carrying all those gold and silver items
[00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.020]   with them out of Egypt.
[00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:08.500]   And God is saying, "You need to offer them to me
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:11.740]   to build this tabernacle so that I can build,
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.180]   I can live among you."
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:16.700]   You see the principle here is generous offering.
[00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:23.300]   How blessed we are that we can build the presence of God
[00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:25.620]   in the midst of us.
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:27.340]   God does not need the people of Israel
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.540]   to build him a tabernacle.
[00:29:30.540 --> 00:29:31.820]   God doesn't need that.
[00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.320]   God can send angels to build a tabernacle,
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:39.440]   but he wants his people to participate
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.660]   in the act of worship.
[00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:45.340]   God want his people to participate in worship.
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:48.440]   And that's why we come to worship,
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.240]   not because we deserve it,
[00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.380]   but God is willing to live among us
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:57.180]   and give us the opportunity to sing praises to him,
[00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.140]   to worship him and to serve him.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:03.380]   God does not need you or need me to worship him.
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:05.960]   It's all by grace.
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.720]   And that's why when we build our church,
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:12.760]   when we build the body of Christ,
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.260]   the presence of God,
[00:30:15.260 --> 00:30:21.460]   we are called to make offerings, generous offering.
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.360]   Have you ever thought why we don't do offerings?
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Sometimes we just don't believe that God is good, right?
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.160]   Sometimes we just don't believe God is generous, right?
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   But the Bible show us once and again, God is generous.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.360]   God is so good to you and to me.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:50.080]   And that's why we can offer our generous offering
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:52.900]   to build his presence, to build the tabernacle.
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.960]   Just like those days, the people of Israel were called
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.440]   to bring in the gold and silver and all these good things.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.920]   They can build the tabernacle
[00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:03.720]   so that God will live among them.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.960]   And secondly, is to be holy.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.960]   Leviticus 28, God said, "Keep all my decrees
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.840]   "by putting them into practice,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.880]   "for I am the Lord who makes you holy."
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.040]   Now, what does it mean?
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.640]   Holiness or being holy means separated,
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:25.720]   that you're different, right?
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.660]   That's what the basic meaning of holy is.
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:33.840]   Be holy means be different, be separated
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:36.880]   from all the nations, from all those people
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:40.000]   who don't worship God himself.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.080]   And you are different, you got to be holy,
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:45.480]   and you got to keep the words of God
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.280]   and put them into practice.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.540]   And that is the principle of worship.
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:55.740]   We come to worship, it's not just about singing praises.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.700]   We got to conduct our lives according to the will of God.
[00:31:58.700 --> 00:32:04.700]   Because God is living among us when we observe his law,
[00:32:04.700 --> 00:32:09.620]   when we follow his words willingly.
[00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:14.160]   Two principle out of tabernacle.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.340]   Now, of course, you're gonna say,
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:18.840]   "Okay, we don't need a tabernacle today," right?
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:21.300]   You can go to southern Israel
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.300]   and visit the one-to-one replica.
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.700]   Do we need a tabernacle?
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:29.180]   We don't.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:30.000]   Why?
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.900]   Because we are in the era of New Testament.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:36.580]   Christ has come, Christ has come.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:40.500]   And Christ is the perfect priest.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:42.140]   He is the perfect high priest,
[00:32:42.140 --> 00:32:44.820]   and he offer himself as the perfect sacrifice.
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:48.340]   That's why we don't need the lamb,
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.700]   offer the sheep as burnt offering today.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.700]   Because the Old Testament era is gone,
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:56.500]   and the way of worship is different.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:00.820]   In the Old Testament, people worship God
[00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:03.320]   in the tabernacle or around the tabernacle.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:07.760]   In the New Testament, we worship God in Christ.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:12.100]   It's not in a place, it's not in a spot on the map,
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:13.880]   but in Christ.
[00:33:13.880 --> 00:33:17.780]   So in the New Testament, there was no more animal sacrifices.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:20.060]   There was no more Aaron the high priest.
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:22.700]   There was no more tabernacle, physical tabernacle,
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.260]   because Christ has come.
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:29.220]   But I wanna show you this verse, John chapter 1, 14.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:31.900]   Now, as I read John chapter 1, 14,
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:35.300]   you try to guess which word is related to tabernacle.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:37.860]   All right?
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.840]   John 1, 14.
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.460]   So the word, speaking of Jesus,
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:46.220]   became human and made his home among us.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:52.300]   He was full of unfailing love, grace, and faithfulness.
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.660]   And we have seen his glory,
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:56.560]   the glory of the Father's one and only Son.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:02.120]   Where you see the word related to tabernacle here?
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.700]   Home, right?
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:08.960]   Made his home among us.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.140]   The word became flesh.
[00:34:11.140 --> 00:34:15.020]   Jesus Christ came as God incarnate.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.860]   Made flesh and made his home among us.
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:23.860]   Actually, the original Greek term is tabernacle.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.660]   God made his tabernacle among us,
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:31.200]   or God tabernacle among us.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.960]   God's glamping among us, camping among us,
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.940]   living in the midst of us.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:39.500]   So that when we see Jesus, when we see the record of Jesus,
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.500]   we see the glory of the Father, the glory of the true God.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:47.420]   And that is the beginning of the Gospel of John,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.100]   chapter 1, 14.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.900]   And then at the end of Gospel of John, chapter 17,
[00:34:52.900 --> 00:34:57.060]   after the Last Supper, Jesus prayed a prayer,
[00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:00.940]   and we call that prayer the High Priest Prayer.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:03.820]   He was like a high priest.
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:08.220]   And one of the verses that describe
[00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:12.860]   Jesus' High Priest Prayer was 1722.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.660]   And Jesus said, "I have given my disciples
[00:35:15.660 --> 00:35:20.660]   "the glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:25.740]   "I have given them the glory, I have shown them the glory,"
[00:35:25.740 --> 00:35:27.860]   which is the glory of the cross,
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:30.220]   that he was willing to die on the cross
[00:35:30.220 --> 00:35:32.020]   to redeem all of us.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.380]   "I have given them the glory, I have shown them the glory,
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.140]   "so that they may be one as we are one."
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.580]   He's like the high priest,
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.340]   bring in the glory of God
[00:35:43.340 --> 00:35:48.860]   to his disciples, to us, to the church, right?
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:53.420]   Now, we don't need the tabernacle because Christ came.
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:57.220]   Christ is the tabernacle, that's why we worship in Christ.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.800]   That's why we pray in Christ.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:04.140]   Now, however, there are all sorts of sanctuary terms
[00:36:04.140 --> 00:36:08.580]   or temple terms to describe the people of God
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.340]   in the New Testament.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:12.100]   And I wanna close with this verse,
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:16.460]   1 Corinthians 3.16.
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:18.140]   Now, you know the letter of 1 Corinthians
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:20.940]   is written to the church in Corinth.
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:24.340]   And we know the home churches in Corinth
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.060]   had a lot of problems.
[00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.400]   They have divisions among them,
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.340]   they have separation among them,
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:32.580]   they have arguments in the midst of them,
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.060]   and they are fighting for different things.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.740]   And it's a very problematic church.
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:41.260]   And the pastor, Paul, wrote this letter to them
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.180]   to warn them and to teach them
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.700]   how to live as a worshiping community.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.540]   In chapter three, verse 16,
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:53.020]   he reminds the Christians in Corinth,
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:56.900]   he said, "Don't you realize that all of you together
[00:36:56.900 --> 00:36:59.140]   "are the temple of God?"
[00:36:59.140 --> 00:37:02.140]   Wait, I thought the temple of God is stone building.
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:07.280]   No, Paul said, "Because Christ lives in you.
[00:37:07.280 --> 00:37:10.740]   "You guys, you together, when you meet together,
[00:37:10.740 --> 00:37:14.820]   "when you are a family of God, you are the temple of God."
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:15.660]   And what is the temple of God?
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:19.380]   What is the sanctuary of God or tabernacle of God?
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:21.140]   It's God's home, right?
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:26.140]   God is living in the midst of the temple, right?
[00:37:26.140 --> 00:37:28.220]   The temple is God's home.
[00:37:28.220 --> 00:37:33.220]   And Paul is saying, "You guys are the home of God.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:38.220]   "You guys are the embodiment of the presence of God.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:41.040]   "You together are the temple of God
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:43.720]   "and that the Spirit lives in you."
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   And you have to realize that.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.160]   When we congregate together, when we meet together,
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.280]   no matter what size of your congregation,
[00:37:51.280 --> 00:37:54.440]   if you call on the name of God,
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:57.040]   if you pray to the name of Jesus,
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:59.980]   we are the community of faith, we are the church.
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:02.000]   At the same time, we are the temple of God.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.300]   God is living in the midst of us.
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.720]   In 17, it's a huge warning.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.740]   He warns the Christian in Corinth,
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:17.500]   "God will destroy anyone who destroys his temple.
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:22.600]   "For God's temple is holy and you are that temple."
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:25.640]   Let me read that again.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:30.180]   "God will destroy anyone who destroy this temple."
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:31.980]   And who is, what is this temple?
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:35.900]   The church in Corinth, right?
[00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.460]   The church people.
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:39.460]   We are the temple.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.020]   "And God will destroy anyone who destroy this temple.
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:48.020]   "For God's temple is holy and you guys are the temple."
[00:38:48.020 --> 00:38:53.820]   Do you realize what, it's so great of God's grace.
[00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:58.300]   God lives, choose to live in the midst of us, right?
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:02.420]   Not that we deserve it, right?
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.500]   We are all broken and sinners, right?
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:07.980]   We all have our own flaws.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:12.660]   However, God chooses to live in the midst of his people
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:15.140]   who call on the name of Jesus.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.020]   And that's why we need to do everything
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.260]   to build up this temple.
[00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:20.740]   That's why we need to do everything
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:23.940]   to build up this community, this church.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.740]   Because we understand the New Testament,
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:29.220]   the Bible tells us that we are the embodiment,
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.820]   the presence of God.
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:33.080]   When someone walk into our church,
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:39.980]   let's say that that person is not a Christian yet.
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:41.300]   It's not a believer yet.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:43.300]   He walked in.
[00:39:43.300 --> 00:39:45.560]   How can he see the presence of God?
[00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:49.560]   He see the presence of God through us, right?
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.940]   Paul is saying to the Corinthian Christians,
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:55.940]   "If you are fighting against each other,
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:58.540]   "people cannot see God, right?
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:02.860]   "People cannot see the holy presence of God."
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.460]   He warns them, "If you destroy this temple,
[00:40:07.460 --> 00:40:08.900]   "God will destroy him."
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:13.580]   Because God's temple, God's home is holy, right?
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:19.060]   In the same way, that is a reminder for all of us,
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:24.220]   not to destroy, but to build up, build up the temple,
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.900]   build up God's home so that God will be glorified, right?
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.380]   And that is the essence of worship.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.860]   And brothers and sisters, I pray, I pray that
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:39.620]   we will be faithful, we'll be faithful
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:44.020]   to build up God's temple, God's church.
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.500]   Now, you have to see it by faith.
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:48.900]   You have to see it by faith.
[00:40:49.740 --> 00:40:52.980]   You cannot see with your flashy eyes.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:54.060]   You have to see it by faith.
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.940]   We see each other, the sister and brother in Christ.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:41:00.380]   We have to see it by faith that God is living
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:01.860]   in the midst of us.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.580]   When we pray for one another, when we worship together,
[00:41:04.580 --> 00:41:07.260]   God is living and dwelling in the midst of us
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:12.300]   so that our worship can bear the witness to the world,
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.660]   to tell other people God is real
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.980]   and God is worthy of our worship.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.220]   Let us all pray together.
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:22.780]   Father, we come before you and ask that you will forgive us.
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:28.700]   At times, we just trivialize worship.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:34.900]   And we thought we'd just come together and sing some songs.
[00:41:34.900 --> 00:41:36.900]   No, it is not.
[00:41:36.900 --> 00:41:41.780]   By your grace, you dwell among us.
[00:41:41.780 --> 00:41:45.700]   And we are your people, and we are your temple, holy temple.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.740]   And God, I pray that you will renew our faith,
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:52.100]   renew our commitment to you,
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:54.580]   that we'll be your real people,
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:57.340]   knowing that you live among us.
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:00.940]   And thank you for being our God, and we can be your people.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:06.060]   Let our worship be holy and pleasing to you.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:09.100]   Let our worship be a witness to the world,
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:11.300]   to other people, that you are real
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:13.940]   and you are worthy of our praises.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:17.460]   So pray that you will renew our spirit of worship,
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:20.500]   our sense of wonder, wonder of your grace,
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:25.460]   all and so awesome of your grace,
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:29.900]   that we can be called to worship you in your presence
[00:42:29.900 --> 00:42:30.900]   in Christ, and pray.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:36.220]   Well, God bless all of you, and next week, okay,
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.780]   we're gonna do our act of worship together, all right?
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.260]   Let's do it faithfully.
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.540]   Let's do it in a way that is pleasing to God.
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:46.100]   All right, see you next Sunday.
