[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hey family, as always I am praying for you. I hope that you're warm and safe this week and
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.280]   enjoying the winter. If you're someone who likes to get out in the weather and enjoy the snow,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.960]   then I hope you're doing that. If you just like to stay in and stay warm and sit by the fireplace and read or
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:24.240]   get on the couch and and watch a movie that you love, then I hope you're enjoying that. I hope that you're
[00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:32.160]   feeling well and being safe and warm even during this cold time. I also want to wish you a very happy
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.960]   Lunar New Year. I know all of the holidays have been so different this year
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.080]   because we're not able to gather together in the way that we normally would.
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:47.760]   But I hope that you are enjoying this time and that you're able to connect with family and friends, even if it's only virtually.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.180]   Hope that you're able to connect with the people that you love and to share
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.820]   with them how much you love them and how grateful you are for their presence in your lives. And also hope that you're able to just
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.680]   enjoy celebrating and looking forward to the next year and what it could mean for us.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.400]   I hope that however you're celebrating the Spring Festival this year, I hope that it's joyful and
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.440]   encouraging and a blessed time for you and for the people you love.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:19.240]   Valentine's Day too, if you're celebrating that, I hope that you're enjoying that, celebrating that with someone that you love as well.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.520]   And I want to remind you as always to connect with us. You can send us an email at info@urbanvoicechurch.com.
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.520]   We'd love to hear from you all.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.760]   But today we're going to be looking again in Matthew chapter 6, still looking at these kingdom values, and we're finishing up
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.080]   the topic of anxiety. We've been talking about this for a few weeks now. So let's look at Matthew chapter 6 verse 25 here.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.520]   We're going to read all the way down to verse 34. It says this,
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:53.600]   "Therefore I tell you do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body,
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.720]   what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.680]   Look at the birds of the air.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.840]   They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.400]   Are you not of more value than they? And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to the span of
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.520]   life? And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.320]   They neither toil nor spin, yet I tell you even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:27.640]   But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven,
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:31.160]   will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.520]   Therefore do not be anxious saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.320]   For the Gentiles seek after these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.280]   But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added to you.
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.640]   Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.000]   Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.200]   As we talked about
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.960]   anxiety over the past few weeks, we talked about the fact that
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.400]   Jesus is not telling us here to be naive or out of touch with reality.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.560]   He understands that our life is going to involve trouble and difficulty and challenges.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.920]   We live in a broken and fallen world and
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:20.320]   he understands that we are going to be aware of those things and even concerned about them. And that's okay. That's actually healthy.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.640]   We need to be aware and concerned of those challenges of life.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:28.280]   But Jesus doesn't want that awareness and concern to grow into something
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.240]   that damages us and that causes us to to make unhealthy decisions.
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.160]   And that's one of the big things that we see a lot of times when we are
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.800]   trapped by worry and fear and anxiety.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:48.040]   I've been there in my life and maybe you've been there or seen someone who was there in their life. When we begin to
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.560]   get anxious and worried and fearful, we begin to make unhealthy decisions that we would not
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:00.040]   make otherwise. And those decisions can be damaging to us or to the people around us
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:08.160]   because they're motivated by fear and they're motivated by our worry. And that fear and worry can cause us to do some really
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.480]   even uncharacteristic things. It can cause us to do some strange things that just
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.680]   are not what God has for us. And that's one of the reasons that Jesus is
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.800]   calling us out here and saying, "I don't want you to live in anxiety
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.240]   because I don't want you to to be motivated by fear.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.440]   I don't want you to make decisions and do unhealthy things in your life that come about because of
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.600]   your fear and your worry." And in these verses, Jesus is lovingly acknowledging our need and our weakness.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.040]   And he's saying, "Hey, I get it. I get that you get afraid. I get that you worry."
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.960]   There's so much beauty and love in the fact that Jesus is talking about this with us.
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:52.080]   And he's getting in the middle of our struggle and our mess and he's loving on us and I appreciate that so much.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.320]   But he's also showing in these verses that his desire for us is not to get stuck in anxiety and fear and worry.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.440]   His desire for us is not to be under bondage to it and not to be
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.360]   crushed by it. That's not what he has for us.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.480]   It may be a lifelong challenge for us,
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.840]   but he wants us to experience freedom and healing as we go through life and even victory in this area of our life.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.920]   And
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.560]   Jesus is pointing us to the fact that he
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:26.040]   cares for our physical needs and he cares for our emotional and spiritual needs and he cares about the things that are
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:32.840]   beyond our control even. We see this in these verses. Jesus is saying, "Look, I know you have stuff that worries you.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.440]   I know you worry about the stuff that you need and I care about that.
[00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:42.800]   I know that you worry about things that happen that are hurtful or harmful or difficult and you have no control over them
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.100]   and I care about that." I think there's such a loving heart here
[00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:54.560]   that's displayed in these verses and we talked about how as we move away from anxiety, we need to change our focus.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.980]   We need to let that change in focus bring about a change in perspective and we need to grow in our trust of Jesus.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:07.600]   And what I want us to see this week is that Jesus is really telling us to pursue
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.940]   the heavenly kingdom and leave the rest to him. We can see this in verse 30.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.120]   It says this, "But if God so clothes the grass of the field which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.560]   much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.280]   He's saying, "Look, God is caring for nature and God will much more care for you.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.240]   So have faith. Keep your focus in the right place. Keep your eyes on the heavenly kingdom."
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:42.020]   And in verse 32, he says this, "For the Gentiles seek all after all these things and your heavenly father knows that you need them all."
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.680]   Jesus is drawing this contrast when he uses that word Gentiles.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   He's talking about the people who are outside the kingdom of God, the people who don't believe.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.480]   And he's saying, "Look, the people who are outside the kingdom,
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.260]   they're the ones who get so worried about all this stuff.
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:05.240]   They're the ones who are really focused on their food and their clothing and those are huge issues to them."
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.060]   And for us in the modern world, we could add some things to that, right?
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:15.560]   We could say it's the people outside the kingdom who we expect to be focused on materialism and wealth
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:22.120]   and all of those physical things and status and prestige and what kind of house you live in
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:28.400]   and what kind of car you drive and your image on the internet and what kind of meals you're eating
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:35.400]   and do people think you're cool or do people think you're good or do people think you're concerned about the right issue socially
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.120]   or that your politics are in the right place.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.360]   All of those things that get so wrapped up in who we are as people,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.080]   those are the things that people outside the kingdom of God care about.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.480]   Why do they care so much about those things? Because that's all they have.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.480]   They don't know the kingdom of God. They don't know the deeper reality of God's truth.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.280]   And so all they have is the physical material things that are right in front of them.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.120]   All they have is their status or how other people feel about them.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.720]   All they have is the opinion of someone else.
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:10.400]   All they have is the attention and adoration of someone else and that's it.
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:17.440]   But Jesus is saying, "Look, it shouldn't be that way for you because you have a different perspective.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.160]   You know the kingdom of heaven.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:27.440]   You should be pursuing the heavenly kingdom and leaving the rest to God."
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:34.560]   In verse 33, Jesus says this very clearly, very plainly, and very profoundly.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:42.240]   He says, "But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:48.320]   That is one of the most powerful and profound verses in the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.760]   Jesus is saying, "Look, if you will pursue the values of the kingdom,
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:58.640]   if you will pursue rightness with God, and His righteousness."
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.040]   That word righteousness means living a life that is right with God,
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:08.080]   living in a way that is pleasing to God, living in a way that is obedient to God.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.840]   If you will pursue the values of the kingdom, if you will pursue a life that is right with God,
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.480]   if you will seek to obey Him in your life, then God will add in all the rest.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:26.400]   All those things we just talked about that are important to us as humans, God will add them in.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.240]   God will take care of our physical needs.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:30.800]   He'll make sure we have enough to eat and enough to wear.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:35.200]   He'll make sure we have a place to live, and He'll make sure we have transportation.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:40.400]   He will even make sure that we have relationships with other people that are healthy.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:50.080]   God will add in all of those things if we will simply pursue His kingdom and the values of His kingdom.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.480]   God will take care of the rest, and that's what Jesus is pointing us to in this verse.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.240]   And Jesus is also reminding us here to take our hands off of what we can't control.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.080]   Verse 34 is another verse that is just so profound and so powerful.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:10.880]   It says this, "Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.680]   Sufficient for the day is its own trouble."
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.440]   I love that verse.
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:19.920]   Jesus is saying, "Why would you be worried about what's going to happen next week, or next year,
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:30.320]   or five years from now, because you have no control over next week, or next year, or five years from now.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:32.320]   You can't do anything about it.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:36.400]   And by the time you get to next week, and next year, and five years from now,
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.920]   you'll have a whole new set of circumstances, and a whole new set of problems probably,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:44.320]   that you don't even know about right now.
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:48.800]   So why try to figure all that out and worry about that now?
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.120]   That day is going to have its own trouble.
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.480]   It's going to have its own issues to deal with.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:11:00.000]   For today, you should simply trust and walk with God, and let Him be at work in your life,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.600]   and let Him bring you peace, and comfort, and joy.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.160]   And you can worry about next week, and next year, and five years from now, when you get there.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.560]   Now Jesus is not saying that we shouldn't plan, or we shouldn't prepare for things in our life.
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.360]   There's other passages of Scripture that talk about that.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:18.880]   That's something that we're supposed to do.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.840]   That's a healthy thing for us to plan and prepare.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:25.840]   But even as we plan and prepare, if we are followers of Jesus,
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.640]   we should do that with an understanding that anything could change.
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.760]   We should hold loosely to our plans and our preparations.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.200]   We should understand that, "Okay, this is what I might like to do.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:39.360]   This is what I might plan to do.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.480]   But this could change.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.320]   God could change the course of my life.
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.520]   God could change where I'm headed.
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:46.320]   God could change what's happening in my life."
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:51.200]   Or something else could happen, something external that's beyond my control could happen,
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:55.600]   that God might allow to come into my life, that might be difficult or challenging.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.520]   So it may end up being completely different than what I want it to be.
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:03.120]   And that's okay.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:07.920]   As believers, we can plan and prepare, but we need to hold very loosely to those things.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.960]   Take our hands off of what we can't control,
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:15.840]   and stop being anxious about the future when we have no control over that.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:22.640]   When I was a young man, I had a lot of plans for my future in terms of career and education
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.600]   and all these things.
[00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.200]   And God changed those as I went along.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:31.680]   When I was an undergrad, I was planning to go on to grad school
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:35.280]   and to pursue a career in science, and God changed that.
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:41.200]   And I ended up going to grad school and pursuing a degree in divinity,
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.880]   and then going into the ministry.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.640]   And at the time when I was going into those things,
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:48.800]   when I was in high school and the first few years of college,
[00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.040]   if you would have described to me my life now,
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:53.520]   I would have said, "That doesn't make any sense.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.280]   I don't think that I would ever live that life."
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:00.560]   But now looking back, I can see how good it's been for me,
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.800]   and how God has been good every step of the way,
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.520]   and how all the things that God has brought into my life,
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.160]   the relationships and the work that He's given me,
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.880]   and the ministry that He's given me, has all been so good for me.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.800]   And I wouldn't want to change anything.
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:19.120]   But when I was a young man looking forward, I never would have planned that pathway.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.880]   I would have planned a completely different pathway that, to be perfectly honest,
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:26.080]   was really focused on me and was a much more selfish pathway.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:29.440]   And to be perfectly honest, if I had lived out that pathway,
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:34.640]   I would probably be a very selfish and proud and arrogant and self-absorbed person.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.320]   I'm really glad that I didn't live out that pathway.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:42.800]   But I didn't know what was best for me.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:45.120]   God did. God changed a lot of stuff.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.560]   And so when we think about our future, we should say, "You know what?
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:51.120]   Instead of trying to focus on all these things I can't control,
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:55.360]   I'm going to allow God to be in control.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.600]   I may plan and prepare, but I'm going to hold loosely to those plans and preparations,
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:01.760]   and I'm going to let God do what's best in my life,
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   because He knows what's best for me.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.360]   He sees things that are coming in a way that I do not see.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.400]   I'm going to take my hands off and let God drive.
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:14.160]   I'm going to let Jesus take the control in my life."
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:19.120]   And that's really important for us, and it's a way that we can avoid a lot of anxiety.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:22.960]   If we'll stop trying to put our hands on it and force it to work
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:26.560]   and make it work out the way we want it to, life's not like that.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.400]   We can't control life.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:32.640]   We can't just bring it all down and mold life to our will.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.080]   We cannot do that.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.840]   And if we'll take our hands off and say, "You know what?
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:42.080]   I'm going to trust the Lord to control and to work, even in the difficult moments."
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:45.600]   That's something that can relieve us of so much anxiety and give us so much peace.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.240]   You know what Jesus is saying here in verses 33 and 34
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:56.080]   is so counterintuitive to how we feel about our circumstances.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:01.520]   He's saying that as we release control and let go of our desire for control,
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.840]   we actually find peace.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.600]   And that seems just backwards and upside down to our minds.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.800]   When we are struggling with anxiety, a lot of times we feel like if we had more control,
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.920]   we would find peace.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:19.520]   We feel like if only we had more control over that situation,
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.560]   only if only we had more control over our future,
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:26.480]   if only we had more control over that relationship,
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:28.400]   then we could stop worrying about it.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.040]   And we feel like more control would bring us peace.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:37.920]   And Jesus is saying here that actually what brings us peace is when we release
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.080]   and we stop trying to control everything.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:47.680]   We stop trying to be in charge of it and we release and trust God and His love and care in our lives.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:51.200]   And that also has such a powerful effect on our behavior.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.920]   Like we talked about at the beginning,
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:57.120]   when we're motivated by fear and worry and anxiety,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.560]   we can make really unhealthy decisions because we're being motivated from an unhealthy place.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:04.720]   And we've experienced this in our lives.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:05.280]   Think about it.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:09.760]   Some of the worst financial decisions that you've made in your life
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:13.920]   probably came during a time of anxiety and fear.
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:19.440]   And that anxiety and fear motivated you to do something that was rash or impulsive
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.120]   or just wasn't a good idea.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.680]   Something that maybe you never would have done otherwise.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.000]   And it ended up being unhealthy for you.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:29.040]   The same is true in our relationships.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:34.720]   When we get anxious about a relationship and feel like we need to control that relationship more
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.920]   and we're motivated by fear and anxiety in that relationship,
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:43.120]   suddenly we become manipulative and we become difficult to interact with.
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.280]   And the relationship suffers because of our anxiety and our fear.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.240]   So many things in our life are like that.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.040]   We convince ourselves that it would be so much better if only we had more control.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.480]   The reality is we don't control anything in our life anyway.
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:01.200]   And any control that we think we have is just an illusion.
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.920]   But we still think we should control it.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:05.680]   And we still want to control it.
[00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:11.600]   But the truth is that when we release that control and say,
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.280]   "God, I can't do this. I can't make it happen.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:19.760]   I don't want to act out of fear of what might go wrong or what could happen.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.280]   I want to trust you and trust your goodness and trust your love and your care for me."
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:32.560]   When we begin to relate to our life and our circumstances and our relationships and our future
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:39.440]   and all the needs that we have from that place, that's when we really do experience peace.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:44.320]   Peace comes through release, through letting go of those things,
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.720]   not through grasping for more control.
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.240]   And in verse 33 here, I love this verse,
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:53.200]   "But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness,
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.520]   and all these things will be added to you."
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.200]   Jesus is calling us to loyalty to kingdom priorities.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:03.600]   You know, we talked about in the verses that precede this section on anxiety,
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.040]   where Jesus is talking about our focus.
[00:18:07.040 --> 00:18:12.880]   We talked about how Jesus in those verses was calling us to loyalty to kingdom values.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.080]   And Jesus wanted us to be loyal to the values of the kingdom
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.800]   and to seek to live those out and to be obedient to God.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:26.000]   And in this section, Jesus is calling us to loyalty to kingdom priorities.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.680]   He's saying, "Okay, if these values are what you value in your life,
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.400]   if you value the things that are important to God,
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.920]   then your priorities, the things that you organize your life around,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.600]   the things that you say, 'This is number one and this is number two and this is number three,'
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.960]   will reflect those values of the kingdom."
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:46.560]   And that's what Jesus is saying to us in Matthew 6, verse 33.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:51.680]   "Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:55.200]   That's a fair question to say, "Well, what is the kingdom of God and his righteousness?
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.320]   What are those kingdom priorities?"
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:00.320]   Well, what do we know from Scripture?
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:06.000]   Jesus told us that the first commandment is to love God with all of our heart and soul and strength.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.520]   And the second is to love our neighbor as ourself.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:12.000]   And that those two commandments, if we would really live them out,
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:20.800]   that that would basically encompass all of the law and all of God's instructions to us in the Old Testament.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:27.200]   So that's a great starting place to say, "Okay, if I want to be loyal to kingdom priorities,
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:31.200]   then the number one thing in my life is God and my relationship to him.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.000]   And I want to love him with everything that I have.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.880]   I want to love him with my mind. I want to love him with my heart.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:40.480]   I want to love him with my will and my choices and my obedience.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:45.040]   I want to love him with all of the whole of who I am as a person.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.280]   I want all of that to holistically love God.
[00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:53.440]   And then out of that love for God, I want to love others.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:20:02.240]   I want to love my family, my siblings, or my parents, or my spouse if you're married,
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:03.920]   or my children if you have children.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:09.520]   Or I want to love my friends, the relationships that God has brought into my life,
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:12.960]   these people that God has allowed me to have relationship with.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.800]   I want to love my co-workers. I want to love the people that I go to school with.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.560]   I want to love the people at my church.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.760]   I want to love the people in my community, in my neighborhood.
[00:20:21.760 --> 00:20:26.880]   I want to love people who have needs in my community, in my neighborhood, that I can serve and care for.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:33.360]   Though that is a kingdom priority, and to say that is more important,
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:39.760]   loving others is more important than me getting rich, or than me being comfortable,
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:47.040]   or than me stacking up a lot of possessions, or than me having an image of being some amazing person
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:52.720]   through my social media accounts, or than me feeling good about myself
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:57.840]   because I'm trying to do things to impress other people or to perform to some standard.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:00.640]   It's more important for me to love others.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.280]   It's more important for me, as Jesus said, to lay down my life for someone else.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.840]   Remember, Jesus said that greater love has no one than this,
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:11.200]   than to lay down your life for your friends.
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:18.800]   It's more important for me to sacrifice for someone else than to just seek my own good,
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.520]   and my own wants, and my own desires.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:27.200]   That's what it looks like to have loyalty to kingdom priorities.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:30.160]   And that's what Jesus is calling us to in this verse.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:35.120]   He's saying, "Look, if you will seek the kingdom of God first,
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:40.400]   if your loyalty will be towards the things that are important to God,
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.320]   and you will order your life in that way,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:46.880]   if you will say, 'First and foremost, it's about loving God and my relationship to Him,
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:52.080]   and secondly, I'm going to love others, and other things are going to fall in behind that,'"
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:56.240]   Jesus is saying, "Then God will add in everything else you will need,
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.800]   and you can finally stop being anxious,
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:02.880]   because you won't have to worry about the future.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.880]   You won't have to say, 'Well, is God going to take care of me?'"
[00:22:06.880 --> 00:22:12.400]   Because you will be so in love with God, and so caught up in your relationship to Him,
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:16.640]   that you will know that His presence is what sustains you,
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.240]   and what encourages you, and what gives you joy and peace,
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:23.360]   whether the future is good,
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.400]   or whether the future is something that you might think of as bad.
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:32.160]   You can say, "You know what? I'm going to enjoy God's presence in my relationship with Him
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.560]   if I'm healthy, or if I'm sick.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.880]   I'm going to enjoy my relationship with God and His presence in my life
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.760]   if I'm rich, or if I'm poor.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:46.400]   I'm going to enjoy my relationship with God and His presence in my life
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.960]   if I'm in a place of comfort, or a place of discomfort."
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:55.040]   And that is the testimony of Christianity throughout the ages.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.040]   There have been so many people in the history of Christianity
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.320]   who have lived and been imprisoned for their faith,
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:07.200]   or been persecuted, or even tortured or killed because they believed in Jesus,
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.840]   and yet in the midst of that, they were joyful,
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.640]   and they were full of peace and full of comfort.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.600]   That makes no sense, but it's because their priority was on loving God,
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.240]   and they were so caught up in their relationship to Him,
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:24.080]   that the earthly and physical realities didn't bother them anymore,
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:27.840]   and they had peace and comfort in the midst of something difficult,
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.240]   and uncomfortable, and painful.
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.120]   And all of us can experience that.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:36.080]   We can experience that, whether things are good or bad.
[00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.680]   We can find peace and comfort and joy in life.
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:43.840]   And we can learn to love others, whether things are good or bad.
[00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.640]   Most of us as humans, we love others conditionally,
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.520]   and when we feel good, and when someone else is making us feel good,
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.760]   then we love them back, and we treat them kindly.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:55.120]   If they're nice to us, then we're nice to them, and we all get along.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:58.880]   But if someone's unkind to us, then of course we're not going to be kind to them.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.960]   And if things are not going well in our life,
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:04.720]   then we're going to be grouchy and cranky, and we're going to snap at other people.
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:10.160]   And Jesus is saying that if we will have loyalty to kingdom priorities,
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.920]   and say, "I'm going to love others, regardless of my circumstances,
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.040]   even if I'm mistreated, or even if I'm going through something difficult,
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.640]   I'm still going to love others,"
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:24.080]   that we will experience God's goodness, and we will experience God's peace.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.440]   And we will not be so worried and anxious about what's going on.
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   And God will add those other things that we need into our life.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.400]   So I want to close out this study we've been doing on anxiety
[00:24:36.400 --> 00:24:43.360]   by just asking you to think about what it is that brings you anxiety.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:46.480]   And this is a question for me too. I grapple with this as well.
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:50.720]   And I want to point you to the fact that whatever it is, God is bigger.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:53.680]   God's love is stronger.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:56.480]   God's grace is deeper.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:58.960]   God's power is greater.
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:03.040]   And if you're having trouble believing that right now,
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:07.680]   if the problem, if the obstacle seems bigger than anything else,
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:10.640]   then I want to point you back to Scripture.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.040]   Go back to God's truth.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.560]   The Scripture tells us God's truth about reality as it really is,
[00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:22.320]   and about who we really are, and about the way the world really is.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.560]   Look at that and see what it says about you.
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:29.600]   See what it says about your circumstances, and bring that into your situation.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.440]   So if you're anxious, and you're worried, and you're afraid,
[00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:37.520]   because of your past, maybe something that you've done,
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.120]   or something that's been done to you,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:43.600]   and you feel like you can't get over it, you feel like you can't recover from it,
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.400]   you feel like you can't be forgiven, or you can't be clean,
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.160]   or you can't get free from it, or you'll never get over it or get past it,
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.040]   let me tell you what the Scripture says.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.680]   The Scripture says that God's grace is greater, and deeper,
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.360]   and stronger than anything that we've gone through.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.920]   Whether it was created by our own sin, or created by someone else's sin,
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.920]   someone who harmed us in some way, God's grace is greater.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.880]   And healing, and freedom, and victory is possible because of Jesus.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.080]   That's what the Scripture says.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:21.600]   If you're anxious, and worried, and fearful because of your future,
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.640]   and you think about things in your life that you want to happen,
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.040]   and you're afraid that they might not work out,
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.880]   and they might not go well for you,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.640]   and they might not end up being what you need, or what you want in your life,
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.480]   look at the Scripture.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.280]   What does God say?
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.360]   What does Jesus say right in this passage?
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.400]   That God's love and care is complete and all-encompassing,
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:46.080]   even for the smallest animals and for the flowers of the field.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:52.000]   And if God is that good to them, you matter much more to God.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.280]   And He will be much better to you.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:57.040]   He will care for you.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.080]   He will love you.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.040]   He will protect you.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:26:59.920]   He will guide you.
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:00.960]   He will be with you.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.680]   And even the difficult things that He allows to come into your life
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.040]   will be for your good to strengthen you, to grow you,
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:11.440]   to make you more like Jesus,
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.600]   and to bring about God's glory in your life.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.440]   Maybe you're anxious, or worried, or afraid
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.200]   because of relationships in your life,
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.560]   and things that you feel like are not going well,
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:23.920]   and they're beyond your control.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.160]   What does the Scripture say about that?
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.080]   The Scripture says that God is able to change any heart.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.960]   God is able to transform any situation.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.440]   God is able to defend people, even from lies and false accusations.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:39.600]   God is able to protect people,
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.160]   even from people who are out to do evil
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.400]   and who are intentionally trying to harm someone else.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:47.920]   Whatever you're dealing with in your relationships,
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.720]   God has the power to bring healing.
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.160]   God has the power to protect you.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.680]   God has the power to restore.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.000]   God has the power to fix it.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.720]   And God wants to do that.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:27:59.760]   You can trust Him.
[00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:03.360]   Maybe you're anxious, and afraid, and worried
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.880]   because you look at the world around us
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.200]   and you see all of the mess.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:11.280]   Maybe it's the COVID-19 pandemic,
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.320]   or maybe it's political unrest and turmoil,
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.160]   or maybe it's injustice,
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.040]   or maybe it's just things that go on
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.240]   in different parts of the world
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:23.440]   that you care about, but you can't fix them.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.320]   You can't change them.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.680]   You can't do anything about them.
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:29.120]   What does the Scripture say about those things?
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:33.040]   The Scripture says that God holds the world in His hands,
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.680]   that God laughs at the nations
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.360]   because they're so weak before Him,
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:38.800]   and that men make their plans,
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:41.120]   and even evil men, and government leaders,
[00:28:41.120 --> 00:28:43.840]   and people in positions of power make their plans.
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.320]   But ultimately, God rules over it all.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:50.480]   And God is a God of love, and care, and justice,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.800]   and commitment to His people.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:56.080]   And so God takes His people safely
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.920]   through all of the turmoil, all of the circumstances,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.680]   all of the plagues, and pestilence,
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:03.280]   and everything that happens.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:04.560]   That's what the Scripture says.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:07.600]   Whatever it is that causes you to be afraid,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:10.400]   causes you to worry, causes you to be anxious,
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.000]   God is bigger.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.760]   You can take it to Him.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:16.160]   You can pour it out before Him.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.720]   You can trust Him.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:21.600]   And I would encourage you to do that in your life.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:24.080]   As we talked about that very first week,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:26.000]   Jesus lays it out for us in this passage.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:27.360]   We've got to change our focus,
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:30.160]   put our eyes on God, and how great and good He is,
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:33.120]   and how great His love and care is for us.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.000]   Allow that change in focus
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.600]   to start to change our perspective,
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.440]   where suddenly the problems in our life
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.640]   are not such a big deal,
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.000]   and our relationship to God is what strengthens us,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.760]   and anchors us, and sustains us,
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:47.120]   and gives us joy and hope,
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   even in difficult times.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:52.240]   And allow that change in perspective
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.000]   to really start us growing in trust for Jesus,
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.640]   and saying, "God, I see who You are.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:00.080]   I see what You've done.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:01.440]   And because of that,
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:04.080]   I trust that You will take care of me.
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.000]   I trust that You will love me.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.160]   I trust that You will bring good things into my life,
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:09.280]   and not evil.
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.160]   And I trust that You will be in control of any situation,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:14.400]   even the most difficult things in my life."
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.320]   And we can experience the peace,
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:18.400]   and the comfort, and the hope
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.080]   that God has for us
[00:30:20.080 --> 00:30:23.680]   when we begin to put that type of trust in Him.
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:24.960]   I'm praying for you
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:27.520]   as you walk through anxiety, and fear,
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:28.480]   and worry in your life.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.600]   And you can pray for me.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.440]   And I know that God wants us to find peace in Jesus.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.000]   Let's pray.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   God, thank You for Your truth,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:39.840]   and for the comfort that it brings us, God.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.160]   I pray that You would help me,
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.960]   and help us to learn to release control,
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   and to just trust You,
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.600]   and to say, "God, we are going to let go
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.600]   of these things in our life that cause us fear,
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.800]   these things we can't control,
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:55.680]   these things that knock us around,
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.800]   and get us sideways,
[00:30:56.800 --> 00:30:58.400]   and just get us confused,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.240]   and cause us to be afraid and anxious.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:01.600]   God, we're going to release those things,
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.480]   give them up to You,
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.600]   let You have them,
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.120]   let You take them from our hands.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.040]   And we're going to trust You to do what You do.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:10.720]   What do You do?
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.560]   You do good things, God.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.080]   You work miracles.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.520]   You are a fixer.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.560]   You are a healer.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.000]   You are a repairer.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.120]   You are a builder.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.120]   You are the one who takes our brokenness
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.560]   and makes something beautiful, God.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:25.040]   And our world is full of brokenness,
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:26.400]   our lives are full of brokenness,
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.440]   but we trust You to fix, to heal,
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.560]   to restore, to repair.
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:34.480]   And God, we thank You for that.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.920]   We praise You for that today.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:40.480]   And we ask that we would grow in our trust of You,
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:43.200]   and find peace, and comfort, and hope
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:44.960]   as we put our trust in You,
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:47.520]   to be at work in our hearts and in our lives.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.400]   In Jesus' name.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:49.480]   Amen.
