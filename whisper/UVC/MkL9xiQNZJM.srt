1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
 Let's welcome him.

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,240
 (audience applauding)

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,700
 - Hello, hi everybody.

4
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:09,720
 Thank you, Pastor Mark, for praying,

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,220
 and thank you, James, for leading worship.

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,220
 Fun fact, I texted James this morning

7
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,420
 to see what he was wearing

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,560
 so that we could make sure we were matching.

9
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,120
 (laughing)

10
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,660
 That's not true, we just have a similar fashion sense.

11
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,340
 (laughing)

12
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,240
 Thank you both.

13
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:32,080
 So today, I wanna talk about the Book of Jonah,

14
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,240
 but before we do that, I wanna tell you guys a story.

15
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:39,920
 This is a story that I haven't really told before.

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,140
 It's been something that happened

17
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:46,000
 and was decently significant in my life for a while,

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,600
 but I didn't really see it as something

19
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,860
 that was timely or necessary at the time.

20
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,440
 But I think the themes of this story fit really well

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,120
 with the themes of the Book of Jonah,

22
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,580
 so I'm bringing it out today.

23
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:06,280
 I want you to think back to about a year and a half ago.

24
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,440
 This would be right as Chicago is getting out

25
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,680
 of our state-mandated lockdown, right?

26
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,880
 We're all kind of trying to figure out

27
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,980
 how to do this post-pandemic world,

28
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,840
 even though it was still mostly in the pandemic,

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,140
 and we're trying to figure out how to continue to function

30
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:25,560
 even though this virus is spreading.

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,040
 And we've been locked up for two and a half months.

32
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,320
 Things are kind of tense, right?

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,220
 And then, right as quarantines are lifting,

34
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:38,120
 the killing of George Floyd is basically televised

35
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,880
 and thrown everywhere online, and protests erupt.

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,240
 Peaceful marches are everywhere over our city.

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,520
 It was kind of a hectic time.

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,080
 Not only were we living through a massive worldwide pandemic

39
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,020
 like once in every hundred years,

40
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,720
 but we're also experiencing crazy amounts of social unrest

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,800
 and calls for new things to happen

42
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:04,240
 to bring justice about in our country.

43
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,580
 It was a bit of a crazy time.

44
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,300
 Now, for those of you who don't know,

45
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,900
 I am a photographer, kind of.

46
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,060
 I get to do part of that for my job,

47
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,560
 and I also get to do it on the side.

48
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,440
 So I love taking photos of cool places in Chicago.

49
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,240
 I love taking photos of cool places when I travel,

50
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:25,240
 and I also really enjoy taking photos of worldwide events.

51
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,780
 So I loved it when the Cubs won the World Series

52
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:31,440
 because I got to go, and I got to take photos

53
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,980
 of entire crowds at Wrigleyville

54
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,260
 just celebrating and getting excited.

55
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,180
 I loved it when the pandemic happened

56
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:41,980
 because I got to take really stark photos of empty shelves,

57
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,920
 no toilet paper in sight.

58
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,760
 It was great.

59
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,020
 It's like a photographer's dream

60
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:51,020
 to live through these kinds of world-changing events, right?

61
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,460
 So when all these protests started happening,

62
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,580
 when these marches began happening,

63
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,460
 I'm like, "I gotta be there.

64
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,560
 "I'm a photographer.

65
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,800
 "I can't one day teach my kid how to use a camera

66
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,500
 "and then not have photos

67
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,660
 "of some of the most significant historical events

68
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:07,540
 "that I've lived through."

69
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:08,700
 So I went.

70
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,540
 I went to different protests

71
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,900
 that were happening around the city.

72
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,660
 I documented it, and I took photos,

73
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,940
 and I partook in those.

74
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,780
 I even accidentally came across

75
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,200
 some of the looting that was happening,

76
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,140
 and I documented that a little bit,

77
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,380
 although a little more scared.

78
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,420
 And then what ended up happening next

79
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:31,260
 was quite possibly, quite possibly

80
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,900
 the worst experience I've ever had

81
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,400
 trying to photograph anything

82
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,020
 because in addition to protests that were peaceful

83
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,780
 and marches put on by churches

84
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,840
 and different organizations and groups,

85
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,840
 there was also a lot of panic and fear in our neighborhoods.

86
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,460
 And that's what I stumbled on one night.

87
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:54,060
 Sammy and I, my wife, were coming home from Carbone,

88
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,740
 which is the best hidden gem in Chicago.

89
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,980
 It's right by Riccobini's,

90
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:00,100
 and it is so much better than Riccobini's,

91
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,540
 so if you're ever in town, go there.

92
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,720
 It is the best.

93
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,420
 So we were coming back from that,

94
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,580
 and we were driving on 31st and Princeton,

95
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,220
 and we noticed at this intersection

96
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:15,340
 was a massive crowd of people, like massive.

97
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,320
 I'm talking 40 to 50 people,

98
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,660
 and remember, we've just come out of lockdown,

99
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,500
 so this is not normal, right?

100
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,420
 What is this massive crowd doing?

101
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:27,380
 And we finally drive through, and we get through,

102
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,620
 and we notice along our street

103
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:31,780
 there's a bunch of people sitting outside

104
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,920
 of their doorsteps, people sitting on lawn chairs

105
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,880
 right in front of their buildings.

106
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,420
 People are kind of alert and waiting.

107
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,780
 So we find out that apparently

108
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,080
 one of the very peacefully planned protests

109
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,260
 was going to walk through just a corner of our neighborhood,

110
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,700
 just a tiny spot of our neighborhood.

111
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,980
 And the place where we live just erupted.

112
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:03,340
 People were not okay.

113
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,640
 That crowd, they were walking around with baseball bats,

114
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,920
 crowbars, table legs that they had unscrewed

115
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,920
 from their table.

116
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,120
 I even saw a machete.

117
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,720
 There were people sitting outside their buildings

118
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,880
 with pistols.

119
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,000
 I even saw somebody with an AK.

120
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,480
 I am not kidding, a semi-automatic weapon.

121
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:26,860
 So being the genius that I am,

122
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,960
 and against the wishes of my much smarter wife,

123
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,960
 I decide I'm gonna go take photos of this.

124
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,380
 How often do you see somebody walking along a street

125
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,300
 right next to a police officer with a pistol

126
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,260
 or a freaking machete?

127
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,820
 Not very often.

128
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:49,200
 So I take my camera and I go out, I go down our street,

129
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,640
 and it's tense.

130
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,020
 It's, well, not yet.

131
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,660
 It's not actually yet tense.

132
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,380
 Right now it's pretty light.

133
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,700
 I get up there and it's by Franco's Restaurant

134
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,980
 and everybody is having a good time.

135
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,100
 They're joking with each other.

136
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,040
 They're showing off the table legs or the crowbars

137
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,220
 or whatever random assortment of weapons

138
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,580
 they decided to bring to this little gathering.

139
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,040
 Oh, it's a little insane.

140
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,400
 And they're all drinking too.

141
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,700
 They're in this group and they have,

142
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:22,060
 like some of them have crowbars in one hand

143
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,600
 and beer in the other.

144
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,540
 And it's getting to them.

145
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,000
 So I'm a little anxious about this.

146
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,120
 So I make sure to do all the best practices.

147
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,500
 I say, "Hey, I'm just a photographer.

148
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,140
 "I've been photographing everything that's happening

149
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,140
 "from the pandemic to the protests.

150
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,560
 "Just so you know, I'll be taking photos.

151
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,760
 "If you don't want me to take your photo,

152
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:40,820
 "just let me know."

153
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,940
 And I get a lot of people saying, "Yeah, you're fine."

154
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,780
 And then some people saying,

155
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,900
 "I'd prefer not to be in photos."

156
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,740
 I'm like, "Okay."

157
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:48,660
 And then we hear a noise.

158
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:56,120
 And two young kids, I'm talking 10 and 13, tops,

159
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:59,440
 ride their bikes past our crowd.

160
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:04,320
 And two of the guys in the crowd

161
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:07,240
 throw their beer bottles at these kids

162
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,740
 and yell, "We don't want you in our neighborhood."

163
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:15,800
 Everything just shifted in a moment.

164
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,940
 The tone just took a 180.

165
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:24,720
 And suddenly, things were not jovial anymore.

166
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,340
 People weren't messing around.

167
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,860
 There was this weird macho and this weird,

168
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:33,720
 almost like desire for violence

169
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,720
 or desire for letting out their aggression in this crowd.

170
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,120
 It shifted massively.

171
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:45,300
 And in that moment, some of the people

172
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,440
 who were a little more under the influence turned around

173
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,520
 and they pointed their weapons at me and they said,

174
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,380
 "You can't have that here.

175
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,580
 "You need to get out of here.

176
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,020
 "Some of these people have city jobs, man.

177
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:59,920
 "They don't want me taking photos of them

178
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,060
 "doing illegal and terrible things."

179
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,680
 So I sense it and I try to push back,

180
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,460
 like, "Hey, it's public space," but they're not having it.

181
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,080
 So I start to turn around

182
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,680
 and I don't wanna walk directly home

183
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,840
 because I'm only one and a half blocks away

184
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,060
 from where I live.

185
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,820
 So I walk the other direction

186
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,880
 and two of the guys start following me.

187
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,960
 My genius mind was like,

188
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,480
 "I should get the memory card out of my camera."

189
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,720
 So I do that and that's what I'm thinking of.

190
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,360
 And I'm thinking, "I need to find a safe spot."

191
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,520
 I see a streetlight off to the corner

192
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,800
 and I head there thinking,

193
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,980
 "Surely no one's gonna mess with me

194
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:38,060
 "in broad streetlight 'cause it's dark at this point."

195
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,120
 So I get there and the two guys show up

196
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,340
 and there's a group of people

197
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,320
 kind of hanging around that streetlight

198
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,540
 and they all form a circle.

199
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:52,540
 And out of the home by that corner comes this older guy.

200
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,500
 And if you've ever seen a mafia movie

201
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,720
 and you think of like that old mob boss,

202
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,740
 that's the image of this guy.

203
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:03,580
 About yay high, balding head, combed over.

204
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:05,220
 Like I don't think he had a cigar,

205
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:08,240
 but if he did, it would have made perfect sense.

206
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,580
 So he comes out, he's in his white shirt with his overalls

207
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,900
 and he decides to be the one

208
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,380
 to take the charge questioning me.

209
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,980
 And on his shoulder is a sawed off shotgun.

210
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:21,820
 So this whole crowd surrounds me

211
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,820
 and starts asking me questions about where am I from?

212
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,300
 Am I actually in this neighborhood?

213
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,340
 Do I live here?

214
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,820
 What, let me see your driver's license.

215
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:31,540
 Prove that you're not from somewhere else in the city

216
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:34,060
 and you're not trying to like screw us over.

217
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,540
 These guys start getting intense.

218
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,180
 They start yelling at me.

219
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:40,740
 I'm anxious, I'm worried.

220
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,660
 I'm trying everything I can to calm them down.

221
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,500
 And eventually I just say,

222
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,620
 "Look, I am just gonna leave, all right?

223
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,560
 "Clearly you don't want your photo taken.

224
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,420
 "I will not take your photo.

225
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:54,600
 "I haven't taken any photo since it got intense.

226
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,100
 "I'm just gonna leave."

227
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:58,860
 And they're like, "Yeah, you do that."

228
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,740
 I leave and people trail me for just a little bit

229
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,900
 but then I zigzag around

230
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,220
 so that nobody can see where I'm going

231
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,680
 and I come home and I am shook up.

232
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,680
 I am like anxious about this.

233
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,260
 Even now thinking about the encounter

234
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,840
 it gets me really, really tense.

235
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,780
 I haven't told this story

236
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:24,020
 because I think there are a lot of other stories

237
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:26,020
 at that time that were more worthy of telling

238
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,580
 and more timely and I don't think the world needed me

239
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,080
 to tell this story or anything like that.

240
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,820
 It wasn't that groundbreaking or anything.

241
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:38,100
 There were other narratives that needed

242
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,900
 to be lifted up during that time.

243
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,580
 So I kept it to myself but the reason I'm bringing it out now

244
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:46,020
 is because the themes of that story

245
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,420
 of hatred and division and aggression

246
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:55,560
 tie in really well to the themes of the book of Jonah.

247
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,200
 I won't talk about what that is now

248
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,520
 but I'll bring it back in just a minute.

249
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,900
 So let's pray.

250
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,620
 Oh God, thank you so much that you are our God,

251
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,880
 that you love us, that you protect us,

252
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,780
 that you have grace for us,

253
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,060
 that you have given us your word

254
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,900
 so that we may know who you are

255
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,580
 and that you give us wonderful gems of Bible books

256
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,560
 like the book of Jonah.

257
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,460
 I pray that you'd be with us as we talk about it.

258
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,700
 Be with me as I speak about it.

259
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,540
 Don't let me say anything that is against

260
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,860
 or contrary to what you stand for, God.

261
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,160
 Let each of us in this room examine our own hearts

262
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,480
 in the light of you and what you stand for, God.

263
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,740
 May you have your way with each of us.

264
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,460
 We love you, God, and we pray this in your name, amen.

265
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,140
 Now, if I were to ask any of you

266
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,780
 what the book of Jonah is about,

267
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:51,220
 most of us think about VeggieTales, right?

268
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:55,580
 Most of us think about the pirates who don't do anything

269
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,980
 and we think about the VeggieTales movie,

270
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,100
 the bankrupt their studio, right?

271
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:02,740
 And in that movie, you have a bunch of vegetables

272
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:05,660
 singing fun songs about how awesome God is

273
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:07,800
 and how he gives second chances.

274
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:10,100
 And it's so much fun,

275
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,460
 but it's also a very watered down version

276
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,540
 of the actual book, right?

277
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:18,220
 Trying to describe the book of Jonah as,

278
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,880
 oh, Jonah's scared of Nineveh, he runs away,

279
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,280
 God gives him a second chance

280
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,760
 and everything turns out great.

281
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,080
 Describing it that way is like trying to describe

282
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,740
 Avengers Endgame as somebody steals jewelry

283
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:32,000
 from an old guy.

284
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,260
 It's not really gonna cover all the bases.

285
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,360
 It might technically be true,

286
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,440
 but it doesn't give you the full scope of what's there.

287
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,560
 And that's a shame because the book of Jonah

288
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,400
 is crazy cool.

289
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,320
 It is funny, it is extreme,

290
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,560
 it is almost satirical in nature.

291
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,480
 And it is kind of one of a kind in the Bible.

292
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,240
 And when we look at it and we kind of view it

293
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,480
 through the lens of a children's book,

294
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,040
 we do it a massive disservice.

295
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,640
 I gotta give credit to Tim Mackey from The Bible Project

296
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,100
 because his work on unraveling and decoding this book

297
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,640
 and helping me see it in the way

298
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,080
 that maybe the person reading it at the time would have

299
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:18,440
 has changed the way that I look at the book forever.

300
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:19,600
 So props to him.

301
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:23,080
 Now, the part we wanna talk about today

302
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,620
 is at the very end of the book.

303
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,660
 And we can't talk about the very end of the book

304
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,760
 without discussing what goes on for the rest of it.

305
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:33,880
 So in order to talk about the rest of the book

306
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,040
 and to sum it up,

307
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,760
 I'm gonna use the most sophisticated

308
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:40,280
 storytelling tool I have, puppets.

309
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,760
 (audience laughing)

310
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,560
 Now, my wife was very much against this,

311
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,640
 but for me, that was very personal

312
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,280
 because for those of you who don't know, I was homeschooled.

313
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,840
 And we don't have sports when you're homeschooled.

314
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,760
 When you're homeschooled,

315
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,800
 you don't join the volleyball team,

316
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,120
 you join the puppet team.

317
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,320
 I'm not kidding.

318
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,480
 I was in a traveling puppet troop.

319
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,520
 We had neon puppets and we were basically the varsity team.

320
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,760
 I was pretty good.

321
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,040
 In fact, the puppets I had,

322
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:10,240
 you actually had arm rods to deal with as well.

323
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,980
 And they were way more advanced than these level one puppets.

324
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,400
 But we're gonna work with what the Moody Library has

325
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,360
 and we're just gonna go with that.

326
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,600
 Sound good?

327
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:25,400
 So bear with me as I give a bit of a comical recap

328
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,360
 of the book of Jonah up to this point.

329
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:28,280
 Sound good?

330
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,120
 Cool.

331
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,380
 Let's recap Jonah.

332
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,880
 This is a bit of an overview that Tim Mackey did.

333
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,200
 It is wonderful.

334
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,680
 We're gonna go through the spark notes of this

335
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,620
 as we tell this story.

336
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,280
 This is Jonah.

337
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:46,840
 You can tell because he has a necklace of a whale

338
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,520
 and it says Jonah.

339
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,240
 I don't think that's canonical,

340
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,920
 but the puppet says it, so we're gonna go with it.

341
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,360
 This is Jonah.

342
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,920
 And Jonah's a prophet.

343
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,720
 For those of us who don't know,

344
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,240
 prophets of the time were basically

345
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,560
 God's mouthpiece to Israel.

346
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,200
 So God would need to say something to people,

347
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,240
 but because God prefers to work through people,

348
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,480
 through his representatives on the earth,

349
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,240
 that's what it means that we're the image of God

350
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,400
 or images of God,

351
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,080
 he uses humans to work with other humans.

352
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,840
 So he had prophets.

353
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:20,320
 It was this class of people that would

354
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,320
 speak on behalf of God.

355
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,860
 And Jonah was one of those prophets.

356
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,680
 Now if you're in ancient Hebrew

357
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,400
 and you're reading the book of Jonah,

358
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,120
 when you say, oh, this is a prophetical book,

359
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,160
 you're expecting to open it up

360
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,200
 and hear all the proclamations of judgments

361
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,180
 that God has for Israel,

362
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,600
 or all the warnings or all the encouragements that he has.

363
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,600
 If you look at the books ahead or behind of Jonah,

364
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,920
 they're just chapter upon chapter of the prophets

365
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,700
 saying to Israel what they need to know.

366
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,660
 But then the book of Jonah is different.

367
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,240
 It's a narrative.

368
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,080
 And not only that,

369
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,080
 it's kind of intense and insane and extreme

370
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,400
 in the best way possible.

371
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,120
 So at the beginning of the book,

372
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,840
 God sends Jonah a message.

373
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:12,200
 It says, "And the word of the Lord came to Jonah.

374
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,240
 "Go to Nineveh and that great city

375
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,840
 "and tell them the judgment I have for them.

376
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,160
 "In 40 days, they're going to be destroyed."

377
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,680
 Now, Jonah doesn't like this.

378
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,920
 Jonah dislikes this so much

379
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,400
 that rather than going to Nineveh over here,

380
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,920
 he turns the other direction and heads towards Tarshish.

381
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,200
 He gets to a port of Joppa,

382
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,840
 he gets in the boat,

383
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,840
 and he sails away from where God has asked him to go.

384
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,800
 We were going over this with our students

385
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:50,760
 at Urban Voice recently,

386
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:54,000
 and we were like, what do you think is Jonah's motivation?

387
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,900
 Why is he running?

388
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,840
 Why does he not want to do what God has asked him to?

389
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,920
 And the general consensus from the students

390
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,000
 and from just about anybody who reads it

391
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,200
 is that Nineveh's a bad place and Jonah's terrified.

392
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,160
 What Nineveh used to do is when they conquered a city

393
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,720
 and they took the walls down,

394
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,820
 or they conquered a city

395
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,240
 and they would take the leader of that city

396
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,840
 and they would string,

397
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,960
 I don't know how graphic I should be,

398
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,460
 they would cut them up in creative ways

399
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,940
 and string them along the wall of that city.

400
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:31,160
 So the leaders would not only be killed and bleeding out,

401
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:34,240
 but they'd also be publicly humiliated in the process,

402
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:37,000
 and everybody in that city would have a very clear reminder

403
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,840
 of what has happened to them.

404
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:41,860
 So our students are like, well, Jonah's terrified.

405
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,680
 They don't want that to happen to him.

406
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,200
 I wouldn't want to go tell Nineveh,

407
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,820
 hey, you're gonna be destroyed in like 40 days.

408
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:52,120
 So Jonah's running away.

409
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:55,100
 He gets in the boat, he falls asleep,

410
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,100
 and then the Bible says God sent a massive wind,

411
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,260
 a great wind, a storm to hit this boat,

412
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,060
 and things are terrifying, things are freaky.

413
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,120
 It's so bad, in fact,

414
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:16,700
 that the sailors, who are apparently

415
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:20,320
 on a different diet than Jonah, are terrified,

416
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
 and they begin praying to their God,

417
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,840
 and they're like, ah, what is happening?

418
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,140
 And they're like, is everybody praying to their God?

419
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,560
 Do we have all of our bases covered?

420
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,420
 What's that one guy down deck that's sleeping?

421
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,380
 Go wake him up.

422
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,200
 And the captain comes and says, Jonah, pray to your God.

423
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,040
 What are you doing?

424
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,040
 He's like, what, what, oh, okay.

425
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,140
 So they're all praying to their gods.

426
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,700
 Notice, Jonah ain't saying a word.

427
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,140
 They're terrified, and Jonah knows what's going on,

428
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,100
 but he's just keeping his mouth shut.

429
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,060
 He's willing to let them all figure it out themselves.

430
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,460
 So they cast lots, they play a game of chance,

431
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:57,720
 and Jonah draws the short straw.

432
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,300
 So in that day and age, oh, crap, our God's mad at you.

433
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:04,500
 And Jonah says, yeah, I am a Hebrew,

434
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,480
 and I worship the God Jehovah, Yahweh,

435
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,460
 and basically, he's really angry at me

436
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,780
 for running away from him.

437
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:14,000
 That's why all this is happening.

438
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,620
 So they're like, oh my gosh, this is terrifying.

439
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,260
 And they're such great people

440
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,800
 that they actually try to row the other way.

441
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,580
 They're like, maybe we can row out of it.

442
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,280
 And Jonah's like, no, what you have to do is,

443
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,620
 now at this point, you'd think Jonah maybe understands

444
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,100
 that God's mad at him.

445
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,100
 Jonah maybe knows what he has to do.

446
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,380
 Maybe Jonah's gonna tell them,

447
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:37,600
 hey, we should turn this boat around,

448
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,040
 go the other way, and I'll go to Nineveh.

449
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,060
 But what's Jonah say?

450
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,260
 You should throw me overboard.

451
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:49,100
 You should throw me into the sea and leave me to drown.

452
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:54,100
 Jonah would rather die than go to Nineveh for some reason.

453
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,720
 They don't wanna do it.

454
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,600
 They try to row the other way.

455
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,800
 It won't work.

456
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,000
 And with a prayer to God, like God,

457
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,640
 forgive us if this results in this man dying,

458
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,780
 they throw him overboard.

459
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:07,880
 The storm clears.

460
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,560
 And the first subversive thing that happens,

461
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,760
 the thing we're not expecting,

462
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,240
 is that all the sailors are like, crap,

463
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,640
 that must be the real God.

464
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,600
 And they make covenants towards him,

465
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,800
 and they make promises.

466
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,860
 Those sailors become believers in Jehovah.

467
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:24,020
 Even though they would have been of other nations,

468
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,700
 even though they would have been of other tongues

469
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,740
 and different religions,

470
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,380
 they come to know God through it.

471
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:32,820
 So Jonah's drowning.

472
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,060
 And this is the part of the story everyone loves.

473
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:40,180
 God sends a fish,

474
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,820
 who is apparently a very happy whale,

475
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,540
 to swallow Jonah up, right?

476
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:49,380
 God is not going to let Jonah die,

477
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,940
 'cause honestly, Jonah dying would kinda be like him

478
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,320
 getting one over on God, like,

479
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,960
 ha ha, you can't make me go to Nineveh.

480
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,960
 So God swallows, God has the fish swallow Jonah up,

481
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,360
 and while in the belly of the whale,

482
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,340
 Jonah recites different psalms.

483
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,820
 He prays to God.

484
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,940
 Now, on first read, it looks like he's praying,

485
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:12,140
 looks like he's repenting,

486
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,140
 but the more you read it, he never actually apologizes.

487
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:19,300
 He never actually commits to be better, really.

488
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,700
 All he's really doing is quoting psalms

489
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,900
 about how amazing God is, how forgiving God is,

490
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:28,100
 how salvific and loving God is.

491
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:34,660
 And after three days, God tells the fish

492
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,740
 to vomit Jonah out onto dry land.

493
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,660
 That's what the text says.

494
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,880
 There's vomit in the Bible.

495
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,260
 Vomit is a key element of this story.

496
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:48,300
 So the fish vomits Jonah onto dry land,

497
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,660
 and Jonah decides to go to Nineveh.

498
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,860
 So he's going into Nineveh,

499
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,820
 and we're told Nineveh is a great city.

500
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,820
 It would take three days to walk all the way through Nineveh.

501
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:02,760
 But Jonah, he walks one day into it.

502
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,220
 Just one day.

503
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:09,480
 It's a three-day trip city, but he goes in one day,

504
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:13,160
 and he says, oh, sorry,

505
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,060
 and he says, "40 more days,

506
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:19,500
 "and Nineveh shall be overturned."

507
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:23,360
 Hey, in 40 days, you're all going to be destroyed.

508
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,600
 Not a very convincing sermon.

509
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,260
 Jonah didn't put his best work towards this.

510
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:31,740
 He's not exactly attempting to convince anybody.

511
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,220
 He's fulfilling an obligation.

512
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:37,740
 He's doing the barest minimal possible.

513
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:40,060
 So he goes part of the way into the city,

514
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,820
 and he says, hey, you guys are all going to be destroyed

515
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,420
 in 40 days, and then that's it.

516
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:48,340
 But the next part is also surprising.

517
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,720
 We wouldn't have expected the sailors to turn to God,

518
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,700
 and we also wouldn't have expected Nineveh to,

519
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:57,700
 but what happens is that word gets all the way,

520
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:02,880
 oh boy, word gets all the way to the Ninevite king,

521
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,400
 and he's like, oh, crap, guys,

522
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,260
 we're going to be destroyed in 40 days,

523
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,540
 and he puts out a decree to all of the people

524
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,740
 in that nation.

525
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,000
 He says, guys, we need to dress ourselves

526
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,820
 in sackcloth and ash, which is the thing you would do

527
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,500
 at that time if you were grieving and in despair,

528
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,060
 and he says, and we need to pray to this God

529
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,860
 and ask him, because maybe he'll relent.

530
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:32,900
 And so the king has every man, even every cattle,

531
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:38,700
 every freaking cow, be in sackcloth and ashes and repent.

532
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,860
 And at the end of chapter three, it says,

533
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,960
 and God saw what they had done and relented.

534
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:49,900
 So now we're at the point of the story where we want to be.

535
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,420
 Now we're at the very last chapter,

536
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,780
 and this chapter is kind of like a key.

537
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:58,880
 It unlocks some of Jonah's motivations.

538
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,540
 It tells you what he was thinking

539
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,160
 throughout this entire ordeal.

540
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,060
 So that's where we're going to pick up.

541
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:11,680
 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was angry,

542
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:15,120
 and he prayed to the Lord and said, oh, Lord,

543
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,100
 is this, is not this what I said

544
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,780
 when I was yet in my country?

545
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:23,080
 That is why I made haste to flee to Tarshish.

546
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,940
 Pause for a second.

547
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,060
 Jonah's telling us why he didn't go to Nineveh.

548
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,620
 He's explaining it himself.

549
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,600
 He wasn't afraid of Nineveh.

550
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,060
 He knew that God was going to forgive Nineveh if he went.

551
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:42,320
 Jonah continues, for I knew that you are a gracious God

552
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:45,120
 and merciful, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love

553
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,720
 and relenting from disaster.

554
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,840
 Therefore now, oh Lord, please take my life from me,

555
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,020
 for it is better for me to die than to live.

556
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:56,080
 Jonah's throwing a temper tantrum.

557
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,660
 Jonah is like a child who doesn't like a decision

558
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,740
 his parents has made, and the Lord said,

559
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:03,820
 you do well to be angry.

560
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:07,260
 Jonah went out of the city and sat to the east of the city

561
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,820
 and made a booth for himself there.

562
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,940
 He sets up tent.

563
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,700
 He sat under it in the shade till he should see

564
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,720
 what would become of the city.

565
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,180
 So remember he said in 40 days,

566
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,860
 you guys are gonna be destroyed.

567
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:22,540
 He's camping out there for 40 days just out of spite,

568
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:25,060
 just because he wants to watch them be destroyed.

569
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:27,060
 Now the Lord God appointed a plant

570
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,900
 and made it come up over Jonah,

571
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,700
 that it might be a shade over his head

572
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,020
 to save him from his discomfort.

573
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:37,380
 So Jonah was exceedingly glad because of this plant.

574
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,780
 Notice when God is giving Jonah some favor,

575
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,880
 Jonah's happy, he's a happy boy.

576
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,080
 He's great with this.

577
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:48,500
 But when dawn came up the next day

578
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,860
 and Nineveh was not destroyed,

579
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:52,940
 God appointed a worm that attacked the plant

580
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,460
 so that it withered.

581
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:58,180
 When the sun arose, God pointed a scorching east wind

582
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,380
 and the sun beat down on the head of Jonah

583
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,460
 so that he was faint.

584
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,140
 And he asked that he might die and said,

585
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,460
 it is better for me to die than to live.

586
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,440
 Apparently Jonah keeps going back to this

587
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,560
 whenever he's in an argument.

588
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:14,620
 But God said to Jonah,

589
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,180
 do you do well to be angry for the plant?

590
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:19,080
 He said, yes, I do well to be angry, angry enough to die.

591
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,320
 And the Lord said, you pity the plant

592
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,160
 for which you did not labor,

593
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,860
 nor did you make it grow which came into being in a night

594
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,820
 and perished in a night.

595
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,540
 And should I not pity Nineveh,

596
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:34,540
 that great city in which there are more than 120,000 persons

597
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,800
 who do not even know their right hand from their left

598
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,740
 and also much cattle?

599
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,900
 And that's the end of the book.

600
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,740
 That's how it ends.

601
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,680
 In some translations, which I love,

602
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,720
 it's and even the cows?

603
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,500
 Then it just ends.

604
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,100
 You end with God being like,

605
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,380
 and what about the cows, Jonah?

606
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:00,140
 So this is just the weirdest, strangest dud

607
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:04,620
 of an ending to a book, but it is so fascinating.

608
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,120
 It is so fascinating.

609
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,720
 Because what this final chapter reveals about Jonah

610
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,120
 is that Jonah was not afraid that Nineveh would kill him.

611
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,840
 Jonah was afraid Nineveh would be forgiven.

612
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:23,940
 Jonah was so sure that if he went to Nineveh,

613
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,640
 like God asked him to, that God would forgive Nineveh.

614
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,060
 And Jonah didn't like that.

615
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:34,100
 And he was willing to run away for it,

616
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:36,060
 leave his entire life for it.

617
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,760
 He was even willing to die for it.

618
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:46,740
 What is interesting here is that Jonah refuses

619
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:51,740
 to accept a God who loves people that Jonah hates.

620
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,180
 Say that again.

621
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:59,180
 Jonah refuses to accept a God who loves people Jonah hates.

622
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:06,900
 I wanna go back to that story, kind of.

623
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,200
 I wanna go to a few days after that happened.

624
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,160
 Samy and I were going out to eat

625
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,120
 once restaurants were allowed to open up.

626
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,520
 And we were at a pizza place next to our restaurant,

627
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,620
 next to where we live.

628
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:23,580
 And it's in the same neighborhood that this event happened.

629
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,160
 And we're eating our pizza,

630
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,400
 and in walks one of the guys from that night.

631
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,800
 In fact, this was one of the guys

632
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,520
 who even threw his bottle at one of the teenagers.

633
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,720
 And one of the guys who followed me

634
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,580
 midway through when I tried to leave.

635
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:43,600
 I noticed myself tense up.

636
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,880
 I noticed my breathing get shallow.

637
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,000
 I was getting anxious.

638
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,060
 I asked Samy, "We finished our food?"

639
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,000
 And then I asked her if we could leave.

640
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,400
 And I remember, because he was the one

641
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,240
 who had been saying, "We don't want you here.

642
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,880
 "These people have city jobs."

643
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:08,720
 And from that point, for the next few months,

644
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:11,600
 something in me had shifted.

645
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
 Something in me had changed.

646
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,720
 And something about the way that I viewed my neighbors

647
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,180
 and the people on my street had altered.

648
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:27,520
 I didn't want to pass them while I was walking my dog.

649
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:31,320
 I didn't want to talk to them when I was parking my car.

650
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,680
 I didn't want to run into them at any of the businesses.

651
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,100
 In fact, when I'm doing all of those things,

652
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:41,640
 there is a very real part of me that despises them.

653
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:45,040
 There's a very real part of me that sees

654
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,940
 some of those faces that I remember from that night

655
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:52,940
 and feels very real anger and very real vitriol

656
00:29:52,940 --> 00:30:01,440
 and almost hatred, almost like I despise their very being.

657
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,940
 I hate the fact that they're in my neighborhood.

658
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,820
 I hate the fact that I live among them.

659
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,220
 And all these thoughts are going through my head

660
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:11,560
 as I walk my dog past them,

661
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,380
 as I shop next to them at the gas station

662
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,780
 or fill up my vehicle.

663
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:22,160
 In that moment, guys, I had also become Jonah.

664
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,100
 We read this book and we think it's a little insane

665
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,020
 or a little extreme,

666
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,560
 but we ourselves are prone to the exact same thing.

667
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,580
 I could not look at my neighbors

668
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,100
 with the eyes that God looks at them

669
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,880
 because of my anger towards them.

670
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:48,140
 I could not accept that God also loves them

671
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:52,200
 because of what I perceived as the kind of people they were.

672
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,540
 And I lived like that for a while.

673
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:03,020
 In this moment, Jonah believes he knows better than God.

674
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,180
 That's the root of it.

675
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:08,060
 God, I know better than you.

676
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:11,900
 And if you were to make something bad happen to these people

677
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,540
 that would be better, that would be justice.

678
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,340
 If you were to make it so that they couldn't do that

679
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,420
 to people anymore, that would be justice.

680
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:23,060
 It's this belief that we know better than God.

681
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:29,900
 And it's also the same exact motivation

682
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,400
 as Adam and Eve in the garden.

683
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,260
 What do Adam and Eve in the garden do?

684
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,180
 God tells them something bad is going to happen

685
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,740
 if they do something, but they decide,

686
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,280
 I think something good is gonna happen if I do that.

687
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,760
 So often in Genesis we're told, and God said it was good,

688
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:47,020
 and God said it was good, and God said it was good.

689
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:49,680
 And then with the apple or the fruit

690
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,780
 that he's told them not to eat,

691
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:54,900
 it says they looked and saw that it was good.

692
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:58,760
 That's a verbal code for us,

693
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:02,200
 that they looked and they're making the moral judgment call.

694
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:05,380
 The disobedience didn't happen at the bite of the fruit.

695
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:07,240
 The disobedience happened when they decided

696
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,600
 to pick it from the tree.

697
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:14,020
 To pull this even closer to our story,

698
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,260
 at the very beginning it says,

699
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,420
 but it displeased Jonah exceedingly.

700
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,260
 See that little A?

701
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,980
 That means there's a different way

702
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,860
 that it's said in certain passages.

703
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,420
 Some passages don't say that it displeased Jonah exceedingly.

704
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:30,580
 Some passages say Jonah found it exceedingly evil.

705
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,320
 And what happens right before this?

706
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:36,160
 God relents, God does not destroy Nineveh.

707
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,580
 So God doesn't destroy Nineveh,

708
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:41,500
 and in some of the passages we have,

709
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,440
 it was seen as exceedingly evil to Jonah.

710
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:50,360
 Jonah is now the one making these moral judgment calls.

711
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:55,060
 But who are we to look down on Jonah for that?

712
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,660
 'Cause we do that all the time.

713
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,080
 I know that this has happened to me,

714
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,120
 and I know it's probably happened to you.

715
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:08,780
 People who have hurt us, people who have maybe betrayed us,

716
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,440
 or people who have inconvenienced us.

717
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,400
 We have this desire in ourselves to not see them be treated

718
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,360
 with the same love and care that we ourselves have known.

719
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:27,580
 Here's the other weird part about this passage.

720
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,240
 Belief in God was not Jonah's problem.

721
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:35,920
 Jonah was very aware of God's existence.

722
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,800
 Jonah knows God, Jonah hears from God,

723
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:44,220
 yet he doesn't understand God's values

724
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,020
 and isn't on board with his mission.

725
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:50,560
 A person can fully believe in God,

726
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,460
 yet not understand his values

727
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:54,100
 or be on board with his mission.

728
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,840
 That should terrify us.

729
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:00,480
 There are people walking around, sometimes even us,

730
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,020
 with the Christian word on their shirt

731
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:10,020
 who are hurting people, who are causing pain or division,

732
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,080
 and all the while they have the name Jesus on their shirt.

733
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,320
 That should scare us.

734
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:21,280
 And it should remind us that belief in God,

735
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,520
 belief that he's real and belief that the things

736
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,520
 in the Bible are how they happened,

737
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,720
 isn't the thing that saves us.

738
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:31,160
 It's us saying we submit ourselves to your mission,

739
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,100
 to your values, and to your way.

740
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:37,400
 You are our God, not me.

741
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,560
 When we believe we know better than God,

742
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,460
 we are choosing Adam, not Jesus.

743
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,800
 Interesting side note, our students, some of them,

744
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,380
 I've had interesting conversations with them

745
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:54,460
 where we'll talk about what it means to be a Christian,

746
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:56,780
 and almost none of our students are hung up

747
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,580
 on the idea of believing in Jesus.

748
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,600
 Some of them wanna talk apologetics.

749
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:06,500
 Some of them wanna talk about the archeology and all that,

750
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:09,220
 but the majority of them, the majority of,

751
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:12,200
 I would say people, the thing you can't get behind

752
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,580
 isn't the belief about whether or not it's real,

753
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,000
 but it's the submission to another being's way

754
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,820
 of doing things that's hard.

755
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,660
 And we struggle with that,

756
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:27,460
 even though we may believe in him.

757
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:33,160
 Here's another thing we learn from this passage

758
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:37,380
 is that we cannot fully love others like God loves them

759
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,760
 until we learn to see ourselves the way God sees us.

760
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,660
 We cannot fully love others like God loves them

761
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:49,280
 until we learn to see ourselves the way God sees us.

762
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,880
 When we view ourselves as higher than or better than others

763
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,480
 because of whatever metric

764
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,740
 is in front of our noses at that time,

765
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:01,780
 we are doing the same thing the Pharisees did.

766
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:04,600
 We're doing the same thing Jesus rebuked the Pharisees for.

767
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,800
 We are saying we are better

768
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,080
 because of something we've earned,

769
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,320
 because of something we've done,

770
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:11,120
 because of something I am,

771
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:13,080
 and you are worse because of something you are

772
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,500
 or something you've done.

773
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:18,280
 Paul in the New Testament,

774
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,440
 an apostle who would write

775
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,960
 to many of the different churches,

776
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,000
 he understood this well.

777
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,740
 He understood that he can't love other people

778
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,980
 until he sees himself the way God sees him.

779
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,400
 Paul has this really interesting message at one point

780
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,140
 where he says, "I am the chief among sinners."

781
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:39,460
 And that's crazy and weird to the people of the time

782
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,120
 because this is the guy who's leading the charge

783
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,260
 in bringing the gospel to Gentiles.

784
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:49,000
 This is like earliest Christian celebrity, right?

785
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,880
 That guy, the one who's writing most of the New Testament?

786
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,080
 And he says, "I am the chief among sinners.

787
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,560
 I'm the greatest sinner I know

788
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,360
 because I know my thoughts.

789
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,280
 I can't read your thoughts.

790
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:06,280
 And I know who I am and I know how dark I can be.

791
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:11,200
 I know how evil I could become."

792
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:15,480
 And that sort of knowledge and understanding of oneself

793
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,080
 leads to a humility that says,

794
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:20,240
 "I can love other people and love them better

795
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,980
 and find them more important than I find myself."

796
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,240
 Paul had that, Jesus had that.

797
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,000
 Sometimes we struggle to have that.

798
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:34,680
 Finally, we don't get to decide who is worthy of God's love.

799
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,080
 We're not the gatekeepers.

800
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,440
 We are not the one who makes the rules.

801
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:41,400
 When we accept that God has loved us

802
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,960
 and done something for us

803
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,320
 to bring us into a better state of being,

804
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:48,960
 to bring us from a state of death to a state of life,

805
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,960
 we agree with God that that is a possibility for everybody.

806
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:57,680
 Even the people who we despise,

807
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,280
 the people who have hurt us, who have betrayed us,

808
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:02,200
 the people who are on the opposite end

809
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,880
 of our political spectrum,

810
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:07,440
 the people who do evil things in the world,

811
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,080
 we have to believe with God

812
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,280
 that they are as eligible for his grace as we are.

813
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,920
 We can't be the ones who decide

814
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,840
 who is and who isn't worthy of that.

815
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,480
 And the way we go about our lives needs to reflect that.

816
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,160
 I know that's sobering for me.

817
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,480
 I say all this,

818
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:33,200
 I say all this having told you about this struggle I've had,

819
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,360
 especially in the past year with my neighbors.

820
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,440
 And I wanna tell you how this sort of ended

821
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,600
 and wrapped up for me.

822
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,440
 One of the things I love about our neighborhood

823
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,160
 and about the churches in our neighborhood

824
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,880
 is that we do this thing called Pray Bridgeport.

825
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,240
 And it's amazing.

826
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,240
 It's all the churches in the area

827
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:54,720
 who are willing to come together

828
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,560
 and we pray for our neighborhood.

829
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,240
 And it's freaking beautiful.

830
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,560
 We got Anglicans over here, we got Baptists over here,

831
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,920
 we have people of all different like cultures,

832
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:09,240
 nationalities, all different denominations,

833
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,440
 and we're all coming together to pray

834
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,680
 that God would love the people in our neighborhood.

835
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,960
 And it's amazing.

836
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:22,840
 And a few months after that incident in my neighborhood,

837
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:26,800
 I was at a Pray Bridgeport at our park at Armor Square,

838
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,360
 which is right where I live,

839
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:31,320
 which is right where this incident had happened, basically.

840
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:36,840
 And they had set up prayer at different stations.

841
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,000
 So you would go to one station

842
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,120
 and pray for a specific thing,

843
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,960
 go to another station and pray for a specific thing.

844
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,400
 And I was going about these stations

845
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,880
 and I get to a station

846
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,960
 that is praying for the political

847
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,040
 and social divide in our neighborhood.

848
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:00,360
 And it's run by some of the pastors

849
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,560
 at Progressive Baptist Church,

850
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,680
 who are some of the people who are organizing

851
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,520
 the peaceful marches and the protests of that time.

852
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:12,280
 They're organizing these things

853
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:17,160
 and they lead us in prayer for the very people

854
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,480
 who I had just been hating in my own heart for so long.

855
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,200
 The very people I didn't wanna think about,

856
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,520
 the very people I was honestly terrified

857
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:31,160
 that God would ask me to talk to at some point

858
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,520
 because I didn't want to

859
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,360
 and I didn't want them to know about God.

860
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,080
 I didn't want to have to be forced to talk about him

861
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,880
 to someone who I find so despicable.

862
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:44,120
 And these people who were even organizing

863
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:45,560
 these protests and marches,

864
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:49,740
 lead us in prayer for that, for them asking God,

865
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:52,160
 would you work in their hearts?

866
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,800
 Would you help them to see the error of their ways?

867
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,920
 And would you grip them for a greater purpose?

868
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:02,200
 Make them people who bring about good in your world.

869
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,880
 And that was the prayer that I couldn't pray at that time.

870
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:09,440
 And it was me coming face to face with the idea that

871
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,680
 Jesus loves them as terrible

872
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,940
 as they might be at their worst.

873
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:20,720
 I'm also terrible at my worst.

874
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:24,240
 And let me clarify, this is not to say in any way

875
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,560
 that Jesus permits some of the kinds of things

876
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:29,240
 they were doing or the violence or the animosity,

877
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,900
 but that if we have a biblical example

878
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,840
 of God using one of his prophets

879
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:38,740
 to reach such an evil city as Nineveh,

880
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:41,040
 we need to know that God can reach

881
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,240
 even those who we see are evil.

882
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,820
 And if we're not getting on board with that,

883
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:49,480
 we are being against God and trying to gatekeep

884
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:52,480
 and hold things that we want for ourselves

885
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,320
 and not letting other people have it.

886
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,480
 Here's the final point.

887
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,420
 Jesus is kind of like the new Jonah.

888
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:05,220
 Do you guys remember when Jonah

889
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:07,100
 was in the belly of the fish?

890
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,340
 He was in the belly of the fish

891
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,660
 for three days and three nights.

892
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,480
 Our alarm bells should be ringing.

893
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,780
 That is like a biblical hyperlink

894
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:16,820
 to another theme in the Bible.

895
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,420
 Who else was in the dark for three days and three nights?

896
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,360
 That's Jesus.

897
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:26,980
 We're supposed to see parallels between Jonah and Jesus.

898
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,980
 Both are, in a sense, messengers to a people

899
00:42:31,980 --> 00:42:35,000
 delivering a message from God

900
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,960
 of repentance for their own good.

901
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:42,780
 And Jonah goes into the belly of the fish

902
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,020
 for three days and three nights,

903
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:45,980
 and Jesus goes into the grave

904
00:42:45,980 --> 00:42:48,060
 for three days and three nights.

905
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,460
 But the difference between the two

906
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,420
 is that where Jesus decides

907
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,460
 that he is going to take up this cross

908
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:58,680
 to bear this mantle and to love the people he's sent to,

909
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,340
 Jonah despises them.

910
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:04,180
 Jonah fights tooth and nail against God,

911
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,740
 even as he's given the job

912
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:08,420
 of letting these people know that they need to repent.

913
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:11,960
 But Jesus walks to the cross.

914
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,380
 Jesus is consistent.

915
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,700
 Jesus is steady.

916
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,740
 Jesus continues to love the people

917
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:20,700
 who are doing him active harm.

918
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:23,620
 And when Jesus is strung up on the cross,

919
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,980
 in much the same way the Ninevites

920
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:28,740
 would have strung up their enemies on their walls,

921
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:31,760
 Jesus utters, "God, forgive them,

922
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,460
 "for they know not what they do."

923
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:36,820
 May we have that kind of a heart.

924
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:39,160
 May we have that kind of a desire for people,

925
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,700
 that when we see evil

926
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:43,340
 and when we see bad behavior in the world,

927
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:44,940
 we don't despise them,

928
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,740
 we don't stoop to their level of making our own enemies,

929
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:51,560
 but we understand that God's transformational love

930
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,320
 and his work in our hearts

931
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:57,480
 is something that also could be done in theirs.

932
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,760
 And may we hope for that.

933
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,920
 It might not always happen,

934
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,280
 but might we pray for that and desire that,

935
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,600
 not just for the people who we see as worthy,

936
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:11,920
 but for the people who God loves, which is everybody.

937
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,500
 If you're a Christian in this room,

938
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,480
 at all times, as an ambassador of God's kingdom,

939
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:20,760
 you have a choice to be a Jonah or to be a Jesus.

940
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,840
 Not that you can be Jesus, but you know what I mean.

941
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:27,800
 Are you going to love the people you have been sent to,

942
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,120
 sacrificially trusting that God is good,

943
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:32,760
 or are you going to fight him tooth and nail

944
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:33,820
 for your own way?

945
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:39,140
 May we choose to be more like Jesus and not Jonah.

946
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:39,980
 Let's pray.

947
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:44,520
 God, thank you for this convicting passage.

948
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,240
 Thank you for this strange novelty of a book.

949
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:51,000
 Thank you that it's so different

950
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,840
 from many of the other parts of the Bible.

951
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:57,160
 And thank you that it is such a mirror to us.

952
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:59,520
 Thank you that when we look to it,

953
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,480
 it is so subversive and it points out

954
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,640
 the flaws in our own heart so well.

955
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,280
 Thank you that it allows us to see

956
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,620
 the areas where we need to grow.

957
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,240
 And God, I pray for each of us,

958
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,840
 would you give us a heart that is similar

959
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:16,280
 to the heart of Jesus,

960
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,720
 that when we look at people who are lost,

961
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,840
 when we look at people who are in the dark,

962
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,320
 we don't despise them for what they might do

963
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:27,880
 to ourselves or to other people,

964
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,680
 but would we have pity and compassion and empathy

965
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:35,760
 and seek to show them the love that you have first shown us?

966
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,160
 God, we pray that you would use us mightily.

967
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:42,000
 We pray for each of those people

968
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:46,140
 who we all maybe have a difficult time loving.

969
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:49,220
 Would you be with them?

970
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,300
 Would you work in their hearts?

971
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:53,300
 And also would you work in ours

972
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,140
 to know how to love them well and to represent you better?

973
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:00,540
 We love you, God, and we pray this in your name.
