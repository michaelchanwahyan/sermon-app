[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.800]   - Well, thanks, Kelly, and make sure you join our family gathering, the GAA, the General
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:07.800]   Assembly.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:13.600]   We have so many wonderful updates and so many news for you, and not only for staff, for
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.240]   myself, and for our ministry as well, and for our possible expansion of our church,
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.040]   and what's the next step for us, right?
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:27.520]   The church has to go forward all the time, and so has your spiritual life, so has your
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.000]   Christian life.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.080]   You need to think about what's next for you guys, and that's why we want to focus on this
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.080]   series.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:43.040]   And by the way, some update is that my plan in the next few months is to take some of
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.040]   you out for lunch or dinner.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.720]   How does that sound?
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:49.720]   Pretty good, right?
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720]   I'll pay for it.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.720]   I'll pay for it.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.880]   Yeah, and I want to spend more time to have fellowship together.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:03.040]   I mean, I don't want us to feel like we are separated and isolated, so don't be surprised
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.320]   if I ask you out for dinner or for lunch, okay?
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.800]   There's nothing wrong with you, okay?
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.460]   So don't have the misconception that, okay, a pastor is going to have a meal with you
[00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.960]   and there must be something wrong with me, right?
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.400]   No, it doesn't work that way.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.360]   Maybe there's something wrong with me, not you, okay?
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.760]   So that's part of my initiative to do some pastoral care among us.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.960]   And thanks, Kelly, for reminding us.
[00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:38.080]   We still will have the afternoon Bible study, and today we're not going to have it, but
[00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:44.880]   every single second and fourth Sunday of the month, and we still want to continue with
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.160]   that until there are some other changes.
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.520]   But I always value the time to do Bible study with sisters and brothers.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.520]   Remember last time, I was in the English group, and there were many, many good questions asked,
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:07.000]   even though we moved so slow in terms of covering the passages and the verses, but that's okay.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.120]   We need to study together, and whenever I gather with the people of God to study the
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.200]   Word of God, I always learn something new, you know?
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.880]   I always learn something new.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:24.720]   I always learn something that is not from the books, that is not from my preparation,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:30.520]   but from our conversation, we can get to know God and His Word better, okay?
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.880]   So this series will continue with what Christ thinks of us, thinks of our church.
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.660]   What does Jesus Christ, the head of the church, think of you and me?
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.200]   So we study the seven letters to the seven churches, and we start with the first one,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:54.440]   Ephesus, and then we move on to the second letter to Smyrna, and then the third one to
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.040]   Pergamon, and then via Tyre, and now we come to the fifth letter, which is a short letter
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.020]   to the church in Sardis.
[00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:08.400]   And because this is a short letter, and why don't we read together, read the entire letter
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.880]   first and see what is going on here, what does Jesus have to say to His church back
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.640]   then and to our church today, all right?
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.880]   So chapter two, or chapter three, sorry.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.020]   To the angel of the church in Sardis write, "These are the words of Him who holds the
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.760]   seven spirits of God and the seven stars.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.280]   I know your deeds.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.040]   You have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.360]   Wake up, strengthen what remains, and it's about to die, for I have not found your deeds
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.360]   complete in the sight of my God.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.680]   Remember therefore what you have received and heard.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:56.960]   Obey it and repent, for if you do not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:01.760]   not know at what time I will come to you."
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:08.840]   Verse four, "Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.520]   They will walk with me dressed in white, for they are worthy.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.240]   He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:26.040]   I will never blow out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name before
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.800]   my Father and His angels.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.320]   He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
[00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.000]   Remember, it's churches.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.720]   It's not just for the church back then in Sardis, but for all of us, for every single
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.680]   one of us, if we call ourselves as Christians.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.680]   Alright?
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.640]   Now, one of the themes of this letter, only six verses long, I don't know if you pick
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:57.400]   it up, the key word, always repeat, you know, in the six verses.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.080]   It's name.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:00.600]   Reputation.
[00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.360]   Has to do with the name.
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:10.240]   Now, as you know, name in the biblical culture is more than just a label, right?
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.000]   It's more than just a label to call you, right?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.760]   Or name on your name tag, right?
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.560]   Name in the biblical culture has always to do with reputation.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.440]   What are you famous for?
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.240]   What are you known for?
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.440]   What do other people see you and what is your reputation in the community or in the world?
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.740]   That is what the name is all about.
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.760]   And in this short letter, the name repeats again and again.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.840]   And there are two main points I want to cover today.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:50.720]   Is that Christ, number one, cares not your earthly name, your earthly reputation.
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.600]   Jesus doesn't really care.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.360]   Cares not so much about your earthly reputation, all right?
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.960]   As we talk about these letters, we understand we have to understand the letters or read
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.200]   the letters in terms of their own context, right?
[00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:16.280]   Sardis, the churches in Sardis or the small community house churches in Sardis, Christ
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.360]   is going to remind them in their own context.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:27.600]   And we know Sardis, of course now it's a modern city, but back then it was a very famous
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.800]   city.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:35.560]   And it was one of the richest and wealthiest capital city of the ancient kingdom called
[00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.520]   Lydian kingdom.
[00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:41.040]   And it's in today's western Turkey.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:48.280]   As you can tell from this verses, Christ is writing a letter to Sardis.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.360]   And he introduces himself pretty much similar to how he introduced himself in the first
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.640]   letter to Ephesus.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:07:00.240]   He's holding seven stars and he's holding seven spirits.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:03.600]   And he has everything under his control.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.320]   And the letter format goes, he knows something about the church.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.800]   He said, I know your deeds and you have the name of being alive.
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.440]   Your reputation of being alive.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:21.760]   Now if you're living in Sardis back then in the first century, you know that you are
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.280]   living in the one of the most famous cities in the world.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:34.560]   You know, Sardis was known for gold and silver because they have gold mine and silver mine.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   As I prepared, I remember when I was younger, I used to play a lot of video games.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.280]   I don't know if you play the game called age of empire.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.280]   Ring any bell?
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   No?
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.280]   Nobody like video games?
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   What's your childhood like?
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:57.320]   No, age of empire is a strategy game and you start with some of the people of your own
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:03.200]   and then you go out to different places to explore and you have to find resources of
[00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:04.200]   the land.
[00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.760]   And then build up your kingdom and build up your army and then you're going to beat up
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:09.360]   somebody, right?
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.440]   Beat up some of the neighbors and then you're going to conquer them.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.560]   That is age of empire.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:22.800]   What you need in that kind of strategy game, okay, is to find all the resources, natural
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.240]   resources like gold mine and silver mine.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:33.600]   And you have to gather the resources and you know, gathering back to your collection center
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:37.360]   and then you're going to build up your people, build up your buildings and build up your
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.320]   kingdom and then you could, you will be stronger.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:49.640]   Now, Sardis was one of the cities in the ancient world that is close to a big gold mine.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:55.360]   That's why Sardis was one of the wealthiest kingdom, wealthiest city state in the ancient
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.120]   world.
[00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.600]   They have the reputation and they are famous.
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:07.400]   But Jesus writing to them, yes you guys are rich in terms of your earthly resources.
[00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.400]   You have the reputation, famous for being a city of gold.
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:17.440]   But Jesus said, no, you are dead.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.080]   That's pretty interesting, right?
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   Because in Greek, in the original language, there were only two words.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.080]   You guys are dead.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:27.080]   You are dead.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:34.480]   They are most famous for their gold mine.
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.480]   As you can see, the archeologist is thinking up so much.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:46.080]   There's a river nearby that you can just collect the soil from the riverbed and then you can
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:54.480]   sift it and then you will see some of the clumps of gold pebbles.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.720]   And then you're going to put it in the crucible and then you're going to refine it, right?
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.560]   And then you're going to get some gold out of it.
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.920]   As you can see in this center picture, right in the center, they have some samples in test
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.920]   tube.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:14.400]   Some of the soil from the river, you can see it's kind of shiny, right?
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.960]   So Sardis is being known for this.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:21.880]   Because the nearby river is a gold bearing sand.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.600]   And all these pieces of jewelry of gold and silver are what they are famous for.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:31.760]   I remember I first moved to the United States in 1990, right?
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   1990.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.920]   Oh boy, it's 30 years ago, right?
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.640]   30 some years ago.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:40.640]   I live in Sacramento.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:41.640]   Sacramento.
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:45.200]   It's in Northern California, Central Valley.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:51.200]   It's pretty close to San Francisco, the Bay Area, right?
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:11:01.880]   So as you know, in the mid, 100 years ago, some 100 years ago, San Francisco and Sacramento,
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.960]   Auburn, all those towns were blooming cities, right?
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:12.400]   Because there were so many people coming to the Bay Area, coming to San Francisco and
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.160]   Sacramento area for the gold rush, right?
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.800]   Yeah, 49ers, right?
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:21.000]   It's the gold rush, right?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.320]   That's why San Francisco is still called (speaks in foreign language)
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.080]   Because they have gold, right?
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:37.280]   And there were so many Chinese immigrants, actually, coming to the area and they want
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:40.480]   to get some gold, right?
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.720]   To be rich and/or to work for gold mine and industries.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.680]   But today, if you go to those small towns of, you know, it used to be the gold rush
[00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:56.840]   towns, they are almost like ghost towns, right?
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:59.200]   Because all the gold is gone, right?
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.400]   All the gold and silver are gone, right?
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:09.120]   And they were famous for their resources, but not anymore.
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.400]   It is the same way in Sardis.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:19.920]   Yes, you have reputation, Jesus said, of being alive, but now you are dead, right?
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:27.000]   So Jesus is not talking about financial resources or the physical resources that they have.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.720]   He's talking about the people in Sardis, especially Christian people in Sardis.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:40.120]   Yes, you were known for being wealthiest, but in my eyes, you are dead.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:50.520]   Jesus always focuses on your spiritual status, not your paycheck, not your bank account.
[00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:58.680]   Yes, those are important if you are a good and faithful servant, managing God's resources.
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:03.760]   God demands us to be good stewards of your financial resources.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:11.200]   That's why as Christian people, as followers of Christ, we need to have the habit of giving,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.200]   right?
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   Living in generosity.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:17.440]   Generosity, right?
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:23.680]   When I say generosity, often we think, okay, those are for the billionaires, right?
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:25.000]   They can practice generosity.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.040]   We cannot be generous because, geez, we just don't have much money in our pocket.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.600]   Wait, seriously?
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:32.600]   No.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:36.960]   Jesus was the most generous person in the world, right?
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:42.720]   Yet he was not rich in the worldly eyes, all right?
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:49.360]   So Jesus' followers have to practice that as well, to give and to be generous, all right?
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.840]   To give and to be generous.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:58.200]   To the church in Sardis, Jesus says, "You guys are dead."
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.400]   All right?
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.520]   You guys are dead.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:05.160]   And then he issued a series of five commands.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:07.640]   It's like a shotgun, you know?
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.400]   Boom boom boom, rapid fire.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.760]   Number one, wake up.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:14.440]   Wake up.
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.040]   Strengthen what remains, the little bit remains in you.
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:19.240]   You have to strengthen it.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.560]   It's about to die.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.640]   That means your spiritual life is about to die.
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:25.040]   You're going to lose your salvation.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:28.440]   You're going to lose your place in God, all right?
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:35.080]   So wake up and strengthen what remains, what still remains in you, and it's about to die.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.800]   Because Jesus said, "I have not found any of your deeds complete in my sight."
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.360]   Number three, remember.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:47.400]   See, this is similar to the first letter to Ephesus.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:49.480]   You got to remember.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.400]   Remember what you have received.
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:56.040]   The gospel, the grace of God, the blessing of God.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.040]   And what you have heard.
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:15:01.400]   You got to remember all those things to rewind them, right?
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:07.000]   Go back to how many years ago or how many months ago you received Jesus Christ and he
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.840]   has led your life to this point.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:14.960]   And we source you and give you all this blessing and provision.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:18.080]   You got to remember those things, right?
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.840]   Remember the early days you were not willing to go to church.
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.240]   Maybe somebody, you know, invite you or push you around, you know, and you know, insist
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   that you come to church.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:29.440]   And you heard the gospel the very first time, right?
[00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:35.160]   The very first time you impact and you are touched by the love of God.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:39.340]   You see the cross no longer different, right?
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:40.760]   Remember those days.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.800]   Remember what you have received, the love of God, the grace of God.
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.160]   And then obey it, number four.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.160]   Obey it.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.700]   Be obedient.
[00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:52.240]   And then repent.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:58.280]   Remember Jesus said if you do not repent, if you do not wake up, I will come to you
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:15:59.280]   as a thief.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.080]   He is talking about second coming.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:09.000]   In the fifth pages of the gospel, Jesus says I will come anytime to you.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.960]   You know, I think this is a very, very simple truth, right?
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:19.100]   Either Jesus comes anytime or you go to see Jesus anytime, right?
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:23.320]   We will see Jesus and it will be a sudden moment.
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:31.660]   It's not going to, you're not going to plan like when you're going to see Jesus exactly.
[00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:32.660]   You can't.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.040]   That's a picture of second coming.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.480]   Five commands as I said is a series of rapid fire.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:43.640]   It's to trying to shake you up, it's to wake you up.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:46.080]   Don't we all need to be waken up?
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:52.920]   You know, sometimes Christians, I think we are pretending to sleep.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.280]   Pretending you know, nothing's going on, you know.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.280]   Follow the motion.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:04.360]   You know, I can ignore God one week after another week, one day after another day.
[00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:10.720]   You know, this is really sad because you know, you heard of it.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.840]   You cannot wake someone pretending to sleep.
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:19.440]   You know, it is pretend that we don't need, we don't have, we don't have the voice of
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.440]   God.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:25.040]   You know, and actually the voice of the Holy Spirit keeps on reminding us every single
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.160]   day, every night.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.200]   Holy Spirit is knocking on our door.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:35.160]   Are you pretending to sleep?
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:40.040]   Are you pretending that Jesus is not speaking to you?
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:43.520]   Perhaps you have been faithful Christian for a long time.
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.520]   But that was history, right?
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:52.040]   Now I want to tell you, I remind myself all the time, right?
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:18:00.000]   I have many, you know, if you check my resume, I have some experiences, right?
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I have some histories of serving God, you know, being faithful, right?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:12.600]   Yeah, I think I did something according to the will of God.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:18.120]   However, I always remind myself, so what, right?
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:21.360]   Those are histories.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:29.400]   As glorious as they sound, those are in the past.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:34.280]   It's bygone.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:40.320]   What matters most is right now, whether you are dead or not, whether you are alive or
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:42.400]   dead, right?
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:49.480]   Perhaps you had a good reputation before in the church or in your career or in your
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:50.480]   workplace.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.880]   You know, you were a good witness or you did something for Jesus.
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:57.760]   But what matters most is not in the past.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:19:02.800]   It's whether you are having a good life, a spiritual life.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:11.360]   Whether you in the eyes of God are alive or you are dead, right?
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:17.120]   Especially some of the churches, ancient churches or old churches, if you walk around the city
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:23.480]   or you go to different places in Europe or in many different towns and cities, you see
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:30.400]   huge ancient, beautiful, you know, Gothic buildings, right?
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:32.200]   Church buildings.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:36.360]   And those were the glorious days for those churches.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.640]   But you walk into those churches, there was no vitality there.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   There's no spirit there.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:56.680]   And the people of those old churches, they are simply holding on to the property, the
[00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.160]   deeds.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:04.000]   But Jesus said, "You are indeed there."
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:13.720]   Last week, some of the brothers and sisters, we have this little expansion committee and
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:17.640]   we're talking about the long-term future for our church, right?
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:22.040]   So we've been renting this place for the last eight years.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:28.680]   I still remember day one I was here, we got almost nothing here, right?
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:33.400]   And then in the core team, in the last couple of core teams, we were talking about, "Okay,
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:39.800]   maybe we should look forward to a number of years from now.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:41.200]   What can we do?
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.560]   How can we expand and develop our ministry and build up our church, right?"
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.200]   And I hope this is not just my question.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:53.400]   It's not just a question for the core team leaders, but it's the question for all of
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.400]   us.
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.480]   It's the concern for all of us.
[00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.480]   How can we expand?
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:21:03.760]   So last week, out of curiosity, someone texted me and, "Hey, would you like to see one of
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:10.120]   those old church properties on sale?
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.560]   Are you going to check it out?"
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.760]   And I said, "Yeah, let's go."
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:18.040]   Because it's close by my home and why not?
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:22.760]   I just being curious what's out there in the market, right?
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.000]   So I went and with other brothers and sisters, Jinfang was there.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.160]   And we went in there and there was no more people in there.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:32.080]   No more people in there.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:36.040]   The roof is leaking water and all those things.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.580]   And very, very old churches, but look outside.
[00:21:39.580 --> 00:21:41.020]   Look from the outside.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:46.120]   It was intact and pretty nice for the old days.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.120]   For the old days.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:52.480]   We have a steeple and pretty beautiful facade.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.040]   And how does Jesus see the church?
[00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   How does God see the church?
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   Right?
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:21:59.840]   It's not a church building.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:07.680]   No, by the way, I want to remind you, whenever the New Testament uses the word church, it's
[00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:11.280]   not talking about buildings.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.320]   It's not talking about physical building.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.280]   Church is a community.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.040]   It's a people.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.280]   It's living people.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:26.760]   That is church, right?
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.520]   Community of Christians who are faithfully following Christ.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:34.560]   How does God sees the church?
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:41.760]   As I said, Christ doesn't really care about your earthly, our earthly reputation.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:45.640]   What does God cares about?
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.960]   Christ cares about your heart.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.200]   Your spiritual status.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.160]   Your relationship with God himself.
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:56.680]   So that's point number one.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:02.360]   Christ, number one is Christ cares not your earthly name.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.440]   So often we care so much about our earthly reputation.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   We want to collect gold.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.560]   We want to collect all the resources.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:11.400]   We don't go to church because we have to go to work.
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:13.320]   We have to earn some more money.
[00:23:13.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   All the inflation.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.360]   You know how much, you know how expensive the eggs are?
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:18.860]   It's so expensive.
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:23.320]   My wife told me, "You don't eat eggs anymore in the morning."
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.040]   Because I usually eat two eggs.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:28.160]   I fry two eggs in the morning.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:33.600]   Back then it was 150, 160 a dozen.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.280]   I ate two eggs every morning.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.280]   That's all I eat.
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:38.560]   I need some protein.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:41.960]   But last week she told me, "You don't eat any eggs.
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:44.960]   Leave it to your daughter."
[00:23:44.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   I don't eat any eggs anymore.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.200]   You know, there's financial challenges.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:53.440]   There's stress in our lives.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:57.320]   But sometimes we just care so much about our reputation.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:01.600]   You know, we want to collect all these golds and all these resources so that we can build
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   up our own life.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:04.080]   You know, that's what we care about.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.360]   That's what we're concerned about.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.360]   No.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.960]   Jesus said, "Yes, you have to be a faithful steward.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:13.280]   Yes, you have to manage the resources God has given to you.
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:14.280]   Yes."
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:20.640]   But Jesus cares so much more about your heart, about your life.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:22.200]   Alright?
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.280]   The Holy Spirit is knocking on your door today.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.320]   And Jesus is writing to you today.
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:31.680]   Where are you at this point?
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.400]   See how you worship me.
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:35.120]   See how you follow me.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.760]   See how you pray to me.
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.200]   That's what Jesus cares about.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.600]   Christ cares about your heart right now.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.880]   Not in the past.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   Right now.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:45.880]   Verse 4.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:53.080]   "Yet you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes.
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:59.000]   They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.200]   He who overcomes will, like them, be dressed in white.
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:07.040]   I will never blow out his name from the book of life, but will acknowledge his name, his
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:10.440]   reputation before my Father and his angels.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:14.080]   He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
[00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:15.080]   Right?
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:17.480]   Take note how Jesus look at the church.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:22.200]   Jesus delighted to see only a few people.
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.560]   Only a few people in Sardis, in the churches of Sardis.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.840]   And those few people have been faithful to him.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:30.840]   Right?
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:32.720]   Have been faithful to him.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:38.240]   Yes, God sees and God values and concerns about the faithful.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:43.520]   Even though they are small in number, you have a few people I see.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:44.520]   Right?
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:51.120]   God sees a few of them because they are dressed in white garments.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:57.400]   In the book of Revelation, in the entire book, white garments and clean garments show up
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.920]   many many times and symbolize the positive things in our spiritual life.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:10.160]   Purity, holiness, dedication, victory, and glory.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:16.160]   Those are the people, the saints, who follow Christ faithfully no matter what.
[00:26:16.160 --> 00:26:18.800]   Right?
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:25.840]   There are some of the ways we should revitalize our spiritual relationship with God.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:26.840]   Right?
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:34.680]   At this point I want to close in some time of reflection for all of us.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.680]   Alright?
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:44.440]   And we want to do so, you know, quietly and to pray to God.
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:49.280]   And let me suggest to you, how do we revitalize our spiritual life?
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.520]   Remember what Jesus cares about.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.200]   It's your heart.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:56.280]   It's your heart.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:59.000]   How do we revitalize our spiritual life?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:10.360]   Number one, number one, God's grace, remember, God's grace and God's love is always there.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:16.000]   Even we are not faithful at times.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.880]   But his love never changes.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.240]   Now we read through this letter and we find there are so many words of warning.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:29.400]   We often take warning as punishment.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:32.360]   Harsh and unkind words.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.760]   Right?
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:42.760]   But the spiritual warning we find in the Bible, it is there because of God's love for us.
[00:27:42.760 --> 00:27:50.120]   It's not because God yearns to punish us, to yell at us.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:57.040]   God out of his love, out of his grace, try to say those words of warning for all of us.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:01.400]   He wants our names to be on the book of life.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.720]   He wants our names to be remembered eternally.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.760]   And that's why God wants us.
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:13.160]   So how do we go back to God and how do we revitalize our spirit?
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.160]   You know?
[00:28:14.160 --> 00:28:22.200]   So first, number one is don't you forget the grace of God, the love of Jesus, they are
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:30.000]   constant even though we may be faithless at times.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.640]   And second is to repent.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:36.640]   Is to repent.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.600]   Repentance in the Bible is turned around 180 degree.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:47.520]   Yes, I say to God, you know, "Sorry Jesus, help me return back to you."
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:48.520]   Right?
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:51.000]   So I have this prayer here.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.440]   I have this prayer here.
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.880]   "Heavenly Father, thank you for everything you do for me.
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:01.880]   I come before you to repent of my sins."
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.520]   And what are those?
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.960]   The dotted lines.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.040]   You can see.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.040]   You can fill it in.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.040]   You know.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:09.040]   You know.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:10.040]   Right?
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:13.600]   And I want to turn back to you.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.840]   And that's our prayer today.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.520]   Why don't we do that at this time?
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.040]   Reflect on the love of God and we turn, repent.
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:23.040]   Alright?
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:32.920]   Let's spend a minute or so and this is time before you, before the loving Christ.
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:39.920]   Amen.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   Amen.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   Amen.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:30:08.920]   Amen.
[00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:23.200]   Let's all pray this prayer together.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.040]   "Heavenly Father, thank you for everything you do for me.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.840]   I come before you to repent of my sins.
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:38.880]   Please help me turn away from my sins and turn toward you, Lord.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:47.160]   I pray you would help me follow you faithfully and give me the strength and grace today.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   In Jesus' name I pray.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.080]   Amen."
[00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:56.920]   With the love of God and grace of God, we are being sent out, okay, to follow Christ
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.920]   faithfully.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.880]   So that's why I picked this verse of the month, okay?
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:03.480]   We did this for the first of the week.
[00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:09.120]   And I feel like maybe we're going so fast, too fast.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.960]   First of the month, so in the next month, October, we're going to repeat that again
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.920]   and again, alright?
[00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:17.480]   And don't you understand this is not words of punishment.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:22.760]   It's the words of loving promises from God.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:30.120]   Here 1 John 1, 9 says, "If you confess, if we confess our sins, He, God, is faithful
[00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:39.400]   and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness."
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.280]   Remember this, the grace of God, alright?
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:43.280]   The forgiveness of sin.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:46.560]   And we can start all over.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:50.640]   To love Christ and follow Him faithfully, alright?
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:55.640]   With this word we are sent out and we have refreshment outside, right?
[00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:56.640]   I don't know, right?
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:31:58.360]   Yes, we do, right?
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.080]   And I want to do one thing new today.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:06.400]   You know, a brother remind me when we have refreshment, sometimes we gather around our
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:08.640]   own little table, alright?
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:12.760]   May I ask you today to gather at the big table, alright?
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.960]   We're going to chat and we're going to talk about life, okay?
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.920]   And enjoy the food together, alright?
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.840]   Go to the big dining table, alright?
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:22.840]   If you can, okay?
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:23.840]   Squeeze in, alright?
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:31.280]   And then one o'clock we'll have the GA right here, General Assembly.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.960]   And we have very important updates for you, especially financial updates, alright?
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.200]   Alright, God bless you.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.620]   (soft music)
