[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280]   - It's so good to see you all on Marathon Sunday.
[00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.760]   Yeah, and you got here okay?
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.320]   Traffic was okay, right?
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.520]   Yeah, all right.
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:14.760]   You know why people wants to run marathon in Chicago?
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.360]   Know why?
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.920]   Why Chicago is one of the favorite cities
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.600]   in United States or even the world for marathon runners.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.560]   You know why?
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.320]   Well, I was talking to someone who is running today.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.240]   He should be still running now
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.600]   and as part of our UV family.
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.360]   So he got the lottery to be able to join
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.400]   the Chicago Marathon and this is very interesting, right?
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.840]   It's not because you wanna run
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.280]   and then you can join the Chicago Marathon.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.120]   You gotta be in the lottery.
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.400]   When you are picked, then you can run, right?
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.920]   You know about that?
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.280]   You don't know, you don't run, right?
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.200]   Yeah, Chicago is actually one of the favorite cities
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.800]   for marathon runners and I was talking to this brother
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.200]   who is still running today at this moment
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.920]   and he told me last year he was running in Atlanta.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.840]   Yeah, and he didn't have a good experience
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.320]   because in the 26 miles of running,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.480]   there were so many sections of the journey
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.640]   was there was nothing there.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.240]   He was like, he told me he was like running in empty space.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.480]   Right, and no one is cheering him on, right?
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.120]   In Chicago is different.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   Whether the people on the street are faking it or not,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.160]   right, they're cheering you on, right?
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.800]   And there's so many things to see, right?
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.200]   You see the high rise and all that.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.640]   So Chicago is a very, very interesting place
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.920]   and especially for marathon runner.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.920]   And it got me thinking, actually this is our life journey
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.120]   in light of God's providence
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.120]   because God and his people are cheering us on.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.840]   Once we know what providence of God really means,
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.720]   we are being cheer on and we are encouraged
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.680]   every step of the way because we are not running
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.120]   in the empty space, right?
[00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.520]   We're not running in the wilderness all the time
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.440]   because God is always there on the sign line
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.640]   and trying to cheer us on, right?
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.040]   This is what providence of God really means.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.160]   So this is the second talk of God's providence
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.560]   reading Joseph's story.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.000]   A pop quiz for you.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.200]   What does the word providence mean?
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.760]   What does it mean?
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.800]   Can you talk to your neighbors?
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800]   What does it mean basically?
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.560]   Providence, this word, providence.
[00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:48.880]   What does it mean?
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.200]   Talk to your neighbor.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.360]   Basically, what does it mean, providence?
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.800]   - Provision.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.080]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.360]   - Okay, so here you go.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:03.520]   Providence means pro, vision, right?
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.280]   The word, that's how we got the English word vision,
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.960]   meaning that God sees everything in your life,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.840]   whatever comes to pass in your life
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.600]   from the greatest to the least
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.920]   is under the love and care of our God.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.920]   So the Bible is very clear about the providence of God
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.880]   in your life and in my life.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.080]   In God's sight, there was no accident.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.920]   In God's sight, there was only incidents.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.360]   Got it?
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.240]   All these incidents that happened to you
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:41.080]   and you experienced, the people that you have met, right?
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.880]   The encounters that you experienced,
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.920]   it's all in God's sight, in the presence of God,
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.280]   because he's timeless, right?
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.200]   God is outside time, it's beyond time and space.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.120]   And for him, God looking at you,
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.400]   is that there was no accident, but incident,
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.600]   an incident under his love and care.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.280]   And that's why this doctrine is so important.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   And the way the Bible presents and teaches this doctrine
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.800]   is through storytelling, right?
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.880]   The story in the Bible, how God act in history,
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.200]   how God act in the life of his people,
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.840]   is the same that God is doing today.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.200]   God is also active in your life,
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.280]   but teaching you through the means of storytelling.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.000]   So the story of Joseph is one of those
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   complicated story to teach us this precious truth.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.760]   So today is number two,
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.360]   talking about the divine providence.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.840]   So we're coming to chapter 39.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.280]   Okay, let me read this scripture.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.440]   This is again, a story.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.000]   Let's see what we get from this,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.720]   as we explore together what divine providence
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.360]   really means in your life, in my life.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.560]   39 verse one, "When Joseph was taken to Egypt
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.560]   "by the Ishmaelite traders,
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:13.360]   "he was purchased by Potiphar, an Egyptian officer.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.600]   "Potiphar was captain of the God for Pharaoh,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.960]   "the king of Egypt.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:18.800]   "The Lord was with Joseph,
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.720]   "so he succeeded in everything he did
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:25.000]   "as he served in the home of his Egyptian master.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.200]   "Potiphar noticed this and realized
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.080]   "that the Lord was with Joseph,
[00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.240]   "giving him success in everything he did."
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.840]   Verse four, "This pleased Potiphar,
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.360]   "so he soon made Joseph his personal attendant,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.520]   "his assistant.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.680]   "He put him in charge of his entire household
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.080]   "and everything he owned.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.080]   "From the day Joseph was put in charge
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.160]   "of his master's household and property,
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.280]   "the Lord began to bless Potiphar's household
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.760]   "for Joseph's sake.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:56.600]   "All his household affairs ran smoothly,
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.640]   "and his crops and livestock flourished.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.640]   "So Potiphar gave Joseph complete administrative
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.240]   "responsibility over everything he owned.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.520]   "With Joseph there, he didn't worry about a thing
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.880]   "except what kind of food to eat."
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:12.880]   That's interesting.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.760]   Continue with 6b,
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:21.600]   "So Joseph was a very handsome and well-built young man,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.280]   "and Potiphar's wife soon began to look at him lustfully.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.760]   "Come and sleep with me, she demanded.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.040]   "But Joseph refused.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:36.800]   "'Look,' he told her, 'my master trusts me
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.600]   "'with everything in his entire household.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.360]   "'No one here has more authority than I do.
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.560]   "'He has held back nothing from me except you,
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.360]   "'because you are his wife.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.080]   "'How could I do such a wicked thing?
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.320]   "'It would be a great sin against God.'"
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.160]   Verse 10.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.520]   Let's see.
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:00.240]   "She kept putting pressure on Joseph day after day,
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:02.480]   "but he refused to sleep with her.
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:07.520]   "He kept out of her way as much as possible."
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.680]   Verses 11 and following.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.200]   "One day, however, no one else was around
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.840]   "when he went in to do his work.
[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:20.240]   "She came and grabbed him by the cloak,
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.520]   "demanding, 'Come on, sleep with me.'
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:24.840]   "Joseph torn himself away,
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.760]   "and he left his cloak in her hand
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.520]   "as he went from the house.
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.360]   "When she saw that she was holding his cloak
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:38.560]   "and he had fled, she called out to her servants.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.760]   "'Since all the men came running, look,' she said,
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.720]   "'my husband has brought this Hebrew slave here
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:46.960]   "'to make fools of all of us.

[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:53.640]   "'Then he heard me scream.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.320]   "'He went outside and got away,
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.560]   "'but he left his cloak behind with me.'"
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.400]   16.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.800]   "She kept the cloak with her until her husband came home.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:07.280]   "Then she told him her story,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:11.120]   "'That Hebrew slave you have brought into our house,
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.400]   "'try to come in and fool around with me,' she said.

[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.520]   "and left his cloak with me.
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:23.400]   "Paul was furious when he heard his wife's story
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.360]   "about how Joseph had treated her."
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.200]   Verse 20.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.760]   "So he took Joseph and threw him into the presence
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.720]   "where the king's prisoners were held,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.600]   "and there he remained.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.640]   "But the Lord was with Joseph in the prison
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.880]   "and showed him faithful love.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.160]   "And the Lord made Joseph a favorite
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.560]   "with the present warden.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:48.840]   "Before long, the warden put Joseph in charge
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.480]   "of all of the other prisoners
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.920]   "and over everything that happened in the prison.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:57.280]   "The warden had no more worries
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.560]   "because Joseph took care of everything.
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.680]   "The Lord was with him and caused everything Joseph did
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.120]   "to succeed."
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.240]   That's an interesting story, right?
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.400]   And a familiar story indeed.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:15.920]   And we know that Joseph started out in chapter 37
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:19.400]   as a favorite son of Jacob of Israel.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:23.400]   And he was unfortunately sold to Egypt.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.360]   But down in Egypt, Joseph was doing well
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.360]   because God was with him.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:33.160]   And he was in the house of Paul the first,
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:35.880]   one of the captain or one of the officials
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.200]   of the house of Pharaoh.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:41.200]   And then here's a story goes,
[00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:46.200]   and the wife of Paul the first tries to seduce Joseph,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:50.760]   because again, I think who can resist Joseph, right?
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.480]   He was a well-built young man, right?
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.720]   He goes to the gym and is very young
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:58.480]   and good looking young guy.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.720]   And this wife of Paul the first trying to,
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.960]   you know, get him to go to bed with her.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:09.880]   And, but Joseph maintained his integrity
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.920]   and he was committed not to sin against God.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.360]   And he fled from temptation.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.720]   Now this is a self-contained story.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.800]   It means when you, you know, you cut the story out,
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:26.680]   you know, chapter 39, pretty much is self-contained, right?
[00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:30.960]   You can put the story in a separate book.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.280]   A children's Bible, right?
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.160]   Or a children's story book, right?
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:38.520]   You just tell the story about this young man,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.920]   lonely, away from his parents, his family,
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:46.360]   in a foreign place and fighting against sexual temptations.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.200]   And notice the details there.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:51.720]   You find that the wife of Paul the first
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.720]   tried to seduce him day after day after day, right?
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.880]   Who can resist that?
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.560]   But Joseph did.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.040]   He was worth a noble character and a man of virtue,
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.640]   a man of moral example.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.480]   And that's why this story is featured
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:11.800]   in almost every children's Bibles, right?
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.320]   Every single children's Bible has this story
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:17.720]   and as a self-contained story.
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.120]   But you think about it,
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.520]   the story is, it doesn't seem to be
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:27.160]   just a simple, you know, moral story.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.360]   There were a lot of stories in the Bible.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.920]   If we take it artificially,
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.320]   or just, you know, read the text,
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:39.920]   it seems like it's a moral story, right?
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.440]   Teaching a good example, right?
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.240]   Joseph is one of them.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.280]   But if you dig deeper,
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.240]   it doesn't seem like it's just a story of good man,
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.040]   good young man resisting temptation,
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.160]   although that is true.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.080]   But, you know, remember how the story turns out.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:02.920]   The result of Joseph's integrity was really bad luck, right?
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:08.840]   He was being imprisoned and accused, right?
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.520]   Kind of a fake me too moment, right, for Joseph.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.200]   And he end up in prison, right?
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.920]   And that is not a good turnout, right?
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:22.560]   But some of you are parents with young children.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:26.120]   I cannot imagine the bedtime story would go like this, right?
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.240]   You tell a story to your kid, you know,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:30.960]   your son and your daughter when they were younger.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.280]   See, once upon a time, there was a boy,
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:37.640]   very nice looking, he was a good boy,
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:41.800]   and maintain his integrity, and he end up in prison.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.200]   Good night, and good night, kids.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.960]   You wouldn't do that, right?
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.360]   This is how the story functions, right?
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   But we want to cut that out,
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:55.880]   and we put it in the self-contained book,
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.480]   and tell the story.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.840]   So we have to dig deeper, and what does it mean, right?
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:04.200]   How the Bible puts it together
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.160]   so that we get what it really means.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.840]   Now, a lot of stories in the Bible
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:13.760]   are not just stories of good examples,
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:15.320]   so that we can copy and follow.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.760]   A lot of the stories in the Bible are actually God's story.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:23.360]   What is God doing in this man's life?
[00:13:24.360 --> 00:13:29.360]   And that story tells of his character, God's own character,
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.880]   who God really is.
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.720]   So here, I have two main points.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:37.600]   One, as we dig deeper into the story,
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   we find that the divine providence triumphs over even evil.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.160]   And second point is providence moves in silence.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.160]   First point, perhaps you need to understand this story
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.600]   is to understand the overall flow of the chapter.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:58.160]   Now, this chapter has three paragraphs.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.760]   Outline the passage, you find there were three paragraphs,
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.760]   1 to 6a, 6b to 19, and 20 to 23.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:12.640]   It's funny, interesting, in the first part of the story,
[00:14:12.640 --> 00:14:17.080]   1 to 6a, Joseph was in poverty's house,
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:19.880]   but there's a phrase that is repeated.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:24.080]   The Lord was with Joseph, Yahweh was with him,
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:25.600]   and giving him success.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.480]   And then the second part of the story, 6b to 19,
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:33.880]   you find that this phrase is absent.
[00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:39.680]   There's no obvious presence of God,
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:44.640]   even when Joseph was in trouble, right?
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:49.640]   In fact, the cloak, the clothe that Joseph was wearing
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:54.080]   that Joseph is wearing, remember the story of Joseph
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.480]   has to do with what he wears all the time, right?
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.920]   Chapter 37, he got the many colored cloth
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:03.960]   from his loving father, right?
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:06.600]   And then chapter 39 right here,
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:11.600]   his clothes is in the hand of Paul's wife.
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   Now the word hand can mean power and authority.
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:21.680]   So in the middle part of the story,
[00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.360]   Joseph, unfortunately, is under P.W.'s hands,
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:27.880]   Paul's wife, okay?
[00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.480]   Paul's wife, P.W.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:36.720]   Seizes the clothe and kept it under her guard
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:39.040]   to accuse him, right?
[00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.880]   She screamed and he went outside
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:45.440]   and leaving the clothe with P.W.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:48.960]   And in this story, Joseph is under the hand
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.840]   and the power of P.W.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:53.480]   Where's God?
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:55.240]   God is not there.
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:59.080]   At least it's not explicitly mentioned.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:03.840]   And then you go to the third part, 20 to 23.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:08.560]   Joseph is in the prison, the royal prison,
[00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.920]   but then the phrase shows up again.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.920]   The Lord was with Joseph, giving him success.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.560]   Now, when we talk about divine providence,
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:21.760]   we have to deal with the inevitable tension
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:26.160]   between God's sovereignty, God's control in your life,
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:28.080]   and also human suffering.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:31.160]   Now, a lot of people do not believe in the Bible
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.520]   or resist the idea of the existence of God
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:38.040]   because they have seen so much suffering in the world.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.320]   There are so many troubles in the world, right?
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.960]   You read the recent news,
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:45.160]   what happened in Israel, Gaza.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.120]   Hundreds of people died, innocent people.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.120]   And to a lot of people, this is enough
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:57.160]   for them to say, "God, if you exist,
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:59.000]   "why all the troubles, right?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.200]   "Why all the suffering?"
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.000]   Now, this story tells us, or trying to
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.680]   sort out the tension between God's sovereignty
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.280]   and human suffering.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.600]   Now, the Bible never said,
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:18.480]   the Bible never says that God caused PW to tempt Joseph.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.840]   The Bible is clear on this.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.080]   Although the Bible, there's no anti-philosophical answer
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:28.120]   to the problem of evil.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:31.440]   In fact, there's none, right?
[00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.000]   If you read all the works of all the great philosophers
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.080]   who are trying to figure out or sort out
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.920]   the sovereignty of God and human suffering,
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.080]   there's no airtight philosophical rational answer
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:47.280]   to explain the two.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.720]   Never.
[00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:54.240]   Even, you get that, even you have a rational understanding
[00:17:54.240 --> 00:17:59.240]   or comprehensive answer to why suffering happened to me,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.320]   why suffering happened to other people,
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.600]   even you get the answer, the Bible says, "So what?"
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:10.040]   Because you are still experiencing suffering, right?
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.240]   You still see suffering.
[00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:14.000]   In fact, we don't need one.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.360]   The Bible is clear.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:21.200]   The Bible uses stories to try to explain that.
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.360]   And as we all know, human language has its limit.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.640]   And when you hit that limit, storytelling comes.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:30.680]   Because story has the power to explain,
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:34.520]   more so than statements that we make.
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:36.560]   So the language is important.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.560]   The Bible is clear that God does not cause suffering
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.760]   to happen.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:46.520]   Perhaps there's no better term.
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:51.520]   We should say God allows or God tolerates evil
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.800]   or suffering to come to pass.
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:58.800]   At best, we must say God permits or allows
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:01.840]   some bad things happen to us.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:07.960]   Joseph begins with a position of honor,
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:10.040]   being loved by his loving father.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.720]   And now he come to the bottom of the valley.
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.880]   That's a story trying to tell us.
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.520]   But he is here in the position of shame at the end of chapter
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.160]   or in the middle part of the chapter,
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:29.600]   is to prepare him for the next thing to happen.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   God's providence is still there when he faces difficulties,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.320]   temptations, and challenges.
[00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:43.880]   Indeed, the power of God triumphs over all of this evil
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.640]   things in his life.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:51.280]   So that's how the story goes, showing you who God is.
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.800]   He can triumph over all the troubles.
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.880]   And that is true for Joseph.
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:00.120]   That is true for you and true for me.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.960]   For a little while, Joseph suffered.
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:05.800]   He did, he suffered.
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.200]   But at the end of the episode, God raised him up again.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:13.080]   That is what God is doing in the life of Joseph.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:18.040]   And that should be also the case for all of you,
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.400]   for all of us.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.240]   So God triumphs over evil and suffering.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:26.760]   But you take deeper into the story,
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.840]   the providence of God actually moves in silence.
[00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:36.000]   You have to pay attention, look closely to this chapter.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.360]   And if you divide this chapter as I did
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.840]   into three different paragraphs,
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:45.400]   you can also subtitle each part as so.
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:48.920]   The first part, Joseph in providence's house,
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:52.840]   God is there, clearly, explicitly stated.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.720]   6B to 19, in the hand of P.W.,
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:20:59.880]   God seems to be silent.
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:02.640]   God seems to be absent.
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:07.520]   20 to 23, again, God is there.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   You see, in this chapter of Joseph's life,
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.080]   God is there in the beginning, in Egypt.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:20.960]   And sandwiched between it is God seems to be silent
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.640]   in times of difficulties.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.560]   Is God really absent?
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.880]   That's the question the chapter's trying to pose to us
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.200]   as readers.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   Is Joseph merely under the mercy of P.W.?
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   Is he really?
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.880]   Or is not?
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.640]   As I try to understand this providence,
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.640]   this teaching of providence,
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.640]   trying to understand what God is doing
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.800]   in this episode of Joseph's life,
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:57.120]   I must admit at first, I don't quite understand.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.720]   But then I noticed some of the details
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.000]   that I didn't see before.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.200]   Okay, this is what I noticed.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:09.760]   I noticed a subtle changes,
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:13.440]   subtle progression of where Joseph is.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:19.760]   He started off in poverty's house in Egypt.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.360]   Then bad things happened to him.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:27.560]   And then the location changes to the prison.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:31.000]   That is so bad, right?
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.120]   However, the word king shows up the first time
[00:22:35.120 --> 00:22:36.800]   in Joseph's story.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:40.280]   He end up in the prison of the royal house, yes, indeed.
[00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:45.320]   However, it is the prison of the kings, the pharaoh.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:51.320]   Now, why is this location change significant?
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:55.240]   As we all know, the whole story of Joseph,
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.320]   we know Joseph is moving closer and closer and closer,
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:04.320]   one step at a time to the royal court of the king of Egypt.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.320]   And God is preparing him,
[00:23:07.320 --> 00:23:12.000]   even in the midst of misfortunes happen along the way.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.760]   God allows or tolerates something bad happened to Joseph,
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.760]   but he is slowly, gradually moving Joseph closer
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.880]   and closer to the king of Egypt, to pharaoh.
[00:23:23.880 --> 00:23:26.760]   At the end, as we know,
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.760]   Joseph was being placed there in the courthouse of pharaoh
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:37.640]   in order to save the whole family of Israel
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:41.520]   and indeed plus many other people who suffer from famine.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:44.000]   So God has a bigger plan, right?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:49.040]   God can use evil and indeed triumphs over evil
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.600]   to accomplish his will.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:55.040]   God seems to be absent,
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:59.240]   but that does not mean God is not working behind the scene.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.080]   Right?
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.080]   As you observe your life,
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:08.440]   as you think about the journey of your life,
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:09.720]   all the twists and turns,
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:14.640]   if you think about it in light of God's presence,
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:20.200]   what a huge difference the people that you have met,
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:26.360]   the accidents that happen in our lives,
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.640]   but in God's sight, there's no accident.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.920]   It's just incident.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:33.520]   What is God doing in your life?
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:40.040]   Why is God silent or seemingly silent, seemingly absent,
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:45.120]   especially in times of difficulty, times of uncertainty?
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.920]   In the past few months, I've been struggling with
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:52.880]   just so much struggle in the presence of God.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:58.360]   I prayed for something and it didn't happen.
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:00.720]   And there was a spiritual battle inside of me.
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.280]   God, what are you doing?
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.880]   What the heck are you doing, God?
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.120]   Right?
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:08.200]   And there was so many sleepless night
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.200]   and I struggled with my prayers, my wish, my desire,
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.400]   not happening according to my will.
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:20.560]   And then it turned out, praise God, right?
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:22.160]   It did happen.
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.400]   And of course, according to God's good will.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.560]   Philip Yancy, ring any bell?
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:32.680]   Christian thinker, Christian writer.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.040]   He has written many, many books about sufferings,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:39.280]   many, many books about divine providence.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.520]   And in one of his stories,
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.760]   Yancy talks about his struggle with divine silence,
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:52.240]   that God doesn't seem to be working.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:55.840]   God doesn't seem to be moving.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.880]   When he pray so hard, diligently every single day,
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:04.000]   he feels like God is ignoring his prayers,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.240]   denying his request.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   And one of those moments, he wanted to give up, right?
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:15.040]   And then he thought of something in the Bible.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.720]   And that something in the Bible, he thought of,
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.760]   was Jesus in Gethsemane.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:28.760]   Remember the last night of the life of Jesus,
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:31.520]   he was in the garden, he was praying so hard.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.320]   He prayed that the Father would take away
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:36.840]   the cup of suffering, death on the cross,
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.480]   soon to happen from him.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:42.920]   He was praying so hard in the garden in Gethsemane,
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:45.360]   that prayed that God would remove that cup.
[00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:49.400]   And God denied his prayer.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:54.200]   It is so-called the first prayer in Jesus' life,
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.680]   or the only prayer in Jesus' life,
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:59.600]   that God did not answer the way his son prayed.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.680]   His son prayed, finally,
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:06.600]   "Not according to my will, but your will."
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:09.920]   So Yancy wrote this paragraph.
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:14.400]   He said, "How many times have I prayed for one thing,
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.720]   "only to receive another?
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:19.500]   "God alone is qualified to answer prayer.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:23.560]   "And there's some time we have to let go and trust God.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.920]   "Who can transmute our self-focused request
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.240]   "into an unimaginably larger plan?
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:36.200]   "When Jesus prayed to the one who could save him from death,
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   "Jesus did not get that salvation.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.120]   "Indeed, Jesus got the salvation of the whole world."
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.240]   That is amazing.
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:51.660]   God did not answer his son's prayer the way he wanted.
[00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:56.340]   But God has a bigger, bigger, larger plan.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:59.640]   Yet Jesus was not saved from death.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:06.360]   But in Jesus' death, he saved many others in the world.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:09.760]   That is the divine providence of God.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.380]   Look at our lives, right?
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:14.400]   There are many requests, there are many prayers
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:19.200]   maybe delayed, or even God said explicitly, "No."
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.680]   But we have to remember, who got the bigger plan in mind?
[00:28:24.680 --> 00:28:27.780]   Not us, right?
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:31.000]   We can only see a few steps ahead of us,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.700]   but God sees everything.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:37.280]   Let me end with the Confession of Faith of Westminster.
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.080]   Again, this document, a theological document,
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:46.160]   written in 1646, 17th century.
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:50.880]   But it has been one of the best treatment
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.800]   of all the doctrines in summarizing
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.320]   all the important teachings of the Bible.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   In chapter three, article three, five, article three,
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:04.720]   it says, "God uses ordinary means
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:07.780]   "to work out his providence day by day.
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:12.220]   "But as God pleases, God may work without,
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:17.740]   "beyond, or contrary to those human means."
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:19.920]   God can do that.
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:26.400]   God can work beyond those means that you can think of.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:32.320]   God can even work contrary to all those means,
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.340]   to all those instruments that you can think of.
[00:29:35.340 --> 00:29:39.320]   In fact, if you think about it, that is the gospel.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.520]   That is the good news we found in the Bible.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:47.720]   The providence of God transcends human suffering,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.040]   the suffering of Jesus on the cross.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:53.840]   Human evil, God can triumph over it.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:57.020]   When Jesus died on the cross, it was the moment,
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:02.080]   the cosmic moment of injustice.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.340]   But God transcends the means,
[00:30:04.340 --> 00:30:10.080]   perhaps the most devilish means, the crucifixion.
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:16.040]   His son died unjustly on the cross.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:20.160]   But God triumphs over all and accomplishes his will,
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.460]   his holy purpose for saving us sinners from sin, from death.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:30.480]   There are moments in our lives, God may be silent.
[00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:34.920]   He may be quiet, but God is not absent.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.400]   There are moments in our lives,
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:42.080]   we may experience God as if he's a passive God,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.280]   detached from us.
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:46.920]   But the story tells us who God really is.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:52.280]   He's still working, still working behind the scene.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.000]   Look at the cross, look at the crucifixion
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.860]   of his own one and only son.
[00:30:56.860 --> 00:30:58.920]   He's still there.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:02.520]   He's still there in the life of Joseph.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.000]   He's still there in your life.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.040]   Let's all pray together.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:09.200]   (gentle piano music)
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.880]   Father, as we try to sort out the mystery
[00:31:11.880 --> 00:31:14.320]   of your sovereignty,
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:19.140]   the mystery of all the happenings in our life,
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:25.740]   I pray that if we're going through a season of success,
[00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.640]   we don't forget, we don't forget your hand,
[00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:33.400]   your invisible hand is still working in our lives.
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:37.280]   So we come before you to give thanks.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:42.120]   Thank you, because it's not by our own ordinary means
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:43.920]   that we can achieve all of this.
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:47.480]   The fact that we enjoy peace,
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:51.640]   a good season in our lives,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.040]   it's because of your grace.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:58.200]   But we are going through some valleys,
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:01.860]   some dark moments in our lives.
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:05.640]   Help us to remember that you are still working
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.740]   behind the scene.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:10.080]   You're moving slowly,
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:15.860]   mysteriously, but faithfully in our life.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:17.020]   Help us to trust in you.
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:23.120]   Help us to continue to put our faith in you,
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:27.960]   knowing that you are the God who sees all things.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:31.160]   We still wanna praise you,
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.600]   we still wanna give thanks to you,
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.880]   knowing that we can trust in you.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.860]   In Christ, I pray.
