[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Good morning.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Good morning.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Okay, the mic is working.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Today we will be
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   in the book of James.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   So if you would all open with me your Bibles to the book of James.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   It is closer to the back following
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Hebrews. So I'll give you a moment.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   If you do not have your Bibles with you or on you
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   we have it on the screen here.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   So we will be reading from its first chapter
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   verses 1 to 18 and then we'll open
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   in a word of prayer.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   James chapter 1 verses 1 to 18.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   James, a servant of God and of the
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Lord Jesus Christ. To the 12 tribes in the dispersion
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   greetings.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Count it all joy my brothers when you meet trials of various kinds
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   and let steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   lacking in nothing.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   If any of you lacks wisdom let him ask God who gives generously
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   to all without reproach and it will be given him. But let him
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   ask in faith with no doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord. He is a double
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   minded man unstable in all his ways.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   and the rich in his humiliation because like a flower
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   in the flower of the grass he will pass away. For the
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass. Its flower
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   falls and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   away in the midst of his pursuits. Blessed
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   is the man who remains steadfast under trial
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   which God has promised to those who love him. Let no one say when he is tempted
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I am being tempted by God for God cannot be tempted with evil
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   gives birth to sin and sin when it is fully grown brings
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   forth death. Do not
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   be deceived my beloved brothers. Every good gift and every perfect
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   gift is from above coming down from the father of lights with whom there is
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   no variation or shadow due to change. Of his own will
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   he brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be a kind of
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   first fruits of his creatures.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Let's pray.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Father all praise all glory all
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   honor be to you. For righteousness and justice
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   are the foundation of your throne. The heavens
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   declare your righteousness God and your people have seen
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   your glory.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   In the coming moments we ask that you would speak that your word would
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   be illuminated for us. Guard the
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   ears of your people oh God that their feet would not be stumbled.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Would you give them hearts that are renewed so that
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   their hearts would yield to you and your spirit.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Call us to be still oh God so that we may again
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   find our refuge in you. All this we pray in
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Jesus' name amen. Okay.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Let me go back to the beginning.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   That's too far.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   So I think you'll find
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   that one of the most pressing questions that appear before
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   us in our daily lives is the question what now?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   After all our lives are constantly changing
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   because time is linear it moves in a linear fashion
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   we are continually picking up new responsibilities.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   A few of us here are in school.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Some of us most of us are in the workforce
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   and there are a few of us here that are new
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   parents. Those of us who are not going to be new parents we have
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   friends who are being new parents. All new life stages
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   all new circumstances everything is
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   kind of inescapable. And with every change
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   in our life we're faced with the question what
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   now? What should my life look like? What is expected
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   of me and what do I do now?
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And this question of what now becomes even more pressing when the
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   changes in our lives are not just confusing or new
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   but bad. Financial
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   strain, relational strife,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   deep, deep loss.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   All of it is a heavy, heavy weight on our shoulders.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   And to further complicate things you'll find that there is
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   more to this question of what now?
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   It's a Sunday morning. You guys are here. You chose to be
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   here. And so the question for you is
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   as people of God how are you expected
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   to live? If you look again with
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   me to James chapter 1 verse 1 you'll find that the
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   audiences of this letter are the 12 tribes of
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   the dispersion. James a servant of God of the Lord Jesus
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   Christ to the 12 tribes of the dispersion. These are the
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Jewish Christians living outside of Palestine. Those living in a foreign
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   and famished land. They are displaced.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   They're poverty stricken. They are starving from persecution
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   and social exile.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   In circumstances like that it's
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   almost natural for hardship to bleed into character.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   It's almost expected. Under this sort of
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   pressure the cracks, our cracks begin to show.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   They widen to reveal already present
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   flaws in our character. And if we're being honest with ourselves
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   we can all recognize some inadequacies
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   in ourselves that are covered up and usually hidden behind our strengths.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Like we see in verse 14.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Let me go to verse 14 real quick.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Verse 14.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   What threatens to drag us away can so often come from
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   the desires within us that seek to produce sin and subsequently
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   death. It says, "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   and sin when it has fully grown gives birth to death."
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Life is hard. Life is hard
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and it makes us hard. And yet, and yet we find
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   that James heaps instruction upon instruction
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   upon these Jewish Christians.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   He gives instructions that call for those of the
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   dispersion to behave contrary to their circumstances.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   To go against the natural flow of action.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Look at verse 2. What does it say?
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   It says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   Consider it joy when you face trials." James makes
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   this point. Let this be an occasion for joy.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Joy.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   This is a strange and unexpected response to suffering.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   It almost feels inappropriate
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   in some ways. But don't misunderstand.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   Don't look at this and think to yourself,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I gotta pretend that things are okay.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   This is not a forced joy, but an eschatological
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   joy. A joy that comes from looking beyond.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   And seeing something joyous. It's a response of joy.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   If you look at verse 2, James calls for his brothers and sisters
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   to consider it joy when they face trials. And the reason
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   the reason to consider such things joy, such hardships
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   as joy is because the testing of their faith produces
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   steadfastness. Note that this
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   testing they speak of is not to determine
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   whether or not there is faith in you. It's instead
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   here to refine faith that is already present. And in this
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   refining of faith, steadfastness is produced.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   You'll find that only through this refining
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   process would this facet of steadfastness
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   this endurance and perseverance exist within
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   believers. But
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   with all this talk about steadfastness
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   you'll find that this is not the goal. Not just for the
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   sake of being a steadfast person. Steadfastness itself
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   is not the goal. Instead, if you look with me
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   to verse 4, you'll see that the goal
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   and desired outcome of suffering trial is something else.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Right? And let steadfastness have its full
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   effect that you may be perfect and complete, lacking
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   in nothing. The goal is not a specific virtue.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   It's not a particular fruit. The goal
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   of steadfastness is your perfection.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Your completeness. Perfection
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   is central to James' writing. It's this picture of wholeness
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   a finished and flawless
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   work. We see this idea of perfection
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   in verse 5 through the contrasting of two men.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Let's take a look. The first person
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   the first person spoken of by James embodies
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   wholeness. They are lacking in nothing because they ask in
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   faith and they receive wisdom from God. The first person is
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   wise. But the second? The second person is
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   by the wind. They are double-minded
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   and unstable, doubtful of the security of God's promises for them.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   And they're torn apart with inner conflict. They wander
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   on and off every road they can see. In everything
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   they do, they are fractured and inconsistent. They're not
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   whole and they are not wise.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   In all of this is the implication that God desires
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   for his followers to live true to their titles.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Followers. What do followers do? They follow. God desires for
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   his followers to follow him. And more than that, it's implied
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   it's implied that God desires for those who follow him
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   to be refined, to be perfected, and to be completed.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   To be wise and be affected by
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   wisdom. Not in part, but in whole.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   For the collective voice of scripture calls for you to not just be
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   followers, but imitators of Christ.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   That your whole being and every aspect
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   of you would be refined and conformed into the likeness
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   of the rock that is higher. And that from this
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   completeness, your actions would be good and pleasing
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   to God. See,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   this that we talk about, this being wise,
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   being perfected, this result of suffering under trial.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   It is a continuing of the work of God. The call to count
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   all joy in poverty and humiliation is a command that is
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   founded on the finished work of Jesus. You,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   having been saved, you are called away from being fractured
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   and inconsistent. You are called toward being whole
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   with every aspect of your being.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   The reality we see in James is that
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   faith has an effect on
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   life. And that the culmination
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   of Christian life is a whole
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   and perfect conformity to the likeness of Christ.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Why?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Verse 9, "Why should the lowly brother boast
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   as lowly? Because his position
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   in Christ is not lowly, but exalted. He is not poor,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   but rich. Why then should the rich
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   boast in his humiliation? Because his richness
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   comes from his inheritance from heaven, not
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   the collection of dust on this earth.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Why should those undergoing trials and temptations
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   consider it joy? Because in the
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   trying of your faith, you and those around you become witnesses
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   to the work of God that is being done in you.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   You see with your eyes that faith is present in you. And now
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   you're given this opportunity to exercise the faith
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   that is in you by placing weight on it, by trusting
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   it. Do you see?
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   Do you see here? The command here
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   to count it pure joy is not another burden
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   for you to carry on top of the pains of life.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   It's an instruction given to you so that you can live.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Blessed is the man who remains
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   steadfast under trial for he has, when he has withstood the test,
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   who love him.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   And so,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   looking at all this,
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   do you want to be wise?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   Do you want your life to look like?
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   My brothers and sisters, in
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   sickness, loneliness, bereavement, and disappointment,
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   don't keep your eyes fixed on the circumstances of life.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Don't keep your eyes fixed on the desires
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   of the flesh. Instead, look
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   towards the object of your faith, the good and perfect gift
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   of God to you, his son Jesus. And see
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   that the promises of God are fulfilled to you in Jesus, in Christ.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Know that the work of Jesus will not be undone, and that
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   the Spirit is in this very moment making you more and more
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   like Christ, and consider it all
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   joy. The task laid before
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   you is this. Joyfully lean into
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   the work of God that is being done in you,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   and continue in that way.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Become holy like Christ.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   That was a little short, but let me
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   close us in a word of prayer. Would you bow your heads with me?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Father, we give you thanks
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   because you have been with
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   us every single second of the day. There is not a moment
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   that we are away from you or apart from you. You have
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   seen us and known us, and before we were, you were.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   So, Lord, ask that you would continue to
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   keep your hand on your people, on these brothers and sisters of mine,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   that you would reveal to them how deeply you love them,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   that they would start there, not looking at their own selves or the things
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   around them, but God, let them look at you first and foremost.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Would you make them rely on you, depend
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   on you for everything in their life, that they might be a reflection of the way
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   that you provide for them? Remove from them
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   all these obstacles that hinder them, Lord, and keep
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   them firmly in your hand. Give them a
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   stronger spirit, a motivation to grow,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   and help them be good representatives of who you are.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Thank you very much.
