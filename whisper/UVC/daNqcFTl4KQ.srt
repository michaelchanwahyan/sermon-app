1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
 Let's do it together.

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,960
 All right, let's welcome Pastor Mark.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,960
 - Hey, happy new year.

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:06,960
 Happy new year to all of you.

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,000
 And such a good day to be here.

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,560
 I know it's snowing outside, right?

7
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,200
 It's still snowing outside?

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,080
 'Cause I've been here since 8 p.m.

9
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,200
 So I don't know what's going on outside, you know.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,040
 Huh?

11
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,880
 - 8 p.m.

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,480
 - 8 a.m., sorry, 8 a.m., yeah.

13
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:23,560
 It's been a long day for me,

14
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,800
 and it's been a long week for me.

15
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,440
 So good to see all of you.

16
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,100
 And why don't we shake hands with our neighbors

17
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,280
 and say happy new year,

18
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,120
 or words of blessing to each other.

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,240
 Find five neighbors, five neighbors around you.

20
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,080
 Yeah.

21
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:43,840
 All right, all right, yeah.

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,240
 Well, there's some new friends in the midst of us,

23
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:51,520
 and we wanna welcome you to be in our church.

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,800
 Let's round of applause for all the new friends

25
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:57,160
 who are visiting us the very first time, all right?

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,740
 (audience applauding)

27
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,360
 So it's still new year.

28
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,380
 You know, the atmosphere, the color, or whatever

29
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,620
 reminds us what it means to have new year,

30
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:11,020
 and what it means to have change.

31
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,220
 What do we do as new year kicks in,

32
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,080
 and a new period of time, a new season in our lives?

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,460
 I think this is a great reminder for us to just rethink,

34
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,640
 you know, where are we going?

35
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,700
 So we may think of new year's resolutions, right?

36
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,660
 New year goals, all right?

37
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:30,020
 So let me do a survey here.

38
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,480
 How many of you have your new year resolution,

39
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:36,140
 and one of your resolution is to lose weight?

40
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:37,460
 How many of you?

41
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,900
 Yeah, that reminds us, you know,

42
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:42,700
 this reminds us we have to do it every single year, right?

43
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,900
 Although we already fail, we already fail,

44
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,860
 but that's okay, you know?

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,580
 We continue to grow, right?

46
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:52,380
 Not in weight, but in our spirit, all right?

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,800
 You know, some of the new year resolutions,

48
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,580
 some of the new goals that we're gonna set for ourselves,

49
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:01,820
 or some of the new mindset we want to have.

50
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,660
 So this new year will be reminding us, you know,

51
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:10,660
 doing something that will require us to change, right?

52
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:15,560
 So what it is for you, think about it.

53
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,520
 And today, I would like to start a new series

54
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,440
 on the sermon, which is about church,

55
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,600
 about healthy church, healthier church.

56
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,440
 How do we become a healthier church?

57
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,460
 Think of yourself, right?

58
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,060
 You have been a Christian for a long time,

59
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,420
 or maybe a short time, or perhaps you stumble and fall,

60
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:43,020
 stumble and fall, and along the way, you know,

61
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,760
 you still find your identity in Christ, right?

62
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,420
 And how to be a healthy Christian,

63
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,400
 what does it mean, healthy Christian, right?

64
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,740
 You may have your own, you know, imagination,

65
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,220
 what it means to be a healthy Christian,

66
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,700
 what it means to be a healthier church,

67
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:01,260
 but you know, we want to, you know,

68
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:05,000
 go into the word of God, and see what God has to say

69
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,980
 about being a healthier church, right?

70
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,540
 What does it mean to be a healthier Christian?

71
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:12,140
 Now, as we talk about, you know,

72
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,260
 new year's goals and resolutions,

73
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,140
 you know, we always think of, you know,

74
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,700
 there's some maybe poor habits we need to do away.

75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,700
 Some new habits we need to redevelop, right, to pick up.

76
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,460
 Something like that, spiritual disciplines, right?

77
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:36,700
 You know, things like we have to change our lifestyle

78
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,260
 in order to be healthier,

79
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,500
 not just physically, but spiritually as well.

80
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:43,020
 So think about, as an individual question,

81
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:47,420
 how we should change in such a way to be healthier,

82
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,160
 and then as a group, as a corporate, as a body,

83
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:54,660
 as a community, how do we grow together

84
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,640
 to be a healthier church?

85
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,380
 So that is the new topic we need to talk about.

86
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,180
 Now, why do I want to talk about this?

87
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,620
 Because, you know, as you think about church

88
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,860
 as a community, as a family, we talk about relationship.

89
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,500
 Unless our relationship is healthy,

90
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
 our church will not be healthy.

91
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,100
 Unless your relationship with other people,

92
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,940
 Christians, non-Christians, brothers and sisters in Christ,

93
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,880
 you know, your siblings in your family,

94
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,080
 your parents or your children,

95
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,560
 unless your relationship is healthy,

96
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,700
 there's no way you can walk

97
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:35,220
 in a spiritual pathway of God, right?

98
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,220
 So we have to dig into how do we grow our relationship

99
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:44,580
 in a healthier way in order to be a healthier Christian

100
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,440
 as an individual and as a group, as a church.

101
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,700
 In fact, if you read through the Bible,

102
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,060
 there are many places in the Bible

103
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,900
 that describes church as a family.

104
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:04,760
 You know, in the first century, 2,000 years ago,

105
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,980
 in the time of Jesus, in the times of the first Christians,

106
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:13,780
 the early Christians, all churches are house churches.

107
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,540
 So they gather together, not in a separate building,

108
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,100
 but let's say we are the sample here in the first century.

109
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,500
 We're gonna gather together for worship,

110
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:26,460
 for fellowship on Sunday, on the Lord's Day,

111
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:29,060
 and we're gonna ask around different people,

112
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:33,500
 you have a house big enough for us to squeeze in, right?

113
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,860
 To sit together, to sing together, to pray together,

114
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,940
 and to study the word of God together is house church, right?

115
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,940
 It's pretty much the situation in many parts of China.

116
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,100
 Right?

117
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,100
 Having churches not in a separate building, but in houses.

118
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,260
 So when the apostle talks about church,

119
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:02,080
 he actually described the church as family,

120
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,740
 literally as a family,

121
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,420
 because the church will gather in your living room

122
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,140
 as a family, right?

123
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,380
 And all the members belong to the same family,

124
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,420
 the big family of God, right?

125
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,140
 Where you have, of course, your brother and sisters,

126
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:22,180
 someone who is directly related to you,

127
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,980
 but many of the other people

128
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,220
 who will squeeze into your living room in the house church

129
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:30,180
 are related in Christ, right?

130
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,260
 Sister and brothers in Christ.

131
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:36,060
 So in the days of Paul, all churches are house churches,

132
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,820
 and the family is the basic unit,

133
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,660
 not only just the society,

134
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,340
 but for church, capital C, church.

135
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,660
 That's why in this verse, Ephesians chapter two,

136
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,780
 it says you used to be Gentiles,

137
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,620
 not being part of the kingdom of God,

138
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,020
 not being related to the people of God,

139
00:06:58,020 --> 00:07:02,140
 but now in Christ, you are no longer strangers,

140
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:05,520
 you're no longer foreigners, you're citizens.

141
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,460
 You are the people, along with all the holy people of God,

142
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,220
 and you belong to the family of God.

143
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,260
 You are members of God's family.

144
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:19,260
 That's why we need to talk about family relationship, right?

145
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:22,020
 Because I really believe that

146
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:27,660
 if our relationships are strong,

147
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:31,360
 if we are closer, if we grow together,

148
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,800
 then our church will grow.

149
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,760
 Now, if we don't grow in our relationship,

150
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,700
 if we don't grow mature in our relationship,

151
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,020
 our church will be stifled.

152
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,140
 So we need to talk about relationship,

153
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,200
 just as Paul, writing Ephesians, talking about relationship.

154
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:56,900
 Now, 2022, last year,

155
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,460
 there was a new survey done in United Kingdom, in England.

156
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:04,700
 So the survey asked a couple of questions.

157
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,340
 One of the question is,

158
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,600
 to ask different people on the street,

159
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:13,180
 and ask them, how many of you feel that the pandemic

160
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:17,340
 has improved your family relationship?

161
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,300
 How many of you feel that the pandemic,

162
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,800
 which lasts for how many years?

163
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,700
 Seems like forever.

164
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,100
 Three, four years, right?

165
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,980
 Three years, right?

166
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:32,980
 How many of you feel that COVID,

167
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:36,420
 the pandemic, has improved your relationship,

168
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:39,720
 particularly your marriage or your family relationship,

169
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,520
 parents and children and all that?

170
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,080
 How many of you feel that COVID has,

171
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,020
 three years, have improved your relationship?

172
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,580
 And the result is, take a guess.

173
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:55,400
 How many of those people, what's the percentage

174
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,560
 that would say COVID will improve our relationship?

175
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:04,640
 Exactly, one third only, one third only.

176
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,900
 Is that exciting?

177
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,540
 Not very exciting, right?

178
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,380
 Pretty sad.

179
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,600
 The second question is,

180
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:18,000
 they survey some of the largest family law firms in UK

181
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:24,440
 about the increase of divorce

182
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:28,080
 in the past three years of pandemic.

183
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:32,220
 And these law firms submit their results,

184
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:37,220
 and there was increase in terms of cases in divorce.

185
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:41,480
 Take a guess, percentage.

186
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:46,320
 How many percentage increase because of COVID for divorce?

187
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,500
 50, any?

188
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:53,120
 I tell you, it's 95%.

189
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,040
 Is that exciting?

190
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,020
 Is that exciting for lawyers?

191
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:01,040
 Not for the families, right?

192
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,240
 Not for the marriages.

193
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,320
 It is indeed very, very sad,

194
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,320
 because in reality, the pandemic

195
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:16,000
 has a lot of negative impact on our relationship.

196
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Now, think about it.

197
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,880
 And we go to the Word of God and say,

198
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,680
 what does God want, right?

199
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,880
 What does He require of us?

200
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:30,720
 How can we be renewed in our relationship, right?

201
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,520
 Because we are family of Christ, right?

202
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,680
 So I've chosen a passage today from the Bible,

203
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,920
 a very familiar passage.

204
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,620
 And I wanna think about this passage

205
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:46,440
 and what it means to be a family in Christ.

206
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,540
 What does it mean when Christ comes into our relationships,

207
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,440
 all of our relationships?

208
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,440
 Now, my relationship with my spouse, my children, if any,

209
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,800
 my brother and sisters, my in-laws,

210
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,920
 or my, any of our relationship in church

211
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,440
 or outside of the church, right?

212
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,560
 So let's think about it.

213
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,960
 But as I read through this passage,

214
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,960
 I want you to ask yourself,

215
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:15,440
 as if you are reading this passage the very first time,

216
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:19,920
 as you listen to the words of this passage

217
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,060
 the very first time,

218
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:23,680
 how do you feel about this passage?

219
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,980
 How do you feel about it?

220
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,240
 All right, are you ready?

221
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,800
 You ready?

222
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,960
 I'm gonna read through Ephesians 5,

223
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,960
 verses 21 and following.

224
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,800
 And further, submit to one another

225
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,880
 our reverence for Christ.

226
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,160
 For wives, this means submit to your husbands

227
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,280
 as to the Lord.

228
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,280
 For husband is the head of his wife,

229
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,360
 as Christ is the head of the church.

230
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,200
 He is the savior of his body to church.

231
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,040
 As the church submits to Christ,

232
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:01,680
 so you wives should submit to your husbands in everything.

233
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,920
 25, for husbands, this means love your wives

234
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,960
 just as Christ loved the church.

235
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,280
 He gave up his life for her to make her holy and clean,

236
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,760
 washed by the cleansing of God's word.

237
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,960
 He did this to present her to himself

238
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,520
 as a glorious church without spot or wrinkle

239
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,220
 or any kind of blemish.

240
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,660
 Instead, she will be holy and without fault.

241
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,520
 28, in the same way,

242
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:34,280
 husband ought to love their wives

243
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,120
 as they love their own bodies.

244
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,560
 For a man who loves his wife

245
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:41,860
 actually shows love for himself.

246
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,920
 No one hates his own body, but feeds and cares for it

247
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,720
 just as Christ cares for the church.

248
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,620
 And we are members of his body.

249
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,940
 31, as the scripture says,

250
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:58,940
 a man lives his father and mother is joined to his wife

251
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:02,060
 and the two are united into one.

252
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,360
 This is a great mystery,

253
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,460
 but it is an illustration

254
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,560
 of the way Christ and the church are one.

255
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,020
 So again, I say, each man must love his wife

256
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:15,000
 as he loves himself.

257
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,800
 The wife must respect her husband.

258
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,180
 All right, we're done.

259
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,420
 How do you feel about it?

260
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,700
 How do you feel about this passage,

261
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,900
 you know, reading it or listening to the word

262
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,380
 as if this is the first time?

263
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:34,100
 How do you feel about it?

264
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,980
 I tell you, as modern readers,

265
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,040
 there is something really hard to swallow, right?

266
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,460
 Some even find this passage oppressive,

267
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,060
 you know, because it seems like the passage

268
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,740
 is encouraging some sort of blind obedience, right?

269
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:53,660
 Especially for, on part of the wives, right?

270
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,980
 If you're a wife, if you're a female,

271
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,220
 you probably will read this passage as a modern reader,

272
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,140
 you will find trouble understanding what it means, right?

273
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,780
 Because we value 21st century, we modern people,

274
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,420
 we value equality, right?

275
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:14,440
 Husband and wives, you know, they are equal in status.

276
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:21,620
 So you may feel that it is so old and traditional, right?

277
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,620
 Wives, you know, we believe are not subjects,

278
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:29,660
 but partners in marriage.

279
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,500
 Amen?

280
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,180
 Amen, right?

281
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:36,640
 And we respect each other, there's no blind obedience.

282
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:40,300
 And even the servants,

283
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:44,620
 the following context will tell us,

284
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:49,220
 even the servants need to be free, right?

285
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,820
 They need to be free men.

286
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:56,140
 So how can this passage be related to us?

287
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:57,620
 That's the big question.

288
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,860
 What is the passage really talking about?

289
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,800
 Now, I think you heard me before.

290
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:08,100
 As we read the Bible, we need to understand

291
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,760
 the Bible is not written to us,

292
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:13,460
 but the Bible is written for us.

293
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,580
 Got it?

294
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:19,500
 The Bible is not directly written to us, right?

295
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,420
 There's no way by saying this would devalue,

296
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,680
 you know, the sacredness of scripture.

297
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:30,680
 Because as God revealed himself through scripture,

298
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,580
 he has to use some of the ideologies,

299
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:38,160
 some of the wordings that were familiar

300
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,140
 to the first audience, right?

301
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,140
 In order to communicate to them, right?

302
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,820
 Using the language or the cultural values

303
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,580
 that they are familiar with,

304
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:49,620
 and to communicate some eternal truth to them, right?

305
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,740
 So it's not directly written to us,

306
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:54,460
 it's directly written to them, using their language,

307
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,580
 using their categories to communicate

308
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,420
 some of the eternal truth that would be applicable

309
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:05,180
 for all cultures and all times and space, right?

310
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:07,820
 So it's not written directly to us, it's written directly

311
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,680
 to them.

312
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,980
 So we have to understand the scripture

313
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,620
 or read the scripture as if we were

314
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,180
 first century Christians.

315
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:20,260
 If we live in the Roman Empire, in the time of Jesus,

316
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,260
 in the time of Paul, then we probably will be better,

317
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:29,700
 on a better place to understand the real meaning

318
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,840
 of the scripture.

319
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,940
 Now, as you can tell, you know, every society has their own,

320
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,260
 you know, understanding of the responsibility

321
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:41,420
 and roles of, you know, different members, right?

322
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:44,720
 Male are expected to do something, right?

323
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,460
 Or behave in such a way.

324
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:51,260
 And female are expected to behave in some other way, right?

325
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,180
 Every society, you know, ancient or modern,

326
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,980
 there are always some sort of, you know, social categories

327
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,300
 to, well, you can say box in,

328
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,300
 but, you know, in some way it's to define who we are, right?

329
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:11,140
 Based on gender or based on, you know, different roles

330
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,180
 in the society, in the relationship.

331
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,020
 Now, it is the same way in the first century,

332
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:23,940
 in biblical time, in the Roman Empire.

333
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,580
 There was some sort of, you know,

334
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:32,380
 social understanding of how wife should behave

335
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:34,700
 and how husband should behave,

336
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,460
 how the master of the household should behave, right?

337
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,340
 It's just part of the social fabric of the time.

338
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,620
 Now, reading this passage in the first century context,

339
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,520
 we can call it household codes,

340
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,900
 household regulations, household principles, right?

341
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,660
 I know you probably heard of a name called Aristotle,

342
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,120
 right, Aristotle.

343
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,840
 Ring any bell?

344
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,140
 Aristotle is a great philosopher, a great teacher.

345
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,620
 He wrote a lot of things about social relationship.

346
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,680
 And in one of his writings called "Politics,"

347
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:22,340
 Aristotle talked about household management.

348
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,260
 And he said about regarding household management,

349
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,880
 there were three parts.

350
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,140
 There were three different dynamics

351
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,400
 for every head of the household he has to manage.

352
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,300
 The first one is the rule of a master over slaves,

353
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:39,400
 over the servants.

354
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:45,260
 The second aspect is the rule of a father over the children.

355
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:51,320
 And then the third one is a husband ruling over the wives.

356
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:57,600
 Now, three categories or three aspects

357
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,380
 of a man's relationship in the entire household.

358
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,900
 Now, this is called the household code, right?

359
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,900
 So that is the popular understanding on the street.

360
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:18,660
 So if you go back to Rome in Jesus' day,

361
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:19,740
 in the first century,

362
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,420
 and you ask the people on the street, right,

363
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,300
 male or female, you ask them, "Hey, what's the role?"

364
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,940
 "Oh, you are male."

365
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,800
 "What is your role and responsibility?

366
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,400
 "What is your duty in the household?"

367
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,640
 And he would probably be able to cite you

368
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,080
 something like that.

369
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,280
 Oh, there are three ways I need to relate

370
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,480
 to my household and manage them.

371
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,780
 One is my servant, and one is my children,

372
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,480
 one is my wife, right?

373
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,480
 So they would be able to tell you that the popular idea

374
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,720
 that a male will rule over his household as a sovereign,

375
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,100
 almost like absolute authority.

376
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:09,160
 And the male is ruling the subordinates,

377
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:14,160
 and the subordinates are the servants, right?

378
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,100
 The wife and the children.

379
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,620
 So there are three parts, right?

380
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:22,620
 So the consensus is that the man is justified

381
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:27,720
 to rule over his household because wives, servants,

382
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,980
 and children are by nature inferiors, right?

383
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,100
 They are subordinates, they are to submit.

384
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,180
 So the purpose of the household codes like this

385
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:39,540
 in Paul's day, in the first century,

386
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,100
 is to maintain a good order,

387
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:46,160
 a good hierarchical order in the Roman Empire.

388
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,960
 The Roman society is peaceful, is secure,

389
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,580
 is all because all the household heads,

390
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,660
 the males, the sovereign in the household

391
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,800
 are managing the family properly.

392
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:04,980
 Now with that understanding,

393
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,200
 you go to the book of Ephesians,

394
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,780
 you find something really interesting

395
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:14,780
 'cause Paul is almost citing or using some of these ideas,

396
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,260
 but he used it and twisted it in such a way

397
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:21,560
 and turned it upside down.

398
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:25,600
 Now if you're familiar with the book of Ephesians,

399
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,120
 as Paul talks about the family church,

400
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,720
 the family relationship, he talks about three parts.

401
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,680
 First, what we have just read,

402
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,060
 husband and wife relationship.

403
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,140
 And then the second part, if you go on with the passage,

404
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:43,160
 he talks about a father and children.

405
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,240
 And then he talks about what?

406
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,720
 Master and slaves, right?

407
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,860
 Master and servants.

408
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,860
 But Paul is not just copycatting the ideas of his day.

409
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:59,240
 He's using the idea of his day,

410
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,520
 the social understanding of his day,

411
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,060
 and put a new meaning in Christ.

412
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:08,760
 Twist it and almost turn it upside down.

413
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:12,280
 Let me tell you the context, okay?

414
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:15,960
 We just read 522 to 33.

415
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,200
 If you keep on reading,

416
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,560
 he talks about other relationship, right?

417
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,960
 Now let me try to demonstrate.

418
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,400
 If we were in the first century,

419
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,840
 hearing the words of Paul in the book of Ephesians,

420
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,600
 as if the first time, right?

421
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:36,980
 You're all familiar with the idea of a household

422
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:39,080
 from Aristotle, right?

423
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:41,720
 People on the street, they always assume that kind of idea.

424
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:45,480
 The male head, all the other people in the household

425
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:47,120
 are subordinates, right?

426
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:51,600
 And then Paul comes in, and he's using a similar idea,

427
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:55,640
 and he talked to different parties in the household.

428
00:22:55,640 --> 00:23:01,840
 Now let me demonstrate how probably a male would feel,

429
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,040
 what he would feel like when he heard this word

430
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,560
 first time, first century.

431
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:18,120
 522, Paul writes, "Wives, pay attention, listen up.

432
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,560
 "You need to submit, right?

433
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,280
 "You need to do this and that, right, to your husbands."

434
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:27,840
 And then if you're a male in the congregation,

435
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,560
 hearing the words the very first time,

436
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,920
 what would be your response?

437
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:35,200
 I would imagine if I'm a male,

438
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,000
 and I hear this 522 to 24.

439
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,560
 Wives, you need to submit to your husband.

440
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:45,560
 I'll go, my response is, "Yeah, of course."

441
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,040
 Of course the wives have to submit to me, right?

442
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,640
 Because I'm the head of the household.

443
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,960
 And the 525, Paul comes in and say,

444
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:58,960
 "But, but hey, husbands, the males, listen up."

445
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:04,240
 And there's a long verses, you know, 25 to 33,

446
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,320
 actually so much longer than the passage

447
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,760
 we've done for the wives.

448
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,880
 Listen up, men.

449
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,960
 Lord Jesus comes in.

450
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:17,480
 He is the sovereign, not you, right?

451
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:19,440
 And this is what you do.

452
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,480
 Remember what 25 to 23 says?

453
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,320
 Jesus died for the church,

454
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,280
 sacrificed himself for the church.

455
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,360
 This is how you love your wife, right?

456
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:33,680
 And as a male reader, I would go, "What?

457
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,680
 "Why does it concern me?"

458
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,560
 Because that's not what the slogan says, right?

459
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,800
 I mean, all the commands are given to the subordinates,

460
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,000
 right, to submit.

461
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,240
 Not for me.

462
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,640
 However, Paul turns it upside down and say,

463
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,120
 "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, men, slow down."

464
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,520
 Because there's a new sovereign coming into your household.

465
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:02,200
 And you are now become a steward.

466
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,800
 You're no longer the absolute authority.

467
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:09,040
 You're accountable to Lord Jesus Christ.

468
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,880
 And look at how he managed the household of Christ,

469
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,000
 the household of church.

470
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,040
 He died and sacrificed, right?

471
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,960
 He loved selflessly.

472
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,920
 And then six, one to three, children, right?

473
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,280
 Hey, kids, listen up.

474
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,760
 You know, this is what you do.

475
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,440
 You have to respect your parents and all that stuff, right?

476
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,000
 As a male reader, I would say, "Yeah, of course, right?

477
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,600
 "My kid has to submit to me."

478
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,680
 And then six, four, Paul comes in and say,

479
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,920
 "Surprise, you know, fathers, listen up.

480
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,160
 "There's something for you to do

481
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:47,120
 "because you are now in the Lord.

482
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,800
 "You are not the sovereign.

483
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,480
 "Jesus is the sovereign."

484
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,600
 Same way for servants.

485
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,000
 Servant, listen up, right?

486
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,960
 All the employees in your household,

487
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:59,360
 yeah, of course, they need to work hard and faithfully.

488
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,400
 However, six, nine, Paul comes in and say,

489
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,240
 "Hey, masters, listen up as well.

490
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:07,520
 "You men, you better behave

491
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,400
 "because Lord Jesus Christ is above you, right?"

492
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:14,000
 There was a, can you see that?

493
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,840
 There was a, there was a,

494
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,600
 a fraudy reconstruction or reconfiguration

495
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:23,840
 when Christ Jesus comes into your family,

496
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,680
 into your church.

497
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,920
 This is what we call subversive.

498
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,680
 Paul is using similar familiar ideas,

499
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,240
 but he turns it upside down

500
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:36,720
 all because Christ Jesus comes in, right?

501
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,720
 Now, it's reorganization, right?

502
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,640
 Look, before I entered ministry,

503
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:46,080
 I used to work in a chemistry lab.

504
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,240
 I was a sort of a biochemist.

505
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,040
 I was working in a environmental lab for some time.

506
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,760
 And I remember I was working for this lab

507
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,840
 and I was in the office

508
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,240
 and there were other co-workers beside me, right?

509
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,160
 And I still remember there's one co-worker

510
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,120
 I really dislike, all right?

511
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,160
 I really dislike, you know why?

512
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,000
 You know why?

513
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:11,880
 You know me, right?

514
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,400
 I work hard.

515
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:17,400
 I'm a very good worker, all right?

516
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,240
 Right?

517
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:23,720
 And that co-worker that I dislike,

518
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,480
 he comes in late and he exit early.

519
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,600
 He hardly do anything and he's lazy boy.

520
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,920
 I was like, how is that possible

521
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,320
 that I'm a new worker

522
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:40,680
 and he has been working there for years?

523
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:42,280
 And then after some weeks,

524
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:45,480
 I learned about the relationship in the department

525
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:49,880
 and I realized he is actually directly related

526
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,040
 to the department head.

527
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,400
 He's some sort of relatives to the department head.

528
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,280
 I said, bingo, bingo, that's why.

529
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,640
 That's why he hardly working, right?

530
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,320
 He's hardly working and he's getting paid, right?

531
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,000
 It's such an unfair situation.

532
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,040
 Have you ever encountered a situation like that?

533
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,880
 Right?

534
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,160
 That's so unfair because they are blood with relatives,

535
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,000
 right?

536
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,720
 So of course he's protecting his cousin, right?

537
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,880
 And he's getting paid by just showing up for a little bit.

538
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:26,880
 So I feel really oppressed, to say the least.

539
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,000
 And then I remember one day,

540
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,040
 the CEO of the company,

541
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:36,080
 the head of heads, right?

542
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:39,400
 He fired the department head

543
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:45,520
 and he hired a new department head to replace him.

544
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,040
 It's very interesting after that,

545
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,160
 the co-worker that I dislike,

546
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,920
 he start working hard.

547
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,440
 It's very interesting, his life almost turned around.

548
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:04,200
 It's because the department head now is new,

549
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,160
 is under new configuration.

550
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:10,160
 There's a new head now, right?

551
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:14,040
 So he has to change his behavior,

552
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
 has to change how he works.

553
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:20,960
 Now this is an analogy of Ephesians 5 and 6.

554
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,520
 The household is working well according to Roman,

555
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,720
 Greco-Roman values.

556
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,280
 However, when Christ Jesus comes in,

557
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,760
 everything will be reorganized.

558
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,280
 Now he's the head.

559
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,000
 Everyone is kept accountable under Jesus.

560
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,200
 The values will be different, right?

561
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:45,680
 The order of the relationship has changed.

562
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,760
 Just like this.

563
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,240
 The left is the old order.

564
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,720
 The male is up there above, right?

565
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,760
 Unchallenged or unchallengeable.

566
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,560
 And then wife and children and servants,

567
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,520
 they are all subordinates.

568
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,720
 And then there's a reorganization happening in Christ.

569
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,480
 If you believe in Jesus,

570
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:14,840
 every single of your religious should change

571
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:17,160
 in a very fundamental way.

572
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,200
 And that's the right side, the new order.

573
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,960
 Christ is above all of them.

574
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,800
 Male, female, children, servants,

575
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:31,800
 all are accountable to one sovereign, one Lord,

576
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,600
 one Lordship of Jesus Christ.

577
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,480
 Someone is more powerful than anyone in the household.

578
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,840
 That is the fundamental change

579
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,800
 that should happen in our lives.

580
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,520
 If you believe in Jesus,

581
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,160
 when Jesus comes into your home,

582
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,200
 coming to our home, coming to our family,

583
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,320
 every relationship will be reordered in such a way

584
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:01,640
 that we, every one of us,

585
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,840
 will be accountable to the one true Lord, Jesus Christ.

586
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,240
 So how does it work?

587
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,080
 How does it work?

588
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,840
 I remember, I don't know if you listen to radio.

589
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,280
 Radio is an old thing, right?

590
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:17,560
 You radio program, do you listen to it regularly?

591
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,640
 Don't, or no, right?

592
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,360
 Sometimes I listen to radio programs.

593
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,040
 I remember not too long ago,

594
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,000
 I was working in the church,

595
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,640
 it was very, very late, very late, almost 11 p.m.

596
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:34,120
 And then I was driving home.

597
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:37,240
 Takes about five to 10 minutes.

598
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
 And then the radio was on, right?

599
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,760
 I didn't intentionally turn to one of the programs,

600
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,120
 but it was on.

601
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:47,080
 And 11 p.m., almost midnight,

602
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,000
 what kind of program would be air in a radio station?

603
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,040
 You know, those songs, "Dedication Time," right?

604
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,000
 The caller will call in to the radio station

605
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 and call the DJ and say something really touching, right?

606
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,880
 Expressing love and all that stuff, right?

607
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,520
 And then I didn't really pay attention

608
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,800
 until I was a couple blocks away from the church

609
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,000
 on the way home.

610
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,880
 And I listened up and there was a middle-aged man,

611
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,320
 50-plus year old.

612
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,920
 He call in, he call in to the radio station.

613
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:26,680
 And he said to the DJ and saying,

614
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:29,840
 "Hey, you know, I have been married

615
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:33,760
 "with this woman of my love for 25 years,

616
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,480
 "but I have never,

617
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,480
 "I've never taken the opportunity to apologize,

618
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,440
 "to say a formal apology.

619
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,160
 "So I want to dedicate this song to her

620
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
 "because I love her.

621
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:55,040
 "For 25 years, I have been not really properly

622
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:59,120
 "related to her, and especially in our communication.

623
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,800
 "And I want to dedicate this song to her

624
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,120
 "and I want to say sorry.

625
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,360
 "And I want to change."

626
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,040
 You know, in those moments,

627
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:11,520
 you know, I almost crashed, you know,

628
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,040
 almost crashed because I was paying attention.

629
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,400
 I was like, wow, you know, that takes a lot of courage.

630
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,480
 Right?

631
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,320
 You know, as a male, I find myself,

632
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,680
 that's pretty hard to do, you know?

633
00:33:24,680 --> 00:33:25,680
 Would you do that?

634
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,800
 You as male, as a man,

635
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:34,680
 you probably would not have the guts to do it, right?

636
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,880
 But I was listening to him and I listened to the song.

637
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,360
 I forgot what song it is, but you know, anyways.

638
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,440
 I said to myself, that is how Christ should change

639
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:52,720
 our family, our marriage, our relationships, right?

640
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,080
 Admitting our wrong, right?

641
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,720
 There's no sovereign, I cannot do something like apology

642
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:03,960
 because I'm ultimately accountable to Christ, right?

643
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,400
 That is the new order, right?

644
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:11,560
 That's how it works in our family, in our marriage.

645
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:13,240
 That's how it works with our relationship

646
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:16,280
 with other brothers and sisters.

647
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:21,120
 The old order would say, you know, I insist on my way.

648
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,120
 The new order, when Christ comes in,

649
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:28,680
 there's forgiveness, there's understanding,

650
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,480
 there's proactive communication, right?

651
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:36,720
 This is how Christ should change our,

652
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,320
 your marriage, family, and relationship.

653
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,760
 Well, let's work on that.

654
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,600
 Let's really work on that.

655
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:51,600
 It's a new year, new phase of our lives, work on that.

656
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:58,560
 What does it mean for you when you say Jesus is Lord?

657
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,560
 How does it affect fundamentally and practically

658
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,800
 your relationship with other people, right?

659
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,880
 Let's all pray together.

660
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,000
 Father, thank you for loving us.

661
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,560
 That Jesus, your son and only son,

662
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:25,200
 would come and sacrifice himself on the cross

663
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,600
 to die for us, to save us and redeem us.

664
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:33,200
 Thank you for your lordship.

665
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,920
 It's not a lordship of power,

666
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,080
 but a lordship of love and grace.

667
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:43,920
 And I pray that as we launch into a new year,

668
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:49,240
 your lordship will mean to us,

669
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,480
 fundamentally and practically,

670
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:53,880
 will renew and change our relationship.

671
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:58,760
 We welcome you, welcome you to be our Lord,

672
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,040
 to be our savior.

673
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,680
 Now pray that you will renew our relationships,

674
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:09,240
 whether it's a relationship with our spouses,

675
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,800
 with our brother and sisters, our in-laws,

676
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:16,800
 our family members, even our spiritual family members.

677
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,160
 Now pray that your love will fill us

678
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:24,720
 and change us in such a way that we'll honor you.

679
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,760
 And thank you for being our loving Lord.

680
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:29,360
 And thank you for being,

681
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,880
 for the blessing to be your church.

682
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,680
 And I pray that Jesus, you will be our Lord.

683
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,520
 You will lead us and change us

684
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,560
 in such a way to honor your name.

685
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,000
 In Christ's name, we'll pray.

686
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,240
 Well, God bless you and happy new year.

687
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:50,360
 And there is a bag of blessing

688
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,400
 we're going to distribute to all of you

689
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,400
 who haven't gotten one.

690
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,960
 Make sure you get one, all right?

691
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,520
 I don't know what's in there,

692
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,040
 but it should be good things.

693
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,800
 All right, and then this afternoon,

694
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,960
 we're going to have a fellowship meal together

695
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,240
 at Gene Fung's house church, all right?

696
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,640
 So you're all welcome to come.

697
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,640
 And I don't know what kind of good food they prepare

698
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,760
 or we prepare, or we bring our own dish, right?

699
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,240
 I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

700
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,920
 So it's a potluck, okay?

701
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,760
 It's a potluck.

702
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,600
 So you bring something good

703
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,880
 and I'm sure it will be a great time

704
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:28,560
 of fellowship together, all right?

705
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,560
 I'll see you later.
