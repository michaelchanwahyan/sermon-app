1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500
Help me

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:13,380
Sound good

3
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:14,420
All right

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:14,920
All right

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:15,720
Thank you very much

6
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,260
Mark thank you very much

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,680
for inviting me back again

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,840
You know

9
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,300
It's been a couple of weeks

10
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,600
since I was last here

11
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,920
And I will probably say

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,180
After I spoke to you guys

13
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,800
I have been literally

14
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,140
been on the road

15
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:30,640
for the last couple of weeks

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,800
I think I've been more

17
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,500
in hotel rooms

18
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
and traveling on planes

19
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,000
than I actually have been at home

20
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,420
And so it is good to be back here

21
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:43,080
at least for the next week

22
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,640
that I'm off to Seattle this week

23
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,180
that I'm back in Texas

24
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,960
and Los Angeles

25
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,220
for the next couple of weeks

26
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,300
before finally being home again in June

27
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,640
We've been starting this series

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,680
on the book of

29
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,100
the first Kings

30
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:57,420
where we looked at the character Elijah

31
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,560
Elijah when we first began

32
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:02,140
in first Kings 17 1-7

33
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,560
We saw that Elijah literally means

34
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,640
that our introduction of Elijah was this

35
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:09,600
We know that his name literally means

36
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,140
My God is Jehovah

37
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:14,140
DL means My God

38
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,260
Jah means Jehovah

39
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,600
I is the connecting point

40
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,720
My God is Jehovah

41
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,060
We knew that Elijah is a Tishbite

42
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:25,680
from Tishbe in Gilead

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,800
What does that mean

44
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,560
Merely that

45
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,480
they have no idea where he lives

46
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,140
It's somewhere in Gilead

47
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,020
and he lives in obscurity

48
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,440
And so this guy who comes from a rural town

49
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,020
who's kind of rough on the edges

50
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,640
as you will see

51
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,060
whose name literally means

52
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,020
My God is Jehovah

53
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,340
comes over to King Ahab

54
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,340
And King Ahab is the king of the northern kingdom

55
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,340
If you guys remember the back story

56
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,800
There is a northern kingdom

57
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,800
during that period of time

58
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,720
and a southern kingdom

59
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,140
The southern kingdom is where

60
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,020
Jerusalem, Nehemiah, Ezra

61
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:05,800
All of those guys take place

62
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:09,520
Elijah takes place in the northern kingdom

63
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,760
And in the history of the northern kingdom

64
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,720
there are 19 kings who rule

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,560
And none of them are good

66
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,800
All of them are bad

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,520
King Ahab is the worst of all of the kings

68
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,940
And then there's Queen Jezebel, his wife

69
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,020
who a lot of times

70
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,020
when you look at scripture

71
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,260
Queens are rarely ever mentioned

72
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,340
Here's a king and here's a queen

73
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,100
But Jezebel is mentioned

74
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,260
You know why

75
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,180
Because Jezebel will turn out to be the worst

76
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,560
of all of the kings

77
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,380
including Ahab, including the 18 kings

78
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,180
She's this bad

79
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,220
Well, Elijah suddenly gets

80
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,880
a meeting with the king

81
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,980
How a guy from Tishbe

82
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,420
gets a meeting with the king

83
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,020
who comes out of obscurity

84
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:51,760
I don't know

85
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,480
but he gets a meeting with the king

86
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,340
And he says that neither dune nor rain

87
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,920
except by my word

88
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,560
And he says this in verse 2

89
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,760
As the Lord the God of Israel lives

90
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,100
before whom I stand

91
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,220
That becomes the theme of Elijah's life

92
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:11,060
That becomes the theme of this particular passage

93
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,600
That's Elijah's motivation

94
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,300
before whom I stand

95
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,460
That's why he does the things that he does

96
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,840
He tells them that there will be

97
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,800
neither dune nor rain

98
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,840
And just like that

99
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,340
right in the middle of the action

100
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,760
God takes him away to Cherith

101
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,340
And now he lives in Cherith

102
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,600
He doesn't just stay there

103
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,840
He lives there

104
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,420
And he's fed by ravens

105
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,420
And he's staying there

106
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,140
until the brook suddenly dries up

107
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,460
And suddenly in the last time that was here

108
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,720
which will eventually lead us

109
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,880
to what we're talking about today

110
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,220
The word of the Lord came to him

111
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,100
and says arise go to Zarephath

112
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,800
So you've been to Cherith

113
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,220
And now you're going to Zarephath

114
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,800
which belongs to Sidon

115
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,080
and dwell there

116
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,460
Behold I've commanded

117
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,460
a widow there to feed you

118
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,680
All right so God you want me to

119
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,260
When I go against Ahab

120
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,180
You want me to go to Cherith

121
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,720
I went to Cherith

122
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:07,340
It's nice

123
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,800
I know you're protecting me

124
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,840
Ravens fed me

125
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,040
Brook fed me

126
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,640
So now I'm happy

127
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,040
Now you want me to go to Zarephath

128
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,340
Zarephath literally is a hundred miles

129
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,920
You want me to walk a hundred miles

130
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,840
Do you not realize

131
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,880
that Ahab is coming after me

132
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,640
Do you not realize my life is in danger

133
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,720
Yes

134
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,500
And by the way

135
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,340
which I never told you this

136
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,920
Because I found out

137
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,840
Right before

138
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,500
Right after I came and spoke

139
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,140
Zarephath is the birth town

140
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:39,680
In the hometown of Queen Jezebel

141
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,420
So you want me to walk a hundred miles

142
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:45,140
Be exposed to danger

143
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:49,140
And you want me to go to Jezebel's hometown

144
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:50,420
Yes

145
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,340
And someone's going to be there

146
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:52,340
to take care of you

147
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,540
Great

148
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,800
He walks a hundred miles

149
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,180
He risks the danger

150
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,800
And there he has seen a widow

151
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,880
Who when he meets in verse 12 says

152
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,220
As the Lord your God lives

153
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,220
Here's what she says to him

154
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,720
He meets a widow

155
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,540
As the Lord your God lives

156
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:09,960
She's not even of the faith

157
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,720
She doesn't even belong in the faith

158
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,680
Your God

159
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,040
I have nothing baked

160
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:19,340
I only have a small handful of flour

161
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,720
And a little oil

162
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,720
And a jug

163
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,300
So I have a little baked

164
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:24,300
I have a little flour

165
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,500
I have a little oil

166
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,840
Really

167
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,580
And now I am gathering a couple of sticks

168
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,840
That I may go and prepare it

169
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,800
For myself and my son

170
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,040
That we may eat it and die

171
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:36,920
Lord

172
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,920
That's what you're sending me to

173
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,460
You made me walk a hundred miles

174
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,420
To the birthplace of the Queen Jezebel

175
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,260
Who is the worst of everyone

176
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,640
To meet a widow

177
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,180
Who has no flour

178
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,920
Little oil

179
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,760
And she thinks she's about to die

180
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:55,680
Yes

181
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,840
And as you remembered

182
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,760
For those who are here

183
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,760
For those who are not here

184
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,720
Quickly we talked about three things

185
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,640
Three things that you need to know

186
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,220
And two things that you need to overcome

187
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,380
Number one

188
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,460
The Lord sees you

189
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,960
The Lord sees Elijah

190
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,060
The Lord knows where Elijah is

191
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,520
He knows that he's been in Tishb

192
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,460
He knows that he went to see Ahab

193
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,220
He knows that he was a chariotee

194
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,140
He knows that he's in Zarephath

195
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,520
The Lord sees you

196
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,640
Number two

197
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,920
The Lord knows where you need to go

198
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,680
The Lord knows where you need to go

199
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,640
You need to go to Zarephath

200
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,880
You just need to go

201
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,420
It reminds us of Joshua chapter three, right?

202
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:40,640
It's after forty years in the wilderness

203
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,220
To roam around the wilderness

204
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,920
One day the Lord says to Joshua

205
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,420
Tell everyone to pack up

206
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,260
After forty years

207
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,880
Pack up

208
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:52,560
We're going to cross the Jordan River

209
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,380
But follow me

210
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,880
I love this verse

211
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,180
Follow the ark of the covenant

212
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,920
Because you have never been there before

213
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,180
And you don't know where to go

214
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,100
Follow the ark of the covenant

215
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,060
Because you don't know where to go

216
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:14,140
Because you have never, ever been there before

217
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:17,340
Not only does the Lord see you

218
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,260
The Lord knows where you need to go

219
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,220
But the Lord knows what you need

220
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,880
Now it may not be what we think we need

221
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,060
It may not be our expectations of what we need

222
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:37,760
But the Lord knows what we need

223
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,720
He encounters a widow

224
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,100
Doesn't have a lot but just enough

225
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,100
He encounters a widow

226
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,180
And there's two things

227
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:48,060
That you need to overcome

228
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:49,060
You're going to have to overcome

229
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,480
First impressions or expectations

230
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,300
That when we think that

231
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,520
When we follow the Lord

232
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,760
There's all these expectations

233
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,720
Of what God should provide for us

234
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,760
If we're faithful

235
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,060
If we're faithful to you

236
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,800
Here's what I expect out of you

237
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,640
And we have these expectations

238
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,180
And when these expectations

239
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,680
Don't come through

240
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,480
We get a little frustrated

241
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:12,680
We get a little annoyed at God

242
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,600
And we soon lose trust in God

243
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,060
So you have to overcome

244
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,020
These first impressions

245
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,600
This widow and these expectations

246
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,140
And trust that God

247
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:27,600
Will open those doors as you see fit

248
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,480
Mark mentioned that

249
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,720
Some of you guys are graduating

250
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,980
I was just talking with Rachel

251
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,420
As she's graduating as well too

252
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:36,220
All your life from first grade to second grade

253
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,520
From third to fourth

254
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:38,880
From seventh to eighth

255
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,880
From eighth to freshman year

256
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,520
Then from that point you go to college

257
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,180
You know where you need to go

258
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:46,680
Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam

259
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,720
Upon the graduation from college

260
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,140
It will be the first time

261
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,840
College graduates look at their life and say

262
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:56,420
There are five roads I could take

263
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:58,800
There are multiple job offers

264
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,000
There are master programs that I could take

265
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,420
I don't know where to go

266
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,260
And we think that if we take one passage

267
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:10,600
If we think that's what God is calling us to do

268
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,000
Everything will be okay

269
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,840
And God will provide

270
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,680
It may not happen

271
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,960
So you have to overcome

272
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,100
First impressions or expectations

273
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,840
And then you're gonna have to overcome

274
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:24,000
Physical impossibilities

275
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,300
He, Elijah, had to overcome

276
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,600
Physical impossibilities

277
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
He had to overcome the very fact

278
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,300
That this particular widow

279
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:36,260
Didn't have very much

280
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:38,680
But then he says to her

281
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,420
Which I love and which a lot of times

282
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:43,060
We actually didn't have enough time to spend on

283
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,880
Because so today I want to spend time

284
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,180
On this one verse

285
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,300
Really unpack it

286
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
And see what it means to me

287
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,640
He says to her

288
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,800
Go and do

289
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,420
Go and do

290
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,220
You're gonna have

291
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,960
And here's a

292
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,100
I'm losing it

293
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,300
Oh Lord, here we go

294
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,420
Here we go

295
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,880
Elijah says to her

296
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,760
Do not fear

297
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,800
Go and do as you have said

298
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,960
Even though you have seen

299
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,560
All of these impossibilities

300
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,840
Even though you have seen

301
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,960
All these expectations

302
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,140
That are out the window

303
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,600
He says to the widow

304
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,460
Go and do

305
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,920
And that's a calling for us

306
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,600
As Christ followers

307
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,260
For us to go and do

308
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,720
Three things that we're gonna talk about today

309
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,180
What does it mean for us

310
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,960
As we look at this particular phrase

311
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,460
For us as Christ followers

312
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,880
To go and do

313
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:41,140
What does it mean for us not to go and do

314
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,680
What does that mean for us not to go and do

315
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,800
What do we do

316
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,760
As Christ followers

317
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:49,880
Three things we're gonna talk about

318
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,180
What does it mean for us to go and do

319
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,680
Number two, what does it mean not to go and do

320
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:02,880
And what does it mean for us to actually do

321
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,640
Those three things

322
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,840
I told you the last three weeks

323
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,560
I have literally been on the road

324
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,100
Went to Minnesota for spring break

325
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,560
With the family

326
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,060
Went over to Romania

327
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:16,680
To the city of Bucharest and Cluj

328
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,340
Then from that point

329
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,640
I went over to Prague

330
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,260
Over the Czech Republic

331
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:22,380
And I ended up over in Orlando

332
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,840
With a bunch of our cohort

333
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,960
From around the different worlds

334
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,420
When I went to Romania

335
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,720
I arrived in Bucharest

336
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,340
The capital city of Romania

337
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,640
On Orthodox Easter

338
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:35,680
Where the city was completely empty

339
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,920
It was completely deserted

340
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:40,200
Why

341
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,040
Because it is a huge national holiday

342
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,700
Did you know in Romania

343
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,500
90% of all the people

344
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,700
Who live in the country of Romania

345
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:53,160
Will say they're Christians

346
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,740
Out of that 90%, 80% of them

347
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,540
Are Orthodox Christians

348
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,500
Romania as a country

349
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,960
Is going through a huge rebuild

350
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,700
Like when I stepped foot in Romania

351
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,500
I've never been to Romania before

352
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,000
Some of you guys

353
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Who have probably studied

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,500
Eastern European history

355
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,500
That's the only time

356
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,500
I've ever heard about Romania

357
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:19,500
It was embedded in communist regime

358
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,500
All the way to 1989

359
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,500
It was ruled by this general secretary

360
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,500
By the name of Nikolai Ceaușescu

361
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,500
And he ruled it with an iron hand

362
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,500
And after his overthrow of the regime in 1989

363
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,500
Everything started rebuilding

364
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,500
But it got to a point

365
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
If you know anything about

366
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,500
What was going on in Romania

367
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
This guy Nikolai Ceaușescu

368
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,500
Was so obsessed

369
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,500
About creating his own kingdom

370
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,500
He ignored the basic necessities

371
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,500
Of the people there

372
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,500
He ignored the health of the country

373
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,500
He ignored the needs

374
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,500
Until it got to be so much

375
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
They soon overthrew him

376
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,500
On one of those days

377
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,500
We visited his former palace

378
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,500
It is now the parliament

379
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,500
For where the congress

380
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,500
And the senate takes place

381
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,500
When you go into this former palace

382
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,500
It is humongous

383
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,500
We walked around

384
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,500
It took me 25 minutes

385
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Just to walk around the outer perimeter

386
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,500
Because it's Orthodox Easter

387
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,500
So there's no security guard

388
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,500
I'm sitting there

389
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,500
Why is there no security guard

390
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,500
Around the parliament

391
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,500
I had no idea

392
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,500
And so you had to walk all the way

393
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,500
And we kept getting lost

394
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,500
We finally ended up in this place

395
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,500
To take a tour of this place

396
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,500
It is so big

397
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,500
It is the second biggest

398
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,500
Government building

399
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,500
Next to the pentagon

400
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,500
So of all the different

401
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,500
Government buildings

402
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,500
Around the world

403
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,500
This palace was the second biggest

404
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,500
They told us that it takes

405
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,500
$500,000 a month

406
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,500
To power this thing up

407
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,500
To pay for all the utilities

408
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,500
And you know what was ironic

409
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,500
It was empty

410
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,500
75% of the building

411
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,500
Is completely empty

412
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,500
It was deserted

413
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,500
And they said unless

414
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,500
Congress and Senate meets

415
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,500
It's just empty all the time

416
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,500
Do you know any groups

417
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,500
Who would like to rent this room

418
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,500
It just was crazy

419
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,500
And here's the one thing

420
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,500
That's happening in Romania

421
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,500
We went to Bucharest

422
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,500
And later on we went to Cluj

423
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
More on Cluj in a little bit

424
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,500
If there's 90% of people in Romania

425
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Who says they're Christians

426
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,500
Why do they have such an issue

427
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,500
With corruption in Romania

428
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,500
Because a lot of times

429
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:35,500
Back in the days of the communist regime

430
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,500
Many people had to trust God

431
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,500
For basic necessities

432
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,500
They had to trust that God would provide

433
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,500
They couldn't trust that

434
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,500
The government would provide

435
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,500
Because the government

436
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,500
Was taking all their money

437
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:47,500
So a lot of times

438
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,500
Many of the older baby boomers

439
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,500
Lived in this regime

440
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:54,500
Where their basic needs were not met

441
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:58,500
When communists fell in 1989

442
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,500
Democracy came

443
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,500
You started bringing a whole new generation

444
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:06,500
Who did not live in that regime

445
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,500
So now you know what happened

446
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,500
They started attending church

447
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,500
But now because of those opportunities

448
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,500
They didn't need to depend on God anymore

449
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,500
They don't need church anymore

450
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,500
I'll go on Sundays

451
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,500
Because that's what is expected

452
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,500
I've always lived

453
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:29,500
I could control my own destiny

454
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
And did they have mentors

455
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,500
To mentor them as they were growing up

456
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,500
No

457
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,500
Because this is the first generation of Christians

458
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,500
Who now are living in a democratic society

459
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,500
That is different from their parents

460
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,500
Their parents couldn't be the mentors

461
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,500
Because they couldn't understand it

462
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
So suddenly you have all these Christians

463
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,500
In Romania trying to figure out

464
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,500
What it means to integrate their faith

465
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,500
We then went over to Cluj

466
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Cluj is the second biggest city in Romania

467
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,500
Cluj was filled with entrepreneurs

468
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,500
Was filled with university setting

469
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,500
People with new ideas

470
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,500
Wanting to change their city

471
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,500
But at the same time

472
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,500
Many of the older folks

473
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:17,500
There's a huge divide between the church

474
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,500
And the business leaders

475
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,500
As they're trying to figure out

476
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,500
So a lot of times you have these Christians

477
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,500
Who are living in Romania

478
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:25,500
Trying to figure out how

479
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,500
And what it means to integrate their faith

480
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
From Romania I went over to Prague

481
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,500
And in Prague we gathered

482
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,500
This is my second year there

483
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,500
We gathered all the wealthiest

484
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:37,500
European Christians from all of Europe

485
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,500
Who gathered in one place

486
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,500
To talk about collaboration

487
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,500
Because the perception is

488
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,500
The church is dying in Europe

489
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:46,500
But that's not so

490
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,500
There's so much rebuilding in Europe going on

491
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,500
And all these wealthy people

492
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Marketplace leaders are all gathered together

493
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
To come and say

494
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,500
How do we pull all of our money together

495
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,500
To engage and see and collaborate

496
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,500
That's the key thing

497
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,500
Collaborate in what was Europe

498
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,500
So from that point on to Prague and to Europe

499
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
And two more stories

500
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,500
And it ties into what we're talking about

501
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,500
We then get to Orlando

502
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:13,500
And there we gathered

503
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,500
All of our young marketplace leaders

504
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,500
From Hong Kong, from Indonesia, from Malaysia

505
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,500
All of that

506
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,500
And we have a bunch of different speakers

507
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,500
We have one speaker

508
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Who said that who is on his way

509
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,500
To minister to business leaders

510
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,500
And CEOs in Hong Kong

511
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:30,500
He was going to meet with the CEO of

512
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,500
The President of Pakistan

513
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,500
Oh by the way

514
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,500
He was the former president

515
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,500
Of a major organization

516
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,500
A Christian organization

517
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,500
A 30 million dollar organization

518
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Whose leader and founder

519
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,500
Fell from grace

520
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,500
But fell from grace in a very powerful way

521
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,500
Because of sexual sin

522
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,500
And this individual

523
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,500
Who was the president

524
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,500
Of this major organization

525
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:59,500
Shared about how the entire ministry

526
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,500
Completely fell and disintegrated

527
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,500
Because of the sin of one person

528
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,500
We heard the pain

529
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,500
As he learned how to rebuild his life

530
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,500
We also heard the story of Larry Smith

531
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:17,500
Larry Smith is the CEO of Tokyo Electron

532
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,500
He shared his story

533
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,500
That when his kids graduated from college

534
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,500
He and his wife sold everything they had

535
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:25,500
They sold their mansion

536
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,500
And they moved to a 300 square foot home

537
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,500
In a tiny town

538
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,500
Full of drug addicts

539
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,500
Full of homeless people

540
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,500
All of that

541
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,500
So he could minister to them

542
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,500
And learn how to build bridges with them

543
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,500
Why did I tell you all these different stories

544
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:46,500
Because each one of those individuals

545
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,500
Whether you're here or listening today

546
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:52,500
Are doing what God has called them to do

547
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
Has continued to be so molded

548
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,500
And so focused in their calling

549
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:02,500
They are walking each day to make a choice

550
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Because they realize they are stewards

551
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,500
Of what God has given them

552
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,500
One speaker said this

553
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
I love what he said

554
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,500
I wrote it down

555
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,500
That when you and I are born

556
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:16,500
You look like your parents

557
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,500
But when you die

558
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,500
You look like your decisions

559
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,500
When you and I are born

560
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,500
You look like your parents

561
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:28,500
But when you die

562
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,500
You look like your decisions

563
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,500
What are the decisions

564
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,500
That you and I need to make

565
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:39,500
To continue to serve and honor the Lord

566
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,500
In everything that we do

567
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,500
What does it mean for us to go and do

568
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:45,500
Acts 1A tells us

569
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,500
But you will receive power

570
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,500
When the Holy Spirit has come upon you

571
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,500
And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem

572
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,500
And in all Judea and Samaria

573
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,500
And to the ends of the earth

574
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
For the longest time when I read this

575
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,500
I always thought it was just the Great Commission

576
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,500
We always knew it was the Great Commission

577
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,500
This is where God wants you to be

578
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,500
Where's your Samaria

579
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,500
Where's your Judea

580
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,500
Where's your all of these different things

581
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,500
Where's the end of the earth

582
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,500
I understood it as the Great Commission

583
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:14,500
We all see it as the Great Commission

584
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,500
One pastor one time says to me

585
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:17,500
Tommy, have you ever thought

586
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,500
That besides this being a Great Commission

587
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,500
How would your perspective change

588
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,500
If you look at Acts 1A

589
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Not just as a commission

590
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:33,500
But as a declaration

591
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,500
Because when you look upon it

592
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,500
As a declaration also

593
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:42,500
It changes your perspective

594
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,500
It creates urgency in what you need to do

595
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:46,500
What do I mean

596
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,500
It says that when you will receive power

597
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
You're definitely going to receive power

598
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,500
When the Holy Spirit has come upon you

599
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,500
You will be my witnesses

600
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,500
It's not a choice

601
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,500
You're going to be my witnesses in Jerusalem

602
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:03,500
You're going to be my witnesses in Judea

603
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,500
You're going to be my witnesses in Samaria

604
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,500
Samaria Jews don't go to Samaria

605
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
You will be my witnesses

606
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:13,500
In places that you don't want to be

607
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,500
And you will be my witnesses

608
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
To the end of the earth

609
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:23,500
When we see it as just a declaration

610
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,500
There is no choice

611
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,500
There is an urgency for what we must do

612
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,500
It changes our perspective

613
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,500
It allows us to look at our life

614
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,500
And what we're doing right now

615
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
And realize the call of the Great Commission

616
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,500
This declaration that Jesus is coming

617
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:44,500
Means that the Holy Spirit is in each one of us

618
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,500
And we are called to make a difference in our work

619
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,500
In our family, in our community, in our church

620
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:56,500
Not only from the outside, but from the inside

621
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,500
It's how we live

622
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,500
It's how we treat people

623
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:02,500
It's how we think, all of it

624
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,500
Because we are witnesses

625
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:07,500
Because the Holy Spirit is upon us

626
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,500
That's what we're supposed to be doing

627
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
It means that we go into places

628
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,500
Encounter people that aren't Chinese

629
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,500
It means that we go to people

630
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:21,500
Encounter people that are different than us

631
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,500
In their skin color, in their beliefs

632
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,500
In their sexual identity

633
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,500
We engage all those issues

634
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,500
Because we're Christ followers

635
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,500
That's what it means to go and do

636
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,500
That's what it means to be witnesses

637
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,500
In everything that we do

638
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:41,500
To go to places

639
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:44,500
That are different than us

640
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,500
My former boss

641
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,500
The president of a major seminary

642
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,500
Once said to me, "Tai

643
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
All we need to do

644
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:57,500
Is to teach people to study the Bible

645
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,500
That's all you need to do

646
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,500
That's it"

647
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:04,500
And I once had to say to this guy, "I disagree with you"

648
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,500
And I'd love to hear your thoughts later on

649
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
I disagree with you

650
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,500
Helping people studying the Bible is very key

651
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,500
But I said to him, "A lot of times

652
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,500
You have to understand this

653
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:18,500
When I see you, you are a white Caucasian man

654
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
President of a seminary

655
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:23,500
Where you earn mid-six-figure salaries

656
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
When you first started in a church

657
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,500
You came into a big church

658
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,500
Also earned six-digit salaries

659
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,500
When you left the seminary and went to a church

660
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,500
Another church hired you

661
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:38,500
And gave you a big six-digit salary

662
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,500
You never had to worry

663
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:43,500
About racial discrimination

664
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,500
You never had to worry about money

665
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
You never had to worry about

666
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,500
Any of those different things

667
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,500
But some of us do

668
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
Some of us have to deal

669
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
Some of the issues in culture

670
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,500
We're going to have to deal

671
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,500
With racial discrimination

672
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,500
We're going to have to deal with money

673
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,500
And so a lot of times

674
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
And for all of us

675
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
As Christ followers

676
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,500
Dealing with studying the Bible is great

677
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
It's very great

678
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
But we as Christians

679
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Have to learn how to engage the culture

680
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,500
We have to learn to address the culture

681
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:18,500
We have to learn to be

682
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,500
What it means to really be able to be

683
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Engaging with the Christ-filled mind

684
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,500
That's what it means to take the gospel

685
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:29,500
To all the ends of the earth

686
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,500
What does it not mean

687
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,500
Here's what it does not mean

688
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
It does not mean that you live

689
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:36,500
Like a nomad like John the Baptist

690
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,500
And be in need and give up everything

691
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,500
Sometimes I think we as Christians

692
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
Say, "I'm not dealing with this

693
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:43,500
"Because it means that I live this poor life

694
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
And it's like, no, it doesn't

695
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,500
For some people, they've chosen to do it

696
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
But for us as Christ followers

697
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,500
It does not mean that we give up everything

698
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,500
Like John the Baptist

699
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,500
But here's what it does mean

700
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:59,500
It means that you do not get to

701
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:05,500
Pick and choose when to follow Jesus

702
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,500
It does not mean that you get to

703
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:12,500
Pick and choose when to follow Jesus

704
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
We pick and choose

705
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
When we pick and choose

706
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,500
When to follow Jesus

707
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:21,500
It doesn't lead to transformation

708
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:24,500
That means that every single day

709
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,500
When you and I wake up

710
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,500
Our mentality is

711
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:33,500
We are a steward of grace

712
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,500
We are a steward of the grace

713
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,500
That God has given us

714
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,500
We are a steward of God's will in our lives

715
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,500
And how do we use those talents and strengths

716
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:46,500
To continue to make a difference

717
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,500
To live a life that glorifies Him

718
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,500
In every single way

719
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,500
Luke 14, 26 tells us

720
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,500
If anyone comes to me

721
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,500
And does not hate his own father and mother

722
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,500
And wife and children

723
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,500
And brothers and sisters

724
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,500
Yes, and even his own life

725
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:09,500
He cannot be my disciple

726
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
And as an Asian person

727
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,500
A lot of times there's a lot of honor and respect

728
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,500
That we have toward our family

729
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,500
And when we read this, we say

730
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:20,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you want me to hate my mom and dad

731
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:23,500
That's not very nice

732
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:26,500
What it means is that your dedication

733
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,500
Your focus, your frame of mind

734
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,500
Your focus of mind

735
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:35,500
Is so strong every single day

736
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,500
That when it is compared to your relation

737
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,500
With anything else

738
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,500
You are hating your mother

739
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:46,500
You are hating your father, your wife, your children

740
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Your own brothers

741
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:51,500
That's the focus that we need to have

742
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,500
We don't need to pick and choose

743
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,500
We don't even get to pick and choose

744
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,500
It's our focus every single day

745
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,500
Why?

746
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:03,500
Because the Holy Spirit is within us

747
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:06,500
And when the Holy Spirit is within us

748
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,500
We are called to go and do

749
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,500
When the Holy Spirit is within us

750
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,500
We go and do to go to Samaria

751
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,500
We go and do over in Jerusalem

752
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,500
We go and do over in all the ends here

753
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,500
That's what we're called to go and do

754
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,500
And that means every single day

755
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:29,500
We are light on the city of a hill

756
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,500
To make a difference in our own lives

757
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,500
In the lives of other people

758
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:40,500
But the problem is in Christianity

759
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,500
We've created a Christianity

760
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,500
And I'm not sure for those who are watching

761
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:45,500
We've created a Christianity

762
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,500
Where no one wants to be part of us

763
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,500
We've created a Christianity

764
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Where people are sick and tired of us

765
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:54,500
We've gotten too cute

766
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,500
Where we sit there and look at pastors

767
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:58,500
These days who love their platforms

768
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:01,500
I was literally on Facebook the other day

769
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
And I came across these ads on

770
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
How do you help your pastors in church

771
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:08,500
Snippet their sermons

772
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,500
And create instant reels

773
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,500
And create their platform

774
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,500
We've gotten to a point where we're too cute

775
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,500
That we love to be influencers

776
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:19,500
And we want to create these platforms

777
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,500
We've gotten too cute

778
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,500
In the sense that a lot of times

779
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
Here in the US

780
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,500
We've started fighting over dumb things

781
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
We want to know who's right

782
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
On the political spectrum

783
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
We want to know who we're supporting

784
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,500
And within the church

785
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,500
That has completely divided us

786
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,500
We want to know that we're right

787
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,500
And you better believe

788
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
There's no longer dialogue

789
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
And conversations and arguments

790
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:42,500
All of these things

791
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Because everybody wants to be right

792
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
And the rest of the world

793
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Has been watching us

794
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
And they are looking at us and say

795
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,500
If that's the way the church is

796
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,500
If that is the people

797
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
And the leaders that we encounter

798
00:28:57,500 --> 00:29:00,500
If that is the hypocrisy that we see

799
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:02,500
If that is what we're dealing with

800
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,500
With pastors who want to create their platform

801
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
With people using each other

802
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,500
With people misspending money

803
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,500
With people fighting all the time

804
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,500
Then why in the world

805
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,500
Do I want to be part of that church

806
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Because as Christ followers

807
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
We do not have a singularity of mind

808
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,500
To know that every single day

809
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,500
We're going to deal with different people

810
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
And every single day

811
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Through the power of the Holy Spirit

812
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:30,500
We are called to take his gospel

813
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,500
To every part

814
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
And to encounter people

815
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,500
Who are different to us

816
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,500
That has different opinions

817
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,500
And how do you show God

818
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,500
In a loving way

819
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,500
That's what we do

820
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,500
So what do we do

821
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,500
Couple of things as we wrap up

822
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Couple of things

823
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
How has God designed you

824
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
How has he gifted you

825
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:55,500
What are the skills that he has given you

826
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,500
We're not all called to do the same thing

827
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,500
We're all called to have the same focus

828
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
But we're not called to have to do the same thing

829
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,500
Peter was not sent to the nations

830
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
Paul was sent to the nations

831
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,500
But did Peter have to learn

832
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,500
The importance of what it meant

833
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,500
To reach out to Gentiles

834
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,500
He did

835
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:15,500
Joseph was called to be a city official

836
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:17,500
To be the chief of staff

837
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,500
To really be able to nurture

838
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:19,500
During that period of time

839
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:22,500
Nehemiah was called to rebuild

840
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,500
The walls of Jerusalem

841
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,500
At a later age

842
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,500
Before that he was called to be

843
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:29,500
A faithful cupbearer to the king

844
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,500
Zacchaeus of all of those guys

845
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,500
Was not like Matthew

846
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,500
Called to leave his role as a tax collector

847
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:36,500
And follow Jesus

848
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,500
And be one of his disciples

849
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:41,500
He was called to be a chief tax collector

850
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,500
And stay at his job

851
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:46,500
And be faithful at his job

852
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,500
What do we do

853
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,500
It comes down to how God has created you

854
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
And designed you to be

855
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,500
It comes down to how God has gifted you

856
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:57,500
And the passions that he has given in your heart

857
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,500
We're all called to take the gospel

858
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
To the ends of the earth

859
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
We are not called to pick and choose

860
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
When we follow God

861
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
But how that looks like

862
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Is going to be different

863
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:09,500
For each person

864
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,500
And it's going to involve your time

865
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,500
It's going to involve your outlook

866
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
It's going to involve your motivation

867
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,500
And it's going to involve your money

868
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:22,500
It's going to involve all of those things

869
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,500
As we seek to follow God

870
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
In all that we do

871
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
That's really what we're called

872
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:30,500
When Elijah says to the widow

873
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Go and do

874
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,500
God says the same thing for you

875
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Go and do

876
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Go and do

877
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,500
Because if our motivation

878
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:47,500
Is the grace of the cross

879
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,500
What does it mean for you to go and do

880
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
What does it mean for you to go and do in your work

881
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,500
What does it mean to go and do in your family

882
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,500
What does it mean to go and do

883
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:02,500
To engage with people who are different than you

884
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,500
We're called to go and do

885
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,500
We're called to engage with people who are different

886
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,500
Who think differently

887
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,500
Who act differently than we are

888
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,500
That's what we're called to do

889
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
How that looks

890
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,500
Is going to be different for each person

891
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:26,500
Father, thank you for the words of Elijah

892
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,500
You call us to go and do

893
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Where do we go and do

894
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
How do we go and do

895
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
We know one thing, Lord

896
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,500
We don't get to pick and choose when we go and do

897
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:44,500
But may we be aware of open doors

898
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
And open opportunities

899
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,500
May we be aware of how this affects all of our life

900
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Both our inner character and our outer lives

901
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,500
How it affects our money, our calling

902
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Our decisions that we make

903
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,500
Our motivation, Lord

904
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:03,500
Help us to understand what that go and do means

905
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:06,500
Help us as we reflect upon that phrase

906
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,500
Wrestle with that word, those words

907
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:12,500
And help us to see you in the midst of it

908
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
Christ, we pray, amen
