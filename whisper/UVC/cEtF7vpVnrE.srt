1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Hey, we are going to continue our mini-series on worship.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,120
 And last time we were talking about Psalm 8, right?

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,320
 Yeah, and what a nice Psalm to reflect upon.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:17,780
 And today we're going to continue this series

5
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,200
 and we are at the beginning of the Bible.

6
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,440
 So if you have your Bible,

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,000
 turn to chapter two of the first book, Genesis.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,420
 Chapter two, Genesis, all right?

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:35,120
 We're going to read a part of scripture from chapter two.

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,120
 And this is a passage that talks about Garden of Eden.

11
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,480
 Garden of Eden, all right?

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,520
 So let me read a couple of verses out of chapter two.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,480
 Chapter two, verse seven.

14
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,480
 Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground.

15
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:57,080
 He breathed the breath of life into the man's nostrils

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,560
 and the man became a living person.

17
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,560
 Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east.

18
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,880
 And there he placed the man he had made.

19
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,800
 The Lord God made all sorts of trees

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,800
 growing up from the ground,

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,760
 trees that are beautiful, that produce delicious fruit.

22
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,320
 In the middle of the garden, he placed the tree of life

23
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,520
 and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

24
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:27,160
 And verse 15, the Lord God placed the man in the garden

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,440
 of Eden to tend and watch over it.

26
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:33,120
 But the Lord God warned him,

27
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,200
 "You may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the garden,

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,540
 "except the tree of knowledge of good and evil.

29
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:42,920
 "If you eat its fruit, you will surely die."

30
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,060
 Then the Lord God said,

31
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:48,040
 "It is not good for the man to be alone.

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,200
 "I will make a helper who is just right for him."

33
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,240
 This is a simple passage, right?

34
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,040
 Seemingly very simple.

35
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,520
 By the way, I'm reading from a New Living Translation, NLT,

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,740
 which is easier to understand for many of you.

37
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,560
 And as we open the opening chapters of the Bible,

38
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,040
 we find a simple story, right?

39
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,600
 How many of you have seen or read a children's Bible?

40
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,960
 Children Bible, kid's Bible.

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,880
 Yeah, right?

42
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:21,520
 Do you find this story in the children Bible?

43
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,080
 You do, right?

44
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:26,480
 Yeah, it's a must-read story, right?

45
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,880
 And you find a forest, Adam and Eve,

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,280
 two people in the garden.

47
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,920
 And it seems like a very, very simple kid's story.

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,780
 However, a closer reading,

49
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,200
 or if you read it more carefully,

50
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,080
 you raise a lot of difficult questions,

51
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,640
 a lot of different issues.

52
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,440
 For example, did Adam have belly button?

53
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,200
 He's the first guy, right?

54
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,680
 And he was not born from a mother.

55
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,960
 Who's the mother of Adam?

56
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,000
 No mother, right?

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,280
 So how about Eve, right?

58
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,460
 Eve was born or came into existence

59
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,760
 in a very different way, right?

60
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,640
 So do they have belly buttons?

61
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,600
 Or when did they come about, right?

62
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,880
 I mean, a simple, literal reading of scripture

63
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,680
 will have us believe, okay,

64
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,880
 maybe Genesis 1 and 2,

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:27,660
 things that happened just a few thousand years ago, right?

66
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:31,040
 So we've come to the conclusion, probably,

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
 that the earth is young, right?

68
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,080
 It's really, really young.

69
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,040
 I mean, how many pages you got, right?

70
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,040
 From creation to Abraham, right?

71
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,880
 It's only 12 chapters, right?

72
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:45,680
 And what is Adam's DNA?

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
 Have you ever thought about it?

74
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,800
 Well, Adam is a real man, right?

75
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,200
 I mean, what's his genes, right?

76
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:58,080
 And Eve, and is the Garden of Eden on the Google map?

77
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,680
 Can you find it?

78
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,120
 Can you find it somewhere in the Middle East, maybe?

79
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,680
 In Iraq?

80
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,480
 Or let the archaeologists take it up, right?

81
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:12,120
 So a simple reading will have us believe

82
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,980
 this is a children's story.

83
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,760
 But a careful reading, it weighs a lot of questions.

84
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,400
 And I think a lot of questions that we ask,

85
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,260
 or the questions that I ask,

86
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,240
 you can't find answer from Genesis 1, 2, and 3.

87
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,600
 Because the scripture, Genesis 1, 2, and 3,

88
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:34,600
 are not designed to answer some of our,

89
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,400
 or many of our modern questions, right?

90
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:42,400
 It is designed to answer a couple of important questions.

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,900
 Very important, more important

92
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:47,760
 than the questions that we ask, all right?

93
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:51,720
 So reading the Bible is kind of like this, okay?

94
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,880
 We have to come to a certain strategy,

95
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,220
 understand what the Bible is all about, right?

96
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,400
 Otherwise, we'll ask a lot of different questions

97
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,300
 that the Bible is not going to answer, right?

98
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,900
 So we have to listen to the text.

99
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,080
 We have to listen to the Bible,

100
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,020
 listen to the word of God carefully,

101
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,740
 and let it dictate what it's trying to say.

102
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:15,860
 And we are here to listen and to obey.

103
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:19,580
 That is our attitude in front of scripture, right?

104
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,660
 Before the Bible, we are servants,

105
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,880
 and we listen to the word of God.

106
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,220
 So how do we read Genesis 1, 2, and 3?

107
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:32,540
 Simple story, but actually a very deep story.

108
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,580
 I think the story in Genesis 1, 2, and 3,

109
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:38,980
 and we'll spend some time in Genesis 2,

110
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:43,980
 are much like a symbolic story, you know, symbolic story.

111
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,500
 It's like a can full of different symbols,

112
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,060
 and these symbols have deeper meanings,

113
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,660
 and we have to ask the questions,

114
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:56,180
 what do they point to, right?

115
00:05:56,180 --> 00:06:01,180
 My analogy of reading the Bible is like reading a map, okay?

116
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,980
 Do you have Google Map on your phone?

117
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,540
 Or some sort of GPS app on your phone, right?

118
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,740
 And you key in your destination, and it will show you,

119
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,880
 you know, where to turn, right?

120
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,820
 Which road to take, which highway to take,

121
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,220
 which exit to take, Google Map, right?

122
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,340
 We all read maps, and sometimes when we read maps,

123
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,340
 we kind of intuitively, we understand what the map means,

124
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,180
 right?

125
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,100
 Reading the Bible is kind of like reading a map.

126
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,460
 Let me give you an example.

127
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,820
 I have three examples here.

128
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,580
 On the right is a Chicago map.

129
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:43,380
 Upper left is a map of Hong Kong, right, where I came from.

130
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,620
 And then lower left is, do you know where it is?

131
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:50,780
 It's Tokyo, Japan, right?

132
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:53,700
 Why do I put a Japan map on the screen?

133
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,900
 Because a lot of people telling me,

134
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,700
 oh, I need to go to Japan, you know?

135
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,260
 (audience laughs)

136
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,260
 Oh, the currency exchange rate is so good, right?

137
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,660
 Everybody's going to Japan, okay?

138
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,000
 So there you go, all right?

139
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,580
 So you read a map, we kind of, we read it intuitively.

140
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,100
 We understand what it means, right?

141
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,900
 For example, upper left, the map in Hong Kong,

142
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,860
 I add the layer of traffic.

143
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,540
 So you see all the highways, right?

144
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,060
 You see different colors.

145
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,420
 You know, red means it's very congested.

146
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,220
 Black is totally stopped, right?

147
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,860
 Yellow is kind of congested,

148
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,740
 and then green is all smooth, right?

149
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,820
 Those are traffic map, right?

150
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,380
 So you add a layer, you understand the symbols,

151
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,360
 you understand the color of the lines,

152
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,620
 and then you interpret the map

153
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,140
 the way it is intended to, right?

154
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,560
 You got it?

155
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:47,380
 And then at the lower left is the Tokyo map.

156
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:49,980
 It's a terrain map, terrain.

157
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,240
 Where the mountain, where the valleys, right?

158
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,240
 You see Fuji mountain on the map.

159
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:03,780
 On the, it's at the lower left corner, right?

160
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,620
 Mount Fuji.

161
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,980
 So it shows you where the hills are,

162
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:11,140
 where the mountains are, where the valleys are, right?

163
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,820
 And they color it, right?

164
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:17,300
 For the plane, for the level, ground level,

165
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:22,300
 or elevation zero, right, sea level, you see white.

166
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:26,300
 And then you climb the mountain, you see green,

167
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,500
 and then there's a black spot, right?

168
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,780
 Those are higher elevation.

169
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:35,420
 That's a terrain map, right?

170
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,220
 And then on the right is, of course, the Chicago map.

171
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,740
 Where are we?

172
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,780
 Where are we on the map?

173
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:44,140
 We're kind of in the near south.

174
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,700
 You see the pink color?

175
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:48,340
 You know where you are?

176
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,900
 Come on, guys, right?

177
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,860
 You know where you are?

178
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,180
 All right, you're not in green, okay?

179
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,060
 You're right by the lake, right?

180
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:56,420
 You see Navy Pier?

181
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,740
 You see that?

182
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,220
 Oh, come on, right?

183
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:03,900
 This is elementary questions, right?

184
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:06,700
 Yeah, we're kind of in the near south,

185
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:10,340
 the lower end of the pink region, right?

186
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:13,220
 So the map has you, different color, right?

187
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:16,500
 So the map is coded in such a way that you know,

188
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,540
 okay, this is the near south, this is the north,

189
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,220
 and this is the region, or how we call it, right?

190
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:24,660
 You don't take the map, this color map of Chicago,

191
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,220
 and you go out to the street and say,

192
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,060
 "How come it's not pink?"

193
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,900
 Pink!

194
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,780
 I'm expecting the road to be all pink, right?

195
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,540
 Because we're in the near south, right?

196
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,180
 We don't do that, right?

197
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:42,740
 Because we intuitively, we know that what it means is that,

198
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,220
 okay, the pink area is simple meaning,

199
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:50,220
 well, this neighborhood belong to the same region, right?

200
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:52,740
 To the same area.

201
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:55,780
 Now, we don't go out and use a Google map and say,

202
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,180
 "Oh, the line is blue, and I don't see any blue line," right?

203
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:03,660
 It shows you with legends, with different color coding,

204
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:07,420
 or different symbols to tell you some aspect

205
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:09,380
 of the reality, right?

206
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:12,540
 Now, no map can tell you everything, right?

207
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:15,020
 You cannot go back to the map maker and say,

208
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,540
 "Hey, why didn't you answer my questions?

209
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,380
 "Why didn't you tell me the terrain?"

210
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,220
 Right?

211
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:21,820
 Well, it's not terrain map, right?

212
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:23,300
 It's a color code map.

213
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:26,900
 It tells you all the 77 neighborhoods of Chicago,

214
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,080
 and what do they call, right?

215
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,180
 And that is the purpose of a map.

216
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:34,900
 Now, you cannot fault the maker by saying,

217
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,620
 "You don't tell me the reality comprehensively.

218
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,500
 "You don't answer all my questions."

219
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:46,500
 Now, it's much the same way when we read the Bible story.

220
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,540
 No Bible story will tell you everything.

221
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:54,460
 No text in the Bible, no passage in the Bible

222
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,140
 will answer every single question that you have, right?

223
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:00,620
 Now, your questions or your concern

224
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:03,860
 when you read the Word of God is let that passage

225
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,740
 dictate the questions to ask.

226
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:10,580
 And listen to the passage, listen to the words.

227
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,840
 What are they trying to tell you?

228
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,060
 Now, the Bible does not answer all the questions

229
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,660
 that we have, and you cannot say,

230
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:20,780
 "Okay, the Bible is flawed."

231
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,860
 That's not what it means, because it tells you

232
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,720
 some aspects of the reality.

233
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:28,780
 So reading Genesis 2 is kind of like reading a map.

234
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,100
 We have to understand what kind of map it is,

235
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,720
 what kind of text it is.

236
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,740
 I already told you the Garden of Eden story

237
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:39,940
 is highly symbolic story, and use different symbols,

238
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,960
 like a map, using different color codes

239
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:47,620
 to tell you some truths of the reality, all right?

240
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,700
 What I'm trying to suggest to you

241
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:54,260
 is that Genesis 1, 2, and 3, the opening chapters of Genesis

242
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:59,680
 or even the first 11 chapters, or many other passages,

243
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:05,420
 especially Genesis opening chapters,

244
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:08,880
 they are identity document.

245
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,220
 The text is trying to answer the core question

246
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,700
 of identity, human identity.

247
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,380
 In other words, who am I, right?

248
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,220
 Who am I?

249
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,020
 Okay, I'm Mark Chan, but who am I?

250
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,340
 Why do I even exist?

251
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,820
 What am I here for, right?

252
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,260
 What is the purpose of me being here?

253
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,620
 My existence, my purpose, you know?

254
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,700
 Now, so often we can make up answers

255
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,440
 to all of these identity questions,

256
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:46,100
 but the truth is we have to ask the creator God,

257
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:51,360
 he created you, and we owe our lives to him.

258
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,420
 We have to ask him how to answer those questions.

259
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,620
 So there we go, we come to Genesis 2.

260
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:01,180
 It is a story on Garden of Eden.

261
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,900
 It's a highly symbolic story.

262
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,940
 It doesn't, when I say the story,

263
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:09,180
 the Bible story is highly symbolic,

264
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,960
 it does not make it less historical.

265
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,700
 It does not make it less real, okay?

266
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,380
 Just like the color code map,

267
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:20,340
 it does not make Chicago less real or less historical.

268
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,060
 It is telling you something about the reality of Chicago.

269
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,660
 It's a color code map.

270
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,980
 It's the same way, Genesis 2, the Garden of Eden story,

271
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,580
 it's a real story.

272
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,520
 It's written in such a way that it's symbolic,

273
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:37,420
 right, understanding a map, different legends and colors.

274
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,980
 So we read the story, we have to try to think,

275
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,100
 you know, what the biblical author,

276
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,700
 or what God is trying to say through this passage.

277
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,980
 Well, let me test you, all right?

278
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,340
 You like a pop quiz, right?

279
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,540
 Think of Garden of Eden.

280
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:57,720
 Now, the Garden of Eden has an entrance, all right?

281
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,300
 Just like church has an entrance, right?

282
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,220
 Where, which direction does the entrance

283
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,580
 of Garden of Eden face?

284
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,300
 East, okay, very good, Jin Fang, very good.

285
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,900
 Good student.

286
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,260
 No question about it, right?

287
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,100
 East, right?

288
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,380
 Okay, second question.

289
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:19,760
 Who is guarding the entrance to Eden?

290
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,540
 Who is at the door?

291
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,600
 So you walk in our church, right?

292
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,580
 There is some people guarding the door, right?

293
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,540
 Some of the core team members,

294
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,420
 or some of the welcome team people.

295
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:35,140
 But who's guarding the entrance of the Garden of Eden?

296
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:35,980
 Who?

297
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:40,820
 What, I'm sorry?

298
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,220
 Give it a shot.

299
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:48,540
 Okay, anyone give it a try?

300
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:49,380
 It's cherubim.

301
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,600
 Who's that guy?

302
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,980
 Cherubim.

303
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:57,020
 Cherubim is one of the angels, all right?

304
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,980
 Cherubim, all right, got it?

305
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,820
 Cherubim, say it, cherubim, all right?

306
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,420
 There are at least two cherubims

307
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,980
 guarding the entrance of Garden of Eden.

308
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,060
 Now, you say, why is it important?

309
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,380
 All right, okay, the entrance of Garden of Eden

310
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,580
 is facing east, okay?

311
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,140
 The place of sunrise, all right?

312
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,660
 Now, in the Bible world,

313
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:24,200
 all the temples, all the sacred places,

314
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,860
 their entrances face east.

315
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:31,160
 They all face east.

316
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,020
 All the sanctuaries in the Bible world face east,

317
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,540
 the place of sunrise.

318
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,940
 And at the entrance, facing east,

319
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:44,780
 is often guarded by some sort of angelic beings,

320
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,480
 some sort of creatures.

321
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,980
 Those creatures are shaped in such a way

322
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,840
 that gives you power,

323
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,940
 because who's guarding the door, right?

324
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,060
 It cannot be a little kid, right?

325
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,260
 It has to be someone who is strong and who is powerful, right?

326
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:03,740
 And cherubim is kind of like that, right?

327
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,620
 Now, let me tell you, much later in the Bible,

328
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:12,620
 a tabernacle, a tabernacle is actually a portable tent, right?

329
00:16:12,620 --> 00:16:15,220
 Remember the Israelites came out of Egypt, right?

330
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,320
 They were in the wilderness, in the desert,

331
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:22,320
 and God is living among them in the form of tabernacle.

332
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,980
 So he designed the tabernacle,

333
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:29,060
 and Moses and all those people, they built the tent, right?

334
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,660
 And you can pack the tent, and then you go somewhere else,

335
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,340
 and then you pitch a tent, and then God is there.

336
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:39,500
 And then when you are about to go to another station,

337
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,500
 and then you pack the tent, and then you pitch the tent.

338
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:43,440
 That is tabernacle.

339
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:48,420
 Tabernacle, the entrance of tabernacle.

340
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,780
 What direction does it face?

341
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,860
 What direction?

342
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:54,380
 The entrance of tabernacle.

343
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,220
 You know that?

344
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:58,340
 East, okay?

345
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:00,220
 East, yeah, I told you already, right?

346
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:01,500
 East, right?

347
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:04,380
 And then after the wilderness, many years,

348
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:07,180
 they came, settled down, the Israelites came,

349
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,060
 settled down in the land of Canaan,

350
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,300
 and eventually they made Jerusalem the capital.

351
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,300
 And remember who built the first temple?

352
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,340
 Solomon, right?

353
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,340
 Solomon, come on, guys.

354
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,820
 Solomon, wake up.

355
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,660
 Almost noon.

356
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,500
 Solomon, right?

357
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:22,660
 The son of David, right?

358
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:27,060
 He built the first temple, Solomon's temple, in Jerusalem.

359
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:30,100
 And the entrance of Jerusalem temple,

360
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,900
 which direction does it face?

361
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,020
 East, yeah, yeah, exactly.

362
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,740
 Exactly, it face east, right?

363
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:40,740
 And then the entrances of tabernacle and temple

364
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,900
 are guarded by, who's guarding the door?

365
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,040
 What's his name?

366
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,420
 Cherubim, right?

367
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,860
 Cherubim, okay?

368
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:53,860
 So you find decoration of cherubim in the tabernacle,

369
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,060
 especially the entrance to the holy place.

370
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,300
 And then in the temple of Solomon,

371
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:02,220
 is also guarded by two cherubim, 1 Kings chapter six.

372
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,300
 There are two cherubims, angelic beings,

373
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,980
 guarding the door, right?

374
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,960
 Facing east.

375
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,940
 Now what did I say in the beginning?

376
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,620
 The God of Eden, facing east.

377
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,040
 Yes, yes, there you go.

378
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:18,180
 And who's guarding the door?

379
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,140
 Cherubim, okay, cherubim.

380
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,140
 And then you find all sorts of different things

381
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:25,060
 in chapter two of Genesis.

382
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,320
 You got flowers, you got trees,

383
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,520
 you got all this beautiful nature,

384
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:34,500
 and gold and silver and all this precious stones.

385
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:37,480
 Where did you find it other than God of Eden?

386
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,300
 You find decoration of all those things in tabernacle,

387
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,240
 and in much later, the temple of Solomon, right?

388
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,000
 So in that way, you understand

389
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,680
 the God of Eden is actually a sanctuary.

390
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,320
 It is at least described in such a way,

391
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:01,320
 using later terms to describe the prototype

392
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,340
 of sanctuary, a holy place.

393
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,800
 Now what is a sanctuary for?

394
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,120
 For worship, yes, for worship, right?

395
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,340
 We're talking about worship in this series, right?

396
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,660
 So right at the beginning, God is telling us

397
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,400
 when God set up the universe,

398
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,400
 when God put man, humanity, in the God of Eden,

399
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,120
 his purpose is for men and women, humanity, to worship him.

400
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,380
 You got it, right?

401
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:36,180
 So don't even come to the God of Eden story

402
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,900
 and say, "Oh, this is like my backyard, you know?

403
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,860
 "I can do barbecue here, right?

404
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,260
 "I can grow some flowers, you know, I can enjoy it."

405
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,000
 No, it's a sacred place.

406
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,540
 It's like a temple.

407
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,140
 It's like a sanctuary, right?

408
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:54,100
 Facing east and guarded by cherub, who?

409
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,460
 Cherubim, okay?

410
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,180
 Cherubim, it's a sacred place.

411
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,580
 It's where God dwells.

412
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,860
 God lives there, right?

413
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:05,260
 Now you have heard me before, maybe some time before,

414
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:09,060
 when you read Genesis 1, you know, six day of creation

415
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:11,340
 or even seven day creation.

416
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,180
 What is that about?

417
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,940
 It's not answering some of the scientific questions

418
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,540
 that we have today.

419
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,860
 It's trying to tell you why it exists

420
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:22,180
 and what is the purpose of the entire universe,

421
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,300
 entire cosmos that God set up.

422
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,060
 Seven days, right?

423
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,340
 What other buildings would take seven period of time to build?

424
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:34,780
 Temples, temples.

425
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,420
 In the Bible world or even within the Bible,

426
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,260
 when Solomon built the temple,

427
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:44,860
 it spent seven period of time, right?

428
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,380
 And building the tabernacle.

429
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:51,220
 Seven paragraphs to talk about building the tabernacle.

430
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:54,780
 So Genesis 1, the first story,

431
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:59,780
 it's not about geology or science or anything that we ask.

432
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:02,460
 It's about why this universe exists.

433
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,900
 Seven day, God set up the cosmos.

434
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:08,020
 So the entire cosmos is like a temple.

435
00:21:08,020 --> 00:21:11,860
 It's like God dwelling in the universe.

436
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,260
 The entire universe, the entire cosmos,

437
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,460
 it's a sacred place.

438
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,500
 It's like a holy place.

439
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:23,500
 God meant to dwell in the midst of it, right?

440
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,980
 Talking about creation care, right?

441
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,540
 Talking about environmental care.

442
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:31,740
 You know, Genesis 1 already right off the bat telling you,

443
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:36,740
 you know, this world is the cosmos set up by God himself

444
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,620
 to create a design in such a way that is sacred, right?

445
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,140
 That is holy, that he can dwell in it.

446
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:45,380
 And then chapter two, the camera zoom in

447
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:50,140
 into one spot in the entire cosmos called Garden of Eden.

448
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:52,780
 It's the first sanctuary.

449
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:55,220
 It's the prototype of sanctuary.

450
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:57,420
 And did I say, did I tell you

451
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,620
 the document is the identity document?

452
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,340
 Right?

453
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:05,220
 So the passage is trying to answer

454
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:07,460
 questions about your identity.

455
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,020
 Who am I, right?

456
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:15,860
 Now, when you get to know someone, a new friend,

457
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:18,100
 how do you introduce yourself?

458
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,920
 You tell them kind of who you are, right?

459
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,080
 Where you're from, what do you do, right?

460
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,100
 And those answers are identity.

461
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:29,220
 Say for example, you're a student and you say,

462
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:32,100
 "Oh, hello, I'm a student."

463
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,980
 And maybe your career, right?

464
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,340
 I will tell people, you know, I'm a pastor.

465
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,380
 And they go like, "Whoa."

466
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:39,220
 Right?

467
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:42,140
 You may be an accountant.

468
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:43,380
 You may be a teacher.

469
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,380
 You may be just a housewife or chef in a restaurant.

470
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:50,660
 Or we answer the identity questions

471
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,700
 by telling people what we do.

472
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,060
 What we do.

473
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:57,740
 But here's the problem.

474
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:01,860
 If we fix our identity, if we define our identity,

475
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,940
 anchor our identity simply by what we do,

476
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,220
 it's gonna change, right?

477
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,040
 It's gonna change.

478
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:15,760
 Before I was a pastor, I was a lab chemist.

479
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,400
 You know, I work in a environmental lab

480
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:21,720
 and I do testing for water and all those stuff

481
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,960
 because I studied biochemistry in my undergrad, right?

482
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,720
 So, you know, thank God I graduated and I found a job.

483
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,000
 So I was working in a lab.

484
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,520
 So every single day, eight hours, nine hours a day,

485
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,200
 I'm doing testing all the time, right?

486
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,440
 And I was called to ministry and then I went to seminary

487
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,240
 and I became a minister, right?

488
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:47,240
 See, my identity changed from a chemist to a pastor, right?

489
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,480
 And then someday I will retire.

490
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,800
 After I retire, am I still a pastor?

491
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,760
 Well, yes and no, right?

492
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,760
 Yes and no, I'm not pay staff of a certain church.

493
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,000
 But, you know, maybe part of me is saying,

494
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,160
 okay, I'm still a pastor.

495
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,200
 But, you know, you know what I'm saying, right?

496
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,040
 You know what I'm saying?

497
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:14,400
 When you answer questions about your essential identity,

498
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:18,560
 you know, things change all the time.

499
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:22,780
 And Genesis 2 is trying to answer that question.

500
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:26,240
 What is your essential identity?

501
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,280
 And the Bible gives us a solid answer.

502
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,280
 I'm God's creation.

503
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,520
 I'm designed and created by God wonderfully

504
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:34,640
 and fearfully made.

505
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,520
 I'm a child of God.

506
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,600
 I'm in Christ, right?

507
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,760
 I'm part of the people of God, right?

508
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,320
 Would that change?

509
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,280
 Would that identity change?

510
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,620
 No, because God does not change, right?

511
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:52,460
 Once you are a child of God,

512
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:54,680
 you're always the child of God.

513
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,200
 Yesterday, today, tomorrow, eternally.

514
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,240
 You're always the child of God.

515
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,140
 You're always worthy in God's sight.

516
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:06,840
 You have worth from someone who never changed,

517
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,160
 God himself.

518
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:09,900
 Once you anchor your identity

519
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,900
 into something that is unchanging,

520
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,240
 that is our eternal God, our creator God,

521
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,260
 God who loves you, God who cares for you,

522
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:19,620
 your identity is secure.

523
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:21,440
 You see what I'm saying, right?

524
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,680
 So we are the people of God,

525
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:27,720
 and you are a child of God once you are in Christ.

526
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:32,480
 We are the church, and that anchor is eternal.

527
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,480
 That identity never change.

528
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,920
 Now, back to this story.

529
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,600
 God of Eden is an identity document.

530
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,520
 What does it tell us about our identity?

531
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,240
 2.15, chapter two, verse 15.

532
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,360
 "The Lord God plays the man,"

533
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,400
 and by the way, here is the man, right?

534
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,860
 The man, the Adam, right?

535
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,440
 The Adam, right?

536
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,160
 So Adam is kind of interesting.

537
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,400
 He's a unique character, right?

538
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:05,560
 But Adam is actually, everyone is in Adam.

539
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,520
 He represent the whole mankind.

540
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,560
 He represent the whole humanity.

541
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,240
 So when you read the story of Adam and even Eve,

542
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,520
 you're reading a story for every man and every woman, right?

543
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,180
 I read myself into it.

544
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:19,160
 What does it tell you about the essence

545
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,680
 of being a human being, right?

546
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,520
 Being Adam, right?

547
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:25,480
 Being a human being.

548
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:29,540
 "The Lord God plays the man," the human,

549
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:34,540
 "in the garden of Eden to tend and watch over it," right?

550
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:38,820
 He said, "What is so important about those verbs?

551
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:43,520
 "To tend and to watch over it," right?

552
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,320
 Now, the early rabbis, the Jewish rabbis,

553
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:49,020
 already realized these words, this phrase,

554
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,600
 is kind of interesting phrase,

555
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:54,280
 because this phrase, "to tend and to watch over,"

556
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:59,280
 are used for priests who are working in the sanctuary.

557
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,140
 Right?

558
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,380
 How do you describe the job description

559
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:08,220
 of a priest working in the temple or sanctuary?

560
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,000
 That's how they describe it.

561
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,620
 In Numbers 3, verse seven, it talks about the Levites.

562
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:17,420
 Levites are those sacred personnel

563
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,540
 being called to minister in the tabernacle.

564
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,220
 It says, "They," the Levites,

565
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,880
 "will serve Aaron," the high priest,

566
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,940
 "and the whole community,

567
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:31,220
 "performing their sacred duties in and around the tabernacle."

568
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:35,360
 Now, I underline the word "performing."

569
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,740
 You can do some matching, and that is Genesis 2, 15,

570
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:43,100
 the word translated "ten," right?

571
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,260
 And the Italic word, can you see that?

572
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,620
 The Levites will serve Aaron.

573
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:54,360
 They will serve, the Italic word is matching, "watch over."

574
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:57,380
 In Hebrew, they are the same words, right?

575
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:58,340
 So it's very interesting.

576
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,340
 We realize when you go to Genesis 2,

577
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,380
 talking about humanity,

578
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,780
 they're being placed in the first sanctuary,

579
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:10,660
 Garden of Eden, their job is like a priest,

580
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,740
 to worship God.

581
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,580
 And what do the priests do in the sanctuary, in tabernacle?

582
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:19,420
 They offer sacrifices, they clean up the place,

583
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,900
 they make sure the temple,

584
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:25,100
 the sacred place is running, is operating,

585
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,940
 and to have fellowship with God.

586
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,220
 And most of all, the job of the priest

587
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:33,060
 is to guard the sacred place,

588
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:36,580
 guard the temple against anything evil,

589
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,720
 or anything secular,

590
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,380
 anything that does not belong to the tabernacle,

591
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,560
 guarding against those things coming in.

592
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:49,120
 So it's like setting a boundary,

593
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,260
 set a boundary around the sacred place,

594
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,900
 around the place of worship,

595
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,500
 so that unclean, profane, secular things

596
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:58,620
 will not enter the house of God,

597
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,580
 because the sanctuary is where God dwells, right?

598
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,220
 So now we understand, okay?

599
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,340
 Genesis 2 is talking about Garden of Eden

600
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:10,440
 is a sanctuary, it's like a temple.

601
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,460
 And our identity being placed in the Garden of Eden

602
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:16,440
 is like a priest, right?

603
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,660
 Like a priest.

604
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,020
 We worship God.

605
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,280
 That is the original design.

606
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,580
 You see, in the world of the Bible,

607
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,460
 the highest honor that a human person can have

608
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,980
 is being a priest.

609
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:35,380
 Someone who's close to God, right?

610
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,540
 Someone who has fellowship with God, to worship God.

611
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,440
 And in order to worship God,

612
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:43,820
 we must first have a right relationship with God.

613
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,520
 And who is God to you?

614
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,500
 That is also identity question, right?

615
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:53,500
 If God is your God, God is the one you worship,

616
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,340
 then you fix that identity,

617
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,580
 because I belong to God, and God created me,

618
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,840
 and I'm people of God,

619
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,780
 and worship flows out of that kind of relationship.

620
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:10,060
 I have God with a right relationship,

621
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,900
 and flows out of that relationship with God,

622
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,620
 I worship Him, right?

623
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:21,420
 In the 17th century, 1646, many years ago,

624
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,580
 many centuries ago, some centuries ago,

625
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,140
 there was a document called Salted Catechism,

626
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:29,580
 Westminster Salted Catechism.

627
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:31,240
 Now, what does it do?

628
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,720
 That's a pretty interesting word, catechism.

629
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,820
 We don't use it anymore, right?

630
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:40,820
 It's actually a document that the Bible teachers draft

631
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:46,440
 in those days to help the new believers

632
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,160
 to get to know the basics of their faith.

633
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:55,040
 So catechism simply means question and answers.

634
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,460
 The form is always question and answer.

635
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,240
 So in this sort of catechism,

636
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,400
 there were about 100 questions,

637
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,580
 and then you ask a question,

638
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,940
 and then the new believer,

639
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:11,820
 when they even get ready to get baptized, right?

640
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:13,420
 It's like a membership card.

641
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:15,660
 They have to answer those questions.

642
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,520
 So it's about 100 questions they have to answer correctly

643
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:23,200
 in order to get baptized and be a member of the church.

644
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,040
 Isn't that fun?

645
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,520
 There's also a larger catechism,

646
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:30,520
 which is more detailed with all the Bible references.

647
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,260
 Here, I give you a shorter catechism.

648
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,240
 It's a very valuable document to summarize

649
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,680
 the basics of the Christian faith, the biblical faith.

650
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:44,360
 And question number one, ask the question.

651
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,920
 Right off the bat, in the entire document,

652
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,880
 the first question is, what is the chief end of a person?

653
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:53,080
 The older translation is,

654
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:57,320
 what is the chief end, chief purpose of man?

655
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,880
 But today, we kind of distinguish that.

656
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,720
 So I translate as, what is the chief end of a person,

657
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,160
 a human person?

658
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,840
 And the answer is, a person's chief end,

659
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,580
 your number one purpose is to glorify God, to worship Him.

660
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,380
 And to enjoy Him forever.

661
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:22,880
 Those two little words are very, very carefully chosen.

662
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,500
 To glorify God in everything that we do,

663
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:28,940
 and worship is a big part of it.

664
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:31,100
 And to enjoy Him, that little word

665
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:33,900
 is a very carefully chosen word.

666
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,060
 Because our relationship with God

667
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:39,180
 is characterized by enjoyment, right?

668
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:43,340
 You enjoy your relationship with God.

669
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,060
 And you feel happy, you feel fulfilled,

670
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,300
 and you feel joyful,

671
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:50,860
 because you are related to God properly, right?

672
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:55,260
 So when you do quiet time,

673
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,220
 when you read the Bible, when you pray,

674
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,180
 do you enjoy it?

675
00:32:58,180 --> 00:33:02,840
 Or you're like, oh my God, this is another thing I need to do.

676
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,620
 Okay, I need to brush my teeth.

677
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,580
 I need to read scripture, all right?

678
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:09,060
 Oh my goodness, okay, get it done, right?

679
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:11,260
 Or you don't even do it, right?

680
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,380
 So think about it, our relationship with God

681
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,340
 is supposed to be an enjoyment.

682
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,540
 And that's what Westminster Catholicism,

683
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,580
 this old document is telling us.

684
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,940
 We worship God, and we enjoy the relationship,

685
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:29,460
 because we are created to worship God Himself.

686
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,140
 We are being put in the sanctuary, Garden of Eden,

687
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,820
 the first temple, the prototype of temple.

688
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,560
 And we are like a priest,

689
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,820
 the highest honor a man or a woman can get, right?

690
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:45,820
 We are all priests before God, and we worship Him.

691
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,980
 And secondly, in this chapter,

692
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,860
 I wanna isolate some of the facts,

693
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:53,820
 or some of the truth that the passage is telling us,

694
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:59,380
 is that we are created to be a community,

695
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,820
 a family, to worship God.

696
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,520
 2.18, "Then the Lord God said,

697
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:08,700
 "It's not good for the man to be alone,

698
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:11,940
 "not good for the human person to be alone.

699
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:15,380
 "I will make a helper who is just right for him."

700
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,540
 Again, it's NLT, New Living Translation.

701
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,180
 It's an easier English translation.

702
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:22,260
 But He says, listen carefully,

703
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,300
 "I will make him a helper who is just right for him."

704
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:29,420
 And by the way, the word helper does not mean

705
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:34,420
 someone of lower status.

706
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,200
 Helper does not mean that.

707
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,240
 You know why?

708
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,120
 Because many Psalms, many prayers in the Bible,

709
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:46,560
 we refer God as helper, right?

710
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,760
 God is not your servant.

711
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:50,460
 God is not your maid servant.

712
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,640
 Many prayers in the Bible, particularly in the Psalms,

713
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:58,360
 asking God, "God, can you help me?

714
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,020
 "You are my helper, you are my fortress."

715
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,640
 Now, so the English translation here,

716
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,320
 helper, don't get the wrong connotation

717
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:12,960
 that, okay, all right, the woman is the lowest status.

718
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,960
 No, I think a better translation is ally, alliance, right?

719
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,600
 In order for Adam to take care of the creation,

720
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:25,800
 to worship God, he cannot do it alone.

721
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,920
 He need another one corresponding to him.

722
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,660
 He needs another one just like him, in front of him.

723
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,900
 What it means, essentially, a copy.

724
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,180
 So you need another person, you need a community.

725
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,140
 And the most basic unit for community

726
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,180
 is the family, husband and wife.

727
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,780
 So Genesis 2 is trying to answer the identity question.

728
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,740
 We are not to be alone.

729
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:49,260
 When we worship God, of course,

730
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,620
 we are first designed and created to be a priest,

731
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,600
 to offer sacrifices and to praise God together,

732
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,780
 but we cannot do it alone.

733
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,000
 It's not good for man to be alone.

734
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,860
 Have you realized we are different from your pets?

735
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:07,320
 Dog or cat, right?

736
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,260
 You realize that?

737
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:16,460
 When a dog looks into a mirror, they bark, right?

738
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,980
 They thought there's another dog in there, right?

739
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,300
 Do your dogs do that?

740
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,840
 Maybe your dogs are super dogs.

741
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:27,360
 But animals are different from humans, right?

742
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,980
 We have the sense of, how do you call it?

743
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,740
 Awareness of self-existence.

744
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:36,100
 I'm a being.

745
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,140
 I'm different from other people.

746
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,780
 Hey, I'm alone, right?

747
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,840
 Now, the first time I really realized that

748
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:47,840
 is that when we had Rachel, our daughter,

749
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,780
 and she was about probably one year old

750
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:55,820
 and started to walk, you know, trying to make troubles.

751
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:57,580
 And I realized that one morning,

752
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:02,580
 she went in front of the mirror in the living room,

753
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:07,380
 and she kind of looked into the mirror,

754
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:11,800
 and she touched her face, moved her fingers,

755
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,860
 touched the mirror, and she did not bark.

756
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:21,020
 She realized, hey, this is the reflection of me,

757
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:24,780
 and I am oneself, right?

758
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,500
 That sense of, you know, it gave me a sense of wonder.

759
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,860
 You know, God created us as someone

760
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:34,140
 who are aware of our own existence.

761
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,140
 And she realized that.

762
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,200
 A baby, a kid, realized that.

763
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,300
 Now, here's what it's trying to say.

764
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:49,940
 The man, the human person, was being alone.

765
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:53,660
 Exists by himself, right?

766
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:55,380
 And he aware of that, right?

767
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:58,660
 Now, in Genesis 1, if you realize,

768
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:02,260
 if you remember, this six day, seven day creation,

769
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:06,380
 there's a phrase that is repeated seven times.

770
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:09,580
 When God did something, when God set up something

771
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:14,220
 in the cosmos, he said, "It was good," right?

772
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,540
 "It was good."

773
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,140
 And seven times he said that.

774
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,100
 He appreciated his work, and this is operating,

775
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,780
 this is good, this is functional, right?

776
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,580
 And it was good, seven times.

777
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:29,420
 And the last time, the seventh time, it was very good.

778
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,320
 That's all in Genesis 1.

779
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:35,520
 In Genesis 2, here, this is the first time God says

780
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,140
 something is not right.

781
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,060
 Something is not good.

782
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:45,860
 And God sees a human person being alone and isolated

783
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:50,500
 and not connected to anyone, and that is not good.

784
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:52,380
 Right, that is not good.

785
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,460
 So if you're living your life, you know,

786
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:57,140
 you don't connect with anyone in a deeper way,

787
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,800
 God said, "This is not good,"

788
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,740
 because God designed human existence

789
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:05,700
 to be connected socially, relationally,

790
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,140
 with other people, right?

791
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:12,200
 I think, you know, we praise God for modern technology,

792
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,500
 right, the internet, right?

793
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,440
 Online learning, online streaming, and all the stuff.

794
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,920
 Those are really, really wonderful things, right?

795
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,760
 The phone that we have, right,

796
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:26,520
 used to send Apollo, the rocket, to the moon,

797
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,520
 many years ago, the phone that we have.

798
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,200
 It's so sophisticated.

799
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,120
 So we praise God for all these tools

800
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,480
 and all these technologies.

801
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,480
 However, if we are not careful, we lose a lot of things.

802
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,440
 We lose a lot of things.

803
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,960
 You remember years of pandemic,

804
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,440
 everything goes online, right?

805
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,960
 Right, is it a blessing or a curse?

806
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,280
 Well, both, right, both.

807
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,760
 Kind of like a blessing, right?

808
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:02,080
 You look at our YouTube channel, right?

809
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,120
 We got 16K subscribers, right?

810
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,120
 I mean, who, you know, it's just a blessing.

811
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,200
 We can share some resources

812
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,520
 with other people around the globe.

813
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:15,480
 But it's also a curse.

814
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,360
 It's also something, you know, not right.

815
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,960
 You know, when everything goes online,

816
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,160
 yes, in some way, it's a blessing.

817
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,560
 But, you know, if we're not careful,

818
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,660
 we lose a lot of things.

819
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:32,000
 And one of the things that we lose is human interaction,

820
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,060
 human interaction, like real-time interaction.

821
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,840
 You know, I still remember when first the,

822
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,960
 when COVID hit, when pandemic hits,

823
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,880
 all the seminars go online, you know?

824
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,680
 And I saw one of the ads, you know,

825
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,360
 one of the commercials, one of the advertisement

826
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:58,080
 that says a certain seminar is offering a fully online,

827
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:02,600
 100% online Master of Divinity degree, you know?

828
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,880
 You know what Master of Divinity is?

829
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,920
 You know, everyone's preparing himself to be,

830
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:10,920
 or herself to be a pastor, to be a minister.

831
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:14,320
 You have to at least complete the three and a half years

832
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:17,960
 or four years Master of Divinity curriculum, right?

833
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,840
 Now, why is it called Divinity?

834
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,760
 It doesn't mean who studied MDiv is more divine, you know?

835
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,100
 Again, it's an old word, right?

836
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,320
 Back in the 17th century,

837
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,120
 Westminster Confessional Faith,

838
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,680
 they called those who studied the Word of God,

839
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,240
 who studied the things about God, divine, right?

840
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,040
 Doesn't mean they're more sacred, right?

841
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,280
 But it's an old word, right?

842
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,960
 That's why the degree is called Master of Divinity, right?

843
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,360
 But you can do it totally online, right?

844
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:47,860
 Now, I totally oppose that.

845
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,520
 I oppose that.

846
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,240
 Now, you can study other degrees online,

847
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:57,160
 but MDiv is to prepare people to be pastors,

848
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,360
 and ministers are to relate to other people, right?

849
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,360
 We got a rough shoulder with other people, right?

850
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,560
 You understand what I'm saying?

851
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,560
 I mean, a pastor is not a YouTuber, right?

852
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,840
 We don't do things online mainly.

853
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,200
 We do things in real time, right?

854
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,600
 There's a Jewish psychotherapist.

855
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:23,040
 She's Jewish, Esther Perl.

856
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,980
 Esther Perl has done a lot of works on human relationship.

857
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:30,820
 And I watched one of her interviews,

858
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:33,840
 and she laments the modern age,

859
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,340
 the loss of real human interaction.

860
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:40,280
 We lost it, right?

861
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,540
 We're always with our phone, right?

862
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,360
 We don't talk to each other.

863
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,280
 We don't get our phone, right?

864
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:50,400
 Even we talk to each other, the one next to you,

865
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,400
 you text them, right?

866
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,640
 You go through some of the device, right?

867
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,960
 So we lost that real time human interaction,

868
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,520
 and she laments that.

869
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:01,400
 And she talks about the older generation,

870
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:04,740
 like me or people who are older than me.

871
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:08,940
 I still remember those days we were kids,

872
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:11,200
 and we have to interact with other kids.

873
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:14,960
 We're on the playground, we're on the street, right?

874
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,060
 The interaction is real time.

875
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:19,680
 It's spontaneous.

876
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,600
 It's instantaneous, right?

877
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,360
 You gotta respond to other people.

878
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:26,920
 You gotta learn how to rub shoulders

879
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,440
 with other people all the time.

880
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,280
 Real time, right?

881
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,980
 There's no device in my days, right?

882
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,920
 So we were on the playground.

883
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,960
 We beat up some kids, you know?

884
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,400
 Real time, you know?

885
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,400
 And the kids beat us up, right?

886
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
 And we got in a fight, right?

887
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,740
 We got into a fight.

888
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:42,120
 So that's how we learn.

889
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:45,160
 That's how we learn how to interact with one another.

890
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:47,280
 I'm sorry, my background is kind of rough, okay?

891
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:49,320
 I know you guys are very, very good, okay?

892
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,960
 You guys are very good, always at home,

893
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,440
 you know, always doing your homework,

894
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,720
 and you get 4.0 or whatever, you know?

895
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,720
 But you know what the problem is?

896
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,520
 It's that most of the social interaction

897
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,600
 are done online today.

898
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,760
 Now think about texting.

899
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,680
 Texting.

900
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,200
 You can always wait, right?

901
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,400
 You receive a text, and you kind of think through it,

902
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,620
 how to respond to it, right?

903
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:17,640
 On Zoom, you don't turn on your camera, right?

904
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,640
 Yeah, you're kind of absent, right?

905
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,240
 Are you there?

906
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,400
 Yes?

907
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,920
 No?

908
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,280
 Most of the time, you're not there, right?

909
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,720
 You disappear, right?

910
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,520
 And we lost that.

911
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:32,240
 You know, we just don't know.

912
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:34,480
 No, for people who are younger,

913
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,160
 especially much younger than you,

914
00:44:37,040 --> 00:44:39,240
 we just don't know how to interact with other people,

915
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,200
 how to relate and rub shoulders with other people.

916
00:44:42,200 --> 00:44:44,080
 The other day, I was having a hot pot

917
00:44:44,080 --> 00:44:46,120
 with some of the friends,

918
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:50,840
 and then I saw a few tables, you know,

919
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:52,720
 the other side of the restaurant.

920
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,160
 They were doing solo hot pot.

921
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,680
 Now to me, this is inherently wrong.

922
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:02,040
 I mean, I understand you have, you know,

923
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,020
 it's a very good deal, right?

924
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:06,320
 But you know, you're facing one pot,

925
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:08,080
 and then tons of food,

926
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,600
 and then you consume the whole thing.

927
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:12,560
 And it's all by yourself.

928
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,000
 You don't talk to anyone, right?

929
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,040
 I mean, hot pot, essentially, is a community thing, right?

930
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,320
 Don't you agree?

931
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,880
 Right, don't you agree?

932
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,280
 I mean, we lost that.

933
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:25,760
 You know, my wife works with Urban Christian Academy.

934
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,000
 It's an after-school program,

935
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,700
 and she always complained to me in the past two weeks

936
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,960
 is that the young students today,

937
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,600
 they don't have any social skills.

938
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:37,520
 They don't even talk to you.

939
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,080
 They don't say good morning.

940
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:42,080
 They don't say goodbye.

941
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,080
 They don't say thank you.

942
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,600
 And they just lost all of this, right?

943
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:50,280
 And that is not good, according to God's design.

944
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,280
 God designed us to not to be an island.

945
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:59,300
 We are created to be connected with one another.

946
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:02,300
 There's an innate desire in all of us,

947
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:03,960
 in every single one of us,

948
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,400
 to be related to other people, to a friendship.

949
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,800
 Part of a family, part of something bigger than myself,

950
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,340
 the community, the church, right?

951
00:46:15,340 --> 00:46:19,200
 We have to relearn that.

952
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,900
 You know, we have to relearn that.

953
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:26,000
 And worship, in the biblical sense, cannot be done alone.

954
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,960
 I don't know how great the experience is,

955
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:34,680
 all by yourself, watching a TV, watching a screen,

956
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:37,220
 and doing your worship or thinking about worship.

957
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,160
 That is not the ideal design.

958
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:46,120
 God wants worship to be done in a corporate way,

959
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:49,560
 you know, collective way.

960
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,440
 Sit with one another, seeing one another,

961
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,620
 and it's a corporate experience, to sing songs together.

962
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,800
 When you sing praises,

963
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,560
 do you realize that you can use your years?

964
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:01,800
 Right, you do have two years, right?

965
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:03,680
 And you listen to other people singing as well.

966
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,240
 Well, may not be singing so well,

967
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,440
 but the experience of worship is a corporate experience.

968
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:10,760
 We sing together.

969
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:14,560
 We don't come and listen to a song.

970
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,840
 We come and worship God together.

971
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:20,600
 That is the meaning of worship.

972
00:47:20,600 --> 00:47:23,760
 You're designed to be a worshiper.

973
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,440
 God created you, put you in a temple,

974
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:28,800
 to be like a priest,

975
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,600
 to serve him and to worship him.

976
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,260
 And we are being designed to do that,

977
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,640
 connected as a community, as a spiritual family,

978
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,140
 as a church, to offer our worship to God.

979
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:41,400
 Let us all pray together.

980
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:46,280
 Father, we come before you.

981
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:52,120
 We repent of our sin of selfishness,

982
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,540
 our self-centeredness.

983
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,860
 Often we think of ourself

984
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,720
 and the culture will have us believe

985
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:02,780
 that we can just do life alone.

986
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:05,880
 And we don't need one another.

987
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:06,800
 We don't need other people.

988
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,320
 We don't need our counselors.

989
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:11,000
 We don't need our spiritual mentors.

990
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,440
 We don't need our friends.

991
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,920
 We don't need our brothers and sisters.

992
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:14,760
 We just,

993
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:21,760
 we use the whole life into individualistic experience.

994
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:25,520
 And we confess our fault and our sin before you.

995
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,820
 And I pray that your word will awaken us

996
00:48:29,820 --> 00:48:32,740
 so that we will see that your original design,

997
00:48:32,740 --> 00:48:34,860
 the beautiful design for us to exist

998
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:39,320
 is to be connected with one another in the community,

999
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:42,820
 to support one another, to pray for one another,

1000
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,620
 to rub shoulders with one another.

1001
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,540
 And thank you for your word reminding us

1002
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:52,120
 our original purpose is to worship you.

1003
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:55,180
 Thank you for this highest honor

1004
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,280
 you granted to all of us,

1005
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,180
 that we can worship you in your presence.

1006
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:05,680
 And God, I pray that you will help us to recover

1007
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:10,360
 not only the sense of wonder and awe,

1008
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,040
 how great you are,

1009
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:17,380
 but we'll recover the sense of togetherness,

1010
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:21,180
 the sense of worshiping you, serving you together.

1011
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,260
 And thank you for the opportunity we can have today

1012
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,660
 to worship you together.

1013
00:49:25,660 --> 00:49:29,780
 So as a church, we ask that you will continue to renew us

1014
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:34,060
 as one body, as one community,

1015
00:49:34,060 --> 00:49:36,460
 to worship you and to present you offering

1016
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:39,040
 and sacrifices that will please you.

1017
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,060
 Thank you for the time that we have.

1018
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,460
 We ask that you will send us out

1019
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:50,460
 to continue to live for you in our Monday to Saturday,

1020
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,540
 challenge us and help us to follow you.

1021
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:56,860
 And help us to connect with one another,

1022
00:49:56,860 --> 00:50:01,140
 to bear witness to our great God,

1023
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,460
 our great and loving Savior, Jesus Christ.

1024
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,440
 In Christ name we pray.

1025
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:09,180
 Well, thank you very much for coming.

1026
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:11,260
 And next week we're gonna serve you,

1027
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,780
 our serve God together, all right?

1028
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:15,460
 We have refreshment, right?

1029
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:19,980
 Yeah, please stay around for a time of interaction, okay?
