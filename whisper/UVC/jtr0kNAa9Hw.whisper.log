[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360]   worship team for leading us. Really enjoyed worshipping with you all. This
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:09.160]   morning we're gonna be looking in the book of John chapter 15, a pretty
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.680]   familiar passage, and talking about fruit in our lives, spiritual fruit and fruit
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.280]   that lasts. This thing that Jesus introduces to us in this passage. This is
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.640]   something that all of us want and desire in our lives. We want to see spiritual
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.440]   fruit. We want to see fruit coming out of our lives and when I when I use that
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:35.120]   term fruit I mean the the evidences in our own selves that we're growing in
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.320]   Christ, we're becoming more like Jesus, that God is changing us and transforming
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.240]   us, but also the evidences in the lives of others when people that we are in
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.280]   contact with, people that we have relationship with, we want to see them
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.560]   coming to know Christ more or growing in Christ. So all of us desire fruit and we
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.200]   want fruit that lasts. There are a lot of examples of that and what I'm gonna
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.480]   start with this morning just to give us a neat example of fruit that lasts is in
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:10.720]   East Africa. The countries in East Africa there's about 267 million people in
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.960]   those countries and of those 267 million over a hundred and eighty eight million
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.840]   are professing Christians. That's over 70% of the population. In countries like
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.880]   Zambia, Uganda, and Kenya over 80% of the population identifies as Christian. In
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.680]   Rwanda it's over 90% of the population. By 2050 the ten countries with the
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.040]   largest Christian populations will include several African states including
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.760]   Ethiopia, Nigeria, Congo, and Uganda. So there's been this amazing growth of the
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:46.480]   church in that part of the world and global Christianity has begun to and
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.440]   will continue to be shaped by renewal and leadership from from that part of
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.880]   the world. But where does that come from? The roots of this renewal go back to a
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.920]   revival that took place in the 1930s and this was a powerful movement of God that
[00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.520]   began with a small group of believers who simply had a desire to walk closer
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.800]   with God and obey Jesus in every area of life. One of these believers was a man
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.600]   named Simeon Sibambi in Uganda. Simeon made a vow to the Lord, "I've committed
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:19.160]   myself to God the Father as from today I desire to be genuinely holy and never
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.560]   intentionally do anything unguided by Jesus." His ardent devotion to Jesus and
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.120]   his zeal for making disciples began to inspire others and his life was a main
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.560]   catalyst of the East African revival. Although he probably never foresaw the
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.640]   way that God would use his obedience or the impact his life would have on his
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.720]   nation and eventually the globe, God powerfully used him to bring about fruit
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.880]   and fruit that remains to this day, fruit that has lasted, fruit that will echo
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:51.400]   into the future. And that's a desire that all of us have, not necessarily that we
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.760]   will impact the world in the way that this man's life did, but all of us want
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.560]   to see fruit in our own lives and fruit that will last in our life and beyond
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.680]   our life into the lives of others and beyond the time that we're on earth
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.440]   hopefully. Hopefully things that God does in our lives will be things that will
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:15.320]   echo into someone else's life long after we are no longer here in the lives of
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.960]   children or in the that may come someday or in the lives of friends who impact
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.080]   someone else and they impact someone else. We want to see that. That's what
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.000]   Jesus is talking to us about in John chapter 15. So I'm gonna read this
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.880]   passage and then we're gonna look at some of the things that Jesus has to say
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:40.600]   to us. This is John 15. I'm gonna read the first 17 verses. "I am the true vine and
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:44.640]   my father is the vinedresser. Every branch in me that does not bear fruit he
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.320]   takes away and every branch that does bear fruit he prunes that it may bear
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:55.200]   more fruit. Already you are clean because of the word that I have spoken to you.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.800]   Abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.640]   abides in the vine. Neither can you unless you abide in me. I am the vine.
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:11.960]   You are the branches. Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.920]   fruit for apart from me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in me
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.920]   he is thrown away like a branch and withers and the branches are gathered
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.640]   thrown into the fire and burned. If you abide in me and my words abide in you,
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.360]   ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you. By this my father is
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.840]   glorified that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples. As the
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.000]   father has loved me so have I loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.060]   commandments you will abide in my love just as I have kept my father's
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.520]   commandments and abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you that my joy
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.320]   may be in you and that your joy may be full. This is my commandment that you
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.720]   love one another as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this that
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.560]   someone lay down his life for his friends. You are my friends if you do
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.480]   what I command you. No longer do I call you servants for the servant does not
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.280]   know what his master is doing but I have called you friends for all that I have
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.320]   heard from my father I have made known to you. You did not choose me but I
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:18.080]   chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit and that your
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.960]   fruit should abide so that whatever you ask the father in my name he may give it
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.120]   to you. These things I command you so that you will love one another. As we
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.160]   think about this passage I just want to remind us of what's going on here at the
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:40.320]   context of this teaching that Jesus gives. This is after the upper room, after
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.120]   the the last Passover that Jesus shares with the disciples. So this is right in
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.600]   the last few days of Jesus's life, in the last hours of Jesus's life really. And so
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.960]   he is teaching some of the most significant things that he's going to
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:01.600]   teach the disciples. And he begins to describe what life is like to follow him
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.800]   in these chapters in the book of John. Now surely the disciples heads are
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.600]   already kind of spinning. They've seen so much that was hard for them to take in,
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:14.200]   so much that they're still trying to understand. In John 13 Jesus washes their
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.440]   feet. They have the Last Supper together. He warns them about the betrayal. Then
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.960]   Judas leaves and Jesus gives them the new commandment of love. In John 14 is
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.640]   where he talks about how he is the way, the truth, and the life. That there's no
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:32.560]   way to God, to heaven, to enlightenment, to relationship with God except through
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:39.480]   Christ. And then in John 14 as well he gives the promise of the Holy Spirit. And
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:45.840]   now he gives them this really beautiful word picture of life in Christ and what
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.960]   it looks like. It's profoundly significant and full of truth for the
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.040]   disciples and for us. And so Jesus recalls, this is actually an Old
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.440]   Testament metaphor of the vine. The Old Testament talks in multiple places about
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.600]   the people of God, Israel, being this fruitful vine. It's in Psalm 80 verse 8
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:11.480]   in Isaiah chapter 5 and Jeremiah 2. It talks about the people of God being this
[00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:18.000]   vine that bear fruit to glorify God. And Jesus is now saying to the disciples, "Hey
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.560]   you know this story. You're familiar with this metaphor. I'm actually the vine. I'm
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:27.480]   the one who is going to produce fruit and I'm gonna do it through you, through
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:35.520]   your lives. As you abide in me, I want to produce salvation, blessing, joy, peace. I
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:41.920]   want this fruit to come out of your lives." And that's what Jesus is speaking
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:47.840]   to them and speaking to us. The first thing I want us to see here is that if
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.960]   we want to experience fruitfulness and fruit that lasts as followers of Jesus,
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:08:02.760]   the only way to see that is to remain in Jesus. This word for abide is in this
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:09.080]   passage. Jesus says it over and over again. It means to stay in a given place
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:14.720]   or in a certain relationship. It means to continue. It means to dwell. It means to
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:21.520]   endure. It means to be present. It means to remain or to stand in a place. And so
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:28.840]   when Jesus is saying, "Abide in me," he's saying, "Remain connected to me. Remain in
[00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   relationship with me. Continue in relationship. Stand in this relationship.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:43.880]   Be in Christ." And he's telling us to remain in his words, to follow his
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:47.960]   commandments. He says in verse 10, "If you keep my commandments, you'll abide in my
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:51.480]   love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love."
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.600]   Saying this is a part of the abiding is to keep my commandments. What does that
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.320]   mean? Well, "keep my commandments" is a church phrase that really just means to
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.920]   do what Jesus said, to live out the things that he talked about and that he
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.680]   instructed the disciples in and that he instructs us in to do it, to live it out.
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:14.560]   That's what it means to keep his commandments. And so that means that we're
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.000]   remaining in his word, remaining in his truth. Again, what does that mean?
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:27.280]   There's nothing unusual about it. It just means that we continue to put in our mind
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:31.960]   and in our hearts the words of Christ. As we read scripture, as we look at what God
[00:09:31.960 --> 00:09:36.240]   says, as we do this every week and we come and gather together as his people
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:41.600]   and we talk about his word, that's a part of remaining in his word. It's a part of
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:46.680]   abiding in his truth. That's a part of abiding in Christ. It's continuing to
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:51.780]   stay connected to what he said and what he taught us and how he has told us to
[00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:58.760]   live and how we obey that. It means that we remain vigilant against sin. The Bible
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:03.120]   has all kinds of things to say, especially later in the New Testament
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:09.000]   and all the epistles, about behaviors that are wrong in God's sight and they're
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.680]   also harmful and self-destructive to us. And it warns us about those things. It
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:19.120]   says don't do these things. Follow after God. Stay free from sin. Stay
[00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:23.520]   vigilant against these behaviors and these desires in your own heart,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.240]   whether it's pride or fear or anger or lust or desire for power or desire for
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:35.000]   control or all of these different things. We have to remain vigilant against those
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.760]   things. That's a part of remaining in Christ, a part of keeping his
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.280]   commandments. A part of abiding in Christ and remaining in Christ means to remain
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:46.880]   in his body. And we know the New Testament talks about that a lot more.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:52.080]   When it talks about this another word picture of the body of Christ, that it's
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:56.640]   like a human body and that if we're going to be a healthy part of it, we have
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.360]   to be in it and be connected. If we get disconnected, then we start to experience
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:07.760]   unhealth and disease and even death. And Jesus talks about that in verse 6. If he
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:11.280]   says, "If anyone does not abide in me, he's thrown away like a branch and
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:15.080]   withers and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned." If a
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:21.360]   branch gets disconnected from the trunk that is giving it resources to live, then
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.840]   it's gonna wither. It's gonna die. We all know that. If you've ever cut a branch
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:29.760]   off of a tree or seen one that gets blown off in a storm, the leaves don't
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:34.120]   stay green very long. They start to wither quickly. And so part of remaining
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:38.960]   in Jesus means we remain connected to his body. We continue to do this. We
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:44.400]   continue to gather together and worship and look at his words together and share
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.840]   the truth with one another. And that's a part of what keeps spiritual life going
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:56.000]   in us and keeps spiritual fruit coming out of us. And so these things are all
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.240]   kind of the the basics of our faith to remain in connection with Jesus. We need
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:04.640]   to remain in his word. We need to remain connected to him in prayer, communicating
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:08.480]   our heart to him. We need to remain connected in worship and in the life of
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:13.080]   his people and community of the church. Those are the basic things, but if we're
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:17.520]   not doing them, there's not going to be fruit. There's not going to be fruit that
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.840]   lasts. And sometimes we look at our lives and we say, "Well, I don't see the fruit I
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:25.720]   want to see. I've been asking God for some stuff and I want to see more and
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:30.840]   I'm just not seeing it." And that's a great place to start. It may be basic, but
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.440]   it's a great place to start is to ask ourselves, "Okay, well am I connected to
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.560]   Jesus right now? Maybe the reason I'm not seeing fruit is I'm just not really
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.220]   connected to God. I've just let my relationship with him grow cold and I'm
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:45.960]   not spending time in his word. I'm not spending time in worship or in prayer.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.560]   I'm not spending time with his people." And as basic as that is, a lot of times
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:58.280]   that's right where the issue is. We're just disconnected. The next thing we see
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:03.800]   here is that abiding, which is the only way to fruit that lasts, is a
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:10.280]   relationship of trust. In verses 4 and 5, it says, "Abide in me and I in you as the
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.440]   branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine. Neither can
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:18.480]   you unless you abide in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. Whoever abides in
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.220]   me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit. For apart from me you can do
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.040]   nothing." Those verses make it clear that the abiding thing is not us trying
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.000]   harder and working more for God because we can't do anything anyway. Jesus makes
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:37.360]   it really clear. The abiding is us trusting him to do the work that only he
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:43.160]   can do. In Isaiah chapter 5, the first seven verses God is describing his
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.760]   relationship to Israel and he's using the metaphor of Israel as the fruitful
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.600]   vine and it talks about the things that God does in order for his people to be
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.000]   fruitful. It talks about that God prepares the land, God removes the stones,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.600]   God builds a hedge around the vineyard to keep out wild animals who would
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.120]   destroy the fruit, God builds a watchtower with the vineyard to keep the
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:13.480]   enemy away, and God prunes and God does the harvest. If you haven't ever read
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:19.920]   that passage, it's a great passage just to look at in Isaiah 5. And it reminds us
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:25.600]   that all the work is work that God does. We don't prepare the land, we don't
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:31.000]   remove the stones or build the hedge, we don't keep the enemy away, we don't keep
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:36.500]   wild animals away, and yet in our life a lot of times we feel like we need to do
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.800]   it. The fruit is gonna come because we need to work harder, we need to be
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.840]   smarter, figure more things out, and do more. And that's not what Jesus is
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:49.320]   calling us to here. He's saying apart from me you can do nothing. You have to trust
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:55.040]   and let God do the work that only God can do. Both to make us more like Christ
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:00.400]   but also to allow us to be fruitful in someone else's life. Only God can do the
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:05.880]   work of drawing people and changing hearts. Only God can bring healing,
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.040]   whether that's physical healing or what we've probably experienced, all of us
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.680]   have experienced even more emotional healing, things that have harmed us and
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.960]   things that are really keeping us from going where God wants us to go, and
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:23.200]   things that are causing self-destructive behavior in our life. Only God can bring
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:29.480]   that healing. And so abiding means to trust in God to do the work of the
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.060]   vinedresser. It means to trust in Jesus as the source of every need in our life.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:38.800]   It means to trust in Jesus as the source of fruitfulness. Instead of trying to
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:42.920]   find other things to get connected to, that's such a huge temptation for us in
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:47.560]   life. We say I want to see more happening in my heart or my life or in someone
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:52.040]   else's life, so let me find some other things to connect to that I think will
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:57.240]   fill me up and will bring some fruit out of my life and will really, you know, get
[00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:01.900]   me going. I'm gonna connect to something else. And the sad thing is as we do that
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:06.320]   in life, we find that every other thing that we connect to ends up being
[00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:10.240]   unsatisfying and unfulfilling. It might give us a short-term rush and we think
[00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.880]   this is it, this is the new thing and I'm so happy and I feel great, but over time
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.420]   we find that we're unsatisfied and unfulfilled and all those other things.
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.760]   Christ is the only connection that's really gonna give us life and it's the
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:29.200]   only thing that's gonna give us fruitfulness. And the other beautiful
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:37.480]   thing about abiding is that in that trust we experience rest, right? Verses
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:42.400]   4 and 5, Jesus is real clear that he does the work. We, apart from him, we do nothing.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:49.900]   Isn't that a peaceful thought to have? It's not peaceful for our flesh because
[00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.040]   like the proud part of us, the selfish part of us wants to be like, no, I should
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.540]   do something because I'm really talented, Jesus. Like you need me on
[00:16:57.540 --> 00:17:02.760]   your team, look at how good I am at all this stuff. But when we're in that mode
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:08.240]   and we're trying to work it out ourselves, we're gonna pretty quickly
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:14.700]   reach a point of complete discouragement, burnout, exhaustion because we can't do
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:22.160]   it ourselves. No matter how talented and smart and gifted you are, you're not
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:28.060]   gonna be able to live out the identity of a disciple of Jesus without Jesus
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:33.580]   living through you. You just can't. And so if you're trying to do that, you're gonna
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:38.820]   you're gonna be exhausted. And abiding gives us rest. It allows us to say, I
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:46.040]   can't, but he can and I'm trusting in him. I'm resting in his work in my life and
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:52.740]   that's a beautiful place to be. Another thing we see here, a difficult part of
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:59.260]   this passage but profound, is that pruning is essential for fruit that
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:05.840]   lasts. This word in the original language in verse 2 means to cleanse of impurity
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:14.300]   or filth or dirt and it means to prune trees and vines from useless shoots.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.700]   Anything that's gonna be fruitful, but especially a grapevine, requires pruning
[00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:23.060]   to get to maximum fruitfulness. Grapevines have root suckers that grow
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:25.940]   up off the roots and there are these branches that grow out of the roots
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:31.220]   that aren't gonna be fruitful at all, but they pull a lot of energy and resources
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.460]   out of the main trunk of the plant. So those have to be pruned off for the
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:40.740]   plant to be fruitful. Also, most grapes produce fruit on shoots growing
[00:18:40.740 --> 00:18:45.980]   off of one-year-old canes or branches. If you have too many old canes because you
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:52.740]   haven't pruned, you'll get very few grapes because they're all too old. But
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.540]   if you prune everything back completely every year, again, you'll get very few
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:19:00.820]   grapes. You'll get a lot of new growth, but very few grapes. So the pruning has
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:09.100]   to be consistent and strategic to get fruitfulness, to maximize fruitfulness. We
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:14.580]   can't do that ourselves. Only God can do that. And God looks at our life and he
[00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:19.180]   says, "Hey, I want to use you and I want to do something with you, but there's some
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:23.740]   stuff that we got to cut away. There's some root suckers that, they have some
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:28.300]   big green leaves, but they're just pulling resources out of your heart and
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.660]   they're not bringing any fruit. And you're growing in the wrong direction.
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:37.820]   You're getting twisted. Vines also, vine dressers also use trellises and
[00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:42.100]   wires to grow the vine so that it'll be fruitful and also so that it will be,
[00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:47.100]   they'll be able to harvest it. And God has to do that in our lives. He has to say,
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:51.180]   "Okay, there's some growth over here that it's really headed in the wrong direction
[00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.740]   and I'm gonna have to prune that back." That's not painful. I mean, that is
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:20:02.140]   painful. Sorry, that's not fun. It's painful, but it's so essential for
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:07.620]   fruitfulness, especially fruit that lasts. And so we have to learn as followers of
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:13.220]   Jesus to embrace that and to let God prune away some of that unhealthy growth.
[00:20:13.220 --> 00:20:17.100]   And when we're in those seasons of pruning and we feel that, we feel like,
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:21.860]   "God, I feel like you're pruning me and you're stripping away some stuff that
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:29.620]   it's hard for me to let go of and I don't see fruit. It doesn't feel good
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:36.460]   right now. What do we do in that season?" We do what Jesus said. We remain. We
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:42.820]   continue to dwell with Him and we continue to abide because that pruning
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:47.380]   is essential if we're going to become fruitful. If God's going to get us to the
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.540]   place where He can do the things that He wants to do in our life, we have to
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:59.340]   continue to remain in Him, remain in His Word, remain in obedience, remain in His
[00:20:59.340 --> 00:21:05.140]   body, remain connected. Otherwise, the pruning begins. We become
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:08.620]   diseased and pretty soon we're disconnected and then we're being
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:14.980]   gathered for the fire. We're not useful to God. Another thing about
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:20.060]   fruit and grapevines I think is really interesting is that maturity is
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:28.540]   essential for fruit that lasts. When you think about any natural plant, what brings
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:35.380]   maturity? Well, time first and foremost, right? It takes some time but it also
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:42.100]   takes going through seasons of life. Through some winter seasons, through some
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:48.460]   flood seasons, through some times of drought and feeling very dry, through
[00:21:48.460 --> 00:21:53.140]   seasons of fire where it seems like everything around you is burning up and
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:22:01.620]   and you're wondering what's happening, through seasons of having attacks, right?
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.060]   The grapevines is one of the reasons the vine dresser would build the hedge
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.020]   because the grapevines have wild animals that come in and try to claw at the
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:15.340]   fruit and try to destroy the vine. There's thieves that come in and want to
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:20.380]   to steal the fruit before the vine dresser can get to it. Those are all a
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:26.100]   part of the seasons of life and they're a part of maturity. And if we're gonna
[00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:29.740]   get to fruitfulness and fruit that lasts, we're gonna have to go through some
[00:22:29.740 --> 00:22:34.940]   different seasons. We're gonna have to go through some of those seasons and maybe
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:39.100]   we're experiencing that right now. Maybe you're in a place of experiencing drought
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.700]   where you just feel spiritually dry and you feel like there's not much water in
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:47.780]   your life. Or maybe you're in a season of a fire where you feel like, man, things
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.580]   are burning up, things are falling apart. Like, I don't know what's
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:55.700]   happening in my life right now. God, where are you? Maybe you're experiencing a
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:23:00.380]   season of the wild animals where it feels like someone else is clawing at
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:06.500]   you trying to destroy the fruit or the good things that God has done in your
[00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:13.580]   heart. Those seasons are challenging, they're difficult, but they're a part of
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:19.340]   the process of maturity and they're the only way to grow in Christ and to
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:24.780]   experience fruitfulness. And so again, what do we do during those seasons? If
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:29.340]   you are in a season of drought or flood where you feel overwhelmed and it's just
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:35.820]   like the water's coming up over your head or fire, what do you do? You remain.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.580]   You abide. You stay connected to Christ. You say, you know what, I don't see the
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.300]   fruit right now. I'm not seeing what I want in my life. I'm not seeing it in the
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:49.500]   lives of people around me. You know, God's put me in some place where I
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:53.980]   work or where I go to school or in my family and I know I'm supposed to
[00:23:53.980 --> 00:23:57.100]   minister here and I'm trying to serve others. I'm trying to love people and I
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.340]   don't see any fruit and it just seems like the world's going crazy and
[00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:07.740]   everything's on fire. What do you do? You remain. You abide. You continue to remain
[00:24:07.740 --> 00:24:12.620]   in Christ, remain true to his word and be obedient to him, remain connected to his
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:17.220]   body and you continue to live out the truth that he's told you to live out. You
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:23.780]   continue to be obedient to him. That's what you do in those seasons. You
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.900]   continue to hold on to him, continue to trust that he can bring the fruit and he
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.700]   will bring the fruit and continue to rest and experience his peace. You're not
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:41.500]   responsible for the fruit. He is. And the other part of maturity is that there's
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:46.980]   time that has to take place before the fruit that last comes and this is
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:51.420]   important for us to think about. It's obvious but it's still important for us
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:25:00.340]   because we live in a modern industrial world, right? Jesus uses an illustration
[00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:06.620]   that involves organic time and that's intentional, okay? Most of us don't live
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:12.460]   on organic time. We live on machine time. We're used to machine processes that
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:17.820]   happen very quickly. We're used to things that can be produced very quickly. We're
[00:25:17.820 --> 00:25:24.820]   used to microwaves and drive-thrus and car assembly lines that produce a
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:31.660]   thousand cars in a month, right? We're used to machine processes. Jesus,
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:37.820]   apparently discipleship and spiritual fruit is not a machine process and
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:45.020]   that's the whole reason Jesus uses this very organic illustration to say, "Hey,
[00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:51.460]   growth and fruit, it's gonna take some time." It doesn't matter what you're
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:58.300]   planting. If you're planting apples or pears or tomatoes or grapes or corn,
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:04.420]   there is no fruit immediately after planting. If you've ever gardened and you
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.740]   plant some tomatoes in your backyard, we do a lot of gardening in our
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:12.100]   neighborhood and at our house. We love it. My wife and I do a lot of that with the
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.980]   kids. We had our, right now our tomatoes are doing fantastic, our peppers and we
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:23.540]   have a lot of squash, but we planted all that stuff, most of it way before we
[00:26:23.540 --> 00:26:29.220]   could even take it outside. So back in February, March, because in Chicago if you
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:34.460]   want to have fruit before, you know, the first freeze in September, October, the
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.620]   plants need to be mature when you put them in the ground the first week of
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:42.220]   June. So they got planted a long time ago. You put seeds in the ground, there's no
[00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:47.700]   fruit. There's no fruit for days. There's no fruit for weeks. And some trees, like
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:51.860]   fruit trees, there's no fruit for years. Sometimes you have to wait five years
[00:26:51.860 --> 00:26:58.580]   with certain fruit trees before you get the first fruit. This is an organic
[00:26:58.580 --> 00:27:04.620]   process. Here's something a little bit scary for us to think about. Fake fruit
[00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:10.060]   can be produced immediately. If you want to make apples and tomatoes out of
[00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:15.940]   plastic, you can make them right away, right? But what's the thing about fake
[00:27:15.940 --> 00:27:23.300]   fruit? There's no nourishment. It doesn't have what real fruit has. It might look
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.860]   good, especially if it's sitting on the other side of the room. You might think,
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:30.900]   "Wow, that apple looks really good." If you ever tried to eat a wax apple or a
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:35.700]   plastic grape, you know what I'm talking about. My mom had plastic grapes
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:39.100]   somewhere in our house when I was little and I did put them in my mouth a few
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:43.060]   times because they looked really good. But when you chew on them, it's just
[00:27:43.060 --> 00:27:48.780]   plastic, right? It looks good, but it doesn't have the taste and the texture.
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:52.460]   It doesn't have the vitamins and minerals. It doesn't have the nourishment.
[00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:58.260]   It's fake. And we're tempted to do that in our walk with God so much. We're
[00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:03.460]   tempted to say, "Man, real fruit takes a long time in my life. It takes a long time
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:07.300]   in discipling someone else to see real fruit." So wouldn't it be better just to
[00:28:07.300 --> 00:28:10.740]   do fake fruit? Like we could just speed the process up and really kind of juice
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:16.780]   this up and make it happen real quick. But the problem is fake fruit doesn't
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:20.420]   have what you're really looking for. It doesn't have that texture and taste. It
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:27.140]   doesn't have that, the nourishment. It's huge for me and my wife. As parents, we
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:30.900]   talk about this all the time. Something that we deal with in parenting all the
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:36.700]   time. We're tempted to just try to modify our kids behavior and make them do what
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:41.380]   we think is right. That's fake fruit. There's nothing wrong with working on
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:44.940]   their behavior, but we want their hearts to be changed, not just their behavior,
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:49.660]   right? Because if it's just their behavior, that may look okay for a while,
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:53.140]   but if their heart hasn't been changed, eventually they'll say, "I'm not
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:57.460]   interested in this behavior anymore," right? So we want their heart to be
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.620]   changed, and that's how God is working in our lives. He's not just interested in
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:05.020]   something superficial that looks good that happens overnight where he says,
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:10.140]   "Okay, you know, you used to dress this way. Now dress that way. All right, now you're
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.380]   done." That's not what God's doing. God is doing something transformative in our
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.940]   hearts. Is it gonna change our behavior? Yes. Should our behavior look different
[00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:24.180]   than the people around us who don't know Christ? Yes. But here's the key.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:29.660]   God's work transforms us from the inside out. Our behavior changed because our
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:33.900]   heart is different, and if we're just modifying our behavior, that's from the
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.980]   outside in, we can try to do better all we want, but if our heart's not different,
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:43.300]   we're just gonna keep going back to the same stuff. And the process of spiritual
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:48.140]   fruit is a transformative inside-out process. God says, "Is your behavior gonna
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:51.020]   be different? Yes, but it's gonna be different because your heart's different,
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:58.580]   your desires are different. You are a new person, and that takes time." And so if you
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.660]   are in a season of waiting right now where you say, "I don't see the
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:08.420]   fruit in my own life. I'm trying to obey, but I still have these struggles. I still
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:13.820]   have, you know, temptations that I'm like, 'Why is this still here, God?'" Or maybe
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.940]   in someone else's life, someone that you love and you're serving, you're trying to
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:21.540]   help them grow in Christ, and you say, "Man, I've been walking with this person for a
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:27.180]   couple of years now, or even longer, and I'm just not seeing the fruit." Understand
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:33.940]   that God is at work in an organic process. It's gonna take some time. And
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:38.140]   one of the things that we can't bypass, even in the world that we live in with
[00:30:38.140 --> 00:30:44.860]   all of our technology, we can't produce our food on machine time. We just can't.
[00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:53.380]   As much as we juice the process of crops and fruit and whatever else we grow, we
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:57.740]   can only do it so much before it becomes diseased and unhealthy, and then we can't
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:31:05.380]   eat it. And that's what spiritual fruit is. You can't--there are some ways
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:09.700]   that you can connect with God, yes, but you can't really shortcut that process.
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:14.180]   There's no real, like, spiritual steroids that just make you bulk
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:19.860]   up overnight. That's not a thing. You've got to spend the time with God, and God's
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.620]   got to work in your life. And that's the same is true when you're walking with
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:29.100]   other people. You've got to give God time to work in their life. So I want to
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:33.060]   encourage us with that. I think as we follow Jesus, we're always tempted to
[00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:37.260]   compare ourselves to others. We're always tempted to feel like we just need to try
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:42.340]   harder. We're always tempted to say, "Well, this person seems to be, you know, going
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.820]   well in their life, or they're growing, and like, why can't I experience that?" Or
[00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:51.380]   we're always tempted to ask ourselves, "Oh, you know, I should--this should be
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:55.980]   faster. I should be experiencing more of God's work in my life. This should
[00:31:55.980 --> 00:32:00.700]   happen a lot quicker. I'm trying to love this person over here, and nothing's
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:05.860]   going on. Why not? What's the problem?" We want to live on machine time. We want to
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:10.380]   produce false fruit. We want to say, "God, I'm tired of waiting for you to work, so
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.980]   maybe if I just do some stuff, it'll speed up, and we'll all feel better about
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:20.980]   it." I do that all the time, all these things. That's why I'm bringing them up,
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:26.980]   because they're very familiar to me. And yet, Jesus is calling me to remain, to
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:34.020]   abide, saying, "Don't try to make shortcuts. Don't try to juice the process. Just
[00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:38.540]   remain. Just abide. If you're in a season of drought, season of fire, season of
[00:32:38.540 --> 00:32:45.500]   flood, keep waiting. If you're in a season of just not much going on, continue to
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.100]   abide. If you're even--if you're in a season of suffering or hurt, or where
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:55.460]   you're confused in some way, continue to abide. Remain connected to Jesus. If
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.940]   you're in a season of pruning, where God's taking some stuff out of your life,
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:05.700]   continue to abide. Be connected to Him. Be connected to His people. And as we do
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:13.060]   that, God is at work, and He's bringing spiritual life into us, and it is going
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:19.620]   to express itself in fruit. It will. But it takes time, and it takes remaining in
[00:33:19.620 --> 00:33:25.100]   Christ. It takes abiding. It takes standing in Him and continuing to be
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:35.660]   connected to Him. Let's pray. God, I just thank you for the beauty of your words,
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:43.900]   and of this word picture for us that helps us see that the spiritual fruit in
[00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:48.460]   our lives is not necessarily going to come in the way that we want it to. And
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:54.020]   God, help us to trust you. Help us to abide. Help us to remain, to continue to
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:59.980]   be connected to you, and obedient, and live out your commands, and stay
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.060]   vigilant against sin, to continue to follow you, even when it's hard, even when
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:10.140]   we're experiencing suffering, or pruning, or drought, or fire, or flood. Help us to
[00:34:10.140 --> 00:34:15.900]   wait in the times when we're just waiting for maturity, or for growth, or
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:21.620]   for something to be strengthened. God, help us to remain in you, and as we do
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:25.660]   that, help us to find rest. Help us to really trust you to do the work that
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:31.260]   only you can do, to take the pressure off of ourselves, and to just really rest in
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:36.340]   you, and in your work in our lives. And God, I pray in my life, and in the lives of
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:41.740]   each one of us in this room, that you would get glory, and you would get fruit.
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:47.220]   That fruit would come out of our lives that glorifies you, and that impacts the
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:53.420]   world around us, our family, our friends, our community, our neighborhoods, for the
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:57.620]   sake of your name, and for your glory, and for the love that you have for those
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:01.820]   people who surround us, God. I pray that that fruit would be abundant in our lives.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:05.660]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:14.620]   Okay, thank you Sam for teaching us and encouraging us from the Word of God
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:24.380]   today. And yeah, as we have learned from John 15, my prayer for us as a church, and
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:29.660]   for all of us, is that we can, yeah, learn to abide deeply in Christ, especially at
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:34.500]   times when there are so many voices, ideologies, grabbing, fighting for our
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:40.180]   attention. So, thank you for the reminder again, Sam. And if you're a regular at UV,
[00:35:40.180 --> 00:35:45.300]   you know the drill after the service, but if you are new here, first, welcome to UV,
[00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:50.180]   and second, usually after the service, we'll have some refreshment at the cafe
[00:35:50.180 --> 00:35:53.700]   area, which is just to my right. So, we would like to encourage you to stay back,
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:57.460]   enjoy some food, and also give us an opportunity to get to know you as well.
[00:35:57.460 --> 00:36:01.860]   So, go in peace, UV, your love.
