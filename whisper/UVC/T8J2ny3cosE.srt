1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Good morning, UB. I hope you guys are extra awake today with the additional hour of sleep

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 yesterday night. So, some of you may know, I recently just moved back into the city to

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 report, and this is actually the first time that I moved into pretty much like a fully

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 unfurnished apartment. And one of the things, one of the lists that I make for my apartment

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,000
 is called things that would be nice to have but not necessarily needed. And under the

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
 list are things like a new desk chair, an external monitor for my laptop, a couch, and

7
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 a couple of area rugs because my entire floor is like pretty much like bathroom tile. And

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 it gets really cold, especially heading into the fall and the winter as well. And so, if

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
 you haven't guessed it yet, that list is pretty much some of the things that I think would,

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 in some ways, increase the quality of my life a little better as I live in this apartment,

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,000
 right? So, most of us are constantly finding different ways that we think can upgrade the

12
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 quality of our life, whether it is getting the newest iPhone, getting the latest technology,

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,000
 or buying a new car, or doing some home projects to renovate your house, make it a little better

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 to live in, or even to smaller things like buying a new rice cooker that cooks better

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 rice. So, this is because deep down in us, there is always a deep desire to live a good,

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 a quality, and a meaningful life, right? So, in fact, there's actually an entire field

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 of study that is being dedicated to this goal of helping people live a good life. And that

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 field is called positive psychology. And a lot of universities actually in the US now,

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 they actually started offering this class in the field of positive psychology as well.

20
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 So, this is according to University of Pennsylvania for the Center of Positive Psychology. This

21
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 is how they define what positive psychology is. So, positive psychology is the scientific

22
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 study of factors that enable individuals and communities to thrive. The field is founded

23
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 on the belief that people want to live meaningful and fulfilling lives, to cultivate what is

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 best within themselves, and to enhance your experience of love, work, and play. And this

25
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 quest of searching for the good life is not just a new and recent endeavor. But, in fact,

26
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 all throughout history, if we take a look at the ancient Greek and the Rome, we actually

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
 find many different philosophical schools that actually try to take on this quest of

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 what is a good life. So, for example, for the Epicureans, a good life is one that is

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 in pursuit of pleasure and the absence of pain. For Aristotle, a good life is a pursuit

30
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 of virtues and development of good personal character. And for Stoics, it is living in

31
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 harmony with the nature and with the cosmos, with the world around us. So, as we can see,

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 the questions of what must we do to experience a good life or what is a good life, this is

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 actually an age-old question that different people throughout different generations have

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 tried to give an account for. But now I want to turn the questions to all of you here.

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 Who are you putting your trust in that you think will lead to a true and blessed life?

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 And if it is not a who, what are you putting your hope in that you think will lead you

37
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 to happiness in this life? So, let's pray together before we dive into our passage today.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 Heavenly Father, thank you for your new mercies every morning, and we thank you that we are

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 able to come together as a body of Christ this morning to worship you. And I just ask

40
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,000
 that during this time, your Spirit will be with us as we open up your Word and receive

41
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,000
 from what you have to say for us this morning. I also just ask that your Spirit will be with

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 me as I speak from your Word. I just ask that your name will be glorified through our worship

43
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 this morning. I pray this in your Son's name, Amen.

44
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Okay, so I'm going to do things a little differently this morning. So, if you have your Bible,

45
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 whether it is on your phone or a physical Bible, I want to welcome you to pull out the

46
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
 passage together. So, we'll be looking at Matthew 5, verse 17 to 20 this morning. So,

47
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 if you have your Bible, I would encourage you to pull it out, and we're going to go

48
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 through it together as well. So, I'm going to be reading from the NIV version. So, Matthew

49
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 5, verse 17. "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth

51
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear

52
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 from the law until everything is accomplished. Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the

53
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:25,000
 least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom

54
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." So, this

57
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 is the word of God. So, when I preached here last time, back in June, I began a series

58
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. And our passage today is actually situated right at the main

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 body of this Sermon on the Mount. So, again, I want to just give a quick review of the

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 structure of this Sermon on the Mount as a whole. So, this Sermon on the Mount begins

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 on Matthew 5 and it ends on Matthew 7. And last time, we looked at the introductory narrative

62
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 framework, pretty much setting up the scenes for where this entire teaching is happening.

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 We saw that Jesus went up on the mountainside and then he began to teach his disciples.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 But we also see that there's some crowd present among them as well. And then we look

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 at the introduction as well last time, basically the Beatitudes and also the call to be the

66
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 salt and the light to the world around us. And so, in my last sermon, I also highlight

67
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 that this Sermon on the Mount as a whole, it serves as the guiding principle on how

68
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 we ought to live our life in the kingdom of heaven. This is not a set of impossible rules

69
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 that we cannot, like we can never follow, but this is actually an invitation from Jesus

70
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 to a way of living that will lead to true blessing and flourishing. And we also look

71
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:06,000
 at how Jesus defined what a true and blessed life is through the Beatitudes. And according

72
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 to Jesus, a true and blessed life is a counterculture one. It is one that is being poor in spirit,

73
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 mourning for sins and the brokenness around us. It is one that is being identified as

74
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 humble and meek and so on. So, today we're going to look at how we can experience this

75
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,000
 truly blessed life through our passage today. And this is the big idea that I will be focusing

76
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 on today. Because the truly blessed life can only be experienced through Jesus, we need

77
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 to follow him and live in conformity with him. Again, because the truly blessed life

78
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 can only be experienced through Jesus, we need to follow him and live in conformity

79
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 with him. So, why the truly blessed life can only be experienced through Jesus alone but

80
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 not through other worldly things? In some ways, this is sort of like an exclusive claim,

81
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 right? By saying that Jesus is the only way that we can experience this kind of life.

82
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So, for my sermon today, I'm going to give you two reasons on why the truly blessed life

83
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 can only be experienced through Jesus, and then I'm going to give us an implication

84
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 of what it means for us as followers of Christ. So, I hope you follow along. I'm going to

85
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 give you two reasons and one implication. So, reason number one on why the truly blessed

86
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 life can only be experienced through Jesus is because he is the only one that can fulfill

87
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 the righteous requirement of God on our behalf. So, let's look with me again in verse 17.

88
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 So, Jesus began this section by saying, "Do not think that I've come to abolish the law

89
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 or the prophets." So, what is the law or the prophets? The law represents God's standard

90
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 of righteousness and holiness. Or, in other words, it basically refers to what it means

91
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 to live rightly before God. And the prophets, on the other hand, they help point to the

92
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 heart of the law, that it is not just about an outward appearance of obedience to this

93
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,000
 law, but more importantly, it is about the attitude of one's heart. And collectively,

94
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 the laws and the prophets, they refer to the Old Testament scripture in this entirety.

95
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 And by declaring that he has not come to abolish the law and the prophets, Jesus sets the tone

96
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 right away at the beginning of his ministry by clearing away all the potential accusations

97
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 and misunderstanding that people might have about Jesus, that he is somewhat anti-law

98
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 or anti-the Old Testament. And then Jesus further clarifies that, "I have not come to

99
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 abolish them, but to fulfill them." Okay, can you guys repeat after me? Not to abolish,

100
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 but to fulfill. Okay, one more time. I think you guys can do better. Not to abolish,

101
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 but to fulfill. Okay, thank you. So, what does it mean that Jesus fulfilled the law

102
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 and prophets and not to abolish them? So, if you think of all the different laws that

103
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 we have, whether it is in your house, at school, at work, or in our society, behind each of

104
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:25,000
 the law, there is a purpose, right? So, let's take the examples of speed limit in a school

105
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 zone. So, the purpose behind the speed limit at a school zone is not to limit how fast

106
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 you can drive, even though that is kind of like the consequence of it. But the true purpose

107
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 behind a speed limit at a school zone is to protect the students so that driver doesn't

108
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,000
 just drive like 80 miles per hour and like run over school students. However, we can

109
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 be following the law, but totally miss the purpose behind the law, right? So, if you

110
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 have been with us this past couple of months, you might recall one of the announcements

111
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 that we make on both of our English and Cantonese services. Hey, if you see some kids running

112
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 around all the expensive car outside of our buildings, make sure to kind of like tell

113
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 them to like go somewhere else and play, right? So, one time after the Cantonese service,

114
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 I was just like walking towards the bathroom and then I saw some kids chasing around the

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 car. So, I just walk over and tell them, hey kids, like don't run around and play around

116
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 here. If you want to play, you can like go to the hallway and like do whatever you want

117
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 over there. But one of the kids, he basically just looked at me and replied, well, I'm not

118
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 going to run around the car then. I'm just going to walk slowly around the car. So, did

119
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 you guys see the problem here? Did you guys see the disconnect right here? The true intent

120
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,000
 of me telling them not to run around the car is so that they don't accidentally like scratch

121
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 or like bump into the expensive car because we have to be like responsible to like pay

122
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 for the damage. But by the kids kind of like responding by, okay, I'm not going to run

123
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 around the car, but I'm still going to play around it by just like walking slowly, that

124
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 pretty much just defeat the purpose of the law, right? That I want them to like not bump

125
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 into the car or like accidentally like scratch those expensive car. So, in the same way,

126
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:21,000
 Jesus will fuse the law by revealing to us what the true intent and purpose is behind

127
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 the law in the Old Testament through his teaching. And in that way, we can understand what Jesus

128
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 actually means or like what those law actually means. And on the other hand, Jesus will fuse

129
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 the prophets in the sense that Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of all the Old Testament

130
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 prophecies made by the prophets about the one, the Messiah, who will come and deliver

131
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 God's people and bring about a new relationship between God and his people. So, when Jesus

132
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 say that he fuses the law and prophet, it means that the Old Testament in its entirety

133
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 ultimately points to Jesus. And Jesus is also the official interpreter of the Old Testament.

134
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And this Old Testament law, in light of Jesus coming, they now has a deeper meaning. And

135
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,000
 in my following sermons, I will take a look at some of the examples. If you would just

136
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 want to take a look, if you have your Bible, just look at like verse 21 and the section

137
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 that follows. You will see that Jesus actually used this formula a lot. You have heard that

138
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 it was said, and then he will quote an Old Testament law. And then Jesus will say, but

139
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 I tell you this, and then Jesus would give his own interpretation. So, in that way, Jesus

140
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 bring kind of like a deeper meaning to this Old Testament law. So, why the truly blessed

141
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 life can only be experienced through Jesus? We look at the first reason that he is the

142
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 only one that can fulfill the righteous requirement of God on our behalf. And as a result of that,

143
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 if we believe in him, Christ's righteousness will become our own and we will be made right

144
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 with God. And on this, Paul highlight that. This is from Romans 10 verse 4. Christ is

145
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 the combination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.

146
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 And now we're going to look at the second reason. The second reason that the truly blessed

147
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,000
 life can only be experienced through Jesus is because Jesus and his word is the only

148
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 and ultimate authority that will endure forever and lead to the truly blessed life. So, verse

149
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 18, for truly I tell you. So, notice the wording that Jesus used here. For truly I tell you

150
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 or for I tell you the truth. So, right away, Jesus is preparing his disciples for a very

151
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 important truth regarding the word of God that he's about to say to them. And then he

152
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 continues. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter,

153
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the law until everything

154
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 is accomplished. And so, to give a little context here, the Old Testament is written

155
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 mostly in Hebrew and a little bit in Aramaic. And when Jesus says not the smallest letter,

156
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:18,000
 he is referring to the Hebrew letter, Yot, which is pretty much like an apostrophe. And

157
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 when he refers to the least stroke of a pen, he's referring to a stroke that in the Hebrew

158
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 alphabets that is used to differentiate a few of the different characters. But what

159
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Jesus is doing here, he's pretty much using an argument from lesser to greater. And so

160
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 he said, if he has even the smallest part of the Bible will not be abolished, what about

161
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 the law or the prophets? And so once again, Jesus is saying to his disciples that he has

162
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 not come to abolish the law and the prophets, but quite the opposite. He intends to bring

163
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 the law to his desired goal. That is a true transformation of our heart to the extent

164
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 that even the smallest details in the Old Testament will be fully accomplished in his

165
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 life and in his teaching. And on top of that, he say, until heaven and earth disappear or

166
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 until everything is accomplished, what Jesus is saying here is that as long as our present

167
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 world continue to exist, the word of God will continue to be valid and claims in authority

168
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 over our lives. Until every single passage in the Old Testament is being fulfilled in

169
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 him. So let's step back for a moment. When we hear something like this, that Jesus and

170
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 his words claims his authority over our lives. How does that make you feel? I think for me,

171
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 it actually feels a little uneasy because one of the popular anthems that our current

172
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 generation is singing is, you can be whoever you want to be, or I can be whoever I want

173
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 to be. I don't have to submit to anything, and I get to decide how I want to live my

174
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 life as long as it makes me happy. And on a surface level, this sounds kind of appealing,

175
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 right? It seems like there's a lot of freedom to do whatever you want to do as long as it

176
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 doesn't hurt other people. However, if we actually take a look at the history of Israel

177
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 in the Old Testament, it is not hard for us to actually recognize the consistent threat

178
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 that when people are left to their own to decide what is good and evil in their own

179
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 sight, 10 out of 10 times, it would always lead to downfall and destruction. And if you

180
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 still need more convincing, all you need to do is just to look at the society around us

181
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 and the world around us, and I'm sure you can figure out pretty quickly of what evil

182
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 humanity is capable of when we're being left to our own device. And so, what is the

183
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 alternative here? If we get to decide how we want to live is not the solution, what

184
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 is the alternative here? I would argue it is to live in full submission to Jesus and

185
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 His Word, again, because the Word of God is the only and ultimate authority that will

186
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:22,000
 lead to a truly blessed life. And just as a parent who knows a lot more than their children

187
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:28,000
 about what is good and safe for them and then sets certain rules and boundaries to protect

188
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 their children, Jesus, who is all-knowing, knows infinitely more than us as humans on

189
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,000
 what leads to a flourishing life. And so, these rules and laws are put in place not

190
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 to restrict our freedom, but it is put in place out of love to protect us. So, instead

191
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:52,000
 of seeing this law as restrictive, it is actually a means of grace from God. Instead

192
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:58,000
 of letting humanity walk down the path of self-destruction, these rules that is from

193
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 the Word of God function as a guide to lead us to a truly blessed life. So, we look at

194
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 two reasons on why the truly blessed life can only be experienced through Jesus. What

195
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 is the implication for us as followers of Christ? To answer that, let us look at verse

196
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 19 together. So, verse 19. "Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands

197
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever

198
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,000
 practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."

199
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 So, how should we live differently in light of this truth that Jesus is the only one that

200
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 can lead us to a truly blessed life? So, this is what I would say. As Christ followers,

201
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:54,000
 we need to live in conformity to Jesus and His commands. So, when Jesus say to practice

202
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 these commands, it means to not just submit to these commands, but also to live out, to

203
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 live out the commands as redefined by Jesus. Again, this is not just an outward conformity

204
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 to the law, but it comes from a sincere heart that is being transformed by the power of

205
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 the gospel. And in the following verse, Jesus further clarifies the importance of keeping

206
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 these commands and teaching others as well. So, He say, "For I tell you that unless your

207
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
 righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly

208
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 not enter the kingdom of heaven." When it comes to the Torah, the Pharisees and the

209
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 teachers of the laws, they are kind of like the cream of the crop. And the Pharisees particularly,

210
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 they're actually being known for the strict observance of the Jewish law. They don't just

211
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 like follow the laws that God has given in the Old Testament, but they themselves come

212
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:58,000
 up with extra multiple laws just so that they can be extra careful. So, what Jesus is saying

213
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:04,000
 here is that, in verse 20, is that, "According to our human standard of righteousness, the

214
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 only way a person can enter into the kingdom of heaven is for their righteousness to surpass

215
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 those of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law." And so, let me put it into some

216
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:22,000
 perspective for us right here. So, since I moved back into the city, I got into the hobby

217
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 or sports of bouldering or rock climbing. And I actually have a few opportunities to

218
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 bring our youth students from Summit to climb in the past few months as well. And we actually

219
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 just went over yesterday as well. And so, in climbing, the difficulty of the boulder

220
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:42,000
 problem is usually being great on the V scale, with V0 being the easiest grade, which is

221
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 pretty much like climbing a ladder. And currently, V17 being the most difficult grade that, yeah,

222
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 in the world pretty much, like someone has successfully climbed. And usually, when we

223
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 bring our kids to climb, they will climb in around the V0 to V2 range, and maybe occasionally

224
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 a V3. And in order to encourage them sometimes to try a little harder, some of my counselors

225
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 will tell these kids, "Hey, if you're able to climb this problem, I will buy you a free

226
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 boba." And so, you guys have to understand that for this middle schooler and high schooler,

227
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 getting a free boba is like the best gift that they could ever receive or that they

228
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,000
 could ever think of. So, every time we put those words out, "Hey, if you can climb this,

229
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 you get a free boba," they will just get extra motivated and try really hard to get all the

230
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:38,000
 way to the top. But imagine if we tell them this, "Hey, I will buy you a free boba if

231
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
 you're able to climb this V17 problem," which, to put it into context, there are less than

232
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 10 climbers in the world that have successfully climbed a V17. So, if we tell this to the

233
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:54,000
 kids, what do you think their reaction would be? They'll probably be like, "That is just

234
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 impossible. What do you want us to do right here?" So, in the same way, trying to earn

235
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 our own way into the kingdom of heaven with our own human effort, that is by having a

236
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 righteousness that surpasses or exceeds the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, is

237
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 almost as impossible as just me telling these kids to climb a V17 if they want to get a

238
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:26,000
 free boba. But the good news is this, that the righteousness that we need to enter into

239
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:33,000
 the kingdom of heaven, it does not come from ourselves. It doesn't depend on who we are,

240
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 what ethnicity we are, what socioeconomic status we are, or what ability we have, or

241
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 what effort we put into it. The righteousness that we need to enter into the kingdom of

242
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 heaven comes from Jesus alone because he has fulfilled the law and the prophets. In other

243
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 words, the entire Old Testament scripture is found in fulfillment in the person of Jesus

244
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 through his life and his teachings. So, I've seen one of the preachers did this exercise

245
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
 once before. He pretty much went through all the book in the Old Testament and tried to

246
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 show us how Jesus fulfilled each of these Old Testament scriptures. So, I did my own

247
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 similar exercise here, but I'm not going to go through every single book in the Old Testament.

248
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:28,000
 I just pick out a few to kind of try to show us what it means that the Old Testament scripture

249
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,000
 ultimately being fulfilled in the life and teaching of Jesus. So, ready? Here we go.

250
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 In Genesis, Jesus is the promised offspring from the woman who will crush the serpent's

251
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 head. In the book of Exodus, Jesus is the Passover lamb whose blood save us from death.

252
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 And also, Jesus is the tabernacle that dwells among us as his people. In the book of Leviticus,

253
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 Jesus is the ultimate offering that deals with our sins once and for all. And Jesus

254
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 is also the high priest that become the mediator between God, a holy God, and a sinful people.

255
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 In the book of Numbers, Jesus is the bronze serpent in which those who look to him will

256
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 be saved. In the book of Deuteronomy, Jesus is the greater prophet that Moses has promised.

257
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 And in the book of Proverbs, which we have looked into the past two weeks with Pastor Mark,

258
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 Jesus is the wisdom personified. In the book of Isaiah, Jesus is Emmanuel, God with us.

259
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 He is the suffering servant who was despised and rejected, pierced for our transgressions

260
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 and crushed for our iniquities. And by his wounds, we are healed. In the book of Jeremiah,

261
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 Jesus is the new covenant that the Lord promised. In the book of Ezekiel, Jesus is the one who

262
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 will give us a new heart and a new spirit in order to do the will of God. And in the book of Daniel,

263
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
 Jesus is the one like the son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. And I can go on and on,

264
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 but hopefully you get the point that because Jesus has fulfilled the law and prophets to

265
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 enter into the kingdom of heaven and experience a truly blessed life, it doesn't depend on

266
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 our own righteousness, but the righteousness of Jesus alone. And all we need to do is to

267
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 follow him and live in conformity with him. So I want to come back to this verse in Romans 10,

268
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 verse four again. Christ is the combination of the law so that there may be righteousness

269
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 for everyone who believes. So we don't usually use the word combination in our day-to-day

270
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 conversation, right? But the word combination here refers to the Greek telos, which pretty

271
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 much means the end or the goal. So when Paul say Christ is the combination of the law,

272
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 what he is referring to is that the angle of the law is to lead us to Christ by revealing

273
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 to us our need for greater righteousness that can only come through Jesus. Again,

274
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 because our own righteousness can never be enough to save us. So are you still trying to

275
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 earn your own righteousness? Once again, I want to start, I want to end with the same

276
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 questions that I start this sermon with. Who or what are you putting your trust in that

277
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 you think will lead you to a true and blessed life? Are you still searching for a way that

278
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 will lead to a truly blessed life, but with the intent to do it on your own strength?

279
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:56,000
 Here's the invitation from Jesus. Come, follow me. So in a few moments, we're going to take

280
00:27:56,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 the communion together as a church and as the body of Christ in response to our message

281
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,000
 today. And my hope is that this will be a time for us to slow down, to reflect on the

282
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:16,000
 message that we have just received, and also to remember his sacrifice for us at the cross.

283
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And 2 Corinthians 5 21, it says, "For God made Christ who would have never sinned to

284
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 be the offering for our sin, in order that we could be made right with God through Christ."

285
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 So in communion, the bread symbolizes the body of Christ broken for us in order that

286
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 we could be made right with God through Christ. And the cup, it represents the blood of Christ

287
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 poured out for us in order that we could be made right with God through Christ.

288
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 And so for those of you who are new here at UV, we have two tables set up with our communion

289
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 elements, one here at the front and one at the back. And before we take the communion

290
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 as the body of Christ, I'm going to put up a couple of reflection questions from my sermon

291
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 this morning up on the screen. And yeah, Phoebe, are you able to go back to my slides?

292
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Okay, yeah. So I'm going to put these questions up. And what I want you to do is just to,

293
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 yeah, take some time to sit before the Lord and reflect on these questions.

294
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 Who and/or what are you putting your trust in that you think will lead to a true and blessed life?

295
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And in what ways are you trying to earn your own righteousness instead of trusting and submitting to Jesus?

296
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 And during this time, I will have Lucy play a song in the background. This song is called

297
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 "Manifold," and it is actually written by a good friend of mine, Pastor Jordan Brown.

298
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 And the idea of this song came from Ephesians 3, 10 to 11. And this is basically a song,

299
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 this song is a call for the church to be the manifold wisdom of God to the world around us

300
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 and to be the presence of God's kingdom here on earth. So, when Lucy is playing in the background,

301
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 whenever you are ready during the song, you can come up and grab the element,

302
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 and then you can go back to your own seat and take some time to reflect on those questions.

303
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 And whenever you're ready, take the bread and the cup at your own time.

304
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 And after that, feel free to join us in singing this song together.

305
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And one last thing before we enter into communion, I want to speak to those in the room

306
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 who might not identify themselves as followers of Jesus yet.

307
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 First and foremost, we really appreciate you being here, and I just want to say thank you for

308
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:50,000
 coming here and joining us in our worship this morning. But we ask that you not partake in the communion

309
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 because taking the bread and the cup is a public declaration of one's beliefs in the work that Jesus has done on your behalf.

310
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,000
 So, if you're not ready to commit your life to Christ yet, I would encourage you instead to use this time

311
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 to really reflect and consider what the good news of Jesus, of the gospel is,

312
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 what Jesus has done on your behalf, and his desire for you to experience the truly blessed life.

313
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 So, yeah, you can take some time to sit and reflect for those questions,

314
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 and whenever you're ready, you can come up, take the element on your own, and yeah, take it.

 Thank you for the cross.

431
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,000
 Thank you for the free gift of salvation

432
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:25,000
 that you made Jesus who knew no sin

433
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,000
 to be a sin offering for us

434
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,000

436
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
 I ask that this truth will really grow deep in us

437
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:41,000
 that we're able just to abide in your love

438
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
 through Jesus that you have for us.

439
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:48,000
 And so I just ask that because of this truth,

440
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
 we're able to live out who you have called us to be,

441
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,000
 to be your kingdom presence to the brokenness around us,

442
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:59,000
 to be the manifold wisdom that you have foretold

443
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 and be the light and the salt to the world around us.

444
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,000
 Thank you, Jesus.

445
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,000
 Pray this in your son's name, amen.

446
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 So thank you all for joining us for our service today.

447
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:15,000

449

450
