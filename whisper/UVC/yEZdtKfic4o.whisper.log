[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.740]   - Hey guys, let's turn to the Bible
[00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.740]   and we will start a mini series called Way of Wisdom.
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:09.960]   Way of Wisdom.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.280]   Okay, so my first question for you is that
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.920]   when you think of wisdom or being wise,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.920]   what does it mean?
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.000]   What does it mean to be wise?
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.720]   What does it mean to have wisdom?
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.960]   And who can you think of someone,
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.960]   a name, a face, someone who is a wise person?
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.040]   Can you think of anyone like that in your life?
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.200]   Someone who is wise, someone who has,
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.480]   you know, embodied wisdom in their life?
[00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:50.360]   Now, does wisdom, does wisdom mean intelligence?
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.340]   Just intelligence?
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.840]   Or, you know, you get a 4.0 GPA, straight A student.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.280]   Does it mean you have wisdom?
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.800]   Can your paycheck number on your paycheck
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.280]   will tell you whether you have wisdom or not?
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.340]   Some of the questions we need to ask,
[00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.980]   what does it mean to have wisdom?
[00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.380]   Especially in our generation, you know,
[00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.200]   you listen to all sorts of different discourses out there,
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.320]   political discourse, public discourse,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.320]   private conversations or conversations in our relationships.
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.660]   Can we pick up some wisdom?
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.040]   You know, this generation, we need wisdom.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.040]   Especially men, all right?
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.800]   I know I'm old school, but, you know,
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.240]   we need to embody wisdom.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.040]   What does it mean to live a life of wisdom,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.480]   a way of wisdom?
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.840]   Many years ago, maybe I'm dating now,
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.840]   many, many years ago, back in the 90s,
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:03.000]   back in the 90s, you know, as I told you, I'm getting old.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.640]   Back in the 90s, there was a new label or new topic
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.280]   that everyone was talking about, mid 90s.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.240]   Emotional intelligence, emotional intelligence.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.120]   That was a term, emotional intelligence
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000]   or emotional quotient, EQ,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:28.720]   coined by a scholar named Daniel Goldman.
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.640]   And he published his studies
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.840]   because he followed some of the best students
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.360]   out of Harvard, out of MIT,
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.760]   followed their career path
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.080]   and followed how they managed their life.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.080]   And he finds that many of those people have just high IQ,
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.200]   does not mean they live successfully,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.000]   does not mean they work with wisdom,
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.440]   does not mean they manage their life
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.960]   and their career successfully or wisely.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   So he publishes his work called "Emotional Intelligence,"
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.320]   "Emotional Intelligence,"
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.680]   and the subtitle of the book says it all.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.720]   So the main title of the book is "Emotional Intelligence."
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   The subtitle is "Why It Can Matter More Than IQ."
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.800]   So why EQ matters more than IQ?
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.800]   So in his study,
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.160]   he finds that there were five essentials for human life.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.800]   How we manage our life,
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.920]   how we manage our life in the sense
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.200]   that we will be so-called successful.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.680]   So he named five essential elements of EQ.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.680]   First, listen up, first, is self-awareness, self-awareness,
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.400]   self-awareness, that's the first thing.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.520]   Second, self-regulation,
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.080]   how you regulate yourself,
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.000]   you know, how you discipline yourself.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.940]   Number three, motivation,
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:03.460]   how you have motivation at work, in life in general.
[00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:09.380]   Number four, empathy, empathy,
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.760]   how you relate to other people,
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.320]   how you make other people feel,
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.520]   how you connect with other people, empathy.
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.800]   Number five is social skills,
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.320]   how you relate to one another,
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.080]   you know, how you build friendship,
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.800]   you know, trust between people.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:34.680]   So number one, five elements of EQ,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.760]   Daniel Coleman said, the first one is what?
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.080]   Self-awareness, self-awareness,
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.720]   that you are aware of your problem,
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.240]   you're aware of who you are
[00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.960]   and you know how to carry yourself, self-awareness.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.200]   Second is self-regulation, how you discipline yourself,
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.560]   how you live your life, regulate your time.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.000]   Number three is motivation,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.120]   you find yourself getting motivated this morning
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.780]   when you get up, so tired,
[00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:05.760]   what's wrong with you?
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   There's something wrong with us.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.340]   Self-motivation, number three.
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.340]   Four, empathy, right, empathy.
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.000]   Number five, social skills.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.740]   These five, he says, is the five big things
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.900]   to manage your life, so-called emotional intelligence.
[00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.040]   So it doesn't have to do with IQ,
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.760]   whether you get a PhD or get a professional degree
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.980]   or you are very, very educated, it's all here, right?
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.340]   The most important things that Coleman said
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.260]   is your emotional intelligence.
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.700]   Speaking of that, that is pretty much similar
[00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.100]   to what the Bible has to say about wisdom.
[00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.220]   Now the Bible says a lot about wisdom.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.540]   If you want to be a wise person,
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.540]   if you want to be a wise, for me, being a wise father,
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:08.720]   wise husband, spouse, wise friend,
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.160]   worker, neighbor, all of this,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.880]   the Bible has a lot to say about wisdom.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.960]   Has a lot to say about how we live our life wisely.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:24.480]   You know, when the Bible uses the term wisdom,
[00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:30.920]   it usually means that something related to practical skills.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.680]   Practical skills.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.680]   You are skillful in certain things.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:37.160]   That means you are wise in certain things.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:41.720]   So Exodus 36, there were a couple of verses,
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.440]   it says there were a couple of people,
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:49.440]   Pastor Al and Oholiab, Oholiab,
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.360]   anyways, how you pronounce it,
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:53.240]   it doesn't matter, it's Hebrew, anyway.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.840]   Oholiab, and every skill-wise person
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.000]   to whom the Lord has given skill and ability
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.360]   to know how to carry out all the work
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.920]   constructing the sanctuary, the tabernacle,
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.920]   to do the work just as the Lord has commanded.
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.300]   Now, what's going on here?
[00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.600]   The Israelites were in wilderness,
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:19.200]   and God said, "You guys need to build a home for me
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.880]   "so I can dwell among you, I can live among you."
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:26.740]   And that is tabernacle, or translated sanctuary here.
[00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:30.400]   It's a portable temple so that God will lead his people
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:32.760]   in the midst of them, living in the midst of them,
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:35.820]   walking in the midst of them, to relate to them.
[00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:37.680]   So it has to do with worship,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:41.240]   it has to do with relating to God in the wilderness.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.740]   And so the sanctuary has to be built,
[00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.080]   and the tabernacle has to be built.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.000]   You know, tabernacle has different items,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   different furniture items, like manure,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.320]   and the show table, and the fabric,
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:57.520]   the poles, and all of this stuff,
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:07:59.920]   those are practical things that you need
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:02.600]   to set up the temple, the portable temple tabernacle,
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.060]   in the midst.
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:07.900]   So God has chosen some of the people here
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.900]   who are wise, skilled in certain things.
[00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:17.280]   So probably they can do metalworking,
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:19.680]   they can do carpentry,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:25.280]   so that they can set up the right, proper worship among them.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.560]   So God needs wise people to build his church, right,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.360]   to build his presence, to build up the tabernacle
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.220]   in those days when the Israelites were in the wilderness.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.600]   So the Bible has a lot to say about wisdom.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.760]   And one of the books in the Bible
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:45.440]   that has to do with wisdom,
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.900]   has a lot to do with wisdom, is the book of Proverbs,
[00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.340]   found in the middle of the Bible.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.300]   And I wanna emphasize something,
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.320]   that when we read again this book,
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:01.220]   we try to understand what the world is like in this book.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:05.420]   Now, if you read the book from verse one to the last verse,
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:06.800]   there are 31 chapters,
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:12.340]   you find that there is some sort of world structure
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.420]   presented by the book.
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.500]   And you find something really clear in this book,
[00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.960]   in the book of Proverbs,
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:24.280]   is that there is some sort of moral structure,
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.340]   some sort of spiritual structure in this world.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:31.240]   In general, what it means is you do something,
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.620]   and then there's consequence.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.980]   Your actions always have consequences.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.460]   If you do good, in general, you will receive reward.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:47.540]   If you do badly, then you will be penalized,
[00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:49.100]   you will suffer.
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:52.680]   So this is kind of the general truth, it's not always true.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:56.700]   It's not universal truth, it's not promises.
[00:09:56.700 --> 00:09:58.020]   But in the book of Proverbs,
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.180]   you find a lot of this has to do with the order
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.180]   of the universe that God has arranged,
[00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:08.500]   so that in this moral order, in this spiritual order,
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.820]   we have to behave in a certain way.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:14.760]   Give you an example here, chapter 11, verses 24 to 25.
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   It says, "A man gives freely, yet gains even more.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:24.100]   "And other men withholds."
[00:10:24.100 --> 00:10:27.660]   Doesn't want to give, but comes to poverty.
[00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:31.900]   25, "A generous man, alive,
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.460]   "living in generosity, will prosper.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:39.320]   "He who refreshes others, give away for others,
[00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:44.220]   "and help others, will himself be refreshed."
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.700]   You see the cause and effect here.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:49.460]   The spiritual order, or the cosmic order,
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:52.280]   if you honor God with your wealth, you will increase.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:55.020]   Even your heart will increase.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:59.060]   You will get a sense of satisfaction.
[00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.500]   You will feel good.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.100]   If you give freely to others, to bless other people,
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:07.700]   you, yourself, will be blessed.
[00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:09.740]   If you serve other people, it's not because
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:12.580]   you're giving up all the time.
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:18.340]   You will get something back, and your life will be blessed.
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:20.740]   So that is the world of Proverbs.
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:25.180]   There is always consequence in the order.
[00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.800]   Just like law of gravity.
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:32.700]   You drop something, it will break.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.860]   You have a glass of water, you drop it on the floor,
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.780]   on the ground, it will break.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:39.060]   The glass will shatter.
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.740]   That's consequence to our actions.
[00:11:43.740 --> 00:11:46.420]   So that's what the life of wisdom is.
[00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.640]   So the book of Proverbs is encouraging us
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   to observe the moral universe and the spiritual order
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.340]   that God has set up in our world,
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.460]   so that we can live accordingly to those principles.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.960]   Now, one of my favorite passages
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:07.560]   in the book of Proverbs is this.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.940]   Let me read that first.
[00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:12.780]   Chapter 24.
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:17.000]   Now, here the wise teacher,
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:22.060]   the wise man, like the teacher in the book of Proverbs,
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:26.280]   he did something, and then he observed something,
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:28.100]   and then from his observation,
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:32.260]   he gets some spiritual principles out of it.
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.980]   He said, "I went past the field of this lucker,
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.860]   "past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.240]   "Thorns had come up everywhere,
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.720]   "and the ground was covered with weeds,
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.860]   "and stone walls was in ruin."
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:56.340]   Now, look what the wise is doing.
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:12:59.340]   He opened his eyes, and he observed
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:02.820]   what is going on in the world.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.900]   He passed through a farm of a lazy person,
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:08.940]   a lazy farmer, sluggard,
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.180]   because he does not do anything to the farm.
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.300]   He does not put in his effort
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.280]   to cultivate the ground, the soil.
[00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:21.120]   So he passed through, and he observed.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:25.380]   He observed something because of his lack of judgment,
[00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:26.920]   because the farmer is being lazy,
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:28.820]   he's not doing his work,
[00:13:28.820 --> 00:13:30.240]   and then you got weeds,
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:33.240]   and you got all sorts of problems for your soil,
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.360]   and your farm is in ruin,
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:38.300]   and stone wall is also in ruin.
[00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.960]   Now, what he observes here
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:45.160]   is that there is some sort of arrangement
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.700]   in this world.
[00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:50.060]   There's some sort of spiritual order in this world.
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:52.800]   If you do something, there's consequence.
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.520]   If you don't do something you're supposed to do,
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:58.420]   there's also consequence.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.580]   If you're lazy, you're not putting effort in your life,
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.900]   in your farm, in this case,
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:07.580]   you know, there's always true
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:09.500]   that your farm will go into ruin.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.180]   Your house, your stone wall,
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.800]   they will always fall.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.660]   You know, the wall of stones,
[00:14:17.660 --> 00:14:20.960]   you stack stones and bricks on top of it
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.460]   so that it will protect you.
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:25.560]   If you don't maintain it,
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:27.800]   if you don't put in energy,
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:29.620]   if you're not being proactive,
[00:14:29.620 --> 00:14:33.420]   the bricks or the stones,
[00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:36.460]   they will inevitably fall.
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:38.840]   Okay?
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.280]   The fallen stone will not go back to the wall
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.320]   unless you pick it up and put it back on.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.840]   But if you do not maintain your life,
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.720]   if you don't maintain your stone wall,
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:52.400]   the stone will drop.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:53.900]   Law of gravity, right?
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.720]   Well, it doesn't take Newton to understand it.
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   So the wise is trying to help us to observe
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:06.600]   the life of the lazy person.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.700]   I mean, look at your bedroom.
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.400]   If you don't put energy to it,
[00:15:11.400 --> 00:15:12.860]   look at your house,
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.420]   it will be in chaos.
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:19.120]   There's always a cause and effect in this world.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.860]   And what the wise is trying to understand is,
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.760]   again, it's the spiritual order of things.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.300]   Life will always deteriorate.
[00:15:28.300 --> 00:15:32.260]   Life always deteriorate.
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:36.660]   And life naturally descends into chaos.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:39.300]   Just like stone wall will fail.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.600]   It will fall.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.100]   Now, what he observed is that
[00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.780]   once you have order,
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:48.140]   stone wall, your farm, good soil,
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:50.180]   order in your house,
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.280]   it will eventually lead to disorder.
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.920]   Order always goes to disorder.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.520]   Order always goes to chaos.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:06.480]   It will never happen naturally from chaos to order.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.660]   It always happens that order goes to disorder.
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:15.560]   Unless you put energy into your life
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.800]   and put things back to order.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:21.840]   Repair the broken wall.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.420]   Pick up the stone and bricks,
[00:16:24.420 --> 00:16:26.100]   put it back on the wall.
[00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.500]   You see?
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:28.980]   32.
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:29.940]   Verse 32, he says,
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.660]   "I apply my heart to what I observe
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:35.920]   "and learn a lesson from what I saw.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.800]   "A little sleep, a little slumber,
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:42.220]   "a little folding of hands to rest.
[00:16:42.220 --> 00:16:46.820]   "Poverty will come on you like a bandit,
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:50.540]   "and scarcity like an armed soldier.
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.800]   "You will be attacked."
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.680]   You know?
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:57.320]   I don't know if you understand it
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.620]   or if you can observe or agree with the wise.
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:06.520]   Our life is always going to the direction of chaos.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:09.340]   Unless we're proactive enough
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:14.080]   and we are active enough to make corrections,
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:14.920]   to maintain it.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:18.300]   Your finance.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.920]   If you just have money sit there,
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:24.320]   you don't do anything about it,
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.040]   it will always be devalued, right?
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:31.660]   Your house, your bedroom,
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:33.880]   your schedule,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:36.600]   your calendar.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.360]   If you don't do anything, folding of hands,
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:42.720]   if you're lazy, if you don't observe and you don't learn,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.520]   it will always go to chaos.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.840]   Anyone remember when you were in college,
[00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.380]   you learn second law of thermodynamics?
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:54.380]   Ring any bell?
[00:17:54.380 --> 00:17:56.240]   Second law of thermodynamics?
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.360]   Okay, no, right?
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.820]   So you guys didn't go to chemistry class.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:05.320]   Second law of thermodynamics says in this universe,
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.920]   things always go to chaos, right?
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.180]   The entropy in our lives always increases.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.820]   Unless you put energy into it and correct it
[00:18:15.820 --> 00:18:17.400]   and bring it back to order.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:20.320]   That's what the wise is trying to teach us.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:22.480]   Now, as you can tell from the book of Proverbs,
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.320]   it's not like a prophetical books.
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:29.120]   It's not like other books in the Bible.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:32.400]   Like the prophets, the prophets will come to you
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.760]   and say directly, this is what the Lord has said.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.160]   Thus says the Lord, you have to do this,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.640]   thou shall do this or thou shall not do this.
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.280]   It's a direct command.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.760]   But the wise in the book of Proverbs
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.000]   is that he uses his observation,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.280]   he'll open his eyes and observe other people,
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.720]   observe life in general, and then learn something.
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.880]   So it's not from top down, it's from bottom up.
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.140]   That's what wisdom will take you.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:03.220]   Observe your spiritual life.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.540]   Now, I've been a Christian for decades.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:12.360]   If I just being lazy and I don't care
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:14.280]   about my relationship with God,
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.800]   things will always go to chaos.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:23.080]   You have less strength to withstand temptations.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:28.080]   You have less faith, less confidence to withstand issues,
[00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:31.360]   to deal with difficulties in your life.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.960]   It is always harder to worship God
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.780]   unless you train yourself and strengthen yourself.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:43.880]   It's kind of a physical exercise, right?
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.840]   How many of you can do a seven minute plank?
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.020]   How many of you can do it?
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.400]   Probably only a few people can do it, right?
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.560]   Well, how come people can do a longer plank?
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:00.180]   Because they train themselves.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:04.320]   They strengthen themselves so that the muscles are going
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:08.380]   so that they can do what they want to do.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:13.840]   Our spiritual muscle always needs work.
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:17.800]   You go to the gym, you train yourself,
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.800]   you fight against chaos,
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.400]   you try to tame the chaos in your life.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.760]   Every single morning, you try to deal with all this disorder
[00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:30.680]   in your work, in your relationship, in your marriage,
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:33.320]   in your family, in your neighborhood.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:37.700]   You always try to rely on God and you train yourself
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:42.040]   so that your life can withstand trials and temptations.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:46.520]   They will come at you whether you ask for it or not.
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:48.480]   Difficulties, challenges, issues
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:51.360]   will always come to threaten your life
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:55.440]   and will pull you apart and separate you from God.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:58.760]   So every single morning, you have to have the motivation
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.880]   to fight the chaos, be a man,
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:07.240]   put in energy and put things back to order.
[00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:10.800]   So after the sermon, you probably need to go back home,
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:13.240]   put things back to order, right?
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.040]   So long you're just folding your hand
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.680]   and you don't care much.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:22.080]   After the sermon, you go back to your life,
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.200]   your personal life, you know, read the Bible,
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.240]   read the Word of God, just meditate on the Word of God.
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:30.120]   Unless you do that, you don't have the Word of God,
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:33.120]   you don't have the strength of God inside of you.
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:34.600]   And then you will be defeated
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:38.600]   because chaos will take over.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.480]   Unless you do that, what the wise is trying to do
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:47.200]   and understand if we fold our hands to rest,
[00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:51.240]   poverty, spiritual poverty will come upon you.
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.140]   And that is your responsibility.
[00:21:53.140 --> 00:21:56.480]   That's not the church's responsibility.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.080]   That's not your mentors' responsibility.
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:00.240]   That is your role.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:03.360]   You need to take charge.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.000]   You need to take leadership.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.680]   That is the way of wisdom.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:13.940]   Now there's one big question I always meditate on
[00:22:13.940 --> 00:22:17.560]   is that many of these wise sayings
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.080]   are from someone called Solomon.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:26.740]   Solomon has the reputation of being the wisest king
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:28.700]   of all the earth.
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:32.140]   You remember that, the book of Kings,
[00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:34.580]   when Solomon was being introduced?
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.280]   He was so wise and he has the wisdom
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.540]   to bring righteous judgment to his people.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.840]   He can rule his kingdom with righteousness and justice.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:50.540]   There's so many sayings that come from King Solomon,
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:56.160]   but I don't know why Solomon failed at the end.
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:00.740]   He failed miserably at the end.
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.460]   Yeah, he had the glory,
[00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.660]   but at the end of the last chapter of his life,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.300]   everything just spiraled into chaos
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:11.000]   and the kingdom is gone, is in ruin.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   And the nation of Israel was divided into north and south.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.660]   How did that happen to the wisest king on earth?
[00:23:21.660 --> 00:23:27.620]   And then one day I was searching some of the Proverbs,
[00:23:27.620 --> 00:23:30.580]   some of the passages, and I find this really interesting.
[00:23:31.540 --> 00:23:36.000]   And it's really, really a great reminder for all of us.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.860]   Why did the wisest person, the wisest king, Solomon,
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:41.580]   fail at the end?
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.300]   1927.
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.980]   Proverbs 1927.
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:51.440]   Stop listening to instruction, my son.
[00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:53.540]   You will stray.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:59.600]   Not you may stray, not possibly you will stray,
[00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:04.440]   but you will definitely stray from the words of knowledge,
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:08.100]   the knowledge of God, the knowledge,
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.560]   the wisdom to walk in the way of God.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.880]   Stop listening.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:16.440]   One day you find yourself, you check yourself,
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.060]   check your heart.
[00:24:18.060 --> 00:24:20.300]   Dude, I don't need to listen to this.
[00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:22.400]   Dude, I don't need to study this.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.900]   I don't need to find out and learn something more
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.660]   from the word of God.
[00:24:28.660 --> 00:24:32.060]   You stop right there, you stop listening to instructions,
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:34.020]   spiritual instruction, my son,
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.780]   you will definitely stray away.
[00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:40.700]   Now I have seen a lot of Christians in my life
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:43.520]   who did just that.
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:49.220]   When they were younger, happier,
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.580]   and they were really, really solid in their faith.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.920]   But I just scratching my head, what is going on with them?
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:24:59.940]   What is going on with them?
[00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:01.740]   There has to be something wrong.
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:05.700]   And you just hear the person complain about this and that,
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:06.900]   this and that, you know?
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:12.880]   But this verse says, there's a heart issue here.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.020]   There's something deep inside, it's the inner issue.
[00:25:17.020 --> 00:25:20.660]   Inner issue of stop listening.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:25.660]   And the Bible says it, adultery.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:27.560]   Because you always listen to someone.
[00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:32.200]   If you don't listen to God, you listen to the counterfeit God,
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:38.240]   the false gods, the culture, the world, or even yourself.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:40.040]   And you deceive yourself.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:43.400]   And then you spiral down into spiritual chaos
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.800]   because of this.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:49.800]   You stop listening, my son, you will definitely stray.
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:54.320]   You will go astray from spiritual knowledge.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.840]   What a reminder to all of us.
[00:25:56.960 --> 00:26:00.160]   I remember in the beginning of this year, in January,
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:04.720]   I preached on a series called Atomic Wisdom.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:05.560]   Remember that?
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.840]   Remember that?
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.900]   It's been so long.
[00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:13.800]   It's not that long, guys, it's not that long.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.000]   It's just a few months ago.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.780]   I preached on this series, Atomic Wisdom,
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:23.780]   and we went into the Bible and we said,
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:27.960]   there are small atomic habits
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:32.920]   that will bring you huge effect if you do that.
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:36.440]   Just a little bit small good habit,
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.840]   it will bring you fruitful life.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.940]   And I just wanna remind you and challenge you,
[00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:44.900]   since the beginning of this year,
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.060]   what has changed in your habits?
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:50.020]   What has changed in your life?
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.100]   Are there any small habits or good habits
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.780]   you have already built up?
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:03.400]   The foundation of small habits go a long way, guys.
[00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:06.700]   And what's standing in the way,
[00:27:06.700 --> 00:27:09.200]   sometimes we say, is life is too busy.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.620]   Indeed, life is very busy.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:14.460]   Who is not busy here?
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:15.660]   Everyone is busy.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:20.620]   So often we say, because life is too busy.
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.780]   Come on, God, just give me a break, all right?
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.840]   When I have a vacation, then I'll read the Bible.
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.120]   When I have spare time, dude, I'll read the Bible.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.940]   Now, sometimes we say that to ourselves
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:34.500]   because we wanna deceive ourselves.
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:36.820]   We say, life is busy because, no,
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.820]   this guy's reading the Bible more because he has more time.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:42.060]   I have less time.
[00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:47.260]   But seriously, it's just self-deception.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:50.840]   Everyone here has 24 hours a day.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:56.780]   We say that as an excuse, but deep down,
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.320]   it's probably pride.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:03.100]   Probably we are too proud of ourselves.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:04.320]   You know what pride is?
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:06.640]   Pride is not being mean.
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:11.280]   Pride is self-satisfaction.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:14.900]   I'm all good by myself.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.780]   I don't need the other voice
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:18.740]   to tell me what to do.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.140]   I don't need God to tell me what to do.
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.980]   I don't need God to define me.
[00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:23.500]   I don't need God to tell me what to do
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.780]   and how do I see myself, my identity,
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:29.060]   and my future, everything else.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.880]   I don't need God.
[00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:30.720]   I don't want to learn.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.380]   I don't want Him in my life.
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.460]   The most important thing is me.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.380]   The most important thing, the defining factor of my life
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:41.500]   is just me and now.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:44.760]   And that is pride in the Bible.
[00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:48.260]   That is stop listening to instruction.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.620]   Stop having other people to speak into my life.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:51.980]   I just shut down, you know.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.580]   I just, please shut up, guys.
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:56.740]   You know, I don't need to listen to you.
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.700]   Please shut up, God.
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.820]   I don't need to listen to you.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:03.500]   And that is the way of foolishness
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:09.400]   because you will stray from the word of spiritual knowledge.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.020]   I don't care what you did in the past,
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:16.640]   but if you stop listening, then you will go astray.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:19.040]   Chapter 9, verse 10.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:24.000]   The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.520]   Knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.
[00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:28.240]   You see the parallel here?
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:31.600]   The fear of the Lord, the proper relationship with our God,
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:33.660]   the fear of the Lord is parallel
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:37.240]   with knowledge of the Holy One.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.680]   Fear of the Lord, knowing how to fear God
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.260]   is to know God.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.900]   To know God means to fear Him,
[00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:51.300]   to understand who He is and relate to Him properly.
[00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:55.880]   And aren't we blessed that we have Jesus Christ
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:57.480]   in our lives?
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:01.320]   It's in Jesus and in Christ that we are related to God,
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.360]   restore our relationship with God properly,
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.120]   that God is our creator, God is our Father,
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:11.280]   and we are His sons and daughters.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:12.880]   We are His people.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:14.160]   That's how we know God.
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:17.760]   But here the why says, the fear of the Lord
[00:30:17.760 --> 00:30:21.400]   and the knowledge of the Lord is the same.
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:23.520]   And that is the foundation of your life.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:28.740]   That is the foundation of your house
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.200]   that you have to build on.
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:31.960]   And you keep on listening to God,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:34.840]   keep on being open to God,
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.960]   because God is actively doing something in your life.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:44.100]   The problem is we don't feel like God is doing something
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.060]   because we stop listening to Him.
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:49.840]   We just close down.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:53.640]   So a final reminder is that, you know,
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:56.880]   today is October.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.780]   Oh my goodness.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.160]   This year is almost over.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:04.000]   But it's never too late.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:05.400]   It's never too late.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.000]   If we're willing to fear God,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.840]   if we're willing to know Him, to relate to Him,
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:12.440]   God will bless you.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.140]   So I want to remind you to read the Bible.
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:18.860]   Read the Word of God every day.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:22.520]   There's one very wise suggestion
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.600]   to how to read the Bible
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:26.340]   if you don't know how to begin with,
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:30.360]   or you haven't been reading the Word of God
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.000]   for a long, long time.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:33.440]   There's one good suggestion,
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.880]   is to take the book of Proverbs,
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:39.760]   because there are 31 chapters in the book,
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.720]   and you read one chapter a day.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:44.560]   Go home and read it.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.480]   And it's not just reading the Bible,
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.520]   it's to pray to Him.
[00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:55.460]   To pray and to be open what God is doing in your life.
[00:31:55.460 --> 00:31:58.520]   What is God doing in your life?
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:01.760]   What does God want you to do?
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:05.220]   Pray for other people.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:08.800]   Maybe there are some friends that we need to pray for them.
[00:32:08.800 --> 00:32:10.820]   Church ministry, we need to pray for.
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.840]   And the growth of the church, we need your prayers.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.160]   We need to pray for the church.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.880]   It's not just, I want this, I need this, I want this, God.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.080]   Give it to me, give it to me.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.720]   If you don't give it to me, you're not God anymore.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:27.680]   This is not worshiping, this is not fear of the Lord,
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:32.240]   this is using God in the name of God for your sake.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:33.960]   And that is pride.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:34.940]   That is idolatry.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:38.640]   Read the Bible, pray to God.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:41.980]   Now observe the time of worship
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:45.200]   because this is probably the entire week
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.560]   you can just sit down and be open to God,
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.740]   open your heart and listen to what He is saying to you.
[00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:56.680]   And you listen and obey.
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:33:01.940]   As we close, why don't we pray together?
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.580]   (pages rustling)
[00:33:05.580 --> 00:33:11.260]   Probably we have forgotten God, but let's pray.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:12.920]   God is full of grace.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:16.820]   God is always there to knock on our doors,
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:19.780]   to welcome us into His presence.
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:29.080]   Hey, Father, dear God, thank you for being our God.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:32.120]   (gentle piano music)
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:33.820]   Help us to come before you now.
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:40.080]   Open our hearts and our mind, our lives,
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.460]   so that we don't,
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:48.000]   we are not occupied with ourself, our ego.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.520]   But God, let us know, let me know
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.680]   what I need to get rid of in my life
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:59.480]   so that I can put my life back to order.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:03.880]   My spiritual relationship with you,
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:05.580]   my relationship with other people,
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:08.960]   to learn how to fear you,
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:11.720]   to learn to listen to your voice.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:16.520]   And God, thank you for being our loving Father,
[00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:20.320]   even though we are weak
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.520]   and we have so many shortcomings,
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:25.380]   yet you are here to embrace us.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.480]   You are here to accept us in Jesus Christ.
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:35.560]   Thank you for being our loving Father,
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:39.100]   always waiting for us to return.
[00:34:39.100 --> 00:34:42.800]   So we come before you as the Spirit
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:49.180]   to help us, to help our hearts to return to you,
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:52.100]   to enjoy our time with you,
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:54.840]   to cultivate our relationship,
[00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:56.880]   the fear of the Lord in our life,
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:35:02.260]   to allot time in our busy schedule
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:05.760]   to relate to you,
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:13.320]   and pray, we just pray that your Spirit will renew,
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:14.580]   renew our faith.
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:18.120]   Help us to have the strength to deal
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:20.220]   with all the chaos in our lives,
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:21.960]   the disorders in our lives.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.500]   Yes, we are of little faith, but help us, God.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:31.700]   And thank you for being our God, always there.
[00:35:31.700 --> 00:35:36.460]   Help us to grow spiritually, help us to grow mentally,
[00:35:36.460 --> 00:35:38.680]   help us to grow emotionally,
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.580]   so that we walk in the way of wisdom.
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:47.580]   This is our prayer, and I pray that in this coming week,
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:52.040]   you will be with us, strengthen us, carry us through,
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:56.000]   and help us to continuously to rely on you,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.800]   to pray to you, and to worship you,
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.600]   knowing that you are our strength and you are our rock.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:03.920]   You never abandon us,
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:06.820]   and nothing will separate us from the love of Christ.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:08.920]   Thank you for being our Father, our God.
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:10.920]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.440]   Well, God bless you all,
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.600]   and we have some refreshment outside,
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:20.160]   and please enjoy some time of fellowship together.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.500]   Make sure we spend this time together
[00:36:22.500 --> 00:36:24.600]   to get to know each other.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:28.040]   I know there are some friends here, some new friends here.
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.040]   Welcome, and we wanna get to know you,
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.920]   and please get to know us as well.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.200]   So yeah, God bless you, and I wanna see you next Sunday,
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.460]   and we continue to serve God and worship Him.
