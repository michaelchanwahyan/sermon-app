00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,480
 Series called back to basics and I want you to remember and practice some of the basic

30
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:07,480
 Habits, you know in in your Christian life and if we have those slide ready, we will

31
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:11,400
 first reveal the verse of the week and

32
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,520
 This verse of the week is if you have the Bible, I don't have a slide yet

33
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:17,960

 Anyways, we'll go to chapter 4 verse 6 and 7 verse 6 and 7. All right

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,880
 Here it says don't worry

37
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,640
 Here we go. Don't worry about anything

38
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:49,080
 Instead pray about everything tell God what you need and thank him for what he has done

39
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,200
 Then you will experience God's peace which exceeds anything you can understand

 His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus

41
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,920
 Philippians 4

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:08,120
 Verses 6 to 7 what a wonderful verse right? What a wonderful sentence or a paragraph

43
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,840
 to

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,800
 Tell us, you know, especially those of us who worry some

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,800
 Worry a lot and overthinking a lot. Are there anyone here?

46
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:26,200
 You constantly overthink you constantly think a lot, you know about your future about you know issues or problems

47
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:32,220
 This verse gives you peace. Don't worry about anything instead pray about everything now

48
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,280
 I want to let you to understand this is taken from the book of or the letter to the Philippines and

49
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:42,440
 what this letter is as you understand the New Testament has a total of

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,120
 27 books or 27

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,520
 You know pieces of writings some of them are letters. Some of them are stories

52
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,580
 Some of them are histories and you know different different types of literature

53
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:56,240
 But if you go to the New Testament Bible

54
00:03:56,240 --> 00:04:03,760
 there were 27 books there or 27 writings and some of the writings we call epistles or letters and

55
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,940
 Many of the letters are actually written from a pastor

56
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:12,080
 From a pastor leader to a church a very very small church

57
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:17,400
 very very small house churches in different cities and here we find the letter of

58
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:25,280
 Letter to the to the to the Philippines and it's written by Paul the Apostle Paul the pastor Paul and

59
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,640
 He wrote this letter

60
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:33,920
 Call we call the letter to the Philippines and writing to the Christians the house churches in

61
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,920
 Philippi one of the Roman

62
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:41,480
 Quarantine in in in Greece and

63
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,280
 If you read this letter

64
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,400
 There were only four chapters is very very short

65
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,320
 Book a very very short letter you can sense that this is a personal letter

66
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,560
 With with a lot of personal tones a lot of personal

67
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,080
 Feeling to it and

68
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,840
 There are two reasons why

69
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,280
 first because

70
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,720
 Paul actually found this church

71
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,280
 He established this church in his second missionary journey if you check the book of Acts, which is the history of the earliest

72
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,760
 the first generation

73
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:18,560
 Christians you'll find some of the stories that Paul

74
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,200
 came to the city called of Philippi is a Roman city and

75
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:30,240
 He tried to preach the gospel and some of the individuals came to faith and he established the church

76
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,440
 And he's like a father to the church in Philippi

77
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,680
 He's like a father to the Christians the Philippian Christians. And the second reason is the church has been

78
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
 supporting Paul

79
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,120
 and his mission and his

80
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:46,960
 ministry and sometimes they send

81
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,320
 the supplies or

82
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,480
 Essentials to Paul and at this point when when when Paul write this letter the letter to the Philippines

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,320
 He was in prison

84
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,120
 He was in Rome. He was in the capital city of the Roman Empire

85
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,600
 He was right there in house arrest

86
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,840
 for almost two years as far as we can reconstruct the

87
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:17,400
 The last few years of Paul and he was waiting for trial because he want to appeal to Caesar the king

88
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,400
 the Emperor of Roman Empire and

89
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,040
 He did not know the result yet

90
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,720
 He was in house arrest and in his house arrest in the Roman world. You can still receive, you know information from other people

91
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,240
 You can receive visitors. You can have friends and you can send letters and that's the context of the Philippian

92
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,080
 Letter and in this in this letter you get the sense that you know, he's trying to reply to something

93
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:52,560
 Because we find some verses in this fourth chapter the book of Philippians that Paul is trying to thank

94
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,120
 The church in Philippi, right? He was in Rome, right and

95
00:06:56,120 --> 00:07:04,640
 The Philippian Christians are in Philippi and they send someone to to give the essentials or offer essentials to support

96
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:07,360
 Paul while he was in prison and

97
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,240
 For example, you can go to the last chapter chapter 4

98
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:19,160
 417 what does he say? He say I don't say this because I want a gift from you

99
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:25,720
 In other words a possible receive a gift a financial gift from the church in Philippi rather

100
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,480
 I want you guys to receive a reward for your kindness at the moment

101
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:34,000
 I have all I need and more more than enough

102
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
 I'm generously supplied with the gifts you send me with

103
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:46,640
 Epaphroditus Epaphroditus and they are sweet smelling sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to God now

104
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,640
 Who's this guy before Titus?

105
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:54,880
 It has to be a member or even a leader from the church in Philippi and he traveled all the way

106
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:59,400
 to come to Rome to find Paul in house arrest and give him some

107
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:08,160
 Essentials probably some food items probably some clothes or anything that he needs in two years and constantly he does so and

108
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:17,280
 Epaphroditus is kind of like, you know, kind of like a UPS, you know a delivery delivery guy or uber eat, you know

109
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:25,440
 he's gonna support Paul and make sure he's being fed and he's he's being strengthened and to help him and to stay with Paul and

110
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,160
 From the letter we see that Epaphroditus was really sick

111
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:34,120
 It's probably because he travels so much to help Paul

112
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,800
 and maybe he was got so sick and even to the point of death and

113
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,040
 He was by the side of Paul and Paul is really really

114
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:45,820
 worried about this brother and maybe because

115
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,480
 Paul and

116
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,480
 Epaphroditus they talk about

117
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,160
 the church and there was so much anxiety for the church because the small church is under a lot of pressure and

118
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,640
 oppositions and Paul want to send Epaphroditus back to the church in

119
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:08,320
 Philippi and he wants to send Epaphroditus back with a letter and this is the letter

120
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,640
 Right the letter to the Philippians and he you can imagine he's just quickly grab some

121
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,520
 parchment paper and write a letter in four chapters a very very short a very personal letter and send it with the

122
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,720
 Mailman, you know the UPS guy Epaphroditus and send him back to

123
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,480
 Philippi and that's how we find the letter to the Philippines and finally we come to the

124
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,880
 last chapter chapter 4 and

125
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:40,240
 And Paul is trying to close the letter and he's trying to you know

126
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:47,680
 Give give his encouragement as much as he can in this letter and chapter 4 verse 1

127
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,760
 He said therefore brothers and sisters you whom I love and long for my crown and my joy

128
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,160
 You got that personal tone

129
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:01,800
 It's a personal letter and that's how you should stand firm in Lord dear friends. I

130
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,220
 Plead with you dire and I plead with

131
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,940
 Syntaghy to agree with each other in the Lord and yes, I ask you loyal your fellow

132
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:18,020
 hope this women who have contended at my side in the cause of gospel along with

133
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:25,840
 Clement and the rest of fellow workers whose name are in the book of life rejoice in the Lord always I say again

134
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:31,260
 Rejoice, let your gentleness be evident to all and the Lord is near

135
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:38,560
 Now that's the closing chapter right there. There are two women being named here, right you dire and

136
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,880
 Synecdoche, right, but perhaps these two women are

137
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,440
 Some of the leaders

138
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,160
 In in Philippi some of the leaders of a church

139
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:56,600
 perhaps they invite the church or fellowship to the living room and have the house churches meeting possible and

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,640
 These two women and from from the context, you know, these two women don't agree with each other

141
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:08,280
 Right, they got some tension inattention or probably

142
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:14,840
 Disagreement for some reason they were in disagreement and Paul is writing this letter encourage them to be united

143
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:20,020
 To be of one heart right and that's actually the tone for the entire letter

144
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:25,160
 Paul the pastor wants the church to work in unity

145
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,920
 To along with other people like Clement right other fellow workers

146
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,120
 So that brings him joy, right and you know from from the wording he used

147
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,480
 The communities in Philippi they are working toward that goal already

148
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:48,720
 So Paul is trying to encourage them to continue to work in unity and that brings him joy

149
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,040
 Right the entire letter only four chapters, but over and over again

150
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,160
 Paul is expressing his joy and he's happy

151
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,480
 He's joyful

152
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
 because of the gospel

153
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:09,920
 Because the church is being established because the church is trying to stand up and be strengthened in faith. And this is a powerful

154
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:17,040
 Passage because as you can imagine someone who is in house arrest and

155
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,760
 You just don't know what it will turn out to be

156
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,920
 Right, whether you will live or where you would die, right?

157
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,760
 he is waiting to be to go on trial and

158
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,560
 He was in house arrest and he was in prison and just such powerful

159
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,560
 Wordings that he was trying to use you guys are my joy and my crown and there's a secret here

160
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:49,920
 Why did Paul do that? How could Paul do that? You know, imagine you're in prison, right or in house arrest

161
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,200
 right

162
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,200
 And you can't go anywhere

163
00:12:54,200 --> 00:13:01,120
 You don't have your strip of your freedom, right and you are being mistreated

164
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,720
 What is the secret of being joyful here?

165
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,440
 You can tell from verse 3

166
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:15,520
 Paul says all of their names are written in the book of life, right the book of life

167
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:22,720
 You believe in Christ Jesus if you trust holy trust in the name of Jesus your name

168
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,560
 Is in the book of life, right?

169
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:30,120
 Your eternity is secure, right? You are on

170
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,160
 the team of team Jesus, right, you know, the Olympic has

171
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,680
 begun and

172
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,280
 there were different athletes right and

173
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:47,080
 The they they are honored to join team USA, right or the team of the country, right?

174
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:53,800
 Just joining the team the name being on the team is such an such an honor, right?

175
00:13:53,800 --> 00:14:01,080
 Right. Yeah, you can imagine if your name is on team USA, right? What kind of honor would that be?

176
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:06,160
 Right, we're gonna throw a big party for you, right too bad. Your name is not there, right?

177
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,240
 Yeah, but your name is on team USA you get the honor and you are happy, right?

178
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:14,440
 And that's the secret of a Paul

179
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,040
 It's if your name is in the book of life

180
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,440
 You have the ground to be joyful, right? You're joyful not because you are successful

181
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:32,960
 You're not you're not because because you're not you're not you're not joyful because you're successful in the in the worldly perspective

182
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,120
 You're joyful because your name is in the kingdom, right?

183
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:41,600
 And then he goes on to encourage the questions encourage us that the Lord is near

184
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:49,600
 Right now it is usually translated in the in the sense of time, you know temporal sense

185
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,920
 The Lord is near meaning Jesus is coming anytime

186
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,680
 It's just coming anytime soon, right? It can be today. It can be the next hour

187
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,160
 It can be five years later anytime right Jesus coming second coming is right around the corner

188
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,240
 That's the temporal sense. But you know here another sense is is often forgotten

189
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,320
 In those words the Lord is near

190
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,560
 It's the spatial sense

191
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:25,280
 So what Paul is saying is that the Lord is near Jesus is near is that Jesus is right by your side

192
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:32,720
 Jesus is present with you if you're facing difficulties or you're facing some sadness and depressed

193
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,480
 moments in your life

194
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,800
 Know that you know, the Lord is right next to you

195
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:45,400
 Right right beside you. The Lord is near he is someone you can trust

196
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:49,520
 He's right next to you and it makes a world whole world of difference, right?

197
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,760
 It makes a whole world difference knowing that there's supporting friend right next to you

198
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,200
 Right when you are feeling down when you're feeling bad or sad, right?

199
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,920
 I usually

200
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,720
 visit

201
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:09,280
 People who are sick in the hospital, right and you can tell from their eyes

202
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:14,160
 When you go in and you preach you are present with them

203
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,440
 They are encouraged right? They are comforted and

204
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,680
 That's why it's hopeful for many of us to sometimes to talk to someone who is wiser

205
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:30,640
 Like a wise counselor, right? Either professional counselor or you know a layman

206
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:36,480
 Find someone who can talk to you find someone who can listen to you to understand

207
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,000
 Your voice right understand your mind

208
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:47,800
 That is so important. And and that's what it means. The Lord is near right friends if you're going through some down period

209
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,800
 If you're going through some difficult time know that the Lord Jesus is near

210
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:59,120
 He is right next to you and Paul goes on to talk about one of the basic practice

211
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:05,440
 Of Christians and don't forget that he said do not be anxious

212
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:12,600
 That's NIV do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition

213
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:19,320
 With Thanksgiving present your request to God and the peace of God which transcends all

214
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:25,080
 Human understanding will guard your heart and your minds in Christ Jesus

215
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:27,760
 he says

216
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,240
 Don't worry

217
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,240
 Right. Don't worry

218
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,200
 Don't worry too much

219
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,640
 Don't be too anxious about anything or perhaps our essentials, right?

220
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:46,320
 Don't be anxious about anything but in everything you pray and you present your petition to God, right?

221
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,440
 They're almost synonyms prayer and petition

222
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,640
 not the exact wording but you know words that

223
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,040
 Express our way of you know

224
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:04,680
 Talking to God right and that is prayer. That is the basic practice that we all have. Let me ask you this

225
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:07,480
 Do you pray?

226
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,320
 Constantly regularly

227
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,160
 Every day. I want to encourage you you take 10 minutes of

228
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:22,680
 The best time of the day to pray to God right now so often we we we misunderstand

229
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:31,840
 What prayer is right? Sometimes we think prayer has to be in some sort of using some some sort of big words, right?

230
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:37,560
 Beautiful words so we can approach God that way. No, that is not the spirit of prayer

231
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,120
 I still remember the first year in in seminary

232
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:46,000
 I was taking a class and there's a very very

233
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,920
 old and wise professor

234
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:56,840
 Hey, he always begins the class with prayer and end the class with prayer and when he prays

235
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,640
 No, it's just beautiful prayer

236
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,520
 He uses King James Version English to pray

237
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,480
 You know Tao T and it's just beautiful right because he grew up in the Christian family

238
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:16,560
 Very devout Christian and he used to that kind of language, you know, King James

239
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,160
 It's very very old old English. But you know when you hear his prayer, you just feel like my goodness

240
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,080
 This is beautiful

241
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,400
 Every time he he opened his mouth. It's like writing poem, right?

242
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,240
 Do we have to pray like that?

243
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,680
 No, we don't right, you know one of the shortest prayers in the Bible

244
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:39,880
 remember that is

245
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,400
 Lord help me

246
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:50,920
 That's one of the shortest prayers in the Bible right so his prayer in the Bible the spirit of prayer is authentic

247
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:58,080
 sincere honest and open you just tell God what you need and how you feel right and

248
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,840
 It's kind of like baby talking to to daddy and mommy

249
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:10,400
 Right. Do we as as dad and mom do we mind the young child?

250
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:18,360
 Not knowing what to say and you know, just bah bah bah all the time, right? We love those those voices, right?

251
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,420
 To make known right his or her feeling that that's how we approach God, you know

252
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,560
 Will prayer is authentic

253
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:35,880
 Authentic sincere honest and open right and we need to practice that right?

254
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:39,080
 We need to practice that and then Thanksgiving

255
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,000
 He said by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, right?

256
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,160
 When you when you cultivate the spirit of being thankful

257
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,200
 You are constantly reminded

258
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,960
 What God has done in your lives, right?

259
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,480
 Sometimes we are so overwhelmed by you know, the problems that we have right the worries that you know in our mind

260
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,280
 And then we forget

261
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,920
 No, God has been good to us, right?

262
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:12,720
 God has been good to us in the past and that's why we can keep on

263
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,760
 Trusting him right there. God has the track record, right?

264
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,560
 of being good to us

265
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,120
 And that reminder will help us

266
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,480
 To worry less right a christian author

267
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:32,320
 Says listen up christian author says this. I think it says it's very very

268
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,880
 correctly

269
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:37,040
 The way to be anxious about nothing

270
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:39,600
 Is to be prayerful

271
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
 about everything

272
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,480
 The way to be anxious about nothing

273
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,280
 Is to be prayerful

274
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,440
 about everything

275
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,680
 Right. What a wonderful reminder, right?

276
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,940
 We come here. Paul says don't be anxious about anything but in prayer petition and thanksgiving

277
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:03,520
 You come before God, right? And that's a wonderful verse, right? But it's also interesting, right?

278
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,400
 you know you think about it from a

279
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,280
 Just our our human perspective if God wants us to worry less

280
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,880
 Why doesn't God just give us everything that we ask for right? Do you want a bigger house?

281
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,640
 Do you want to win the the lottery

282
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:30,560
 And retire early right is sitting by the beach of cancun, you know all the time, right, you know sipping

283
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:33,440
 You know pina colada all day

284
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,520
 Don't you want that?

285
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,520
 Right. Don't you think you need that?

286
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,600
 You want bigger bigger car or a better car, right?

287
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:49,520
 Um money, you know lottery new house right new car right, you know

288
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:56,800
 Uh, you think God God would be good to us if if if God just shower us with

289
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,600
 all this material possessions

290
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,560
 You think you think that's the goodness of God?

291
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:10,720
 You say so right you say so but you know what if if you have all that you want, right?

292
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,000
 Sometimes your spirit is poor

293
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,920
 Right because it doesn't build up your character

294
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,360
 Right, it doesn't give you the strong spirit to withstand changes to withstand difficulties, right?

295
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:29,680
 And that's why paul is saying, you know

296
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,840
 God treats us

297
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,440
 in a different way

298
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,360
 God gives you peace

299
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,360
 Right god gives you peace

300
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,160
 And peace that is beyond human understanding transcends all understanding and talking about peace

301
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,520
 You know to the uh to the years of uh, the philippians in the roman city roman colony

302
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,760
 And uh, they should uh, they should immediately understand what it means peace, right?

303
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,220
 Sometimes we read the word peace we use our understanding

304
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,040
 uh

305
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:06,000
 And our perception but in the to the roman

306
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,800
 To the romans and and philippian, uh, they're living in a roman city a military city

307
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,440
 They do know what peace is right and there's a slogan

308
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:24,320
 Back in the uh, first century roman empire is pax romana, right pax romana latin

309
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:29,520
 It means roman peace, right? You know what what roman peace is?

310
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:33,200
 You know, uh, rome is a dictator, right?

311
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,480
 Roman peace means I beat you up

312
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:43,040
 And then you're gonna obey me right I conquer you right and you're not gonna do uh

313
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:48,640
 You're not gonna be rebellious. You're not gonna rebel against me. That is called peace, right? That is roman peace

314
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:56,880
 Pax romana, right? I was trying to organize some of the materials lately and uh, I find this uh, roman coins

315
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:03,360
 Golden coins and what we call this kind of coins are first jewish revolt coins

316
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,640
 You know the first jewish revolt happened in uh, a d uh, 66 to 70

317
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:17,200
 Those few years, uh, some of the jewish people especially in judea in jerusalem. They rebelled against rome and they fought against rome

318
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,760
 and um, of course they

319
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:27,520
 Um, ultimately they failed right and the roman army came to palestine and suppressed the revolt

320
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,680
 And after the suppression after roman, uh, the romans conquered, uh, all those, uh,

321
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,400
 rebellious people

322
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,000
 uh, they

323
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:43,760
 Will uh, they will send a propaganda to the entire empire by minting coins

324
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,560
 And coins with a message, right?

325
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,040
 You know coins have message, right?

326
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:53,520
 And on the left you see there's a military victory

327
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:56,240
 procession

328
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:03,120
 And all the armies and horses, you know and with a horn, you know proclaiming the victory of rome and in front of it

329
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,560
 The little guy, you know the first guy in the procession

330
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,360
 Uh, he has a name

331
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,440
 And his name is simon

332
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,200
 simon son of

333
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,720
 Uh, gilora

334
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,560
 And he's one of the leaders

335
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:18,720
 of the uh first jewish revolt

336
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:26,080
 And uh, the romans came and say we are triumph over you. Okay, right and we beat you up

337
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:31,200
 And you are the head of the procession and we're going to tell other people all the tribes in all the nations

338
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:34,000
 That we are the winner and you are the loser, right?

339
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,240
 And then who's the winner?

340
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,000
 that's bastion

341
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,880
 The middle the middle face middle face of a coin, right? That is one of the roman empires

342
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,720
 emperors

343
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,680
 And on the right you see the word judea

344
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:50,320
 Can you make make it out judea?

345
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,800
 And it's a woman

346
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,640
 captive

347
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,480
 You know being bound

348
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:58,160
 of her hands

349
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,440
 sitting at the foot of uh, uh the palm tree

350
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,560
 And she was defeated

351
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:07,680
 right, she was crying she was weeping because

352
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:11,840
 She has no judea has lost the battle, right?

353
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,440
 Now what I want to tell you is this is the room. This is the roman peace

354
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:20,640
 This is the peace of roman empire they beat you up, right?

355
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,840
 So you cannot rebel anymore, right? And philipi was guarded heavily by

356
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,760
 uh roman

357
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,440
 roman military units

358
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:37,140
 And if you live in philipi, if you're one of those who read the letter of philippians

359
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:41,520
 You understand you because you will see soldiers all around you, right?

360
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,000
 Every single city gates you will see roman soldiers heavily guarding the city, right?

361
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,520
 Roman army is to guarantee the roman peace, right?

362
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,160
 That is the peace that they understood

363
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,400
 right

364
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,760
 roman peace

365
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,220
 I still remember, uh the first year of the pandemic

366
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,240
 Remember that we have national guards here

367
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:09,680
 You know guarding the in and out of downtown

368
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,840
 Remember that?

369
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,000
 You know, they they got uh, you know military trucks and uh, you know all over the cities, right?

370
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,440
 And I remember I have to help uh international student to move

371
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,320
 and uh, I I rent an

372
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,960
 a 10-foot u-haul

373
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:29,360
 And she has to move out of the uh, you know the the building in downtown

374
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,080
 And I I drove that u-haul

375
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,040
 You know across all the checkpoints, right?

376
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:40,080
 Dude, I was so scared, right? Well, what are you doing? You know people are using u-haul to

377
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,960
 you know to to to uh

378
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,560
 To to break break down the wall and uh steal things right?

379
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:51,280
 And it was pretty scary right? I have to talk to the guard and you know, I I'm a pastor

380
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:55,040
 I'm helping I want people to move, you know, I know this is a bad time, but you know

381
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,240
 The street is like a ghost town, right?

382
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,200
 Do you think that was peace

383
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:05,520
 In a way it was right, we're quite peaceful

384
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,960
 It's quite peaceful nobody on the street, right?

385
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:12,640
 But that is the roman peace

386
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,680
 The peace that paul talks about is the peace

387
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
 of god

388
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,560
 Right the peace that we find in jesus christ

389
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,160
 And first of all that peace is that we have a restore

390
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:33,100
 Relationship with god the father right in jesus because of the cross that we have that peace that ultimate peace

391
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:37,100
 Restore relationship with our creator with our father. We can call him father

392
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:43,580
 We are sons and daughters and that is the peace talk paul talks about peace given by god, right?

393
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:46,140
 So paul pictures god's peace

394
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,620
 as the garrison

395
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,740
 As military soldiers keeping guard

396
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:58,860
 Over your hearts and your minds to protect you from all kinds of attacks

397
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,180
 that is

398
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,180
 the peace of god

399
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,520
 And that's why it's beyond human understanding

400
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,380
 Right, you know that your eternal destiny is secure in christ

401
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:14,140
 You know, your identity is secure in christ

402
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,380
 And you are not shaken

403
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:19,260
 No matter what comes your way, right?

404
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,420
 sickness

405
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,420
 right separation

406
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,280
 Heartbrokenness

407
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:29,580
 All this all these issues are coming in your way

408
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:33,260
 If you know that your identity is secure

409
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:38,540
 You have peace and that is the peace from god, right?

410
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,820
 And we can rely on god

411
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:49,020
 You know, rachel has been driving a lot these days, uh, I told you, you know in the in the beginning a couple years ago

412
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,340
 She hates driving

413
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,100
 Now she likes driving

414
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,780
 She enjoys driving

415
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:57,020
 And um, you know, she drives one of our old cars

416
00:30:57,020 --> 00:31:01,820
 and uh, she always always comes on, uh, she always comes home and uh,

417
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,500
 uh, tell me

418
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,500
 with a little phrase

419
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:10,860
 And she said dad, uh, the car is low on gas

420
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:18,540
 The car's low on gas and she didn't say anything right because she trusts

421
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:26,300
 That i'm the i'm the good father, right? I'm gonna add uh gasoline to the car when the gas is low, right?

422
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:30,940
 And um, I really admire that kind of chill out spirit

423
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:36,620
 Uh, you know just trusting me that I will always provide right? I will always provide

424
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,300
 Yeah

425
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:40,380
 I think that kind of spirit we need to have

426
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,540
 Without god, right

427
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,020
 We're low on gas

428
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:50,140
 And father heavenly daddy, we're low on gas

429
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,700
 And that is the spirit of prayer, right? That is the spirit of prayer

430
00:31:54,700 --> 00:32:00,700
 We come before god. We are open. We come before god. We are sincere and honest and that is

431
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,060
 Our daily prayer life, right?

432
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:07,420
 Come before god to tell him our request

433
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,980
 Tell him our feelings

434
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:13,180
 Tell him what is what is going on in your life?

435
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:17,100
 And god is there to listen and the lord is near

436
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:21,100
 That is the mentality of paul, right? He was in prison. Remember?

437
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,340
 He was um

438
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:25,340
 under a lot of pressure

439
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:28,300
 Uh opposition there was no light at the end end of tunnel

440
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,900
 He just doesn't know what the future holds for him. But there was a habit in paul. There was a habit of uh,

441
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,380
 of a faithful living

442
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:39,340
 To pray and to be thankful all the time, right?

443
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,500
 That takes care of a lot of different issues and worries

444
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:50,780
 Beyond our thinking beyond our reasoning, right? Don't we all don't we all overthink, you know from time to time?

445
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:58,140
 Right. We thought that we think that our thinking can can take care of things. No, we don't right and paul is saying and

446
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,540
 Trust trust in god

447
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:03,100
 Right and the peace of god will be with you

448
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:06,540
 You know, I watched the uh

449
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,540
 olympic game opening

450
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,260
 And one of the uh, most inspiring moments

451
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,980
 is celine dion

452
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:16,940
 You watch that celine dion present

453
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,980
 her uh singing

454
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:26,460
 It's just inspiring right, you know in the past few years she has gone through just

455
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:33,020
 Just no enormous difficulties, right? Yeah losing losing family member

456
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,660
 um, you know, uh

457
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,780
 You know where disease, you know striking her

458
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:41,260
 but um

459
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:43,260
 She keeps on fighting, right?

460
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:48,860
 You know, it doesn't come overnight, you know that kind of spirit doesn't come overnight

461
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,500
 Because she has been a fighter

462
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:58,860
 For so long right she had this habit this pattern of life this perspective of life to keep on fighting, right?

463
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,300
 Here we see this we see the spirit in paul

464
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:05,580
 And paul is trying to encourage us. Hey

465
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:08,460
 You know

466
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:10,780
 God is with you

467
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,780
 Trust in him, right?

468
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:14,140
 pray

469
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:16,780
 So I want to encourage you to uh to develop

470
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:22,540
 A constant prayer life. It's very simple. There's no it's not rocket science, right?

471
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,260
 Uh, take 10 minutes

472
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:28,460
 The best time of your day

473
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:31,340
 To pray to god, right? You can take pray verbally

474
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,900
 And even non-verbally right and god knows, uh your heart, right

475
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,580
 Let's do that

476
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,580
 and um before we conclude

477
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:48,060
 Uh, let's recite this, uh, wonderful passage again, right?

478
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:51,400
 See

479
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,400
 philippians 4 6 to 7

480
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,900
 Don't worry about anything instead pray about everything

481
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,180
 Tell god what you need and thank him for all he has done

482
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,220
 Then you will experience god's peace

483
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:09,900
 Which exceeds anything we can understand?

484
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:16,700
 His peace will guard your heart and mind as you live in christ. Jesus

485
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,060
 That's our prayer

486
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,620
 Father no matter what life comes

487
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,420
 In our way and we come before you

488
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,300
 Knowing that you are near

489
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:30,380
 You're right next to us

490
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,940
 As we close our eyes and bow our head. We know that you are with us

491
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,300
 You're right next to us

492
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,380
 You know what we are going through

493
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:43,020
 Either it's loneliness sadness

494
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,460
 Uncertainty some difficulties in our lives

495
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:48,140
 on

496
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:50,140
 Just so many problems in our lives

497
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,620
 We know that you care for us

498
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,820
 And thank you for calling us to be your sons and daughters

499
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:59,420
 We come before you to pray

500
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,140
 With an open heart

501
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:04,840
