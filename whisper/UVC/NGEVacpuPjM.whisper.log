[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Okay. Okay.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Before we begin, I'd like to ask everyone a question.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Do any of you pray for the brothers and sisters
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   who serve on Sundays, especially this weekend?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   If you do, I want to thank you.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Because every time I give a sermon,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   I am filled with fear and anxiety.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Let alone today I'm preaching in English.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Lord, have mercy on me.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   Today I hope to discuss Romans chapter 12, 1 to 2 with you.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   And I encourage everyone to reflect more deeply on the message within.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Dear Lord, our God, we thank and praise you.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   We dedicate this hour to you.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Anoint the lips of your child.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   Let your words be spoken with power and authority.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   May the Holy Spirit work in people's heart as they listen to you.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   The book of Romans is a very important book in the Bible.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Well, you might say, like, every book in the Bible is important, right?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   By important, I mean that the book of Romans
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   has had a profound impact on generations of theologians.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   The theologian and philosopher Augustine in 386 AD
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   repented after reading Romans 13, 13 to 14,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   and later became a renowned preacher.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   His writings still carry great weight today.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   The theologian and religious reformer Martin Luther in November 1515
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   taught the main point of Romans is not about how a righteous God punishes the unrighteous,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   rather that God declares people righteous through their faith in him.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   This doctrine was the driving force behind his reform movement.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Before we dive into Romans 12, 1 to 2,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   let me briefly summarize what was discussed in Romans chapter 1 to 11.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   In summary, Paul explained the basic teachings of Christianity,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   emphasizing that both Jews, who seem to have a higher status and were proud,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   and Gentiles, who seem to have a lower social status,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   were both God's people justified through faith in Christ,
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   not by observing the Old Testament law or rituals.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Now, as we come to Romans 12, verses 1 to 2,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   serve as a turning point from the previous chapters.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   The apostle Paul transitions from explaining the true meaning of the gospel
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   to teaching believers how to live out their justified lives through faith in their daily conduct.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Title for today, "The Perfect Sacrifice."
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Let's start by reciting Romans 12, 1 to 2.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   "I appear to you, therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   that by testing you may discern what is the will of God,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   what is good and acceptable and perfect."
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   When I read this passage, I could easily relate it to how Paul felt at the time.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Since 2008, our family, along with many brother and sister,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   have gone on mission trips to China.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   We almost go every summer.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   But we haven't been able to go since 2019.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   But my heart always yearns to see my brothers and sister in China.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I always think about, like, how they are doing.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   I really hope to have the opportunity again to visit them,
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   ask them about their well-being, their gatherings,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   and whether they are still holding on to their faith.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Similarly, in the beginning of chapter 12,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   the apostle Paul, out of godly compassion and love for the brothers and sisters,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Paul encourages believers on how to practically live out life as a Christian.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Because the church was divided by their differences,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   they forgot they are following the same God.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   In Ephesians 4.1, it says,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   "I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   urge you to walk in the manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called."
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   The teachings in the Bible are not just meant for reading or acquiring knowledge.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   The ultimate purpose of these teachings is to know God and to put His words into practice,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   to present your bodies as a living sacrifice.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   In the Old Testament, sacrifices were generally about selecting, preparing, offering,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   and literally sacrificing animals to please God in religious rituals.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   There were various types of sacrifices, such as burnt offering,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   grain offering, peace offering, sin offerings, and trespass offerings,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   each with its own preparations, certain elements, rules, procedures,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   and they each had their specific purpose, all of which are necessary.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   However, what Paul mentions here is different.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   It is a living sacrifice.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Before we talk about living sacrifice,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   I want to first talk about the bodies mentioned in the Scripture.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   The word bodies in the original text refers to the whole person.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   This includes the body, the mind, spirit, and thoughts.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Furthermore, the word bodies is not one physical body, but rather many bodies,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   a community of faith, a community of faith offering themselves as one sacrifice.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   When a person believes in Jesus, it is indeed an act of offering.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   A person who accepts Jesus as their Lord Savior,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   acknowledge his or her sins, surrenders himself before God,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   declares that their life no longer belongs to themselves.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   They are no longer their own masters,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   and they ultimately choose to recognize Jesus as his or her own personal Savior.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   From then on, I no longer live, but Jesus lives in me.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   This declaration is a response to the Gospel.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Romans 8:11, "If the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   through his spirit who dwells in you."
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   To offer our bodies as a living sacrifice,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   the sacrifice mentioned in Romans 12 is made possible
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   not by whether a person is willing or not to offer themselves,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   but by the prerequisite that Jesus first offer himself as the perfect sacrifice,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   accomplishing salvation.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   It is the precious blood of Jesus that cleanses us from all sins,
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   enables people to be born again, become holy, and be called righteous.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   It is because Jesus first offered himself as a sacrifice
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   so that people can become a living sacrifice.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Hebrew 1010, "And by that will we have been sanctified
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all."
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Reflecting back on the days of my college years,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   when I memorized Romans 12 1-2,
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   I was only thinking about how mission-driven I felt
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   and how determined I wanted to be a good Christian,
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   offering myself as a sacrifice.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   The motivation behind offering myself came from my own selfishness.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   It makes me feel good to think this way.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   However, I didn't truly understand the focus is not on me.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It is not about how much I love God
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and willing to offer myself as a living sacrifice,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   but on how much God loved me that he sent his one and only son, Jesus Christ,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   to be the sacrificial lamb so that I can live.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   To offer our bodies as a living sacrifice is a true and proper worship
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   because it is a proper response to Jesus' sacrificial offering.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   For those who follow the law, it is the most natural response to the gospel,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   a response of gratitude to God,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   and a reasonable response of someone who understands the grace once received.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Verse 2.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   "Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind."
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   This present age has its own thoughts and lifestyle,
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   which believers who have received God's grace must discern.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Therefore, the meaning of "do not be conformed to this world"
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   is that we must be cautious and not let these trends and values worldview shape our lives.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Recently, during a gathering, a friend mentioned that because of his two daughters,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   he often watches Disney Channel.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   Lately, he noticed an increased portrayal of non-traditional family relationships in the program.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   According to him, the portrayal of these families and their interaction in these programs
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   are no different from traditional families,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   except for the fact that they don't necessarily have a father and a mother.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   They seem to subtly normalize non-traditional relationships.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   A few years ago, in Canada, a 46-year-old father with seven children
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   discovered that he was actually a woman.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   His wife could not tolerate his lifestyle, so he left his wife and his seven children.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   After leaving his family, this 6'4" tall man with his hair tied up and wearing a custom-made dress
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   transformed himself into an 8-year-old girl.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   He advertised himself online and sought adoption.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Not having to wait long, he was adopted by an elderly couple.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   He now lived with them and behaved like one of their grandchildren.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   He and her grandchildren spent time coloring, playing with the toy kitchen, playing toys.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   One day, one of the grandchildren of this elderly couple wanted to be an older sister.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   So she asked this 46-year-old man to be two years younger.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   So this 6'4" tall little girl changed his age again,
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   played the role of a younger sibling, and settled at the age of six.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I remember a long time ago when I was picking up my daughter from school.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   I saw a little girl waiting for her parents.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I casually asked her, "Your mom is coming to pick you up?"
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   She looked at me and did not answer.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Later, I found out that she didn't have a mom because she has two fathers.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   When I returned home, I thought for a long time.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I realized that I should never assume that every child's family has a father and a mother
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   because there are so many combinations nowadays,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   such as two fathers, two mothers, one father, multiple mothers,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   one father, one mother, or no parent at all.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   This is the current situation of our world's family relationships.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   I don't know how many different combinations will emerge in the future.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And I often wonder, where does the next generation's concept of family stand?
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   What kind of world we are living in right now?
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   As a Christian, how would you respond?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   As a Christian parent, how would you address the questions your children ask?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   If you are still solely focused on how to push your children to get into a good school,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   studying advanced courses at an early age,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   engaging in various activities like music, painting, chess, calligraphy,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   eating organic food, don't eat any fast food,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   I think you need to reconsider.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   I'm not trying to scare you, for I am a mother myself,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   but I genuinely want to know,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   when was the last time you considered your child's character?
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   The world urges us to put all this effort into making our child the smartest,
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   the most successful, most high-achieving individual.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   But sadly, we turn a blind eye to their heart.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   As Christian parents, we need to pray.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   We need to seek God for wisdom.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   We need to listen. We need to reconsider.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   Sometimes when my daughter talks to me,
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   she brings up topics that I never thought about before.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   And I don't always know the answer or know how to respond.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   In those moments, I pray in my heart, asking the Lord for wisdom,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   hoping at least not to say anything wrong.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Most of the time, I'm speechless.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   I'm just there to listen and try to understand more.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   I don't know if you have watched the UV YouTube channel recently,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   for I have done an interview with Pastor Julie when I was in Hong Kong.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   If you haven't watched it, I encourage you to watch it if you understand Cantonese.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   In the interview, Pastor Julie provided a few reminders.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   And one of them was that Christians are the people of the book.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Pastor Julie said she has a desire to teach lay people Hebrew
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   and make theological education more accessible
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   so that Christians are equipped to face future challenges.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   She hoped to help believers deepen their study of the Bible
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   and even be knowledgeable enough to feed those around them.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   2 Timothy 3:16 says, "All scripture is breathed out by God
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   and for training in righteousness."
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   Teaching shows you the path to walk on.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Reproof shows you where you have gotten off the path.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   Correction shows you how to get back on the path.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   Training in righteousness shows you how to stay on the path.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   The foundation of Christian faith is God's Word.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Christian parents have asked me how we can respond to current issues in various matters.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Unfortunately, we have to admit that we just don't have all the answers.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   So how can we teach our children in this day and age?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   My brothers and sisters, when facing the uncertain future
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   and the challenges of this world,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   remember that only God's Word is your greatest help.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   When you read the Bible, you may not understand or feel its significance.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   But day by day as you read, study the Bible,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   you are accumulating your knowledge.
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   You are allowing God to speak to you,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   allowing the Holy Spirit to transform your heart.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   And sure, you will slowly store up ammunition for the battle.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Only by drawing near to God,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   allowing the Holy Spirit to renew and transform our hearts,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   give us the ability to discern good and evil.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   Can we stand firm in this turbulent and unsettled world?
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I remember a scene from a drama series I watched when I was young.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   A person asked his jewel of friends how to distinguish between real and fake diamonds.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   The person explained that when he was young,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   his grandfather would let him play with real diamonds.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   As he grew older, his grandfather added fake diamonds into the mix,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   and he could immediately tell the difference.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Do you have the ability to discern the truth, brothers and sisters?
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   For those of you who have believed in the law for maybe two, four, or more than ten years,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   how well do you grasp the truth of the Bible?
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   How much time have you set aside in your daily life in God's Word?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Romans 12, 1-2.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   I appeal to you, fearful brothers,
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   by the mercies of God to present your bodies as a living sacrifice,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   that by testing you may discern what is the will of God,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   what is good and acceptable and perfect.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   The perfect sacrifice.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Jesus has already offered himself as the perfect sacrifice,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   accomplishing it once and for all.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   How will you respond?
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   How should we as brother and sister, a community of faith, respond together?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   A living sacrifice refers to the regenerate and save life
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   that is willing to live a life worthy of salvation received,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   offering oneself fully in response to the grace of salvation that we do not deserve.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   This is indeed the most reasonable and appropriate response to the gospel we have received.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   As Christian, we need to hold on to God tightly and strive to study his Word diligently,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   for it is good through God's Word that our minds are renewed,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   giving us the ability to discern what is good and pleasing to him,
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   that by testing you may discern what is the will of God,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   what is good and acceptable and perfect.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   Let us bow our heads.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   Lord, we thank you for loving us and for the sacrifice of Jesus Christ.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   You know us better than anyone else.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Please continue to guide our lives and help us not to forget what you have done for us.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   May we respond to your love by offering ourselves as living sacrifices.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   May the Holy Spirit remind and help us to root ourselves in your Word,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   so that we may stand firm in this turbulent and restless age.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   I also want to pray specifically for our brothers and sisters who are struggling and feeling weak,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   that those who are struggling may find a way out,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   and those who are weak may find your companionship and presence.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   For those who are sad and burdened, may you grant them wisdom to face their challenges.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   For those who are wounded and sorrowful, may you embrace them and provide comfort.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Lord, please strengthen us so that the more difficult, chaotic, and oppressive our lives become,
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   the stronger our hearts will be in seeking strength from your Word.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   As we, the church body, come before you, that we may be a living sacrifice that pleases you.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Thank you, Lord, for you will never abandon those who follow you.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And you are a God who listens to prayer.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   We humbly come to you with gratitude.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
