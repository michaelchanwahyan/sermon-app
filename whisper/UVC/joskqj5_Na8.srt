1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
 First, I want to record a quick and easy video for you guys

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:11,720
 This video will give you a basic idea of how to do Premiere Pro

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,220
 I will start from the beginning

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:15,420
 First, you need to import your video

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,980
 It's best to sort it out

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:21,020
 As you can see, I have written down all the camera

7
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,860
 Camera 1, Camera 2, Take 1, Take 2

8
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:24,900
 It will be much easier

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,860
 First, I will do the opening

10
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:30,200
 You only need one angle for the opening

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,200
 So you won't need a lot of things

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,200
 You can see the import is done

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,740
 Basically, you click and drag it to the timeline

14
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,740
 You will see it

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,740
 Like this

16
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:44,740
 But we have a lot of takes

17
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,740
 You can edit it here

18
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,740
 For example, you can play it here

19
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:52,220
 (There is a Christmas, there is a Christmas, it's warm)

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,720
 That's right

21
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,720
 But if you don't want to edit it here, there is another way

22
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:58,720
 Let's talk about how to edit it here

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,720
 For example, I want to do this last take

24
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:04,720
 You can put the cursor at the beginning or at the end

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
 You will see a red bracket

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,720
 First, press the cursor at the beginning

27
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,720
 You will see the video is cut when you drag it

28
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,720
 Like this

29
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,720
 Let me restore it first

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,720
 If I don't want to cut it like this

31
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,720
 What will I do?

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:21,720
 First, go back to this

33
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,720
 Press the video

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,720
 When I double click it

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,720
 You will see a small window here

36
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,720
 It will open a preview window

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,720
 I can play it here

38
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,720
 (It's so big)

39
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,720
 I can play it until I get to this third place

40
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,720
 I want that take

41
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,720
 (There is a Christmas, there is a Christmas, it's warm)

42
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,720
 This is what I want

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,720
 Let's go back

44
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,720
 I open a bracket here

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,720
 Mark it in

46
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 Start from here

47
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
 (There is a Christmas)

48
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,720
 It's not right, move it forward a little

49
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,720
 Go back here

50
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,720
 About here

51
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,720
 (There is a Christmas, there is a Christmas, it's warm)

52
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:04,720
 Stop

53
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,720
 Then I mark in

54
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,720
 Can you see this? Mark in and out

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,720
 This is what I want

56
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,720
 First, I put the cursor at the video

57
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,720
 Left click, hold

58
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,720
 When I drag it down

59
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,720
 You will see

60
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,720
 The part I dragged is the part I bracketed just now

61
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
 Not the whole video

62
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,720
 This is another way you can do

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
 You can see the bar below

64
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,720
 Zoom in and zoom out

65
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,720
 This word

66
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:33,720
 You see I just cracked that video down

67
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:34,720
 Very good

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
 Usually

69
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
 If I just need one camera

70
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:40,720
 I will immediately get the audio down

71
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,720
 Import the audio first

72
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,720
 You have to organize it yourself

73
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,720
 Label all files

74
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,720
 Otherwise, it will be troublesome when you do it

75
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,720
 You must label it

76
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,720
 Because all files are photos

77
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,720
 The number will be very messy

78
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,720
 I have labeled my audio

79
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,720
 Audio

80
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,720
 Put it in

81
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,720
 You see my audio is also very long

82
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:02,720
 Because the audio should be so many takes

83
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
 I know it should be the third take

84
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,720
 So I can pull it

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 Pull it to the last episode

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
 Okay, I need to synchronize it

87
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,720
 Not synchronize by myself

88
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,720
 Must use all programs

89
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,720
 So highlight both

90
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,720
 Right click

91
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
 Synchronize

92
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,720
 Must synchronize by audio

93
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
 When you press

94
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,720
 You see it lined up by itself

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,720
 Why is it lined up here

96
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,720
 Oh, that means tell me

97
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
 What happened

98
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
 I thought I got the second take

99
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,720
 Actually, I should have got the third take

100
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,720
 That means it can't line up

101
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
 Although I cut it

102
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,720
 But in fact, it can see

103
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,720
 In fact, the program did not delete

104
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,720
 It knows

105
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,720
 I am the whole video

106
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,720
 That means I did something wrong

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,720
 I actually want to get the third take

108
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,720
 I thought I was the third take

109
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,720
 So now let me do my wrong demonstration

110
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,720
 Okay, I actually need the third take

111
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
 Actually, if I want this part

112
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,720
 I will highlight both at once

113
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,720
 Trim

114
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,720
 Two videos at the same time

115
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,720
 This should be the third take

116
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,720
 Audio

117
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,720
 I play it once

118
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,720
 When you play

119
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
 Both tracks are on

120
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,720
 I don't want to

121
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
 I want to mute the first track

122
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
 I want to mute the original one

123
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,720
 Because I want to use the beautiful sound we recorded

124
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,720
 Now look at it

125
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:27,720
 Christmas is coming

126
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,720
 This is perfectly matched

127
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,720
 Because it's not manual

128
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,720
 Must use the program to synchronize

129
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,720
 When you play

130
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,720
 Why do you feel a little lacking

131
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,720
 Because you see

132
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,720
 The speed when I play

133
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,720
 It's just a quarter of the speed

134
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,720
 So when you play it for him

135
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,720
 There should be no problem

136
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,720
 But usually preview

137
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,720
 Don't turn it on full

138
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:46,720
 Because when you have too many running

139
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,720
 Your machine usually can't handle it

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,720
 And it's very slow

141
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,720
 You think things are not synchronized

142
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,720
 Usually I am one quarter or one eighth

143
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,720
 Depends on how big my video is

144
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,720
 Okay, the hard thing is coming

145
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,720
 Next step

146
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,720
 When you want to use multi-camera

147
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,720
 What to do when three cameras are doing it at the same time

148
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,720
 Do you remember every video

149
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,720
 We are all from three different angles

150
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,720
 First of all

151
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,720
 What to do is import this video

152
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,720
 I suggest you don't import all at once

153
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,720
 One take at a time

154
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,720
 So I put camera 1, camera 2

155
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,720
 And camera 3 take 1

156
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,720
 Import it first

157
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
 Then these highlights

158
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
 These cards are named

159
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,720
 So it doesn't have to be stuck together

160
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,720
 First, select them all

161
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,720
 Three different angles take 1

162
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
 Then right click

163
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,720
 Go to this one

164
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,720
 Called create multi-camera source sequence

165
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,720
 So what do you synchronize it by

166
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,720
 It must be by audio

167
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,720
 Then it will think about it

168
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,720
 Put the three videos together

169
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,720
 If you are lucky, it will be fine

170
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,720
 I have tried error message

171
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,720
 Maybe I can show you later

172
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,720
 Will also error message

173
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,720
 If it is an error message

174
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
 First, the first thing is to look at

175
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,720
 Will it suddenly show up here

176
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
 A called camera 2 or camera whatever

177
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
 Your take 1 but more

178
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,720
 Is multi-camera

179
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,720
 Let me see what the full name is

180
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,720
 See if I can show you

181
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,720
 Multi-camera

182
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,720
 If you have done this process

183
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 A video like this is played

184
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:19,720
 Actually it works

185
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,720
 Even if it says you have a mistake

186
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
 You don't care

187
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,720
 First, highlight this video

188
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
 Drag down

189
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,720
 If you see there is a video above

190
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,720
 V1 is actually video

191
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,720
 There are videos below A1

192
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,720
 There are two voices

193
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
 You are already in good shape

194
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,720
 You have done the first part

195
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
 I deleted it

196
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,720
 Sometimes there is an error message

197
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,720
 There is this video

198
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,720
 There is a multi-camera video

199
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,720
 I drag down and only have a voice

200
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
 Only have a voice or only have a picture

201
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:51,720
 What do you do

202
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,720
 You delete it

203
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,720
 Highlight it, delete it

204
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,720
 Do it again

205
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,720
 I don't know why

206
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,720
 But it happens to me so many times

207
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,720
 As long as you keep doing it

208
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,720
 Make sure

209
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,720
 Of course, it can't synchronize that video

210
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,720
 There is a reason

211
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:05,720
 You highlighted the wrong video

212
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,720
 There are two videos that are not the same

213
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,720
 It can't synchronize

214
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,720
 But if you are pretty sure

215
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
 Double check

216
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,720
 Those three videos are the same

217
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
 Same video, different angle

218
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,720
 But it can synchronize

219
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,720
 I just keep doing it

220
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,720
 The second one will be take two

221
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,720
 Push it like this

222
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,720
 Take two

223
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,720
 Do it again

224
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,720
 Let's see if there is a failure this time

225
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,720
 I am also lucky

226
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,720
 Sometimes failure

227
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
 Say error message

228
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
 Sometimes

229
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,720
 Can do it

230
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,720
 Can do it

231
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,720
 It has a take two multi-camera

232
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,720
 Ah, I will do it for you right away

233
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,720
 Why is this one?

234
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,720
 If you are in this situation

235
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:42,720
 I basically delete it

236
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,720
 Say delete, yes

237
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
 I do it again

238
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:46,720
 Import the video

239
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
 Do it again

240
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,720
 Do it until it works

241
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,720
 Usually only two or three takes

242
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,720
 The worst case

243
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:54,720
 Basically, you keep importing all your videos

244
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
 Then put the audio below

245
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:57,720
 Synchronize

246
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,720
 This is the first step

247
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
 First look at the video

248
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,720
 I have put all the videos of the multi-camera

249
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,720
 So the opening is the start

250
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
 Then take one

251
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,720
 Take two, take three, take four

252
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,720
 See different lengths

253
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,720
 Below here

254
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,720
 I have started to put the audio

255
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
 Synchronize the audio

256
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,720
 It's definitely not handmade

257
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:27,720
 It's done by a machine

258
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,720
 So I continue to highlight three

259
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
 Actually not three videos

260
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,720
 It's the video and the audio

261
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,720
 You see it looks like three boxes of highlights

262
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,720
 But actually because the original video is with the audio

263
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,720
 Then continue to do it

264
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,720
 Synchronize

265
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
 Always like this

266
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
 Audio

267
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,720
 Then I think about it

268
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,720
 You see it doesn't seem to move much

269
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,720
 Because these two videos match very well

270
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
 The audio and the video

271
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
 But sometimes there will be a problem

272
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,720
 For example, I will put the audio of take two down now

273
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,720
 You see that sometimes our hands

274
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
 Everyone's camera and video

275
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,720
 There is a slight difference between opening and closing

276
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,720
 Sometimes it may not be perfectly matched

277
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,720
 Sometimes the audio is very long

278
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,720
 I will do a demonstration now

279
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,720
 First, if I put the videos in a seamless way

280
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,720
 Which is nice

281
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,720
 And you have to do this

282
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,720
 But sometimes in the early morning

283
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,720
 If the audio is not synced with it

284
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,720
 You will find that this happens

285
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,720
 First, I will put the audio and video of take two

286
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,720
 Line up

287
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,720
 Synchronize

288
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
 Because when it is synchronized

289
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,720
 It usually puts

290
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,720
 See

291
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,720
 The video will move around to adjust the audio

292
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,720
 I don't know if it has anything to do with the order of highlights

293
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,720
 But you will see when they want to align something

294
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,720
 It will move the video

295
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,720
 When you see it move to the right

296
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:58,720
 It will actually eat into the next video

297
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,720
 So these are things you don't want to see

298
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,720
 It won't push the video below

299
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
 It overlaps and eats it

300
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
 So first, press Ctrl + C to undo

301
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,720
 So don't usually line up the videos so quickly

302
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
 Leave a line in the middle

303
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,720
 In case they will move around

304
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
 Shift to the next video

305
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,720
 Yes

306
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,720
 After that, you can line up

307
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,720
 How to line up?

308
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,720
 I will zoom in for you to see

309
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,720
 Usually, there is no problem if the audio is not lined up below

310
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,720
 I basically want the video to line up

311
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,720
 So you drag it over

312
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,720
 Make sure the video is seamlessly lined up

313
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
 If they are usually seamless

314
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:44,720
 You will see a triangle here

315
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:48,720
 That means it is perfect when it is pinned together

316
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
 But if you eat it like this

317
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,720
 You will see a triangle on one side

318
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,720
 Not two sides

319
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,720
 That means you ate into another video

320
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,720
 So when you drag it down, you have to touch it

321
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,720
 Oops, wait a minute

322
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,720
 I forgot to highlight

323
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
 You see

324
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,720
 Make sure to highlight the three videos together

325
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 Otherwise, you just move the top

326
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,720
 There is also a way

327
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,720
 If you want to group them together

328
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,720
 You group

329
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,720
 Here

330
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,720
 You move it, everyone moves together

331
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,720
 No problem

332
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,720
 But sometimes you remember

333
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
 When you want to highlight the video

334
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:21,720
 Ungroup it

335
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,720
 Otherwise, you move it all

336
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:24,720
 Move the audio

337
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
 Okay, let's continue

338
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
 The other two videos are the same

339
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,720
 After synchronizing it

340
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,720
 Line up

341
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,720
 You see me

342
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
 I'll do it for you quickly

343
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,720
 OK

344
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
 Drag it over

345
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,720
 Make sure the video is lined up

346
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,720
 Do the last one

347
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,720
 Take 4

348
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,720
 You see

349
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,720
 Actually before you officially add the video

350
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,720
 Actually there are a lot of these

351
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,720
 Line up

352
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
 Synchronize

353
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,720
 A lot of trimming work

354
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,720
 Have to do it first

355
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,720
 OK

356
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
 Synchronized

357
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,720
 Also all lined up

358
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
 So you can

359
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,720
 Start your first step

360
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,720
 If you are clear-headed

361
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,720
 You will see that our videos have different colors

362
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,720
 If you remember

363
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,720
 When we opened

364
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,720
 We said

365
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
 This

366
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,720
 Opening camera 2

367
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,720
 Used one camera

368
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,720
 So you see the video is blue

369
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,720
 And the other ones are green

370
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
 That is multi-camera

371
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,720
 Then

372
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,720
 You will see why it seems so random

373
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,720
 The first video is written Cam3

374
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:35,720
 The second video is written Cam2

375
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,720
 This one

376
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,720
 Highlight them with you

377
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,720
 What do I want to say

378
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,720
 Highlight them with you

379
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,720
 There is a difference when doing multi-camera

380
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,720
 I didn't remember

381
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,720
 When you highlight the first one

382
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,720
 When you click the first video

383
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,720
 It will take that angle

384
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
 Actually this is not important

385
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
 How to change the angle is the most important

386
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,720
 So everyone

387
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
 Need to know a button

388
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
 Is this

389
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:02,720
 There is a row of buttons under this big light

390
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,720
 You guys slowly familiarize yourself with how to use it

391
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,720
 Basically

392
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
 This is the marker

393
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,720
 This is Mark In

394
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,720
 Mark Out

395
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,720
 This color

396
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,720
 This Shift to In

397
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:12,720
 I rarely use

398
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,720
 This is

399
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,720
 Backtrack 1 frame

400
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,720
 This is Play

401
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
 This is Forward 1 frame

402
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,720
 This is Go To Out

403
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,720
 Go to Mark In, Mark Out

404
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,720
 I rarely use

405
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,720
 I don't know how to use these

406
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,720
 Export Frame

407
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
 Sometimes you can take a screenshot

408
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,720
 You can use this button

409
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,720
 Comparison View

410
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
 I don't seem to have used

411
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,720
 This button is what I want you to know

412
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,720
 This is called Taggle Multi-Camera View

413
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,720
 You can say

414
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,720
 I don't have it

415
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,720
 Why can't I find it

416
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,720
 It doesn't matter

417
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,720
 You go to the plus sign next to this

418
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,720
 There are actually many hidden buttons inside

419
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:48,720
 You haven't used it

420
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,720
 Maybe your button hasn't appeared yet

421
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,720
 So you can find the button you want to use

422
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,720
 For example, I drag one out

423
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,720
 This one

424
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,720
 You press it and then drag it down

425
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,720
 You can put it in this Toolbox

426
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,720
 Then click OK

427
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
 Then you can do it

428
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,720
 But I don't want this

429
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,720
 I'll cancel it

430
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,720
 This is very important

431
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
 I'll press it down for you to see

432
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,720
 After pressing

433
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:12,720
 My machine is a bit slow

434
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
 So I just saw it flashed

435
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,720
 It's called Media Blending

436
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,720
 Your machine is fast, it's okay

437
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,720
 There will be more cameras

438
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,720
 How do you see it

439
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,720
 First of all, it's the same as this icon

440
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
 The big camera is on this side

441
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:28,720
 The one on the right is the angle your audience sees

442
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,720
 So now the audience sees this video

443
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,720
 It will be in this camera 3

444
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,720
 Anyway, camera 1, 2, 3

445
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,720
 You label it yourself

446
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
 I have my own system

447
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:42,720
 Usually the camera closest to Mark Chan

448
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,720
 The so-called left-hand side of our audience

449
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,720
 Mark Chan's side

450
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,720
 Camera 1

451
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
 The front one is called Camera 2

452
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:54,720
 On the right side of our audience

453
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,720
 Camera 3

454
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,720
 I usually label it like this

455
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,720
 If you have your own system

456
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,720
 That's okay too

457
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:03,720
 Now the audience is watching in Camera 3

458
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,720
 You see here

459
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,720
 I divided it into smaller sections

460
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,720
 There are 1, 2, 3, 3 sections

461
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
 Because I only have 3 cameras

462
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
 I haven't tried it yet

463
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,720
 But I absolutely believe

464
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,720
 If you have 4 cameras

465
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,720
 Then there will be 1, 2, 3, 4 fill-ups

466
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,720
 If you have 5, then it will continue to split

467
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,720
 The computer also tells you

468
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,720
 You are watching in Camera 3

469
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
 You are using the camera 3 angle

470
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,720
 So it highlights the yellow box

471
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:31,720
 So the left side of this screen

472
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,720
 Just to let you know

473
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,720
 How many camera angles are there in this video

474
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,720
 We have 3

475
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,720
 But the big box on the right

476
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,720
 Is the angle that the audience is watching

477
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
 Why do you have to watch this

478
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,720
 Why do you have to know the split

479
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,720
 It's very important

480
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,720
 Because it will be very confusing later

481
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
 So everyone listen

482
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,720
 OK

483
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,720
 When I was watching this video

484
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,720
 I was watching and playing

485
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,720
 Play very slowly

486
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,720
 Because if your machine

487
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,720
 Is not that fast

488
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
 Actually doing this editing

489
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:07,720
 Is quite difficult

490
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
 Because it will keep splitting

491
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
 So I usually do it

492
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,720
 I will flip it

493
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,720
 I will turn it off

494
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,720
 Because it wastes a lot of memory

495
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
 When I usually watch the preview

496
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
 I will keep playing

497
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:28,720
 For example, I think I want to change the angle

498
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,720
 What should I do

499
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:33,720
 I will press this button

500
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,720
 Waiting again

501
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
 Yes

502
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:36,720
 There are two ways

503
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,720
 If your machine is playing fast

504
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,720
 I will set it to 1/8 or 1/16

505
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,720
 This is very important

506
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,720
 Especially because the more you open

507
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,720
 The slower it plays

508
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,720
 I have the 1/16 option

509
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
 Use it

510
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,720
 The screen seems to be very blurry

511
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,720
 But that's ok

512
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,720
 Because you are using 1/16 to watch

513
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,720
 Two ways to edit

514
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,720
 The first is to watch and edit

515
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,720
 When you keep watching

516
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,720
 The bar will move

517
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,720
 You can see a gap here

518
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,720
 You won't see any editing

519
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,720
 Until you call the machine to stop

520
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:14,720
 You keep watching and editing

521
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,720
 The clips will be made for you to see

522
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,720
 What is right for me

523
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
 You watch me do it now

524
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,720
 First, if you keep watching and editing

525
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,720
 First, you must press the play button

526
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,720
 While you are watching

527
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:30,720
 The machine is talking

528
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
 It is very slow

529
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,720
 It should be moving

530
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,720
 For example, I want to change the angle

531
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,720
 I will change to full screen

532
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,720
 You press this button

533
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
 Full screen

534
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:41,720
 Press

535
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,720
 It seems nothing happened

536
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,720
 You can see the screen has changed

537
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,720
 Keep watching

538
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:52,720
 For example, I want to change the angle

539
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
 I will change to Mark Chang's angle 1

540
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,720
 Press this button

541
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:58,720
 Camera 1

542
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
 Then

543
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
 It is working

544
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:02,720
 You can see it is not working

545
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,720
 It is working

546
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:06,720
 It will remember what you want to cut

547
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,720
 I have some delay

548
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
 You can see it has changed

549
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,720
 Ok

550
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,720
 For example, I want to stop here

551
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:12,720
 Stop

552
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,720
 You can see

553
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,720
 It is not cut yet

554
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
 Now

555
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
 After I stop

556
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,720
 The program will remember

557
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,720
 When I changed the angle

558
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
 It will cut the scene

559
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
 So

560
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:29,720
 Let me see

561
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,720
 I need to go back

562
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
 My machine is too slow

563
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,720
 It is hard to play

564
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,720
 While I am watching

565
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
 While I am editing

566
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,720
 It will help me change the angle

567
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:46,720
 (Laughter)

568
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
 It has changed the angle

569
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
 It will help me change the angle

570
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
 My machine is too slow

571
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,720
 It has delayed

572
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,720
 (Background noise)

573
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,720
 It will change the angle

574
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,720
 Next

575
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
 I will change to Mark Chang's angle

576
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,720
 It will change

577
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
 So

578
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,720
 This is a fast way to do

579
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
 Not fast

580
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:08,720
 It is called

581
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,720
 When you are watching the video

582
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:11,720
 You can cut

583
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,720
 For example, I am watching here

584
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:13,720
 Mark Chang suddenly said something

585
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
 I zoom to Mark Chang's side

586
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,720
 Look at Mark Chang

587
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,720
 It will be very smooth

588
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
 Very beautiful

589
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,720
 This is one of the ways

590
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,720
 The second way

591
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,720
 Is manual

592
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,720
 Not playing

593
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,720
 It is

594
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,720
 When you decide to stop

595
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,720
 You can use the razor blade to cut

596
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,720
 I delete what I did

597
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,720
 Now the video is beautiful

598
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
 I didn't cut

599
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:41,720
 The way to save memory

600
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,720
 Don't use the multi-angle

601
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
 Just play

602
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
 (Laughter)

603
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
 Just play

604
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,720
 Okay, everyone is happy

605
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,720
 I decide to cut here

606
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,720
 You divide the video into two parts

607
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,720
 The first part is still angle 3

608
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
 But I want to start from here

609
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,720
 Go to the front

610
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
 Because I want to see everyone laughing

611
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
 So

612
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,720
 I will open this button

613
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
 Here

614
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,720
 Manual

615
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,720
 Press camera 2

616
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,720
 You see this video

617
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:12,720
 Immediately change to camera 2

618
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,720
 The whole video will change

619
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,720
 Then you continue to go down

620
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:18,720
 Go down to this point

621
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,720
 I want to go back to the second camera

622
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,720
 So you manually cut it

623
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,720
 So from this video

624
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,720
 You want to change the angle of the new video

625
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,720
 Then the video will turn back to camera 3

626
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,720
 See it changed immediately

627
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:33,720
 This is manual

628
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,720
 Both ways are fine

629
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
 Your machine is fast

630
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
 You just watch and cut

631
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
 If your machine is slow

632
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,720
 Just like me

633
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,720
 Turn around and cut

634
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,720
 Not much difference

635
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,720
 It will be easier if you are familiar with it

636
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,720
 But what I want to say is

637
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,720
 First of all, I regret it

638
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,720
 After I did it

639
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,720
 I found that this video should not be camera 2

640
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
 What should I do?

641
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,720
 It's very simple, right?

642
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,720
 Go back to this multi-camera setting

643
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,720
 Just change

644
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,720
 Basically, the angle has been changed

645
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,720
 Anyway, you have to make sure

646
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,720
 When you change

647
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,720
 You highlight the video

648
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,720
 Don't highlight the other video

649
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,720
 You highlight the other video

650
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
 You press it

651
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,720
 When you find it doesn't work

652
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,720
 Because you highlighted it wrong

653
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:13,720
 You have to highlight the other video

654
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,720
 This is one of the ways to change the angle

655
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
 Very easy

656
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,720
 But another thing is

657
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,720
 Oh, I think this video

658
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,720
 Stay at camera 3

659
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,720
 This angle is too long

660
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,720
 Actually, I should have changed earlier

661
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,720
 Change earlier

662
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,720
 Let's say

663
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,720
 For example, my next video is camera 2

664
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,720
 Change it first

665
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,720
 Usually my machine is slow

666
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
 Just like this

667
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,720
 Okay, now you see

668
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,720
 This video is camera 2

669
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,720
 This video is camera 3

670
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,720
 Camera 2

671
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,720
 I found that I have to change to camera 2 earlier

672
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,720
 This video is too long

673
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,720
 What should I do?

674
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,720
 This is the third trick

675
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,720
 You see

676
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,720
 The so-called clip trick

677
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,720
 The first is red, right?

678
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,720
 Just shorten the video

679
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,720
 But leave a gap

680
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,720
 This red bracket

681
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
 Can only be used at the beginning or end of the video

682
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
 If you are in the middle of the video

683
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,720
 Remember which button to press

684
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:10,720
 Just put the mouse here

685
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,720
 Press ctrl to make it yellow, right?

686
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,720
 Then drag it

687
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:18,720
 The video will be seamless

688
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
 There will be no gap

689
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
 But what's the problem here?

690
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,720
 It will make the video shorter

691
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
 Your neck is not beautiful

692
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,720
 Ctrl + Z to come out

693
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,720
 How to shorten this video

694
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,720
 That is, the time of camera 3 is shortened

695
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,720
 To change to camera 2

696
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,720
 The time of camera 3 is shortened

697
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,720
 To change to camera 2

698
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,720
 First put the red bracket in the middle

699
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:44,720
 Not in the middle

700
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
 Put it in the middle of the two videos

701
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:47,720
 When you press ctrl

702
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,720
 You see this is a new button

703
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,720
 You have never seen

704
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,720
 This has two arrow buttons

705
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,720
 Then you press the left button to hold it

706
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
 Then you shift it

707
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,720
 The advantage of this button is that the length of the video will not change

708
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:07,720
 What you change is to shorten the time of the camera

709
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:10,720
 I usually use this

710
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,720
 If I find that the length of the video is too long

711
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,720
 I want to adjust

712
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
 I don't want to affect other things

713
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,720
 I will use this button

714
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:23,720
 You see the video won't change

715
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,720
 It just changes the angle

716
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:40,720
 This is how I change the angle

717
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,720
 And adjust the length

718
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,720
 That's about it

719
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:50,720
 In the next video, I will continue to talk about how to trim

720
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
 Because I usually don't do camera

721
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,720
 This is just a demonstration

722
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,720
 I won't change the camera angle

723
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:03,720
 After synchronizing the video and audio

724
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,720
 I first trim the unwanted things

725
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,720
 So the correct order is

726
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,720
 Remember the first time I imported the video

727
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,720
 The video has to be multi-camera

728
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,720
 Then put the beautiful audio in

729
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,720
 Synchronize the audio

730
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:26,720
 After everything is in sync

731
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
 What you have to do is start watching the video

732
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:31,720
 Then you see something that doesn't fit

733
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,720
 Or some jokes, just cut it

734
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,720
 How to cut

735
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:38,720
 I usually put a bookmark here

736
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:42,720
 Because the bookmark may not want to cut off

737
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
 I still think about some things

738
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
 Maybe cut off

739
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
 Maybe not cut off

740
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,720
 Some of course, the NG points must be cut off at the first time

741
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
 But some may be the topic or the sentences are not good

742
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,720
 I don't know if it will cut off

743
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,720
 I will use the above marker

744
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:57,720
 Mark where it is

745
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,720
 Then cut them

746
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:06,720
 The first video should have talked about the basics

747
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,720
 I won't talk about it anymore

748
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,720
 But there are some tricks that I want to tell you

749
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,720
 Re-tune

750
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,720
 Talk later

751
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,720
 Give you a little more example

752
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,720
 See how I cut

753
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
 For example, I am here now

754
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,720
 I found a place to stop

755
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:25,720
 How to do it

756
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
 I will play it for you to see

757
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:38,720
 I found that I can stop here

758
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,720
 I added a bookmark

759
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:41,720
 Actually, it's the above

760
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,720
 Add bookmark

761
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,720
 I found that the middle paragraph can be cut

762
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,720
 I added a bookmark

763
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,720
 Usually, after adding a bookmark

764
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,720
 You press it

765
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,720
 It will line up

766
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
 Then I will use the razor blade to cut

767
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,720
 I just happened to

768
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:58,720
 Because we remember that our machine failed

769
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,720
 So I will have a video

770
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
 I have a beautiful soundtrack

771
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
 Then add MP3

772
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
 So I have two soundtracks now

773
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:09,720
 One video

774
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,720
 And I zoom in for you to see

775
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,720
 Actually, the soundtrack that follows this video is here

776
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:16,720
 But I don't want to see it

777
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
 I just pulled it up

778
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:22,720
 Then cut it

779
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,720
 Then you can do it

780
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
 Put it back in your marker

781
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
 Do the same thing again

782
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,720
 Usually if you are in the words

783
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,720
 In the words

784
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,720
 These questions

785
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,720
 I usually zoom in a little

786
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,720
 Make sure I cut it beautifully

787
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,720
 Use the razor blade to cut

788
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
 Cut

789
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,720
 Cut

790
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,720
 Cut it all

791
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,720
 Cut all I want

792
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
 Video and those two sound clips

793
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,720
 Remember to go back to Arrow

794
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,720
 Choose your tools

795
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,720
 There are two ways

796
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,720
 First, I decided not to do this kind of thing in the middle

797
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
 Highlight it all

798
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,720
 Remember not to press delete immediately

799
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,720
 You press delete

800
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,720
 There will be a big gap

801
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
 Like just now

802
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
 You have to drag all the

803
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:00,720
 Pull it all back

804
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,720
 Very troublesome

805
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,720
 So how to do it

806
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,720
 If you delete

807
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
 I press Ctrl + C

808
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
 Remember to highlight

809
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
 What trick to do this time

810
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:10,720
 Just press Shift

811
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,720
 Then delete

812
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,720
 See it

813
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,720
 The middle piece

814
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,720
 Delete all

815
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
 But all below

816
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:18,720
 Will automatically line up

817
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,720
 That's one of the ways

818
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,720
 it is good

819
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:22,720
 There is another way

820
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
 Just

821
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,720
 I

822
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,720
 I will press Ctrl first

823
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
 I just cut one side

824
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
 Although these two sections in the middle

825
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
 Now we are cracking this section

826
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:32,720
 Is what I don't want

827
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,720
 I just need to cut one side

828
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,720
 How to do it

829
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
 After cutting

830
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,720
 I cut that side

831
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,720
 Then now put this

832
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
 Line up

833
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,720
 I want to go to

834
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,720
 We just said we want to go to this place

835
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,720
 Don't want the middle piece

836
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,720
 Highlight

837
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,720
 Remember I have a trick

838
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,720
 Put an arrow here

839
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,720
 Then press Ctrl

840
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,720
 Then I pull it

841
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
 Pull it to the place I want to stop

842
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,720
 Let go

843
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,720
 Same reason

844
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
 You can do the same effect

845
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,720
 Just don't want the middle piece

846
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,720
 Instead of

847
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,720
 Cut two pieces like cutting a cake

848
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,720
 Delete the middle one

849
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,720
 I just cut one side

850
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,720
 Then pull the whole video

851
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,720
 Pull it to the place I want to let go

852
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,720
 But remember

853
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,720
 After you make these adjustments

854
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,720
 The markers above

855
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,720
 Will all move

856
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,720
 So

857
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,720
 How do I delete these markers

858
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,720
 Go to the marker

859
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
 Right click

860
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,720
 You will see

861
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
 Clear all markers

862
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:31,720
 You can clear it all

863
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,720
 So usually these markers

864
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,720
 I do a paragraph

865
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,720
 Then do it all

866
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,720
 I have to delete it all

867
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,720
 Clear it all

868
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
 Otherwise I will be very lucky

869
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
 Sometimes in the middle of these cuts

870
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,720
 You will feel

871
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,720
 Coincidentally, their positions are different

872
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,720
 Will it be very awkward

873
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:46,720
 Actually, you see my usual videos

874
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,720
 Sometimes it will jump

875
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,720
 But how to make the jump smoother

876
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
 Is in the middle of these jumps

877
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,720
 Remember we can change the camera angle

878
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
 When you do this

879
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,720
 The jump will be less obvious

880
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,720
 And you will feel like

881
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
 You seem to be suddenly focusing on talking

882
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:04,720
 Talking about angles

883
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
 For example, Mark Sir said

884
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,720
 He will talk a lot in the middle

885
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,720
 I decided to jump the angle

886
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
 When you play this video

887
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,720
 It will be very smooth

888
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,720
 Because you seem to be

889
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
 I changed the angle to focus on

890
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:17,720
 The person talking

891
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
 People will not notice

892
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,720
 You are jumping

893
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,720
 Not so obvious

894
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:31,720
 Is it like a lot better

895
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,720
 So usually

896
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,720
 First make a video

897
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,720
 How to do it

898
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,720
 Remember I just told you

899
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,720
 Line up all the audio to video

900
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,720
 After that, don't care about the angle

901
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,720
 Don't do anything

902
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:45,720
 Angle is basically done at the end

903
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,720
 Just watch the video all the time

904
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,720
 Put some bookmarks

905
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
 Where do you think you should cut

906
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,720
 Where not to cut

907
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,720
 How

908
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,720
 Usually watched

909
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,720
 About two minutes

910
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,720
 Or if you feel very smooth

911
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:56,720
 Continue to watch

912
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
 After a few minutes

913
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
 You put all the bookmarks

914
00:29:58,720 --> 00:29:59,720
 Just go back

915
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,720
 Do your cutting things

916
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,720
 After cutting

917
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
 When you cut the whole video

918
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:05,720
 What will you find

919
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,720
 I found that the sound will be loud and quiet

920
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
 For example

921
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,720
 If you can watch Peaks

922
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,720
 You will know how to watch Peaks

923
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,720
 You will see

924
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,720
 Here

925
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,720
 Is a little quieter

926
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,720
 But when everyone suddenly gets up

927
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,720
 It will be very noisy

928
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,720
 Wow, what should I do?

929
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,720
 There is a way

930
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,720
 First is

931
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:26,720
 For example

932
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,720
 I found this video

933
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 When someone is talking

934
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,720
 Very quiet

935
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,720
 This paragraph

936
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,720
 Crack it up

937
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,720
 Now you cut the sound

938
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,720
 After

939
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,720
 You just control this paragraph

940
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,720
 For example, maybe Cindy is talking

941
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
 Maybe Leo is talking

942
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,720
 Very quiet

943
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,720
 Click on this video

944
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,720
 Then right click

945
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,720
 Go to Audio Gain

946
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,720
 It will ask you

947
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:49,720
 How much gain

948
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,720
 Here is actually gain and reduction

949
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,720
 Add and subtract can also be

950
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
 Now it is too quiet

951
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,720
 So I want it louder

952
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,720
 So you are positive number

953
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:57,720
 I usually start with 5

954
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:58,720
 You will see

955
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,720
 These peaks suddenly got higher

956
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,720
 Or I do it again for you to see

957
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,720
 Exaggerated

958
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,720
 You can see the difference

959
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,720
 First do 10

960
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,720
 Or 15

961
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,720
 Press

962
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
 You see the peak is much bigger

963
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,720
 Just adjust like this

964
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,720
 First do this adjustment

965
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,720
 Because this adjustment

966
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,720
 There won't be so much echo

967
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,720
 But if you say

968
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,720
 I still want to be higher

969
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,720
 There is another way

970
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,720
 When you click the video

971
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:29,720
 You will see

972
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,720
 The effect control here

973
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:32,720
 Will come out

974
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,720
 Change levels

975
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,720
 This can also change the volume

976
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,720
 But somehow this volume

977
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,720
 Change

978
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,720
 It will be a little different from the control gain

979
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
 You have to play around

980
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,720
 Usually if I want to change the overall

981
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,720
 Change the sound

982
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,720
 Add a little

983
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,720
 I will use control gain

984
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,720
 I found that the echo is not so strong

985
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,720
 If you just do level

986
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,720
 For example, from 0 to 15

987
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,720
 Usually the sound will be worse

988
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,720
 This is how you can control the volume

989
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:06,720
 But specifically sometimes

990
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,720
 For example, someone said a sentence

991
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,720
 Suddenly it's very explosive

992
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,720
 I can also change

993
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,720
 Change levels

994
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,720
 I will talk about this later

995
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,720
 Basically it's like this

996
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,720
 Do the whole video

997
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,720
 Cut all the boring details

998
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,720
 After that, listen again

999
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,720
 Make sure all the sounds are consistent

1000
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,720
 If it's too loud, adjust it

1001
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,720
 After adjusting all the sounds

1002
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,720
 Then go back to the last angle

1003
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
 Because by the time you cut the video

1004
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,720
 You will find that this video

1005
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,720
 Has been cut countless times

1006
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,720
 Then you slowly adjust the angle

1007
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,720
 Sometimes it will jump to Mark Chan's angle

1008
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
 Sometimes jump to Hale's side angle

1009
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,720
 Sometimes go back to the middle angle

1010
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:49,720
 That's about it

1011
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,720
 The order is always doing camera angle

1012
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,720
 Do the last last

1013
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,720
 Will do this step

1014
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,720
 That's all for now.
