[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Well, so happy to see all of you, and as I said, I came back last night about 9 to 10
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   p.m.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.200]   And safe and sound, good to see my family, good to see all of you.
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.000]   And again, we went as a group, 27 people, 12 of them from this church and 15 of them
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   from all over the place, Hong Kong, West Coast and East Coast.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   And what a blessing to have all of us together for the past two weeks and to walk the land,
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   actually.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.640]   This is one of my favorite pictures, and I have tons of pictures, and I want to just
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.280]   give me some time to reorganize them.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:48.600]   And starting next Sunday, I'll design a series and introduce to you what happened there.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.720]   This is one of the favorite pictures I have because we do have, this round, we do have
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.600]   a couple of semi-professional photographers, and they did take some good pictures.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.080]   And yeah, I don't know what I'm doing with my right hand, but in any case, this is one
[00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.600]   of the places that we went to in the past two weeks, and it was an additional place
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.600]   because we found some time.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:21.240]   So I talked to the driver, "Hey, can we just take some off-track places?"
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.140]   And so we went.
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.680]   So we were on that day, on this day, we were going from Jerusalem, which is high on the
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.640]   mountain, and all the way to the east, to the Judean wilderness, all the way to the
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.840]   Dead Sea and Jericho and all that.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.840]   Remember that, right?
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:44.800]   The road from Jericho down to, the road from Jerusalem down to Jericho.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.480]   And there is a road, right?
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.800]   And today is the Highway 1 in Israel.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.120]   So we were passing different places, and I talked to the tour guide, and I talked to
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.080]   the driver, "Hey, do we have time to go over there?"
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:06.040]   And we made a left turn into this off-track places.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:13.320]   And the place was called Wadi Q, Q-E-L-T. Wadi is in Arabic.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.880]   It means some dry valley.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:23.760]   Usually it's just seasonal runoff will go after the, go into the valley, but usually
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.160]   it's dry.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.600]   And what you see on the left is actually the Wadi Q, and it's one of the valleys coming
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.800]   out of the mountain of Jerusalem all the way to the Dead Sea Valley.
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.280]   So it's kind of exotic place.
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.760]   Yeah, because we were in this big bus, right?
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760]   27, almost 30 people.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.200]   And then we would drive, I wasn't driving.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.340]   I wanted to drive, but the driver was one, just amazing driver.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:00.880]   And he drove the bus on the cliff of Wadi Q. And we can see, you know, down the window,
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.760]   we can see the bottom of the valley.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.240]   And it's just amazing view there, right?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.640]   On the left, lower left, you see a monastery.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:18.200]   The monastery is called St. George Monastery, and it's a monastic community that existed
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.760]   since AD 400.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.920]   So it's been around for 1,600 plus years.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:33.320]   Generation after generation, there are Christians, Eastern Orthodox Christians who gather there
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:41.800]   and to live a contemplative life and keeping the tradition of Christianity.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.560]   So it's just amazing.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.880]   And this picture did not show up, perhaps it did.
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.960]   We were standing on, right on the top of the cliff and looking down to Wadi Q and St.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:01.880]   George Monastery, and on the other side of the valley, we saw a shepherd grazing the
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.840]   sheep on the cliff.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.560]   And there were probably like hundreds of sheep and running up and down the cliff and, you
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.520]   know, finding food, right?
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.960]   And this is actually Psalm 23.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.800]   The Lord is my shepherd, and I have lack of nothing.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:35.720]   And He leads me into green pastures and quiet waters.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.520]   And what do you think of when you read words like this in Psalm 23?
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.920]   Green pastures and quiet waters.
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.200]   We always think of the Scottish Highland, right?
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.760]   Where everything is green, right?
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.600]   This is actually Psalm 23.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   Green pastures.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.780]   Can you see anything green in there?
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.160]   Maybe a little bit, right?
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.160]   Maybe a little bit.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.400]   But that is the green pastures of Psalm 23.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.840]   Just enough for you, right?
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:11.640]   If you follow a wise shepherd, the wilderness is the place for grazing sheep.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.400]   You don't graze a sheep in your olive grove, right?
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.200]   In your wheat farm, right?
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.460]   Because those are for surplus, for humans, right?
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:29.160]   So animals, sheep and donkey and goats, they go out to the wilderness, which is just east
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.640]   of Jerusalem.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.920]   Often we read of land without water, land without water and wilderness.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.240]   This sort of picture is the wilderness.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.160]   And you think about Psalm 23.
[00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:49.120]   Green pastures is the little green stuff underneath of the rocks.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.760]   The little green stuff, you know, between the cracks and sheep can go out and find them,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.760]   right?
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:01.320]   And then they can get just enough, the essentials to be fed on.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.920]   That is the theology of Psalm 23.
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:05.640]   You see quiet water?
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:08.680]   No, just seasonal runoff, right?
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:10.000]   As I said.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:16.520]   But if you follow a wise shepherd, you get just enough water for you to live.
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:21.360]   Just enough for you to survive and even thrive in a land like this, right?
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:22.360]   It's beautiful.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   It's beautiful.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.560]   So, you know, in order to understand some of the passages in the Bible, I think it's
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.240]   so essential for us to walk the land.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:38.680]   One of my professors who passed away some years ago, Anson Rainey, he's a professional
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.280]   biblical geographer.
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:46.600]   He always, you know, when you take his classes, we always go out to the field, places like
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:47.600]   this.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:48.880]   We don't sit in the classroom.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.440]   We don't sit in an air conditioner, air conditioner room to listen to a lecture.
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:57.280]   Most of the time we walk out there.
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.980]   And sometimes we walk with him.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.160]   And Rainey would say, you know, this is the only institute, only classroom that we have
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.640]   a one-to-one map.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:09.320]   Indeed, it was one-to-one, right?
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:15.360]   Every step of the way is not the Bible map that we found in the Bible, but it's actually
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.200]   walking the land, right?
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:25.040]   So he always emphasized one thing is that we have to read the Bible with our feet on
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.040]   the ground.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.240]   Our feet on the ground, right?
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:34.000]   Not in the ivory tower, but with our feet on the ground, right?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.040]   So yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.120]   I haven't been to Waterkill for years.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.520]   I've led tours for the past over 10 years.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.040]   And usually because we want to hit different sites, different spots, and we want to go
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.280]   out there and to see as many places as we can.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.520]   But it was such a unique opportunity.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.680]   We can just pass through the wilderness and spend extended time there.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:04.600]   So there I was actually reading Psalm 23.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:11.400]   It's not the Scottish Highland, but God is always faithful, even in wilderness, right?
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.320]   Amen to that, right?
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.080]   Standing on the ground as we read the Bible, right?
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.400]   So yeah, that's what, this is one of my passions.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.680]   And I want to thank the church for letting me and letting the pastor to go away for a
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:27.960]   little bit and to be a blessing to many other people.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:35.040]   And most of the people, we go out to different sites and their first response has always
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.680]   been, "Wow, ah, yeah, I got it now."
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.680]   Right?
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:41.840]   Yeah, you got it now, right?
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:47.040]   So walking with our feet on the ground as we read the Bible, right?
[00:08:47.040 --> 00:08:50.520]   So perhaps next year you can go with me, right?
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:57.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.320]   Okay, we can go anytime.
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.280]   I always tell people you can go, you know, next week.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:07.880]   As long as you got a passport and you got a visa card, that's all you need, right?
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:11.080]   But I did bring something back this time.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:14.120]   So as a tour guide, I got some free gifts.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:19.040]   So I got this mineral hand cream from a hover factory.
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:21.600]   Yeah, so all the way from Dead Sea, right?
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.720]   So you can get a little bit after the service, just like a million, you know?
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.080]   Share, okay, share.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:31.080]   Don't drink the bottle, all right?
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.840]   Don't drink the bottle, all right.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.480]   So it's good to be here and I want to reflect on a short passage today.
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:45.280]   And I want to tell you, we, in order to understand the message, the impact of the passage, we
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:47.120]   have to understand the context.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:52.000]   That's why we have this theme of walking the land.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.200]   You need to understand the biblical background of scripture in order to appreciate what Jesus
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.280]   has said.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.320]   And this passage is Matthew chapter eight.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.440]   Let's read that first.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:09.560]   When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he taught them, the disciples, and he instructed the
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:11.960]   disciples to cross to the other side of the lake.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:15.440]   And this lake is called Sea of Galilee, right?
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.840]   The Lake of Galilee, Sea of Galilee.
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:22.400]   So they crossed to the other side, away from the crowd, and one of the teachers of religious
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:31.240]   law said to Jesus, "Teacher, Rabbi, I will follow you wherever you go."
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:37.180]   But Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens to live in and birds have nets, but the Son of Man
[00:10:37.180 --> 00:10:40.600]   has no place even to lay his head."
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:48.200]   Then other of his disciples said, "Lord, first let me return home and bury my father."
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:51.240]   But Jesus told him, "Follow me now.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.160]   Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead."
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.320]   Now first of all, this is a passage, one of the passages about discipleship, about the
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:04.480]   cause of following Jesus.
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:10.840]   I must admit the very first time when I was much younger, when I first read this passage,
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:13.440]   I was kind of confused.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.360]   This is actually one of the tough sayings of Jesus, one of the most difficult to understand
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.200]   sayings in the Bible.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:29.040]   And what he said is that, especially the latter part of it, verses 21 to 22.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:36.440]   Other disciples said to Jesus, "Yeah, I want to follow you, but first let me return home
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:38.520]   and bury my father."
[00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.320]   But Jesus said, "Yeah, go ahead and bury your father and follow me."
[00:11:42.320 --> 00:11:43.320]   No, he didn't say that.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.560]   He said, "Follow me now.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:47.560]   Follow me now.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.760]   Let the dead bury their own dead."
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.720]   Now that's what I call really confusing, right?
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:54.400]   It's really tough.
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.400]   What is going on?
[00:11:55.400 --> 00:11:56.400]   I just want to bury my father, right?
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:59.840]   So how long would that take?
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.000]   Maybe a day or two, right?
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.800]   You think about modern burial practices.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:07.520]   Can we just do that, right?
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.120]   And then I'll follow you?
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:14.920]   Because by all means, in Jewish culture, burying one's father is one of the most honorable
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:18.240]   thing for someone to do it, right?
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.880]   Especially for son, right?
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.480]   In that patriarchal culture, you have to honor your parents, right?
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:26.080]   By the way, that's one of the Ten Commandments, right?
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.620]   To respect and to honor your parents.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:30.160]   And what is going on here?
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:36.400]   And I think in order to appreciate the impact of what Jesus has said, you have to understand,
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.680]   again, it's the context, the background of the Bible.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:46.800]   The Bible is not something, you know, out of the blue, like a heavenly book.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.800]   It's dropped down from heaven to earth, and then we can read it.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:55.080]   And the message and the languages are magical.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.400]   No, the Bible has its own context, right?
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.880]   In order to understand what the Bible says, we have to understand the background.
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:02.880]   And here we go.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:11.160]   We have to understand in Jesus' time, burial is a huge thing, just as today, right?
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:17.520]   No matter you like someone or you don't like someone, if you know him and he passed away,
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:23.260]   you probably have to change your clothes, all black, and you go to the funeral home
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:27.960]   just to, you know, pay the final respects, right?
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.540]   It's a huge thing, but in Jesus' time, it was a bigger, huge deal.
[00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:41.160]   So in the Jewish culture, in Jesus' time, they would do this in their burial.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.860]   So from left to right, when someone died, what to do with the body?
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.640]   What to do with the dead ones?
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:56.880]   First, because in the ancient days, they didn't have refrigerator and ways or technology to
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:02.920]   preserve the body, and it gets stinky really quickly.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:10.800]   That's why someone died, and then they have to bury the body almost ASAP, almost immediately.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:19.920]   They have to put the body in the tomb, and this is the typical Jewish ritual of burying
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:20.920]   someone.
[00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.280]   So first of all, someone died, all the way to the left.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:29.000]   You're going to go into the burial, almost within 24 hours.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.560]   And then you kick in a seven-day mourning period.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:34.720]   It's called Shavuot.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.140]   Shavuot means seven in Hebrew.
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:43.140]   So seven days, they would mourn at home, almost privately.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:48.200]   And then, after the seven days of Shavuot, they would go into Shaloshim.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.420]   Shalosh is three.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.000]   Shaloshim is 30.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.540]   Thirty days of mourning, and then some of the members of the family and extended relatives,
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.720]   they will come to your home and visit you, bring you food or bring you gifts and all
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:07.500]   that stuff, and 30 days.
[00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:10.860]   And then you wait for about a year.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:17.420]   So you put the body in the tomb, and then it will take time for the flesh to declay,
[00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:18.420]   right?
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:20.600]   To be all gone.
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:27.860]   And then almost one year later, you will return to the same tomb and to gather the bones,
[00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.860]   right?
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:33.660]   If I die, you bury me in the tomb, right?
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:37.540]   And then one year later, you come back and you don't see me anymore.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:40.000]   You see my bones, right?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And that's what they do.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.740]   It's the second burial.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.740]   Second burial.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:50.280]   And they put the bones into some stone boxes called asherurim.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:55.520]   And these boxes, you can still see all over Jerusalem.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:01.500]   And this is one of the pictures of the first century tomb, and they call Kokkim tomb.
[00:16:01.500 --> 00:16:05.780]   Now this is what I said in the timeline.
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.860]   Once the body is there, once someone dies, and you have to prepare the body, and you
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.500]   bring the body into the chamber of the tomb, okay?
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.660]   By the way, this tomb is right next to a coffee shop.
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:20.780]   Yeah, it's very nice.
[00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:25.500]   You can have a coffee and a croissant right in front of the tomb.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:26.500]   Interesting.
[00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.780]   It's on Mount Scopus in Jerusalem.
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:32.780]   Anyways, you see the entrance of the tomb, right?
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:38.380]   Back in the days of Jesus, 2,000 years ago, the tomb is dated to the time of Jesus.
[00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:39.380]   It was covered.
[00:16:39.380 --> 00:16:40.860]   It was a cave, actually.
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:42.260]   So now it's open air.
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:48.820]   Anyways, it was covered 2,000 years ago, and the ceiling of the cave did not collapse.
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:49.820]   So you go into the entrance.
[00:16:49.820 --> 00:16:50.820]   Can you see that?
[00:16:50.820 --> 00:16:53.660]   There are three side benches, right?
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:59.780]   And then you bring the dead body on the bench, and you put spices and whatever you need to
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:01.660]   prepare the body for.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:07.580]   And then you're going to prepare it well, and then you're going to stuff the body into,
[00:17:07.580 --> 00:17:09.340]   you know, see the small holes?
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:10.980]   Those are called coke.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:11.980]   K-O-K-H.
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:20.220]   You stuff the body in there, and then one of the cokes, or one of the kookim, or kookim
[00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.460]   is plural, coke is singular.
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.340]   So as you can see, there were a lot of kookim, right?
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.940]   Because most of the tomb is family tomb, right?
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:36.140]   So my father used it, I used it, my son used it, my grandson will use it.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.540]   So there were a lot of people being buried in the same place, in the same tomb, because
[00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.700]   they belong to the same family.
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:47.100]   So that's why they were, it's like a refrigerator, all right?
[00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:52.620]   You put the body in the kookim, and then what do you do?
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:17:53.620]   What do you do?
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:17:57.900]   You go home for seven days of mourning, and then 30 days of mourning, and then?
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:59.020]   And then you wait, right?
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:00.100]   For one year.
[00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:07.260]   And the body stay in the tomb, in the kook, or kookim, and then let the flesh decay, and
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:12.100]   when everything is gone, you go back one year later for the second burial, which is the
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.180]   ossuary, right?
[00:18:14.180 --> 00:18:21.460]   Or you see, one year later, you open the tomb again, go inside, and gather the bones into
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.100]   boxes like this.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.100]   Some of them are decorated with some geometric design.
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:32.860]   Some of them are bigger, some of them are smaller.
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:39.300]   And the length of the stone box is the length of your longest bone.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:41.940]   Where is your longest bone in your body?
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.940]   Right here, what do you call it?
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:43.940]   - Femur.
[00:18:43.940 --> 00:18:44.940]   - Femur, right?
[00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:46.400]   Femur, yeah, this one.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:51.400]   So for me, I probably need a bigger box.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:57.540]   Anyways, it's just a matter of, it's a business of recycling, right?
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:02.240]   Because they are doing a lot of different stone work and stone building, especially
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:09.140]   Herb the Great, he built or expand the temple in Jerusalem so big, and that's why there
[00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:11.680]   were so many leftover stones, right?
[00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:17.560]   And they make vessels out of the stones, and one of the vessels is the ossuary.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:23.560]   So they will go back one year later and gather all the bones and put them all in the stone
[00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:24.600]   box.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:31.200]   And then you put the box by the entrance or by the, just on the side of the chamber.
[00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:36.400]   So the dead upon dead will be gathered in the tomb.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.800]   And then the new dead will be buried in the same tomb, and then you go through the same
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:48.080]   cycle, three days and, what, seven days and 30 days, and one year, you go back for a second
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:53.700]   burial, gathering the bones and put in the stone boxes.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:59.000]   So with that background, you can actually understand what happened, first of all, on
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   Good Friday.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   All right, Good Friday.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:09.120]   Good Friday, when Jesus died, his body has to be buried, buried, right, immediately,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.120]   right?
[00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:13.720]   And remember what time Jesus died on Friday?
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.720]   Before Shabbat, right?
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:15.720]   Before Shabbat.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.280]   Once Shabbat kicks in, you cannot do any work.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:23.040]   You have to wait for another 24 hours, right, to continue to work.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.160]   So that's what happened on Good Friday.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:33.520]   Jesus died, and quite unexpectedly, and the women disciples, or the disciples, would put
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:43.000]   his body into one of these tombs, and the Bible says it's a new tomb, a new tomb for
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.800]   the important people.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:52.160]   So they would put his body on the bench, and because Shabbat is coming, and they could
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:54.180]   not finish the work, right?
[00:20:54.180 --> 00:20:56.720]   They got to get out of the tomb, because it's Shabbat, right?
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:04.260]   You got to purify yourself in order to prepare yourself for Sabbath of 24 hours.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:08.480]   So they exit the tomb, and then when did they come back?
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:09.720]   After Shabbat, right?
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.720]   After 24 hours.
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:14.600]   And then on the first day of the week, it's the first day of the work.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:19.620]   So they return, the women return to the tomb, and they try to, probably they would ask someone
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:27.400]   to open the tomb again, and come back, and just finish off whatever they did not finish.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:34.260]   It was kind of in a hurry, so they didn't finish all the ritual of mourning and burial.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.120]   So that's what they were planning to do.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:44.540]   Returning to the tomb for the first burial, put Jesus' body into what?
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:46.640]   One of the kukims, right?
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:47.640]   Stuff him.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:54.720]   Stuff him into one of the holes, and wait for another year, and come back for asurery.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:56.920]   That's what happened on Good Friday.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:03.480]   With that picture, or with this timeline, you would understand what, oh this is one
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.600]   of the diagrams, this is better, right?
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.640]   The entrance is on top, or it's middle of the picture.
[00:22:10.640 --> 00:22:18.000]   You remove that big stone, and you get into the cave.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:23.360]   You have the center chamber, and then you have kukims.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:27.080]   In any case, with this timeline, you can understand what Jesus said.
[00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:29.200]   He said what?
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.120]   First of all, and other disciples said to him, "Lord, first let me return home and bury
[00:22:34.120 --> 00:22:35.800]   my father."
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:43.160]   But Jesus replied, "Follow me now, let the dead bury their dead."
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.840]   That's what happened here.
[00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:46.400]   Now I want to ask you a question.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.760]   With that background, I explain.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:55.040]   This and other disciple who came to Jesus and said, "Hey, first let me return home and
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:59.080]   bury my father."
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:05.800]   For this disciple, assuming his father just passed away, when did this disciple approach
[00:23:05.800 --> 00:23:10.160]   Jesus with that request?
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:12.640]   When?
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:17.880]   Is it before first burial, or before second burial?
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:24.120]   There's no way for this guy to have any room to come to Jesus and follow him and say, "Hey,
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.960]   first let me go back and bury my father."
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:33.160]   There's no way that he can find time before the first burial.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.880]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:42.920]   So it has to be this guy, when he approached Jesus, he already done his first burial.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.360]   And he's waiting for another year, right?
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.200]   Because the second burial has to be done, right?
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:55.600]   So when this and other disciple approach Jesus, it has to be between the first burial and
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.320]   second burial.
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:24:02.680]   So what he meant when he said to Jesus, "First let me return home and bury my father."
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.080]   He was referring to the second burial, the ossuary.
[00:24:07.080 --> 00:24:14.740]   So he is asking Jesus, "Hey, I want to follow you, but hey, let me have some time.
[00:24:14.740 --> 00:24:19.260]   And let me get the ossuary done first, the second burial."
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:23.480]   So essentially, he was asking Jesus for a year time.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:29.800]   "I want to follow you, but next year, because I want to get something done, right?
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.800]   The second burial.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:32.480]   It's not done yet."
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.920]   Do you understand what I'm saying?
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:38.840]   There's no way his father just died and then he would come and follow Jesus, right?
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.520]   This is the most dishonorable thing to do, right?
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.840]   His father died, indeed, it's pretty sad.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:50.520]   But he has already done his first burial because first burial happened almost immediately,
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:51.520]   right?
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.440]   There was no time for this guy to approach and follow Jesus.
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:02.080]   And this, another disciple actually is between the first and second burial and asking Jesus,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:08.040]   "Hey, can I have some time before I follow you?
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   Let me first go back home and bury the dead."
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:22.200]   Now in rabbinical tradition, for all the sons, especially the firstborn son, there are three
[00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:25.280]   rituals in their lives that are most important.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.200]   Think about your life, in your lifetime.
[00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:34.240]   What are the most important things that you could have done?
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:36.920]   You could have done, right?
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:43.800]   For the Jewish tradition, the first most important thing, most important ritual for all Jewish
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   men, the first one is circumcision.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:52.360]   It's done on the eighth day after the child is born, right?
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.480]   So it's done.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.720]   That's the most important ritual they have to go through.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:04.160]   The second most important moment in their life or ritual in their life is wedding.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   Get married.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.160]   That is the biggest day.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:14.160]   And the third one, actually according to ancient literature, Jewish literature, is the second
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.160]   burial.
[00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.160]   It's the ossuary.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:26.160]   Because you will finish the duty, the honorable duty of the firstborn son.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.240]   So it's not really the first burial that is important.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   The most important thing is wait for another year until you come back to the same tomb
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.160]   and gather the bones of your father into ossuaries.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:46.840]   That is the most important ritual and most important social honors one has to gain.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:51.960]   Now with this background, you understand the impact of the passage.
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:55.320]   You understand what Jesus is trying to say.
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:02.520]   Because the entire Bible from Genesis to Revelation, no one can claim the authority higher than
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:04.220]   your parents.
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:10.360]   Remember I said one of the Ten Commandments is honor your father and your mother, right?
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:16.000]   Your parents, in this kind of culture, is the most important people on earth.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.480]   You have to honor them.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:22.360]   You have to pay respect to them, right?
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:29.080]   From the first page of the Bible to the last page, nobody can claim the authority higher
[00:27:29.080 --> 00:27:35.000]   than your human parents, except God himself.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.800]   Only God can step in and say, "I have a higher authority.
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:47.640]   You honor me above all others, even your parents, even your grandparents."
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:55.880]   So as you can see, what Jesus is claiming is actually the authority of divinity.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.280]   He is not a normal guy.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:10.080]   He has power and authority and honor much higher, infinitely higher than any human authority,
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.880]   including your parents.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:16.600]   Remember I said I quote this line to you before?
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.480]   Listen up.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:27.680]   This line says, "Either Christ is Lord of all, or he is not Lord at all."
[00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.520]   Right?
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.480]   A.B. Simpson, founder of Alliance Church.
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:41.080]   Christ is all of all, otherwise he is not Lord at all.
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.720]   So my point is, there are two basic points.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.280]   Let me go back to this slide.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:53.560]   This passage is the priority of following Jesus.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:29:00.080]   Following Jesus, honoring him, worshipping him and serving him is above all.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.960]   Above your own emotional stuff you have to deal with, above your parental authorities,
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   above everything else.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:11.920]   And Jesus is the highest because he is God himself.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.240]   He is the Lord of everything.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:20.280]   He is over everything of your life.
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:22.920]   It's the priority of following Jesus.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:27.400]   And secondly, it's the timing of following Jesus.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:28.400]   I gave you the chart.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:33.960]   I gave you the timeline of a typical Jewish burial in Jesus' day.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:41.160]   And I already explained how it is for this and other disciples to approach Jesus.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:48.080]   This has to be after the first burial and before the second burial, the austerity.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:54.440]   So this and other disciples is asking Jesus for a different timing of following him.
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:59.960]   He said, "Yes, I want to follow you, but let me delay for about another year and then
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.560]   I will decide to follow you."
[00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:03.560]   And Jesus said what?
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.360]   "Let the dead bury the dead."
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:08.160]   What does it mean?
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:12.400]   With that tomb picture in your mind, you understand what Jesus said.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.580]   Because inside a family tomb there were so many dead people, right?
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:21.680]   In the past, your grandparents, the great-grandparents, the bones were there.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:26.580]   The dead were with the dead in the tomb.
[00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:29.160]   And Jesus was saying, "Hey, you need to follow me.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.640]   You have to follow me now."
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:39.360]   And also, if you understand the story flow, the story plot of the Bible, the Gospel of
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.680]   Matthew specifically, we read chapter 8.
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:49.960]   Chapter 8, Jesus already started his prophet ministry and he was on his way to Jerusalem
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:58.060]   and die on the cross, crucify, die, be buried, and rise again.
[00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.400]   How much time does he have?
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:07.760]   How much time does Jesus have between the disciple approaching him to the time of Jerusalem,
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.000]   his death?
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.800]   Less than a year.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.520]   Less than a year.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:18.240]   As you can tell, this another disciple did have the intention to follow Jesus, but he
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:21.920]   did not understand the time is running out.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:27.920]   If you don't follow Jesus now, you will never be able to follow him.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.440]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.400]   Because he will be gone.
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:35.960]   If you really need to follow this rabbi, if you really need to follow Christ, you've got
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:42.080]   to do it now because according to the story of the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus had less than
[00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:44.360]   a year on earth.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:50.040]   There's no time for you to wait for another second burial to be done, anything to be done,
[00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.520]   any stuff that you have to do.
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:32:01.080]   Just a reminder for us, if we follow Jesus, we better do it now because he claims the
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.640]   highest priority.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   And also, your time is running out.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.560]   You have to follow him.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:13.680]   Following Jesus is the biggest deal.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:22.080]   There are many matters in our lives are big deals, but there is no bigger deal than following
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:23.240]   Christ.
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:28.320]   There's no one greater than Jesus himself in terms of authority.
[00:32:28.320 --> 00:32:32.040]   So Jesus said, "Let the dead bury the dead."
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:41.360]   He's actually poking fun of the complicated burial ritual the Jewish had.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.440]   It's too complicated to follow.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:50.320]   It's actually challenging us to lay aside anything that is stopping us from following
[00:32:50.320 --> 00:32:59.360]   Jesus today, at this moment, not tomorrow, not next month, not next year, because who
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:03.040]   knows, right?
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:15.360]   In our past two weeks, I was with the 27 people on the trip and I think by the end of first
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:22.320]   week, some of the members are from Hong Kong, they received really shocking news because
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:31.240]   one of their relatives suddenly had a stroke and she's a young mother, 30-some years old,
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:38.160]   had a stroke on the street, didn't have any sign, and she had a stroke, a massive stroke,
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:47.720]   and she was immediately hospitalized in ICU, 30-some years old, and we were praying for
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:53.680]   her on our trip almost every single day, all of us, praying for her.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:34:00.480]   And I think she's still alive in ICU, but in a very critical condition.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:07.440]   What I want to tell you is that if you want to follow Jesus, this is the time.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.320]   Not wait until something has been fixed, right?
[00:34:11.320 --> 00:34:16.200]   Not wait, like, "Okay, let the church be better and then I'll follow Jesus."
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:24.760]   Or, "Let me take care of my relational issues and my work or my career, and even I won't
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.520]   follow Jesus until I retire."
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.200]   If that is so, I don't think this Jesus is what I want.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:34.600]   I don't think this is the Lord of all.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:37.800]   Jesus is not the God worthy of my following.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:40.760]   If I have to wait and He will become my footnote of my life.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:45.640]   No, Jesus is the content of your life, not the footnote.
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.280]   We are the footnotes.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:57.240]   So I want to remind you, following Jesus is now, not tomorrow, not next year.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:59.960]   Let's all pray together.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:09.480]   Pray that we will return and repent from our delay, delaying our decision in ways that
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:10.480]   you can think of.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:15.880]   You know, sometimes we have reservation of following Jesus because this or that, no matter
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:23.080]   what is this or what is that, Jesus has the highest authority and following Him is now.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:33.120]   Father, we come before you, we realize that your Son, Jesus Christ, is the Lord of all.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:37.880]   And I pray that at this moment, all the brothers and sisters, Christ, all the friends, we do
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:41.400]   have some stuff we have to deal with.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:50.840]   And perhaps some of the issues in our lives, our career, our work, our study, almost anything
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:59.720]   we can think of can be the barrier, the barrier of following you right now.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:04.200]   And I pray that you will listen to us, listen to our prayers.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:17.200]   Help us see that you are the God worthy of our praise, worthy of our following.
[00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:22.840]   And I pray that at this moment, your Spirit will cleanse us, lay aside all the issues,
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:28.240]   worries and reluctance that will come and follow you right now.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.640]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:31.760]   Amen.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.500]   (dramatic music)
