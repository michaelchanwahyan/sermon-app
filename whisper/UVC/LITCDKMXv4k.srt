1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Good morning.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 Good morning.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,000
 Okay, the mic is working.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Today we will be

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
 in the book of James.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
 So if you would all open with me your Bibles to the book of James.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 It is closer to the back following

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Hebrews. So I'll give you a moment.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 If you do not have your Bibles with you or on you

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
 we have it on the screen here.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 So we will be reading from its first chapter

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 verses 1 to 18 and then we'll open

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 in a word of prayer.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,000
 James chapter 1 verses 1 to 18.

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 James, a servant of God and of the

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 Lord Jesus Christ. To the 12 tribes in the dispersion

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 greetings.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Count it all joy my brothers when you meet trials of various kinds

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness

20
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 and let steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete

21
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 lacking in nothing.

22
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 If any of you lacks wisdom let him ask God who gives generously

23
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 to all without reproach and it will be given him. But let him

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 ask in faith with no doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,000
 of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person

26
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord. He is a double

27
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 minded man unstable in all his ways.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,000
 Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation

29
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 and the rich in his humiliation because like a flower

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
 in the flower of the grass he will pass away. For the

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 sun rises with scorching heat and withers the grass. Its flower

32
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
 falls and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 away in the midst of his pursuits. Blessed

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 is the man who remains steadfast under trial

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
 for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:24,000
 which God has promised to those who love him. Let no one say when he is tempted

37
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,000
 I am being tempted by God for God cannot be tempted with evil

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 and he himself tempts no one. But each person is tempted when he is

39
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 lured and enticed by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived

40
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 gives birth to sin and sin when it is fully grown brings

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 forth death. Do not

42
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 be deceived my beloved brothers. Every good gift and every perfect

43
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
 gift is from above coming down from the father of lights with whom there is

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 no variation or shadow due to change. Of his own will

45
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 he brought us forth by the word of truth that we should be a kind of

46
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 first fruits of his creatures.

47
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 Let's pray.

48
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 Father all praise all glory all

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,000
 honor be to you. For righteousness and justice

50
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 are the foundation of your throne. The heavens

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 declare your righteousness God and your people have seen

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 your glory.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 In the coming moments we ask that you would speak that your word would

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 be illuminated for us. Guard the

55
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 ears of your people oh God that their feet would not be stumbled.

56
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 Would you give them hearts that are renewed so that

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 their hearts would yield to you and your spirit.

58
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
 Call us to be still oh God so that we may again

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 find our refuge in you. All this we pray in

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 Jesus' name amen. Okay.

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 Let me go back to the beginning.

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 That's too far.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 So I think you'll find

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 that one of the most pressing questions that appear before

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 us in our daily lives is the question what now?

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 After all our lives are constantly changing

67
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 because time is linear it moves in a linear fashion

68
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
 we are continually picking up new responsibilities.

69
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 A few of us here are in school.

70
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Some of us most of us are in the workforce

71
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 and there are a few of us here that are new

72
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 parents. Those of us who are not going to be new parents we have

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 friends who are being new parents. All new life stages

74
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 all new circumstances everything is

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 kind of inescapable. And with every change

76
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,000
 in our life we're faced with the question what

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
 now? What should my life look like? What is expected

78
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
 of me and what do I do now?

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And this question of what now becomes even more pressing when the

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 changes in our lives are not just confusing or new

81
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 but bad. Financial

82
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 strain, relational strife,

83
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 deep, deep loss.

84
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 All of it is a heavy, heavy weight on our shoulders.

85
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 And to further complicate things you'll find that there is

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 more to this question of what now?

87
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 It's a Sunday morning. You guys are here. You chose to be

88
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 here. And so the question for you is

89
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 as people of God how are you expected

90
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,000
 to live? If you look again with

91
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 me to James chapter 1 verse 1 you'll find that the

92
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 audiences of this letter are the 12 tribes of

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 the dispersion. James a servant of God of the Lord Jesus

94
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 Christ to the 12 tribes of the dispersion. These are the

95
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 Jewish Christians living outside of Palestine. Those living in a foreign

96
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 and famished land. They are displaced.

97
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 They're poverty stricken. They are starving from persecution

98
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 and social exile.

99
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 In circumstances like that it's

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 almost natural for hardship to bleed into character.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 It's almost expected. Under this sort of

102
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 pressure the cracks, our cracks begin to show.

103
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 They widen to reveal already present

104
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 flaws in our character. And if we're being honest with ourselves

105
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 we can all recognize some inadequacies

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 in ourselves that are covered up and usually hidden behind our strengths.

107
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Like we see in verse 14.

108
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 Let me go to verse 14 real quick.

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:16,000
 Verse 14.

110
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 What threatens to drag us away can so often come from

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:24,000
 the desires within us that seek to produce sin and subsequently

112
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 death. It says, "But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed

113
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 by his own desire. Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin

114
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 and sin when it has fully grown gives birth to death."

115
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 Life is hard. Life is hard

116
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 and it makes us hard. And yet, and yet we find

117
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,000
 that James heaps instruction upon instruction

118
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 upon these Jewish Christians.

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 He gives instructions that call for those of the

120
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 dispersion to behave contrary to their circumstances.

121
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 To go against the natural flow of action.

122
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
 Look at verse 2. What does it say?

123
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 It says, "Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 Consider it joy when you face trials." James makes

125
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 this point. Let this be an occasion for joy.

126
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Joy.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 This is a strange and unexpected response to suffering.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,000
 It almost feels inappropriate

129
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 in some ways. But don't misunderstand.

130
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 Don't look at this and think to yourself,

131
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 I gotta pretend that things are okay.

132
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 This is not a forced joy, but an eschatological

133
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 joy. A joy that comes from looking beyond.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
 And seeing something joyous. It's a response of joy.

135
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 If you look at verse 2, James calls for his brothers and sisters

136
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
 to consider it joy when they face trials. And the reason

137
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 the reason to consider such things joy, such hardships

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 as joy is because the testing of their faith produces

139
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 steadfastness. Note that this

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 testing they speak of is not to determine

141
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 whether or not there is faith in you. It's instead

142
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 here to refine faith that is already present. And in this

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 refining of faith, steadfastness is produced.

144
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 You'll find that only through this refining

145
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 process would this facet of steadfastness

146
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 this endurance and perseverance exist within

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 believers. But

148
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 with all this talk about steadfastness

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,000
 you'll find that this is not the goal. Not just for the

150
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
 sake of being a steadfast person. Steadfastness itself

151
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 is not the goal. Instead, if you look with me

152
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 to verse 4, you'll see that the goal

153
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 and desired outcome of suffering trial is something else.

154
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
 Right? And let steadfastness have its full

155
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 effect that you may be perfect and complete, lacking

156
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 in nothing. The goal is not a specific virtue.

157
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,000
 It's not a particular fruit. The goal

158
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 of steadfastness is your perfection.

159
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 Your completeness. Perfection

160
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 is central to James' writing. It's this picture of wholeness

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 a finished and flawless

162
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 work. We see this idea of perfection

163
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 in verse 5 through the contrasting of two men.

164
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:00,000
 Let's take a look. The first person

165
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 the first person spoken of by James embodies

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,000
 wholeness. They are lacking in nothing because they ask in

167
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
 faith and they receive wisdom from God. The first person is

168
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 wise. But the second? The second person is

169
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 by the wind. They are double-minded

171
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 and unstable, doubtful of the security of God's promises for them.

172
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,000
 And they're torn apart with inner conflict. They wander

173
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 on and off every road they can see. In everything

174
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 they do, they are fractured and inconsistent. They're not

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 whole and they are not wise.

176
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 In all of this is the implication that God desires

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 for his followers to live true to their titles.

178
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
 Followers. What do followers do? They follow. God desires for

179
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 his followers to follow him. And more than that, it's implied

180
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 it's implied that God desires for those who follow him

181
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 to be refined, to be perfected, and to be completed.

182
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,000
 To be wise and be affected by

183
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 wisdom. Not in part, but in whole.

184
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 For the collective voice of scripture calls for you to not just be

185
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,000
 followers, but imitators of Christ.

186
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 That your whole being and every aspect

187
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 of you would be refined and conformed into the likeness

188
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 of the rock that is higher. And that from this

189
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 completeness, your actions would be good and pleasing

190
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 to God. See,

191
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 this that we talk about, this being wise,

192
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 being perfected, this result of suffering under trial.

193
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 It is a continuing of the work of God. The call to count

194
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,000
 all joy in poverty and humiliation is a command that is

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 founded on the finished work of Jesus. You,

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 having been saved, you are called away from being fractured

197
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,000
 and inconsistent. You are called toward being whole

198
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 with every aspect of your being.

199
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 The reality we see in James is that

200
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,000
 faith has an effect on

201
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 life. And that the culmination

202
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 of Christian life is a whole

203
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 and perfect conformity to the likeness of Christ.

204
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 Why?

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,000
 Verse 9, "Why should the lowly brother boast

206
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 as lowly? Because his position

207
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 in Christ is not lowly, but exalted. He is not poor,

208
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 but rich. Why then should the rich

209
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 boast in his humiliation? Because his richness

210
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 comes from his inheritance from heaven, not

211
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 the collection of dust on this earth.

212
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 Why should those undergoing trials and temptations

213
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 consider it joy? Because in the

214
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 trying of your faith, you and those around you become witnesses

215
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 to the work of God that is being done in you.

216
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 You see with your eyes that faith is present in you. And now

217
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 you're given this opportunity to exercise the faith

218
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 that is in you by placing weight on it, by trusting

219
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 it. Do you see?

220
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Do you see here? The command here

221
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 to count it pure joy is not another burden

222
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 for you to carry on top of the pains of life.

223
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 It's an instruction given to you so that you can live.

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 Blessed is the man who remains

225
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 steadfast under trial for he has, when he has withstood the test,

226
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
 he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those

227
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,000
 who love him.

228
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
 And so,

229
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 looking at all this,

230
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 do you want to be wise?

231
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:28,000
 Do you want your life to look like?

232
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 My brothers and sisters, in

233
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,000
 sickness, loneliness, bereavement, and disappointment,

234
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:40,000
 don't keep your eyes fixed on the circumstances of life.

235
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 Don't keep your eyes fixed on the desires

236
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 of the flesh. Instead, look

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 towards the object of your faith, the good and perfect gift

238
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:56,000
 of God to you, his son Jesus. And see

239
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
 that the promises of God are fulfilled to you in Jesus, in Christ.

240
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 Know that the work of Jesus will not be undone, and that

241
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,000
 the Spirit is in this very moment making you more and more

242
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 like Christ, and consider it all

243
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 joy. The task laid before

244
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 you is this. Joyfully lean into

245
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
 the work of God that is being done in you,

246
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
 and continue in that way.

247
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Become holy like Christ.

248
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 That was a little short, but let me

249
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
 close us in a word of prayer. Would you bow your heads with me?

250
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Father, we give you thanks

251
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 because you have been with

252
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 us every single second of the day. There is not a moment

253
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 that we are away from you or apart from you. You have

254
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 seen us and known us, and before we were, you were.

255
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 So, Lord, ask that you would continue to

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 keep your hand on your people, on these brothers and sisters of mine,

257
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 that you would reveal to them how deeply you love them,

258
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 that they would start there, not looking at their own selves or the things

259
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 around them, but God, let them look at you first and foremost.

260
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Would you make them rely on you, depend

261
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,000
 on you for everything in their life, that they might be a reflection of the way

262
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
 that you provide for them? Remove from them

263
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 all these obstacles that hinder them, Lord, and keep

264
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 them firmly in your hand. Give them a

265
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 stronger spirit, a motivation to grow,

266
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 and help them be good representatives of who you are.

267
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 We pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.

268
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 Thank you very much.
