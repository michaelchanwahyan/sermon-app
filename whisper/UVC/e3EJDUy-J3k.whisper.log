[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900]   And let's turn to the word.
[00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:05.060]   One question I wanna ask you is that
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.620]   where do you find in the Bible
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.900]   the story of the birth of Jesus Christ?
[00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.980]   All right, if you can talk to your neighbor,
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.700]   where do you find it, the first Christmas story,
[00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.460]   all right, so-called first Christmas story,
[00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.020]   where do you find in the Bible?
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.820]   Where?
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.780]   All right, so Old Testament or New Testament?
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.300]   New Testament, right, which book?
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.280]   Luke, okay, right, the third book of the New Testament,
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.280]   and then the first book, right, the Gospel of Matthew.
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.440]   Basically, you find the stories of the record,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.960]   the historical record of the first Christmas,
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.760]   the birth of Jesus Christ, the details over there.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.080]   So let's turn to the first book of the New Testament,
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.080]   the Gospel of Matthew, chapter one, verse 18.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.640]   Here we go.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.040]   This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.740]   His mother, Mary, was pledged to be married to Joseph,
[00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.080]   but before they came together,
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.520]   she was found to be with child through the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.480]   19, because Joseph, her husband, was a righteous man
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.160]   and did not want to expose her to public disgrace,
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.960]   he had in mind to divorce her quietly.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.360]   Now, everybody loves the Christmas story, right?
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.280]   Everybody loves the Christmas story.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   A young Jewish couple, about 14 years old, 15 years old,
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.640]   back then, people marry very early in their lives,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.640]   and in Jewish marriage, there were two stages of marriage.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.040]   The first stage, the first period, is about a year long,
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.600]   is called betrothal or engagement.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.160]   It's about one year long,
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.080]   and in the beginning of that one year,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.640]   when a young couple get engaged,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.940]   usually the parents arrange them.
[00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.440]   So they arrange them, and then they talk about
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.840]   the bride price and all that details,
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.920]   and then the young couple will be,
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.680]   technically, legally, they will be married,
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.880]   and we call them betrothed or engaged,
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.800]   and take about a year to prepare for the real wedding,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.320]   which is the second stage,
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.320]   and the couple will consummate their marriage relationship.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.960]   So it is at this point in the first stage
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.120]   of betrothal and engagement
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.880]   that we find the first Christmas story.
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.160]   So Mary was found to be with a child.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:44.100]   She was pregnant.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.260]   And then for Joseph, and you think about it,
[00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.680]   it's quite a tension, it's quite a tension,
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.040]   because all you plan for, all you arrange ahead of time,
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.080]   didn't work out, right?
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.320]   Mary was found to be with a child.
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.680]   And for Joseph, for the husband,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.960]   in this stage, in the first stage, the betrothal,
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.320]   Mary and Joseph, even though they are so-called engaged,
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.160]   but they are officially and legally,
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.000]   they are husband and wife.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.840]   So at this point, Joseph had two options, all right?
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.780]   One option is to divorce Mary properly,
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.760]   grab her to the city gate, to the court of the day,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.280]   and divorce her and just shame her,
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   because it's presumed that Mary is with child
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.560]   before they come together, before the second stage.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.400]   So it's presumed that Mary would have committed adultery.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.720]   And in the traditional society,
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.720]   and actually in some areas in the land of Palestine today,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.240]   it's so conservative that whoever found
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   to be committing adultery would be stoned to death.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:07.040]   So that's the first option for Joseph.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.180]   The second option for Joseph is to divorce Mary privately.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.780]   Probably would ask two or three witnesses
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.240]   and come together in a private setting to divorce her,
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.160]   give her a divorce certificate.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:29.120]   I think Joseph still had compassion toward Mary.
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.080]   At this point, I think he was trying to keep it down
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.000]   to divorce Mary quietly, to save Mary from public disgrace.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.920]   So here's what happened.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.300]   And Joseph, if you think about from his perspective,
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:55.300]   would he believe that Mary had a child from the Holy Spirit?
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:01.100]   Would he believe that it was really a miracle from God,
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.420]   because we got another version,
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.300]   Mary's version from the Gospel of Luke, right?
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:09.500]   At this point, Joseph knew nothing about the annunciation,
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.500]   about the news that the angel brought to Mary.
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.200]   So Joseph knew nothing about it,
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.460]   and it was pretty difficult for him to accept the reality.
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:26.360]   But this is where God came with his divine intervention.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.960]   He sent an angel in chapter one, verse 20 and following.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.560]   But after Joseph had conceded all of this,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:39.360]   an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said,
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.260]   Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.220]   to take Mary home as a wife,
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.300]   because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.760]   It's a virgin birth, it's a miracle, only God could do.
[00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.160]   She will give birth to a son,
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:54.980]   and you are to give him the name Jesus.
[00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.940]   And the name Jesus means he will save,
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.780]   he will redeem his people from their sins.
[00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.900]   Now with that, Joseph obeyed God
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.520]   in kind of a difficult situation.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.980]   Even though in the midst of uncertainty,
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.420]   you just don't know what happened next, right?
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.300]   So Joseph was kind of an example here,
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.100]   example of obedience and compassion.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.760]   So he took Mary as wife,
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.760]   and essentially he was adopting Jesus to be his legal son.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:35.780]   Now remember, Joseph is from the house of David.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:40.780]   He's one of the descendants of the Davidic dynasty,
[00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.300]   the house of David.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:47.300]   So in adopting Jesus to be his legal son,
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:52.500]   Jesus would be son of David as well.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.040]   Now why did all this happen?
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:58.100]   Matthew continued, 1:22.
[00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:04.680]   All this took place is to fulfill the will of God.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.660]   What the Lord has said through the prophet.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.540]   Here Isaiah 7.
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.820]   The virgin will be with child,
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:14.140]   and will give birth to a son,
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.860]   and they will call his name Emmanuel.
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.740]   Well, we sang the song,
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.780]   which means in Hebrew, God with us.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.020]   Now why did this happen?
[00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.180]   Matthew is quoting a prophecy
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.860]   spoken 700 years before the time of Christ.
[00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:34.240]   It was back in the time of the Davidic dynasty,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:39.240]   and it was about 700 BC, before Christ.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.340]   It was a wonderful prediction, right?
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:44.980]   700 years before,
[00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:47.700]   already prophesied the birth of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.620]   Now that is only half of the story,
[00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:53.620]   because as we know, the Bible is not written to us, right?
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:55.980]   The Bible is not written directly to us,
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:58.180]   but the Bible is written for us.
[00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:00.860]   Now with that said,
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.440]   the Bible always has a historical background.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.060]   There are tons of history,
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:06.660]   tons of background behind the Bible.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.020]   So we have to understand why Matthew
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:12.260]   is quoting this prophecy from Isaiah 7.
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:15.420]   So Isaiah 7, let's turn to that.
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:19.820]   What happened at that time was that in about 700 BC,
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:21.660]   there was,
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.940]   the dynasty of David was already divided
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.320]   into North and South.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:30.780]   The Northern Kingdom is called Israel.
[00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:32.980]   The Southern Kingdom is called Judah.
[00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.060]   Now what happened in 700 BC was that
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.740]   the Northern Kingdom, Israel,
[00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:43.700]   and other pagan nation called Aram,
[00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.900]   they decided to form a sort of a military coalition
[00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:51.160]   against Judah, against Judah in the South.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:54.020]   Now Judah was a much smaller nation,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:56.660]   and didn't stand a chance.
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.820]   So back then, the king of Judah called Ahaz,
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:02.740]   he was freaking out.
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:05.340]   He was freaking out because these two pagan nations
[00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:10.260]   are invading Jerusalem, invading the nation of Judah.
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.180]   So it was about 700 BCE.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:16.620]   This little country was under military attack
[00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:21.500]   by two coalition, Israel and Aram.
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:27.300]   So what happened was that when the king was freaking out,
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.600]   did not believe in God, did not trust in God,
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:35.740]   then the Lord told Isaiah to prophesize to him,
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:39.740]   to speak to King Ahaz.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:44.100]   Verse 10, the Lord spoke to King Ahaz,
[00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:47.580]   and he said, "Ask the Lord your God for a sign,
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.860]   "whether it's the deepest depth or the highest heights."
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:53.100]   So the sky is the limit, you can ask anything.
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.940]   You can ask a sign from God that God will confirm
[00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.620]   that he is with you.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.440]   God is protecting you, and you can trust him.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.980]   But King Ahaz said, "What?
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.780]   "I will not ask, I will not put the Lord to the test."
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.660]   Now that may sound really godly, right?
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:11.640]   I don't wanna test God, I don't wanna tempt God, right?
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:16.100]   But in fact, we know King Ahaz was an evil king.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.100]   He did not trust in Yahweh, he did not worship God.
[00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.620]   He has actually did something to save himself.
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:24.660]   So he scraped the gold and silver
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:26.380]   from the temple in Jerusalem,
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.220]   and gave it to another bigger king,
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:33.820]   which is Assyria up on the upper right.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:37.460]   Asked Assyria to help him and save himself.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:41.580]   So he has already taken money out of the temple treasury
[00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:46.580]   to bribe another enemy nation, Assyria, to help him out.
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.420]   So he did not trust God,
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.660]   and hiring the Assyrians to help him out.
[00:10:51.660 --> 00:10:54.300]   Now hiring the Assyrians to help him out
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:59.100]   is like taking money out of the offering box, right?
[00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:01.380]   Taking money out of the offering box
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.180]   in order to rob the church.
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:08.060]   So Ahaz was a really bad king,
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.780]   he did not want to tell the prophet.
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:15.780]   Now, but we're at this point, Isaiah continue his word.
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.540]   Essentially he's saying, even though you don't trust me,
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.820]   you don't trust God, how so, David?
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:28.460]   Is it not enough to try the patient of man?
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.960]   Will you try the patient of my God also?
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:34.940]   Therefore, the Lord will still give you a sign.
[00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:37.020]   The Lord will still give you a sign,
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:40.860]   some sort of evidence to tell you that he is with you,
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:43.540]   even though you are faithless, but God is faithful.
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.340]   And that sign is the virgin will be with child
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:49.460]   and will give you a son.
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:53.060]   And you will call his name, Emmanuel, God of us.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:56.180]   Verse 16, and this child will be born,
[00:11:56.180 --> 00:12:00.980]   but before the boy, this newborn child,
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.880]   knows enough to reject the wrong and choose the right,
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.540]   the land of the two kings, remember Israel and Aram, right?
[00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:12.460]   It's trying to attack Israel, trying to attack Judah.
[00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:16.300]   These two kings will be laid waste.
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:21.460]   Now, I highlight here, verse 16,
[00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.320]   before the boy knows enough to reject the wrong
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.780]   and choose the right.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:30.580]   It means when a child is born, continue to grow,
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.180]   and at some point, he will know what is right and wrong,
[00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.380]   right, what is black and white.
[00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:39.460]   Now, how old is the boy, how old is he,
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.940]   going to tell the difference between right and wrong?
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.340]   Not very old, right?
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:47.540]   Probably in a couple of years, right, two years old.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.980]   Know enough to tell what is right and what is wrong.
[00:12:50.980 --> 00:12:54.260]   So essentially, the prophecy of Emmanuel,
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:59.260]   in the context, in the background of Isaiah 7, 700 BCE,
[00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:01.460]   is saying in a couple of years,
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.500]   God will save you from trouble.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:06.460]   God will save you from the attacks
[00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:08.700]   of the two northern kingdoms.
[00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.840]   God will save you, and you will,
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:12.960]   you have to put your trust in him.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:17.900]   So God is saying, this boy will be born.
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.600]   This prophecy will come true in your day.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.260]   In a couple of years, God will save you.
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:25.660]   So you have to put your trust in him.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.020]   This is a test of faith.
[00:13:27.020 --> 00:13:30.920]   But King Ahaz, as we know, he failed the test, right?
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:32.120]   In the midst of difficulties,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.580]   in the midst of difficult circumstances,
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:39.300]   he chose to trust himself, right?
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.020]   Hire the Assyrians to help him out.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.220]   He failed the test.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:49.220]   But God giving this sign, this newborn baby,
[00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:53.820]   is to tell the house of David, he will be with them,
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:57.700]   even though the circumstances look very difficult,
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:13:58.620]   very challenging.
[00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:03.260]   And then we fast forward 700 years later,
[00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:06.300]   in the first century, when Christ was born,
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:10.340]   Matthew was telling us, this prophecy fulfilled again
[00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.620]   in the time of Jesus' birth.
[00:14:13.620 --> 00:14:17.940]   Now you're saying, okay, let me ask the question.
[00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:20.060]   So were there two virgin births?
[00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:24.700]   One 700 before Christ, and then one in the first century
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:26.020]   when Christ was born?
[00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:31.020]   No, no, there were not two virgin births.
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:36.020]   All right, because when Isaiah talks about this prophecy,
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:40.940]   he used the word for virgin, English is translated virgin,
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:43.300]   is actually young woman only.
[00:14:43.300 --> 00:14:47.980]   So virginity is not required, it's only implied, all right?
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.860]   So the word is amar in Hebrew.
[00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:52.880]   Actually in the Hebrew dictionary,
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.420]   there's another word, technical word for virgin,
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:56.260]   which is betulah.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.360]   Isaiah 7 did not use that.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.620]   So it's vague enough, it is broad enough,
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.460]   to say that in times of Ahaz, in times of 700 BCE,
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:13.500]   the young woman, not virgin, will bear a child.
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.100]   And then fast forward 700 years,
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:21.060]   in the time of the birth of Jesus,
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:24.340]   the final fulfillment of this prophecy came true.
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:27.420]   You got my point?
[00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:30.300]   700 years before, there was an initial fulfillment
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:33.100]   in times of King Ahaz.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.640]   Now in the first century, finally we see
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:39.420]   the ultimate fulfillment of the word of God.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:44.420]   So the promise in the Old Testament,
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:53.520]   always have, or often has, multiple fulfillments.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.460]   When God says something, sometimes it was initially fulfilled
[00:15:58.460 --> 00:16:02.080]   in his own time, but then there are multiple fulfillments
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.360]   until the time of Christ fulfilled all of them.
[00:16:05.360 --> 00:16:08.480]   For example, the first temple built
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.440]   by the son of David, Solomon, right?
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.040]   The first temple was prophesied to be built,
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.040]   and it was indeed built by King Solomon, the first temple.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:21.840]   And then several hundred years later,
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:24.040]   the temple was destroyed by the Babylonians.
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:26.560]   The people were in exile.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.720]   The Jewish people were in exile in Babylon.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:30.600]   And then 70 years later, they returned
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   to the land of Palestine, they rebuilt their own home,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.540]   and they rebuilt a second temple, another fulfillment.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.000]   And then in the time of Christ, Christ is saying,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.800]   he's responding to the Jerusalem temple,
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.680]   built by stone, built by hands.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:50.080]   He said, "If you destroy this temple,
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:52.640]   "I will rebuild it in three days."
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.720]   Now what Jesus was saying was that,
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.700]   "I will rebuild my own body.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.680]   "I will resurrect from the dead,
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:01.260]   "and my body will be the new temple."
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:03.140]   That is the ultimate fulfillment.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.120]   Now what I'm saying is, in the Old Testament,
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.120]   when you find some prophecies,
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:09.480]   it's not necessarily it has to be fulfilled
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.880]   many, many years later.
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:15.440]   There are many different multiple fulfillments along the way.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:20.440]   And this is also true for Isaiah 7, the Emmanuel prophecy.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:24.600]   So when Matthew penned the gospel,
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:29.960]   he was checking many different accounts,
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.000]   many different stories, some he had heard before,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:35.440]   because he followed Jesus for a few years.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.520]   He's one of the 12 disciples.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:40.880]   He knows something about the story of Christ.
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:44.380]   He also gathered and collected different stories
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:47.040]   from different disciples of different traditions.
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:50.120]   He put together the gospel of Matthew.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:51.860]   Now the question for you is,
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:53.200]   the very beginning I asked you,
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.040]   where in the New Testament you can find
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:58.560]   the story of first Christmas, right?
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:03.600]   One of them is gospel of Matthew, of course, right?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:07.640]   Now, why was gospel of Matthew written?
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:14.740]   Why did Matthew decide to write a gospel of Matthew?
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:18.560]   Where you find the life of Christ,
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.340]   different story stitched together,
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:25.080]   come together as one book, gospel of Matthew.
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:28.220]   Again, it's the historical background.
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:29.960]   Because in the first century,
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:33.400]   when Matthew wrote the first gospel, the gospel of Matthew,
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:36.080]   the young church was in crisis.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.360]   It was under the Roman Empire.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:40.160]   It was being persecuted.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.840]   And the young church being persecuted,
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.160]   the people in the church, many of them are Jewish believers,
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.480]   they need to reconsolidate their faith.
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:52.960]   They need to understand what they really believe in.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:57.960]   That's why Matthew decided to write the gospel of Matthew.
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:19:01.860]   To tell the church what you should believe.
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.700]   And to strengthen the faith of the church.
[00:19:04.700 --> 00:19:08.100]   So Matthew is collecting different stories of gospel.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:12.140]   And then he traced the story and find a certain pattern.
[00:19:12.140 --> 00:19:16.540]   For Jesus, when he looks at the birth of Jesus,
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:18.980]   the first Christmas, he found that Jesus
[00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:21.020]   is indeed the son of David.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:24.460]   Because Joseph is the son of David.
[00:19:24.460 --> 00:19:27.160]   And that's why Matthew, in chapter one,
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.300]   if you turn to the very first chapter of the New Testament,
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:32.140]   it's not very appealing.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.740]   It's the genealogy of Jesus, right?
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:39.740]   So he traces from Abraham, Isaac, Jacob,
[00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.580]   generation after generation to King David,
[00:19:42.580 --> 00:19:46.540]   the establishment of the kingdom of God on earth, King David.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:49.580]   And then he traced after David, Solomon,
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.400]   and all the kings in the divided kingdom.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.160]   And then finally it comes to the Babylonian exile.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.460]   When everything seems to be over,
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:01.460]   when the nation of Judah was attacked
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:04.020]   and destroyed by the Babylonians,
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:07.440]   everything seems game over,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.100]   he continued to trace the genealogy.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.740]   No, God is still faithful.
[00:20:11.740 --> 00:20:14.820]   And generation after generation from exile,
[00:20:14.820 --> 00:20:18.300]   he traced another generation of Sababel,
[00:20:18.300 --> 00:20:21.260]   Jewish people who come back to Jerusalem
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:22.900]   and rebuild the temple.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:26.800]   And generation after generation doesn't end.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.560]   And finally it comes to Joseph and Mary.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.240]   And then Jesus.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:36.000]   That's why in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter one,
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.800]   after tracing the genealogy of Jesus Christ from Abraham,
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.240]   David to exile to Jesus Christ,
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:43.760]   verse 17, it says,
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:48.760]   there were 14 generations in all from Abraham to David.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.480]   And then from David to the exile to Babylon,
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.040]   there were 14 generations.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.520]   And then from exile to the coming of Christ,
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:03.000]   to Christ, Jesus, there were also 14 generations.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:05.800]   So he divided the entire Old Testament,
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:10.060]   all together about 39 books together.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:13.160]   Matthew divides the entire Old Testament history
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.780]   into three periods, 14 generations for each.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:19.620]   Now the question for you, why 14?
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.660]   Why 14?
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:23.860]   All right, why 14?
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.180]   Now in the ancient Hebrew culture,
[00:21:27.180 --> 00:21:29.740]   they didn't have the Arabic numerals,
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.760]   like what we do have, one, two, three, four, and so on.
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:38.580]   Every letter of the 22 letters of Hebrew,
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:42.940]   each alphabet represents a numerical value.
[00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:45.300]   Like the first one, aleph, is one.
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:47.660]   The second one, bay, is two.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.740]   Gimel is three.
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.260]   Dalet is four.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.460]   And then hey is five, and so on.
[00:21:52.460 --> 00:21:56.260]   Val is the sixth letter, is number six.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:59.580]   So they used different letters to represent different numbers.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:04.820]   Now David, King David's name,
[00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:07.300]   it was originally written without the val.
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:10.740]   So you take out the a and i, you've got dvd.
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.260]   So David was originally written as dvd or dwd.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:19.180]   D is the fourth letter, and v, or w, is the sixth letter.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:23.460]   So you add them all up, and you get 14.
[00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:28.460]   So 14 is the royal number for the King David's dynasty.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.940]   So when Matthew was tracing the Christmas story,
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:34.540]   he find that the long genealogy of Jesus Christ
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:37.300]   actually is 14 generations for three periods.
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:40.420]   And of course, as the son of David,
[00:22:40.420 --> 00:22:43.020]   the real son of David, the final son of David,
[00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:47.580]   his number is also 14, right?
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.060]   14.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:53.100]   The birth of Jesus Christ is so much more
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.380]   than the miracle birth of virgin birth.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:58.100]   Okay, so note this.
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:23:02.380]   Of course, Jesus was born as a virgin,
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:04.100]   the divinity of Christ.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.260]   He is the deity, he's 100% God and 100% human.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:09.300]   What a miracle.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.940]   It was indeed a miracle.
[00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:14.500]   But the prophecy in Isaiah 7, the Emmanuel sign,
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:17.900]   is so much more than just the miraculous nature
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.060]   of the birth.
[00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:21.020]   It is the timing of the birth.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.980]   700 years before Christ, in time of King Ahaz.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.740]   It was just at the right time, God save his people.
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:33.540]   Here in the first century, God did the same thing.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:35.860]   Right, so Matthew is trying to rethink,
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:40.700]   trace the pattern in the first Christmas story.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:42.460]   And the story doesn't stop there,
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.140]   because in chapter two of the Gospel of Matthew,
[00:23:45.140 --> 00:23:48.940]   you remember the so-called three wise men, right?
[00:23:48.940 --> 00:23:50.700]   The three wise men from the east,
[00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:54.100]   they came to Jerusalem to worship the newborn king.
[00:23:54.100 --> 00:23:57.220]   They came to the town Bethlehem.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:03.180]   Now Bethlehem is the hometown of David, right?
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.020]   Remember that?
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:08.660]   The hometown of David was Bethlehem,
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:12.580]   and Christ Jesus was born in Bethlehem.
[00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:15.700]   So this, Herod the Great, at the time,
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.940]   it was Herod the Great, the evil king,
[00:24:17.940 --> 00:24:22.140]   he was an other pharaoh-like oppressor,
[00:24:22.140 --> 00:24:24.380]   trying to persecute the baby Jesus, right?
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:26.420]   The boy Jesus, trying to kill him.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:31.420]   So Joseph took his entire family, Jesus and Mary,
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:37.620]   became a refugee, and went down to Egypt by night.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:43.940]   So Matthew, thinking about this story,
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:49.980]   in chapter two, verse 15, why did this happen?
[00:24:49.980 --> 00:24:53.300]   Jesus became a refugee, went down to Egypt.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:58.980]   He said, "So it is, to fulfill what God has said
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.740]   "through the prophet."
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:05.740]   And he is quoting from Hosea, chapter 11.
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.980]   It says, "Out of Egypt I call my son."
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.100]   Out of Egypt I call my son.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:15.540]   Now you check, you go back if you have time,
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:18.140]   go back to the book of Hosea in the Old Testament.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:20.320]   It was not about prediction.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:23.020]   It was not about predicting 700 years later,
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:24.540]   or so many years later,
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:26.980]   then Jesus will come out of Egypt.
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:28.580]   The entire chapter is talking about
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.780]   God's commitment to his people.
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:36.620]   When they were suffering in the land of slavery,
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:41.100]   in the land of bondage, to be slaves for Pharaoh.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:46.260]   In Hosea 11, God is saying, "I will not abandon you.
[00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:47.780]   "I will be with you.
[00:25:47.780 --> 00:25:49.540]   "I will rescue you out of Egypt.
[00:25:49.540 --> 00:25:52.700]   "There will be an exodus."
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:55.220]   So Matthew is chasing the Christmas story.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:57.220]   He is seeing a pattern.
[00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:00.820]   Jesus went down to Egypt, and he will come out of Egypt
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:04.820]   because God will not forget his people.
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:07.900]   In Jesus, there will be the real exodus.
[00:26:07.900 --> 00:26:11.660]   In the story of Jesus, he also went through exodus,
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.860]   just like the Old Testament people of Israel.
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:15.020]   They went down to Egypt,
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.900]   and they came out of Egypt in the exodus.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:22.900]   And in Jesus, finally, we see the real final exodus.
[00:26:22.900 --> 00:26:26.020]   And the story continues.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.640]   King Herod tried to kill the boys
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:31.820]   under two years old in Bethlehem.
[00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.500]   As you can see, it's horrible.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:36.620]   It's a horrible story.
[00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:39.820]   Under two years old, all the boys, he slaughtered them.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:45.260]   2.17, Matthew sees another pattern.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:48.060]   He said, "This happened is to fulfill
[00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:51.020]   "what was said by Prophet Jeremiah.
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:56.940]   "A voice is heard in Ramah, weeping and mourning.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.980]   "Rachel, weeping for her children
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.260]   "and refusing to be comforted
[00:27:01.260 --> 00:27:03.700]   "because the children are no more."
[00:27:03.700 --> 00:27:06.860]   You see the pattern here.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.460]   He's quoting Jeremiah 31.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:14.940]   And Jeremiah was about 500 years before Christ.
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:19.060]   What Jeremiah was talking about in chapter 31
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:24.020]   is that when the Babylonian slaughtered the Jewish people,
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:25.820]   killed them one by one,
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:30.500]   and captured them at a place called Ramah,
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.620]   and a place called Ramah,
[00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.140]   and Ramah happened to be just close to,
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.620]   right next to Bethlehem.
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:39.860]   It was tragic for the nation
[00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.420]   because the nation was finally, seems like game over.
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:48.420]   And all the men of Judah was being captured at Ramah,
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:54.260]   and they marched from Ramah all the way out to Babylon.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.700]   It was in the time of exile.
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:00.180]   It was in the time of weeping and loss.
[00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:04.220]   Lost the men, the children of Judah.
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.660]   Jeremiah 31.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:12.420]   You keep on seeing the context there.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   If you check what Jeremiah 31 has to say next,
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.100]   it's not just about the exile.
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:24.340]   Because 31, Jeremiah 31,
[00:28:24.340 --> 00:28:27.620]   is about the return, the hope of return.
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.660]   Even though the people of God is in exile,
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:35.540]   God will wipe away their tears.
[00:28:35.540 --> 00:28:37.420]   God will comfort them again,
[00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:39.820]   will bring them back to the land,
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.380]   will give them back to homeland.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.940]   You see the pattern here as Matthew sees it.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:51.900]   In Jesus, we see the real return,
[00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.580]   the true return to homeland.
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.340]   The true home is found in Jesus Christ.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:02.180]   He will wipe away our tears of exile.
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:06.260]   Early on, we were praying for our community.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.500]   Tragic news that we receive.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.020]   So in the middle of last week,
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.740]   one of my friends called me.
[00:29:16.740 --> 00:29:20.860]   He's a very close friend of the victim's family.
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:23.740]   He called me and said, "Hey, Mark,
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:28.100]   "so-and-so just died from a gunshot."
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:31.340]   I could not believe that.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:33.540]   I could not believe that.
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.700]   What a tragic news.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.780]   And other one hitting our community.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:40.020]   So in times like this,
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:42.860]   we always ask ourselves, where's our home?
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:48.100]   Where do we go that we have real security,
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.740]   that we'll have real hope?
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:54.260]   We'll find this place to be really like our home.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.060]   We fear our insecurity.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:30:02.060]   We fear about the craziness going on in our world.
[00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:03.700]   We don't feel like home.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:07.500]   That is what happened to the Jewish people.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.140]   Yes, they returned from Babylonian exile,
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:13.620]   but empire after empire, they're persecuting them.
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:16.780]   They were living, we were in a very, very hard life.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:18.820]   They were still living in exile.
[00:30:18.820 --> 00:30:22.500]   Matthew was saying in the Christmas story,
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:26.860]   if you hope for a real return,
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:28.300]   it's not a political return.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.460]   It's not a historical return.
[00:30:31.460 --> 00:30:33.460]   It's a spiritual return.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.980]   You return to Jesus Christ,
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:39.980]   you will find that your tears, your mourning be over
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.140]   because the eternal hope that we have in Jesus Christ.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.860]   Christmas story continues.
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:52.820]   After King Herod died, Jesus and his family,
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:57.420]   Joseph took his whole family out of Egypt
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:59.140]   and back to the land of Israel.
[00:30:59.140 --> 00:31:01.700]   And eventually they settled down
[00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:04.940]   in a place called Nazareth in Galilee.
[00:31:04.940 --> 00:31:06.860]   It's a very small town.
[00:31:06.860 --> 00:31:09.780]   And Matthew concludes the entire Christmas story
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:11.700]   with this saying.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.180]   Having been warned in dream by the angel,
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:19.660]   Joseph withdrew to the district of Galilee
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.100]   and he went and lived in a town,
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.940]   settled down there called Nazareth.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:28.820]   So was fulfilled what was said through the prophets.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:30.900]   He will be called a Nazarene.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   Now, the prophets talk about Nazarene.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:37.380]   Actually, no.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.820]   If you check the entire Old Testament, 39 books,
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.980]   not one place mentioned the town of Nazareth.
[00:31:45.340 --> 00:31:49.620]   But Matthew is saying, hey, the prophets are actually saying
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:54.020]   that the Messiah will be a Nazarene.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:57.660]   Now, here we need to understand how the Jewish people,
[00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:00.660]   especially the rabbis, how they read scripture.
[00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:02.420]   Sometimes they will pick different words
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.300]   and connect different dots.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.260]   Some of the words, they sound alike, sound very similar.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.740]   They will connect them together.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.140]   And what we find in Isaiah 11,
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.020]   in fact, there is a prophecy,
[00:32:16.020 --> 00:32:18.740]   there is a promise to the house of David
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:22.380]   that sounded like Nazareth, 11.1.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:28.420]   It says a soot will come up from the stump of Jesse.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.340]   Okay, the stump of Jesse.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.260]   The tree is being chopped down.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:35.740]   It's like the nation of Judah being destroyed, right?
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.260]   It's like a dead tree.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:38.420]   The stump of Jesse.
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:39.340]   Why Jesse?
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.020]   Jesse is the father of David, okay?
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:46.100]   It's the dynasty, the forefather of the dynasty, the nation.
[00:32:46.100 --> 00:32:49.180]   The stump of Jesse is being chopped down.
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:54.180]   However, there is a branch grow from the stump.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.940]   And the branch in Hebrew is Nasi.
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:33:00.740]   Nasi will grow and the spirit of the Lord
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.020]   will be with his servant
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:05.540]   and the servant will be the redeemer, the Messiah.
[00:33:05.540 --> 00:33:10.540]   Nasi will grow out of death, out of the ashes.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.420]   God is still there with them, with the people of God.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.740]   And the dynasty of David, the house of David,
[00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.820]   will not be forgotten.
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:25.260]   So actually, this is the prophecy Matthew is referring to.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.500]   A Nasi will grow up.
[00:33:27.500 --> 00:33:31.020]   The Nasi will grow up out of the ashes, out of darkness.
[00:33:31.020 --> 00:33:34.580]   The nation of Judah, the people of God,
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:37.140]   the kingdom of God will come.
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:41.540]   This is actually how the Jewish rabbi
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:43.660]   would like to read scripture.
[00:33:43.660 --> 00:33:44.780]   This is one of their techniques.
[00:33:44.780 --> 00:33:46.700]   It's called mitrash.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:48.700]   Mitrash means seeking.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:53.340]   In Hebrew, it means to stop and to ponder.
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.460]   That's what mitrash means.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:34:01.300]   It's a technique of reading and interpreting scripture.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:02.900]   Connecting the dots.
[00:34:02.900 --> 00:34:04.620]   You see the pattern here?
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.500]   This whole story of Israel in the Old Testament
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:11.460]   found in the story of the first Christmas.
[00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:14.260]   Find in the life of Christ.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:16.340]   When you look at the life of Jesus,
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:20.940]   you look at the entire Old Testament story,
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:22.940]   and you see the faithfulness of God.
[00:34:22.940 --> 00:34:28.900]   Mitrash, to ponder, to stop, and to ask the question,
[00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:31.980]   what child is this?
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:33.940]   What is this?
[00:34:33.940 --> 00:34:37.300]   Who is this Christmas child that we are celebrating,
[00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:38.460]   that we are worshiping?
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:43.220]   What does this child bring you, bring to your life?
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:48.260]   You see the parent, Matthew C., the son of David,
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:52.020]   continues until ultimately fulfilled
[00:34:52.020 --> 00:34:54.060]   in the life of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:59.060]   You see Exodus, Moses come out of Egypt,
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.540]   having freedom, true freedom.
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:04.380]   You find the ultimate fulfillment in Christ.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:09.380]   Exile, the tears of exile will be wiped out in Jesus Christ.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.300]   We turn from exile.
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:15.540]   The true home that we find is in Jesus and no other.
[00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:19.860]   Our true home is found in Christ.
[00:35:19.860 --> 00:35:23.620]   Look around the world, as I said.
[00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:28.620]   All this unrest and all this crisis and pandemic continues.
[00:35:28.620 --> 00:35:34.180]   Sometimes in situation like this,
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:37.540]   we always say to ourselves or say to each other,
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:40.100]   I wanna move somewhere else, right?
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:41.860]   Have you ever thought about it?
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:44.500]   Move out of Chicago, then you will be safe, right?
[00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.180]   Move out of Chicago, move somewhere else,
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.700]   somewhere beautiful, right?
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:52.620]   Somewhere secure, and then you will be safe.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:55.740]   The Bible is telling us the true home is found
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:35:58.340]   no other than in Jesus.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:00.340]   When you have Jesus Christ in your life,
[00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:02.860]   then you will have eternity.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:05.100]   That's what Mitrash is talking about.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:07.100]   That's what Mitrash is saying.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:12.100]   To stop and to ponder, who is this baby Jesus
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.580]   that we worship every Christmas?
[00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.620]   If you choose to trust in Jesus Christ,
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.380]   you will find the true security.
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:26.020]   Don't look anywhere else, look up.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:32.060]   The child born in Christmas, he gives us the true freedom,
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:35.860]   the true Exodus, the true return, the true home.
[00:36:36.860 --> 00:36:41.340]   Lastly, as we close, I wanna go back
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:45.100]   to the very first sentence of the New Testament.
[00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.340]   We often miss this first verse.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:53.300]   A record of genealogy of Jesus Christ,
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:55.500]   the son of David, the son of Abraham.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:00.300]   In Greek, the original language of the New Testament,
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:05.700]   the record of genealogy is Bibliogenesis.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:10.060]   Now, if you know a little bit about English,
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.300]   Bibliogenesis, Bibliogenesis,
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:19.420]   you find words that are sounding so similar.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:23.420]   The book of Genesis, the first book of the New Testament,
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.540]   the first book of the entire Bible is the book of Genesis,
[00:37:26.540 --> 00:37:28.180]   the book of new beginning,
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:30.220]   because God created heaven and the earth.
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:33.220]   He created the entire cosmos.
[00:37:33.220 --> 00:37:35.060]   That is the original creation.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:38.820]   But then the first sentence of the New Testament,
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.820]   it says Bibliogenesis, the book of Genesis,
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.620]   the real Genesis, the new creation,
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:50.180]   found in Jesus Christ.
[00:37:50.180 --> 00:37:52.820]   When we accept Jesus Christ as our Lord,
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:56.940]   when we follow Jesus Christ, we have new beginning,
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:38:02.380]   and this is the only true new beginning we need.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:04.740]   Now, who is Jesus to you?
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:07.420]   Who is Christ to you?
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:10.020]   Stop and ponder.
[00:38:10.020 --> 00:38:12.740]   Put your trust in him.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:17.500]   Put our trust in Christ that we'll find new beginning
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:20.300]   to live as the people of God, right?
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.580]   To be his sons and daughters,
[00:38:22.580 --> 00:38:26.260]   to have hope and security wherever we are,
[00:38:26.260 --> 00:38:28.700]   no matter how dark the world out there,
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.980]   we still have light because Jesus Christ is the true light.
[00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.460]   Let's all pray together.
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:38.380]   Oh God, we give you thanks
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:41.180]   for the fact that you are our true light.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.020]   And in this first Christmas story,
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:48.340]   we see the hope that you offer to all of us
[00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:50.540]   in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:54.700]   Thank you for sending your son to be born in this world,
[00:38:55.820 --> 00:39:00.540]   to bear our suffering, to bear our struggles,
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:05.020]   to wipe out our tears, and to grant us true freedom,
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:09.340]   the true exodus, true return, true home.
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:15.580]   And I pray that all of us will put our trust anew in you.
[00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:19.500]   We'll again choose to trust in you,
[00:39:19.500 --> 00:39:21.300]   again choose to believe in you,
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:26.460]   and help each one of us to be your true son and daughter,
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:31.460]   to live by your word, to live by your scripture,
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.580]   to follow and obey your will.
[00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:39.300]   In this Christmas, we pray that you will continue
[00:39:39.300 --> 00:39:42.700]   to renew our hearts, renew our trust
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.780]   in our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:48.020]   and he will continue to lead our lives.
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:50.940]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:52.740]   Well, God bless.
