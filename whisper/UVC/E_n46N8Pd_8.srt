1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 Thank you.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,360
 Okay.

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,880
 So I have a friend named Grant,

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,320
 and I'm guessing most of us have a friend like this

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:13,640
 in your friend group.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,520
 Grant is that one person in your friend group

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,640
 who is heads and shoulders, smarter and more successful

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
 than everybody else in your group.

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,520
 If you know who I'm talking about for yourself,

10
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,460
 think about them.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,440
 Grant is a genius.

12
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,720
 Grant is very influential in his career.

13
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:35,520
 And this guy,

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,880
 we always joke that if you wanna feel bad about yourself,

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:39,720
 you should Google him

16
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:41,680
 because the number of podcasts he's on

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,400
 and the number of interviews he's been given

18
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,520
 and the number of lists in magazines

19
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,800
 that he's made it onto is a little sobering

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,320
 when you're like, "Oh, I'm about his age, that's great."

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,160
 And the reason Grant is successful and well-known

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,580
 is because Grant is an entrepreneur.

23
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,160
 So he opens businesses, he runs small businesses,

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,680
 and he's been doing this since he was 16,

25
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,320
 since he was maybe 14.

26
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,680
 I am not kidding.

27
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,800
 When he was in his teenage years,

28
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:14,560
 this guy opened a thrift store in Hyde Park

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,920
 that is still running to this day.

30
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,600
 He's also written books.

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,600
 He's made it into magazines.

32
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,800
 And right now he runs a company

33
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,440
 that has more than 50 employees.

34
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,020
 It's a little insane.

35
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:33,040
 Now, one thing Grant always talks about

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,360
 when you talk to him about his businesses

37
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,060
 is he'll talk a lot about projects

38
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,440
 that they will dump or not do

39
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,920
 because of the fact

40
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,640
 that it doesn't fit their mission statement.

41
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,800
 And this is something he says he's been doing

42
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,600
 ever since he started opening that thrift store

43
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,200
 when he was in his teenage years.

44
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,200
 So Grant would tell you that when you open a business,

45
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,480
 your mission statement is the very foundation

46
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,760
 of what you do.

47
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,460
 And you don't just have a mission statement

48
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,440
 because it's fun to put there.

49
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,700
 You don't have a mission statement

50
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,120
 just because you need something to pitch to investors.

51
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,360
 You have a mission statement

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,160
 because when an opportunity pops up,

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,680
 you can compare it to what you first set out to do

54
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,480
 and decide whether or not it's something

55
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,800
 you're going to do based on that.

56
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,400
 So if you're opening a burger restaurant

57
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,400
 and your mission statement

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,200
 is to provide the best dining experience

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,400
 with the most unique burgers in Chicago,

60
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,280
 you're probably not going to jump

61
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,380
 on the chicken sandwich trend when it comes around.

62
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:44,720
 You're probably not going to have a Taco Tuesday special

63
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,020
 because it doesn't match your mission statement.

64
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,400
 You're supposed to stay on point.

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,400
 Everything you do is born out of that mission statement.

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,220
 It's a foundational piece.

67
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,960
 It's like the cement upon which you build a tower.

68
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,680
 And he tells me that every single one of his businesses,

69
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,520
 past and present, has always and will always

70
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,800
 have a very strict and defined mission statement

71
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,520
 because otherwise you're going to end up wasting your time.

72
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,400
 So I want us to think today

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:23,480
 about what is your mission statement?

74
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:27,000
 Now, I know people are not like businesses.

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,700
 We don't sit down and decide that we're going to

76
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,920
 build a person and then decide what they're about

77
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,480
 and what their core values are.

78
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,900
 Most of us probably don't have an index card

79
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:42,360
 with our mission statement written down on it.

80
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:45,420
 I'm guessing most of us don't have an elevator pitch

81
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,440
 for who we are as a person.

82
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,940
 That we can just recite at any moment, right?

83
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,160
 But the thing is that each and every single one of us

84
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,480
 has a mission statement,

85
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,920
 whether or not we understand that we do.

86
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,640
 Even if we don't think we do,

87
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,960
 there is still something that is that foundation

88
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,600
 that drives every action you do,

89
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,420
 every day that you spend your time,

90
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,320
 it drives the decisions you make.

91
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,920
 So I want you to pause for a minute

92
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:19,500
 and think about what that would be for you.

93
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,480
 What is the thing that drives you?

94
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:26,960
 What gets you out of bed every single morning?

95
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:31,960
 If I were to distill every action and motivation

96
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,080
 and every task you do and the way you spend your time

97
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,420
 and the people you hang out with,

98
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,520
 if I were to distill that

99
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:42,040
 into some kind of a mission statement or a purpose,

100
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,120
 what would that be for you?

101
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,580
 Think about that for a minute.

102
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:53,680
 Maybe your mission statement is,

103
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,640
 I want to provide for my family, right?

104
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,120
 Maybe it's, I need to make enough money

105
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,120
 so that I can buy a house

106
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,080
 and have enough money for groceries

107
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,600
 and send my kids to college.

108
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,800
 Maybe that's your mission statement.

109
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,240
 Maybe you're in college right now

110
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,260
 and your mission statement is to either survive

111
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:11,680
 or get out with good grades

112
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,500
 and be in a position to get a good paying job.

113
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
 Maybe you're in high school

114
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,560
 and you want to please your parents with good grades.

115
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,960
 Whatever it is,

116
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,560
 each of us has a mission statement right now.

117
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,400
 And if you can't define it,

118
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,020
 that's probably a good indicator

119
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,480
 that you've just kind of been going with the flow

120
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:37,280
 and maybe the thing you're building your life on

121
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,820
 is being developed without you knowing it.

122
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,640
 That's not a good policy.

123
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,240
 Today, we're actually going to discuss a time in the Bible

124
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,840
 when Jesus was asked

125
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,120
 about what the greatest moral commandment is.

126
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,360
 And Jesus gives an answer

127
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,400
 that I think fits into this mission statement box

128
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,080
 really perfectly.

129
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:00,880
 And his answer tells a lot about why he's there.

130
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,200
 And it also shows us a lot about

131
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:06,080
 why we make the decisions we make.

132
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,400
 And whether you're in this room as a believer,

133
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,640
 whether you're in this room as somebody

134
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,120
 who's grown up in the church

135
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,500
 and you're not sure if you're a believer,

136
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,960
 maybe you're here or you're watching online

137
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,000
 and you're not a Christian, but you're intrigued.

138
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,200
 I want you to be thinking

139
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,640
 about what that mission statement is for you.

140
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,640
 And as we're talking about what Jesus endorses,

141
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,240
 think about how that compares and contrasts.

142
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,680
 We'll do that as we go along.

143
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:34,520
 Let's pray that God would bless our time today.

144
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:40,480
 God, we come to you today

145
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,960
 knowing that there is a lot

146
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,200
 of really difficult things in the world.

147
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,560
 We know there's a lot wrong with existence right now,

148
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:53,160
 from natural disasters to oppression to injustice.

149
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,160
 God, we know and are fully aware of the fact

150
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,760
 that we don't live in a world that is easy

151
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,260
 or oftentimes fair.

152
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:06,120
 But God, it is all the more because of that

153
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,840
 that we thank you for your goodness.

154
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
 And we thank you that you love us,

155
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,560
 even though we don't deserve it,

156
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,080
 even though it's not something that we earned,

157
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,320
 it's not something that we should have.

158
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:24,220
 And honestly, the fact that a God like you cares about us,

159
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:28,040
 even in the slightest bit, should astound us

160
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:31,520
 and should gobsmack us into silence for minutes at a time.

161
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,460
 We love you, God.

162
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,120
 We ask that as we explore this topic,

163
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,880
 you would be moving in our hearts,

164
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,520
 whether we already believe in you

165
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,240
 and call you our God or not,

166
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,860
 would you be working in us

167
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:47,000
 so that we might experience your love

168
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,960
 and so that we might be moved in a certain way

169
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,520
 so that we know you more and are able to have lives

170
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,960
 that please you and look like you even more.

171
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,720
 We pray this in your name, God.

172
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,560
 Amen.

173
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:06,000
 Now, the passage we're gonna be in today is Matthew 22.

174
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,640
 So you can open up your Bibles

175
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:10,240
 or turn on your Bibles if that's your speed

176
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,760
 and turn to that passage.

177
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,280
 I'll be in the, oh gosh,

178
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,740
 I can't remember if I'm in the ESV or the NIV today.

179
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,580
 You choose.

180
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,240
 But before we read the passage,

181
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,280
 I wanna give us a little bit of background

182
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,800
 into where we're dropping in.

183
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,540
 So back in Jesus' day, right,

184
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:35,240
 the temple was the epicenter of religious life.

185
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,820
 And since everybody in that day and age

186
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,680
 kinda had to be religious,

187
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,600
 the temple was kind of the center

188
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:44,340
 of everybody's life in general.

189
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:51,120
 So I want you to think about a sprawling religious building

190
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,680
 and I want you to think about people

191
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:56,400
 who are there all the time, okay?

192
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,220
 You would pass by this place on your way into the market.

193
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,600
 When you're going about your dealings and visiting friends,

194
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,100
 you would pass by this place.

195
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,440
 You would see people going in to make sacrifices,

196
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,920
 going in to talk to the Pharisees.

197
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:11,760
 You would be here often, right?

198
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,560
 And so at that day and age,

199
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,200
 there were people whose entire job it was

200
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:21,200
 to teach the law and the scriptures and the prophets

201
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,320
 at this building, at this temple.

202
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,360
 And these Pharisees or these lawyers or Sadducees,

203
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,520
 whatever you wanna call them,

204
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,600
 they would be out in the temple courts preaching,

205
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,400
 but most of the time,

206
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,340
 they're doing it because they want a following.

207
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:39,560
 They want popularity.

208
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,800
 They want political power.

209
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,040
 At that day and age,

210
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,520
 political power and religious power

211
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,680
 were basically the same thing.

212
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
 So these guys are out there

213
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,560
 and they're preaching and telling people

214
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,160
 how they should live their life,

215
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,480
 what the scriptures mean,

216
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,280
 and they're usually doing it

217
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,440
 because they want to have a following.

218
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,960
 They want people to listen to them.

219
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,080
 They want people to know their name and respect them.

220
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:06,580
 They want to improve their rank, right?

221
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:09,640
 So these guys are essentially people

222
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,320
 who just want the clout.

223
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,820
 If they were alive today,

224
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,400
 they would probably be Twitch streaming.

225
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,640
 That's a bit of a stretch, but trust me.

226
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,760
 They do this kind of stuff.

227
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,420
 They're in it for their name.

228
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:22,420
 They're in it for the political power.

229
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,240
 And another way that they decide

230
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,020
 and they realize they can get that power

231
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:31,880
 is by debating people.

232
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,600
 So let's say you're Bob the Pharisee

233
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,440
 and you out there

234
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,480
 and you're preaching to a bunch of people

235
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,720
 and people are following you.

236
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,840
 And then Dave over here

237
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,600
 sees that you have such a following.

238
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,840
 Well, if Dave can call you out on something,

239
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,240
 if Dave can debate you

240
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,560
 and make you look like an idiot,

241
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,840
 Dave is going to get more popular than Bob.

242
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,560
 Dave is going to get those fans

243
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,300
 because he's shown everybody

244
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:59,520
 that Bob doesn't know what he's talking about.

245
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,860
 So this kind of thing was something you would hear

246
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,540
 and see all the time.

247
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,520
 You'd have crowds of people coming to these people

248
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,620
 and listening to them.

249
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:10,820
 Now, Jesus, at this point in his ministry,

250
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,700
 Jesus does have clout.

251
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,140
 Jesus is very popular.

252
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,200
 People like this guy.

253
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,100
 People are murmuring about maybe he's the Messiah.

254
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,120
 Maybe this guy is the one

255
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:26,140
 who is fabled to come and save our people.

256
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,460
 They're listening to him.

257
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,460
 And you know what that does?

258
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,540
 That paints a target on his back.

259
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,660
 That makes people want to seek him out and debate him,

260
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,820
 make him look dumb.

261
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,620
 If they can just trap him in some kind of a mistake

262
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:44,240
 or make him say something that isn't actually biblical,

263
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,620
 or maybe it's unpopular culturally,

264
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,300
 they can take that popularity and power for themselves

265
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,980
 and invalidate him.

266
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,480
 So this is the situation

267
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,740
 and the sort of arena that Jesus enters

268
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:00,240
 when he's in the temple courts and he's teaching.

269
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,340
 So we're gonna start in verse 34

270
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,340
 and we're gonna go to 40.

271
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:10,340
 So hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees,

272
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:13,140
 that's basically a different political party

273
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,980
 or different religious party,

274
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,700
 the Pharisees got together

275
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:21,100
 and one of them, an expert in the law,

276
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:23,060
 the smartest among them,

277
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,920
 decided that he was going to test Jesus.

278
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,760
 And he tested him with this question.

279
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,180
 (clears throat)

280
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:33,440
 Teacher, what is the greatest commandment of the law?

281
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,340
 Now, maybe this guy is thinking

282
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:39,140
 that he can get Jesus to say something wrong.

283
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,860
 Maybe he's thinking he can get Jesus

284
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:43,380
 to say something unpopular.

285
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:47,580
 Whatever it is, this guy does not have positive intent.

286
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,060
 This guy ain't being sincere.

287
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,900
 He's trying to trip Jesus up.

288
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,140
 Here's how Jesus answers.

289
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:56,140
 And most of us probably know this passage pretty well.

290
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,500
 Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God

291
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,780
 "with all your heart, with all your soul,

292
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,460
 "and with all your mind."

293
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,540
 This is the first and the greatest commandment.

294
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,100
 And the second is like it.

295
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:11,400
 "Love your neighbor as yourself."

296
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,700
 All the law and the prophets

297
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,900
 hang on these two commandments.

298
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:23,620
 Jesus is actually quoting Deuteronomy here.

299
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:26,900
 So, excuse me, he is pulling his answer

300
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,680
 from scriptures that they all would have known.

301
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,500
 So he's saying, "Love the Lord your God

302
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,760
 "with all your heart, soul, and mind,

303
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,660
 "and then love your neighbor as yourself."

304
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,260
 That's the greatest commandment.

305
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,660
 So Brock, you're talking about mission statement.

306
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,940
 Why do you turn to this passage?

307
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:49,500
 I understand that it's not as if Jesus says,

308
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,420
 "Hey guys, this is my mission statement."

309
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,260
 This is not what's written on Jesus's

310
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:58,020
 about page on his website, okay?

311
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,380
 I recognize that he doesn't actually come out

312
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,020
 and say in his many words,

313
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,160
 "This is my mission statement," or "This is my purpose."

314
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,500
 But the reason I like to look at it through this lens

315
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:15,060
 is because it does seem to be like something

316
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,980
 that is very important and something Jesus sees

317
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,740
 as really meaningful.

318
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,300
 What do I mean by that?

319
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:27,300
 This story, most of you probably know Jesus answering,

320
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,180
 "Love the Lord your God with all your heart,

321
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,860
 "soul, mind, and strength," right?

322
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,860
 And then love your neighbor as yourself.

323
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,580
 It's because this story seems to be

324
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,980
 in three of the gospels, right?

325
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,020
 It seems to be in three different accounts

326
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,340
 of Jesus's ministry.

327
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,060
 We have it in Matthew, right?

328
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:48,220
 We have it in Mark and we have it in Luke.

329
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,980
 We're looking at Matthew today,

330
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,460
 but it's also in these other accounts of Jesus.

331
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:59,740
 So when you see things that are in multiple gospel accounts,

332
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:02,660
 you should probably take notice.

333
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:06,380
 So here are two options when we see multiple accounts

334
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,660
 of this story, right?

335
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,660
 We say either all three of these writers

336
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,340
 found this as important

337
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:16,860
 and wanted to put it into their book.

338
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:19,060
 Or there's a second option

339
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:24,580
 that maybe this happened multiple times.

340
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,140
 Maybe there were three instances

341
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,380
 where Jesus gave this answer.

342
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,180
 So let's look at each of the actual scriptures.

343
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
 I won't go into detail.

344
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,600
 You can look at them yourself in your own time.

345
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,940
 There's a Wikipedia page that lists all of them in one.

346
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,260
 You don't have to go to several different webpages.

347
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,780
 Matthew, the one we just looked at,

348
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:45,180
 has a lawyer testing Jesus.

349
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,460
 It explicitly tells us that the Pharisees

350
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:50,500
 are conniving together and they're plotting something.

351
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,980
 In Mark, it's a little different.

352
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,460
 In Mark, there is a sincere scribe.

353
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,980
 It says that there's a scribe,

354
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,380
 so somebody who writes down

355
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:02,040
 and his whole job is to copy the scriptures.

356
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,420
 It says that in Mark, there's this scribe guy

357
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,820
 who's kind of sitting on the sidelines

358
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:08,820
 and he's like, "Huh, this Jesus guy,

359
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,340
 he's answering really well.

360
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,460
 He's giving good answers."

361
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,260
 So then he asks Jesus,

362
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:15,100
 "What's the greatest commandment in the law?"

363
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,100
 Not to test him,

364
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,820
 but because that's what he's working on 24/7.

365
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:22,860
 He's like, "What is the most important part

366
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,860
 of this whole thing that I'm transcribing all day?"

367
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,420
 And in that account, Jesus says to the scribe,

368
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,500
 "Hey, you're close to the kingdom of God, man.

369
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,060
 Keep on, you're doing great."

370
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:37,100
 And then in Luke, it's similar to in Matthew

371
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,820
 where people are trying to test him,

372
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,020
 but Jesus doesn't actually answer himself.

373
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,460
 He says, "Well, what do you say it is?"

374
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,460
 He turns a question into a question.

375
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,540
 He says, "You answer this for me."

376
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,220
 So what is it?

377
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:54,860
 You could believe that all three of these authors

378
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,820
 remembered this instance differently,

379
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,540
 that it was one event

380
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,760
 and three different writers remembered it differently.

381
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,920
 That's a possibility.

382
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,380
 But what I believe, what I think seems to be the case

383
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,460
 since there are so many different,

384
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,740
 interesting, unique details,

385
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:16,540
 is that I think Jesus used this answer often.

386
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:23,500
 It seems that Jesus had this answer prepared

387
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,260
 for when people asked him,

388
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,620
 "What is the greatest moral commandment?

389
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,860
 What is the most important of these things?"

390
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:35,280
 You kind of get the sense that Jesus had this answer ready.

391
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,800
 So it seems important to him.

392
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,200
 And I think it fits the idea of a mission statement

393
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,840
 really, really well.

394
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,320
 And we're gonna have to go look through

395
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,140
 what he's actually talking about here now.

396
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,720
 First of all, Jesus says,

397
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:57,720
 "You are to love God with all of your heart."

398
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,680
 That's your emotion.

399
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,560
 That's the things that you feel.

400
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,520
 You are to love God with all of your soul,

401
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:08,320
 all of who you are.

402
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,560
 Think about the way that you define yourself.

403
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:15,900
 I am Brock, I'm a graphic designer.

404
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,960
 That's my identity, right?

405
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,920
 Jesus is saying your soul, all that you are as a person,

406
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:25,080
 all of your identity and all of who you are,

407
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,580
 God is worthy of that.

408
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:31,140
 All of your mind, your intelligence.

409
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:34,640
 How many of you have ever found a new hobby

410
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,920
 and you've gotten so into it

411
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,360
 that you learn the minutia and the details

412
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,760
 and you're on the subreddit looking at it every day

413
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,200
 and you are learning so much about this hobby or this thing.

414
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,040
 And then eventually you just kind of lose interest

415
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,480
 because you've beaten it, you've conquered it,

416
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,580
 you've figured it out, right?

417
00:18:55,580 --> 00:19:00,340
 Jesus is saying that God is worthy

418
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:02,240
 of all of your intelligence.

419
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,400
 There is no point where you can exhaust that

420
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,120
 in your exploration of him.

421
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,260
 Your strength, this isn't in the Matthew version

422
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,200
 we just read, this is in some of those other versions,

423
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,160
 so we're gonna include it as well.

424
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,960
 This is your passion.

425
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,960
 This is the oomph with which you live your life.

426
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,040
 When you're motivated to do something

427
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,140
 and it's outside of the ordinary,

428
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,860
 it's not what you just do with your everyday life.

429
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,340
 When you put forth effort towards something,

430
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,720
 that's your strength.

431
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,600
 Jesus is saying that your heart, your soul,

432
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,360
 your mind, your strength, all of it

433
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:41,620
 is worth being thrown at God.

434
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,880
 God is worthy of all of it.

435
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,740
 Now I want you to think about your mission statement

436
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,120
 from before.

437
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,820
 Even if you don't have it completely filled out,

438
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,960
 maybe you're just like, ah, I kind of seem security driven.

439
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,880
 Maybe I seem a little bit driven by my own fame

440
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:56,080
 or popularity, or maybe I seem money driven

441
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,600
 or career or status driven, whatever it is.

442
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,340
 Ask yourself, is the mission statement

443
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,840
 that you currently live your life by

444
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,620
 worthy of all of that?

445
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:12,720
 Most of us recognize when a person

446
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,960
 puts all of themselves towards a pursuit.

447
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,260
 Sometimes we applaud it, right?

448
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,960
 You get basketball stars whose only goal is to win.

449
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,840
 And when we have them on our fantasy draft, we like that.

450
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,720
 But in real life, we don't really believe

451
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,480
 that that's the healthiest thing, right?

452
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,560
 We look at that and go, that's a little whack.

453
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:38,820
 To put all of yourself into one thing,

454
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,720
 whether it is success, whether it's status,

455
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,460
 is gonna leave you in a bad spot.

456
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,280
 Jesus is saying and affirming that all of you

457
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,580
 is worth throwing towards God.

458
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,400
 That if you're looking for something

459
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,400
 that is meaningful enough for everything in your life,

460
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,520
 it's God.

461
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,860
 I want you to think about if your current mission statement

462
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,940
 lives up to that.

463
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:12,240
 So love God with everything.

464
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,300
 Here's the second part.

465
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,960
 Jesus says, love your neighbor as yourself.

466
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,720
 Now this is interesting, right?

467
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,420
 He's asked what is the greatest commandment?

468
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,840
 And he gives two.

469
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:26,260
 He doesn't leave this out.

470
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:28,940
 That's weird, right?

471
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:32,400
 He could have just left it at love God with everything

472
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,160
 and that could have been it, but he doesn't.

473
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,560
 He goes into more detail.

474
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:40,860
 He includes and love your neighbor as yourself.

475
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:45,160
 Now, this is the part where if you're not a believer,

476
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:48,600
 if you don't actually consider God as your God,

477
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,500
 you don't look at Jesus and say, yeah, that's my Lord.

478
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:54,720
 You probably would sign onto this.

479
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,360
 You would probably say, hey, I can get behind that.

480
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,900
 Right?

481
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,180
 I might not like a lot of the rules

482
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,420
 or a lot of the things that tells me not to do in the Bible,

483
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,220
 but this part, this seems good.

484
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,660
 This seems fine, right?

485
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,820
 I can sign off on this.

486
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,300
 I can say that this is a good thing,

487
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,300
 even if I don't vibe with everything else in the Bible.

488
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:20,740
 Here's the reason Jesus says

489
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,780
 that they are intertwined though, right?

490
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,320
 Jesus says that these two commandments are very intertwined

491
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,280
 because you are not loving God

492
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,740
 if you are not loving your neighbor.

493
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,640
 I'll say that again.

494
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,600
 You are not loving God if you are not loving your neighbor.

495
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:46,360
 And conversely, you cannot love your neighbor

496
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,940
 if you are not loving God.

497
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:52,840
 You cannot love your neighbor if you are not loving God.

498
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,660
 I'll say those two one more time.

499
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,560
 You are not loving God if you're not loving your neighbor.

500
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:59,760
 End of the story.

501
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,640
 You cannot love your neighbor if you aren't loving God.

502
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:07,640
 These two things, these two concepts are so intertwined

503
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:11,100
 that you can't have one thing without the other.

504
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,960
 I can't say to God, you're really great.

505
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,560
 I like that you died for me.

506
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
 I'm gonna make you my God,

507
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:21,200
 but I really, really hate other people.

508
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,040
 I'm just not gonna deal with them.

509
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,100
 You can't do that.

510
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,200
 And Jesus is also putting forth the idea here

511
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,200
 that you can't actually love your neighbor as yourself

512
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,060
 if you are not first loving him.

513
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:42,560
 This is an interesting idea, right?

514
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,280
 For those of you who are in Summit, you might remember this.

515
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:50,440
 I do, as Pastor Mark said, I do youth ministry here

516
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
 and we work with students in the church

517
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,880
 and students in the neighborhood.

518
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,360
 And this past semester, we actually went over this topic.

519
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,460
 We went over this verse

520
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:01,340
 and we were specifically looking at the idea

521
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:06,040
 of loving other people as yourself, right?

522
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:08,760
 Now, where we're at in Summit,

523
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,120
 where we're at with the kinds of discussions

524
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,400
 we have in our youth group,

525
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:16,000
 it's really interesting because rather than preach,

526
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,040
 we just kind of discuss it and we talk about it.

527
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,920
 And we're at a spot where a lot of people

528
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,960
 are willing to talk about the things

529
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,400
 that maybe don't make a ton of sense to them,

530
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,020
 or they're willing to say, this doesn't make sense to me.

531
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,220
 That seems like craziness.

532
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:32,040
 Let's talk about why that is.

533
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:35,040
 And when we were talking about this idea,

534
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:40,040
 we had a young woman in our discussion who is whip smart

535
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:44,760
 and she's awesome, but she immediately locked on

536
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:47,680
 to some idea about this concept.

537
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:51,400
 She said, okay, loving your neighbor as yourself.

538
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,180
 And as we're talking about what that actually means,

539
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,960
 as we're talking about what that actually looks like,

540
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:00,100
 she goes, that is a terrible life policy.

541
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:06,640
 She identifies, she identified that this was not going

542
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,440
 to put you ahead, right?

543
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,680
 Loving your neighbor as yourself,

544
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,680
 giving them your spot in line,

545
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,120
 preferring the things they want over what you want,

546
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,640
 giving your time and money to other people

547
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:21,180
 instead of using it for yourself.

548
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:24,240
 Like to the point where you would actually prefer

549
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,380
 other people's good over your good all the time.

550
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,860
 That does not make sense.

551
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:33,120
 Can you even build a life on that?

552
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,760
 Can you actually get anywhere with that?

553
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,760
 Aren't you always going to be left in need or wanting

554
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:43,360
 if you actually do that?

555
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,360
 And here's the thing, she's right.

556
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,740
 She's really onto something there.

557
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:58,180
 There is no reason to love other people

558
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,340
 more than you love yourself

559
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:04,740
 if you do not have God in the equation, right?

560
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:11,060
 If you are a just random person here by accident,

561
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:16,580
 making it alone and making it in your life alone

562
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:18,180
 and you're watching out for number one,

563
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,420
 there really isn't any reason

564
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,780
 to value other people so highly.

565
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,680
 There's definitely a reason to care for other people.

566
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,560
 There's a reason to be kind for them.

567
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:31,080
 There's a reason to love them, sure,

568
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,860
 but to love them more than you love yourself,

569
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,760
 love them as yourself, what?

570
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,080
 That makes no sense.

571
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:42,260
 This commandment only makes sense

572
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:47,260
 if there is first a God who has loved you so much

573
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:50,640
 that it would be crazy not to love your neighbor

574
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,600
 as yourself.

575
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,840
 If the God of the Bible, right?

576
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:00,220
 If the God that is Jesus actually loves you,

577
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,600
 if he actually died for you,

578
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,020
 if he actually cares for you,

579
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:05,700
 if he's actually watching out for you so much

580
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,300
 that there will never be anything you need

581
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,120
 that he will not provide,

582
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,580
 whether that's physical, mental,

583
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,000
 whether that's financial,

584
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,060
 whether that's emotional or relational,

585
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:19,100
 if there really is a God out there

586
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,020
 who cares that deeply about you,

587
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:26,660
 it would be crazy not to love your neighbor as yourself.

588
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:29,620
 If you've been given everything,

589
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,860
 why would you not want to share that kind of everything

590
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,060
 with other people?

591
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:41,040
 These commandments are intertwined.

592
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:45,400
 For one final time,

593
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,220
 I want you to think about the mission statement

594
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,700
 that you thought about at the beginning.

595
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:57,900
 I want you to think about what your life is defined by.

596
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,820
 An easy way to do this is to think about your time.

597
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,620
 How much time do you spend doing this thing

598
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:05,680
 versus that thing?

599
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:12,280
 Or how much of your thought life

600
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:14,000
 do you devote to something?

601
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:19,980
 Is your thought life always focused on the next promotion?

602
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:25,420
 Are the things coursing through your mind

603
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:29,740
 how you're going to get to the next step financially,

604
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,920
 that next stage?

605
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:36,220
 Are you consumed with another person

606
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:38,420
 and their thoughts of you?

607
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:40,600
 Is that where you get yourself worth?

608
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:45,200
 What are the things that drive you and motivate you?

609
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,080
 What is your mission statement?

610
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,060
 The reason I wanted to talk about this today

611
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,560
 is because what Jesus is putting forth

612
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,520
 is the only mission statement,

613
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:57,820
 the only foundation that is going to be satisfying.

614
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:03,760
 If you live your life Saturday to Saturday,

615
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,380
 exhausted throughout the week,

616
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,640
 just looking for the next moment

617
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,400
 that you're gonna get for yourself.

618
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,040
 If you live your life looking for purpose or meaning

619
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,360
 and feeling like there's just none of it.

620
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:20,160
 If you live your life feeling lonely

621
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,440
 and exhausted of being lonely,

622
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,920
 what Jesus is saying here and putting forth

623
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:28,600
 is something that is going to matter to you.

624
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,920
 It's something that's gonna fill you up.

625
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:35,680
 And think about what your life would look like then.

626
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,320
 You're not only fulfilled,

627
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:43,000
 you're also fulfilling others.

628
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,440
 You're showing them,

629
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:47,080
 there's a God who loves you.

630
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,740
 And I love you because he first loved me.

631
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,520
 I get to show you that I can value you

632
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,340
 more than I value myself,

633
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:57,440
 because God valued me more than he valued himself.

634
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:04,920
 Everybody's life has some sort of foundation,

635
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,320
 some sort of mission statement.

636
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,960
 Your actions don't happen randomly.

637
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,520
 There is a value behind what you do.

638
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:17,160
 And what Jesus is saying is that

639
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,580
 if you want to be fulfilled,

640
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:22,520
 if you want to be happy,

641
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:27,280
 if you want to know that other people are also loved,

642
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,100
 if you want to be able to love other people

643
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,920
 more than yourself,

644
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,880
 you have to know that first you are to love God

645
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,520
 with everything.

646
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,280
 There is not a lot of things in this world

647
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,040
 that are actually worthwhile.

648
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:45,880
 The older you get, the more you realize that.

649
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:51,440
 So much of what you do and care about now is dust later,

650
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,480
 or doesn't matter years down the road.

651
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,880
 But what Jesus is saying is that this does.

652
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:01,200
 And if you can't say with honesty

653
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:06,400
 that God has changed your heart to the point where

654
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,120
 you are able to love other people more than yourself,

655
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,000
 he's saying that you can have that,

656
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,020
 that all you have to do is love him first.

657
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:20,320
 Because the truth is he's loved you before that.

658
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,640
 Let's pray.

659
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,360
 God, we thank you that these are not just words

660
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,700
 you're telling us,

661
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:36,000
 that it's not just some commandment you're giving to us

662
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,080
 and saying, good luck with it.

663
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:42,960
 God, we thank you that this is something that Jesus did,

664
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,920
 that this is something you did first.

665
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:50,440
 That Jesus himself loved God with all of his heart,

666
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,440
 soul, mind, and strength, all of his emotion,

667
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,120
 all of his intelligence, all of who he was,

668
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,360
 all of his passion.

669
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,520
 And that because of that,

670
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,360
 he was also able to love his neighbor

671
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,840
 more than he loved himself.

672
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,380
 That when he's in the garden of Gethsemane,

673
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:16,840
 on his face, sobbing and sweating blood,

674
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,880
 because he's terrified of the cross,

675
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,260
 that he prays to you and says, your will be done,

676
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:27,860
 and comes to the conclusion that he still loves his neighbor

677
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,500
 more than he loves himself.

678
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:33,380
 Thank you that rather than running,

679
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:37,980
 he turned and he walked towards the cross of his own will,

680
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,180
 because he loves us.

681
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:42,060
 God, would you give us a heart like that?

682
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:44,100
 Would you help us to live for something

683
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,240
 that actually matters instead of the rat race

684
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,740
 that this world is?

685
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:51,220
 Instead of all the things we could pour our heart and mind

686
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:55,160
 and soul and strength into that is going to go away soon.

687
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,580
 God, give us the wisdom to see that this

688
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,340
 is how we should be spending our life

689
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:04,300
 and that this is something that is going to fulfill us.

690
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:07,780
 And give us the conviction to follow through on that.

691
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:11,420
 Not just to believe it's the case and say, that's nice,

692
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:12,780
 and I'll do that on Sundays,

693
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:15,780
 but to actually wake up every morning,

694
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,580
 so thankful and grateful that you love us.
