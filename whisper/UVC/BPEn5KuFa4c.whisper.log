[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Thank you, Kelly.
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.640]   Good morning, UV.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.660]   It is good to be back here with you all,
[00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.040]   and I hope you guys get some time to enjoy the spring weather
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.840]   and just seeing different flowers blooming,
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.200]   the colors, there's like all around the streets.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.980]   This is my favorite time of the year.
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.400]   Okay, this morning we're gonna continue with our series
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.480]   on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.100]   And today we're gonna look at this,
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.840]   okay, pursuing kingdom righteousness.
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.200]   But before that, let us pray together first.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.880]   Heavenly Father, as we prepare to open up your word
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.300]   this morning, I just ask that your spirit
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.440]   will be in each and every one of our heart.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.400]   As we receive your word being proclaimed,
[00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.840]   that your spirit will do your work in our hearts
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.640]   to transform us into people that represent your kingdom,
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.800]   into people of love, into people that the world
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.800]   will recognize that we belong to you.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.400]   Because we know that your word is living and active.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.480]   So allow your word to do the transforming work
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.380]   in our hearts.
[00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.280]   Father, I also ask that your Holy Spirit
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.080]   will be with me this morning as I preach your word
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.260]   that anything that is not from you,
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.460]   that you will take them away.
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.880]   And may your word and your word alone be proclaimed.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.720]   I pray this in your son's name, amen.
[00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.340]   I don't know if there's the breathing voice
[00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.940]   coming through the mic, but hopefully that is not
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.180]   too distracting for you all.
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.340]   Okay, if you are a basketball fan,
[00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.820]   this time of the year is usually some of the most
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.820]   exciting time because the NBA playoff
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.700]   is actually happening right now.
[00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.460]   And most of the teams that are able to make it
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.260]   this far into the seasons are usually led by
[00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.060]   one or maybe two superstars.
[00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.860]   And so these matchups are usually pretty fun
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.980]   to watch as well.
[00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.120]   But what makes a great players like LeBron James
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.960]   or Micah Jordan or Steph Curry
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.920]   such a great basketball players?
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.940]   While there are many different positions
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.300]   on the basketball court, these are some of the
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.700]   common characteristics that makes someone
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.460]   a great NBA players.
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.260]   First, of course, there is the basketball skills.
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.960]   How well can they score?
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.100]   Or how well can they defend?
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.400]   Or how well can they make a play?
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.420]   And then there's also basketball IQ.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.440]   How well do they understand the game?
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.540]   And are they able to read the opponents
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.000]   and respond accordingly?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.340]   And of course, there's the work ethic
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.060]   and also attitude, both on and off the courts.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.100]   And lastly, there's also some intangibles as well,
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.900]   like leaderships, versatility,
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.860]   or if they're able to make a clutch plays
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.860]   when a team needs them.
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.340]   So all of these are some of the basic characteristics
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.500]   that makes someone a good basketball players.
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.900]   But now if I ask, what makes someone a good Christian?
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.020]   How would you answer it?
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.700]   And how different do you think the answer would be
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.380]   if I ask non-believers these same questions?
[00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.900]   I'm currently in the running groups
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.980]   and we do a group run every Friday morning at 6.40.
[00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:38.660]   And usually when we do a group run,
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.780]   so you would just end up talking to the person
[00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.940]   right next to you, right, for probably like
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.660]   about 30 minutes.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:47.460]   And usually when people find out that I'm a pastor,
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.620]   the first thing that they will usually mention to me
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.780]   is either, oh, I actually used to go to church growing up,
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.140]   but I just stopped going now.
[00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.980]   Or, hey, I actually went to church with a friend of mine
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.020]   over Easter or over Christmas.
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.380]   And if I ask them these questions,
[00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.060]   what do you guys think makes someone a good Christian?
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.100]   I'm fairly confident that a majority of them will say,
[00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.580]   okay, a good Christian is probably someone
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.020]   who goes to church regularly,
[00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:14.820]   because to them, going to church
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.620]   is some of the most basic activities
[00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.420]   that all Christian participate in.
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.660]   And when it comes to Jesus days,
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.180]   there were also a few activities
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.220]   that became sort of like the identity marker
[00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.580]   of a good and pious Jews,
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.040]   because these are some of the most basic religious duties
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.780]   that a Jewish person have to sort of like
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.440]   be responsible for.
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:39.420]   But in our passage today,
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.220]   we'll see how Jesus subverts the norms of his days
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.340]   on what makes someone a faithful or devout Jews.
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.980]   But before that, let's enjoy our passage
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.940]   in the larger context of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.440]   So in Jesus' Sermon on the Mount,
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.220]   there is three major section that sort of like
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.860]   made up the main content for this sermon.
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.460]   And in the first major section,
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.540]   that is in Matthew chapter five,
[00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.980]   we learn that the truly blessed life
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.260]   comes from having an intimate relationship
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:14.500]   with our heavenly father, true Jesus Christ,
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.380]   and following after Jesus' example
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.020]   to live in a way that embodies his kingdom righteousness.
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.780]   In this first section,
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:24.960]   Jesus focused on the true righteousness
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.500]   that exceeds that of the Pharisees
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.320]   and the teachers of the law.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.860]   But in our section in Matthew chapter six today,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.020]   Jesus continues with his teaching on righteousness.
[00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.980]   But this time, instead of focusing
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:41.180]   on the positive aspect of righteousness,
[00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.780]   Jesus is going to focus on the wrong kind of righteousness,
[00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.160]   false righteousness.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.680]   Moreover, while the better righteousness
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.060]   in Matthew chapter five has to do with our relationship
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.900]   with each other, that is sort of like
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.020]   the horizontal aspect of our relationship,
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.440]   right here in Matthew chapter six,
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.220]   the righteousness that Jesus talks about
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.000]   has to do with our relationship with him.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.520]   So the vertical relationship between us and between God.
[00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.820]   And as we'll see later in our passage,
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.460]   showing off one's personal devotion to God
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.540]   or one's personal righteousness has become an avenue
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:20.980]   where someone in Jesus' days can do this
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:23.660]   to gain respect from the community.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.820]   Or they can do this to kind of like
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.880]   increase their social status.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.860]   And so Jesus, specifically,
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.620]   he warns again these kind of righteousness,
[00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:35.540]   the performative righteousness,
[00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.380]   the wrong kind of righteousness for his followers.
[00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:41.380]   So let's look at our passage today in Matthew chapter six.
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:47.340]   So Matthew six begins like this, be careful.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.100]   So Jesus doesn't waste any time
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:52.300]   and he gets straight to his point with this imperative
[00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.620]   or with this authoritative command,
[00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:58.260]   be careful or be aware.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.820]   And when Jesus say, be careful, we need to pay attention.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.460]   And so what is Jesus trying to warn us here about?
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.800]   He says, be careful not to practice your righteousness
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.220]   in front of others to be seen by them.
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:14.660]   If you do, you will have no reward
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:16.640]   from your father in heaven.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.460]   So this verse right here, verse one,
[00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:23.500]   will serve as sort of like an overarching structure
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:25.100]   for our passage today.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.900]   So let's break it down a little bit.
[00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.300]   So right here, there's four elements
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:32.100]   that Jesus will repeat on each of the examples
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.540]   that we'll be looking at today.
[00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:35.660]   So the first one is the action.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:37.860]   So the action that Jesus talks about right here,
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:42.100]   the overarching actions is practicing righteousness.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.700]   And what righteousness means is pretty much
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:46.260]   is how to live rightly before the Lord.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.500]   And right here specifically,
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.020]   the emphasis is on our actions and on our deeds.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.780]   And then the second element is the manner
[00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:55.820]   of practicing this righteousness.
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.720]   It is in front of other people.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.320]   And then the third element, the motive,
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:05.320]   is to be seen and approved by other people as well.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:08.120]   And then the final element, the consequences,
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.680]   Jesus say you will have no reward
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.620]   from your father in heaven.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:17.000]   So right here, what Jesus is having an issue is
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.520]   with more specifically on the second and the third element,
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.520]   the manner and the motives
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:25.400]   in which we practice our righteousness.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.800]   So with that in mind, this is the main idea
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.660]   that we'll be diving into today from our passage.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.160]   A worldly disciple pursues right living
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.040]   for the applause of people.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:42.280]   But a kingdom disciple pursues right living
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.920]   for the affirmation of the Father.
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.100]   So we'll look at this idea from the three different examples
[00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.720]   that Jesus has given.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.080]   That is the first one, giving to the poor,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:58.440]   second, praying, and then the third one, on fasting.
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.560]   And why these three examples specifically?
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.040]   Well, again, these are some of the most basic
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.800]   Jewish practice and religious activities
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.760]   that Jews can express their devotion to God.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.960]   In other words, these three activities
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.320]   are the identity marker of a good Jewish person.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:18.560]   If you check all of these off,
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:22.200]   that basically means you are a pretty decent Jew.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:24.720]   And again, through these examples,
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:28.280]   Jesus is trying to show us that as a disciples of Jesus,
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:30.320]   as his kingdom disciples,
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:33.120]   we strive to live a holy and righteous life,
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:35.960]   not for the praise of other people,
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.800]   but to be seen by our heavenly Father alone.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.120]   So let's take a look at each of these three examples today.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.180]   And the first one is giving to the poor.
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.380]   So Matthew chapter six, verse two.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.320]   So when you give to the needy,
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.400]   do not announce it with trumpets
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.800]   as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and on the streets.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:59.960]   To be honored by others.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.560]   Truly I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.920]   But when you give to the needy,
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.040]   do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:12.360]   so that your giving may be in secret.
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:15.680]   Then your father who sees what is done in secret
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:16.900]   will reward you.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.960]   So if you remember the four element here,
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.920]   the first one is the action, right?
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:24.040]   So the action that Jesus focused on here
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.360]   is giving to the poor.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.480]   And then the manner that Jesus warns against
[00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:32.280]   is announcing it with trumpets as these hypocrites do
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   in synagogues or on the streets.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.120]   So a little background context on giving to the poor
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.360]   or almsgiving from the Bible.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:43.080]   In the Old Testament, social justice
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.180]   is actually a pretty prominent themes all throughout,
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.840]   but especially in the prophets.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:51.880]   And when it comes to the intertestamental period,
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.840]   that is the time between the Old Testament
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.000]   and the New Testament,
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:00.120]   giving to the poor has become a sign of religious piety.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:02.720]   And so fast forward to Jesus days,
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.840]   giving to the poor has pretty much become synonymous
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.360]   with righteousness.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.920]   And when people give,
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.060]   they don't usually give directly to the needy,
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.880]   but they give it through the synagogues.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.000]   And so the synagogues,
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.720]   they will function like a social agency,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.760]   similar to the charities or nonprofits
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.400]   that we're familiar today,
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:25.820]   like Salvation Army or World Vision,
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:27.120]   where this agency,
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.800]   they will collect the donation from the community
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.040]   and then distribute it to the poor
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:34.460]   in the community as well.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.040]   So while this public display of generosity
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.760]   is a way to celebrate God's goodness
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.400]   and generosity towards his own people,
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.120]   the hypocrites, on the other hand,
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.240]   they will take this as an opportunity
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.400]   to show off their generosity
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.560]   so that they can receive praise from other people.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.980]   Simply put, their motivation here
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.360]   is to simply be seen and be praised by other people.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.820]   So what Jesus warns against here is this.
[00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:06.780]   When you give to the poor,
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:09.260]   don't draw attention to your acts of kindness
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:11.960]   and generosity like these hypocrites do.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.300]   And the word hypocrite here will actually be mentioned
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:17.620]   in all three of our examples today as well.
[00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.740]   So I think it is worthwhile to spend a little time
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:23.060]   just to understand what Jesus is referring to.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:26.480]   So this word originally referred to a stage players
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.200]   or an actor in a Greek theater
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.560]   who put on mask to play all these different roles
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:32.960]   in the play.
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.600]   And usually, they will put on mask
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:37.280]   to pretend to be someone that they are not, right?
[00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:40.320]   So by the time of the New Testament,
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.320]   these words started to take on a more negative connotation,
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.760]   referring to someone who pretends to be morally good
[00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:49.480]   or morally virtuous,
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.560]   but they're just being false and empty inside.
[00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.960]   Essentially, someone who is a moral actor.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.900]   I'm sure we all are familiar with someone like that, right?
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.620]   Growing up in Malaysia,
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.660]   usually when there's a flood or a house that got burned down
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:07.580]   or some sort of natural disaster that happened,
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:09.700]   the local politicians will usually show up
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.820]   to provide some sort of assistance
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:13.520]   and aid to these people, right?
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.880]   Because that is part of their job,
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:16.980]   that they're being elected by the people
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.240]   to serve the people.
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:22.540]   However, most of the time, when the politicians show up,
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.260]   they don't just come by themselves.
[00:13:24.260 --> 00:13:27.720]   They usually show up with the social media team
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.260]   or reporters from different news outlet
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.960]   or journalists from different newspaper
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:37.020]   in order that the good works can somewhat be documented
[00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:38.900]   and then being shown to the public.
[00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:41.900]   Look, look at what I've done for you all.
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.220]   And the funny thing is,
[00:13:43.220 --> 00:13:46.220]   the closer it gets to an election year,
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:47.900]   these kind of operations will become
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.500]   more and more frequent.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.820]   They will start to visit the poorer part of the city
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.540]   and then take a photo there,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:57.060]   or they will visit hospital or orphanage in the city,
[00:13:57.060 --> 00:13:59.980]   or do whatever they need, the publicity stunt,
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:01.820]   to increase the reputation.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:07.580]   And the consequences of putting up a show for generosity
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:10.780]   like the hypocrites, this is what Jesus warns.
[00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:15.460]   "Truly, I tell you, they have received the reward in full."
[00:14:15.460 --> 00:14:17.720]   This can be a little bit confusing at first
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.900]   because you might wonder,
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.300]   "Jesus, I thought you warned against
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:23.340]   "this kind of public display of generosity.
[00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.860]   "How come they're still able to receive a reward
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.820]   "and even receive a reward in full?"
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.020]   So let's unpack that a little bit.
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:34.020]   So what Jesus is saying here
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:36.460]   is that they have received their full reward
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.380]   now in the earthly sense.
[00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:41.320]   Put it another way, Jesus is saying that
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.540]   if you give to the poor
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.500]   with the intention of receiving praise from people,
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:49.940]   then praise from people is all you're ever going to get.
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.860]   And God pretty much owes you nothing.
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:56.100]   So in this way, your reward is in the here and now.
[00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:58.460]   Your reward is pretty much temporary.
[00:14:58.460 --> 00:15:01.520]   And from another perspective,
[00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.620]   you're actually not giving to the poor,
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:07.120]   but you're sort of like buying your praises from people.
[00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:11.200]   So your reward is also transactional as well.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.420]   Every time you want to receive honor or receive praise,
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.620]   you just give to the poor
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.460]   so that you pretty much buy your praises,
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:20.620]   buy the action of giving to the poor.
[00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:25.660]   So how should we give as his disciples?
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.620]   As kingdom disciples,
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.020]   how should we do this act of kindness towards the needy?
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:34.980]   And what kind of manner should we have?
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:37.940]   So in verse three and four, Jesus say,
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.020]   "When you give to the poor, to the needy,
[00:15:40.020 --> 00:15:41.540]   "do not let your left hand know
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.300]   "what your right hand is doing,
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.060]   "so that your giving may be in secret.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:48.740]   "Then your father who sees what is done in secret
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:50.040]   "will reward you."
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:52.860]   So what Jesus say is this,
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:56.380]   when we give to the poor or when we help those in need,
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:58.900]   do it in secret or privacy,
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.900]   to the extent that even our left hand
[00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:03.000]   doesn't know what our right hand is doing.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.500]   And to be able to show kindness and generosity
[00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:09.100]   to this extent requires us
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:11.860]   to completely disregard ourself, right?
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:13.160]   That is what Jesus mean,
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.620]   that your left hand doesn't know
[00:16:14.620 --> 00:16:16.540]   what your right hand is doing.
[00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:20.500]   It is a point where we need to completely disregard ourself.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.180]   And the outcome of it,
[00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:25.320]   we will receive our heavenly reward from the Father.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:28.300]   And one thing to note here,
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.940]   Jesus does not mean that we give
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:31.900]   because we want to receive a reward
[00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.900]   from our heavenly Father.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:36.260]   We give from a cheerful and sincere heart
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:38.260]   for several reasons.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.500]   If you recall at the end of Matthew five,
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:44.420]   the command to be perfect as our heavenly Father is,
[00:16:44.420 --> 00:16:46.460]   our goal on this side of heaven
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.580]   is to be like our heavenly Father.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.420]   And from the Bible,
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:52.020]   we know that our heavenly Father
[00:16:52.020 --> 00:16:54.220]   is one who cares for the poor,
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.660]   the marginalized,
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.140]   and those in which the world has little regard for.
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:02.220]   So when we give to the poor or help those in need,
[00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:05.100]   we are living out our kingdom identity
[00:17:05.100 --> 00:17:07.440]   as the son and daughters of God.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.740]   And secondly, we give to the poor because we love him
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.340]   and we want to give back a portion
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:15.140]   of what he has blessed us with.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.020]   Later in Matthew,
[00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.420]   in the parable of the sheep and goat,
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:21.620]   Jesus himself emphasized that
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.580]   whatever we do to the least among us,
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:26.900]   we do it to Jesus himself.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:29.740]   So as disciples of Jesus,
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:32.740]   we pursue generosity and kindness,
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:35.840]   not for the temporary glory from men,
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:38.700]   like the hypocrites or the worldly disciples do,
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:42.440]   but we do it for the affirmation from our heavenly Father.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.620]   So this is the first examples on giving to the poor.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:50.740]   Then Jesus moved on to the second examples, prayer.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.460]   So let's start with some background context
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:55.120]   to prayer in the Jewish culture.
[00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.060]   If you are a Jews,
[00:17:57.060 --> 00:18:00.660]   there are set times of prayer for you every day.
[00:18:00.660 --> 00:18:02.080]   As traditionally,
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.120]   the Jews, they will pray at least twice a day,
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:08.000]   one in the morning and one in the evening.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.040]   And usually during those set hours of prayers,
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.720]   they will pray the Shema prayer,
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.600]   which is from Deuteronomy.
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.500]   Hear, O Israel, the Lord, your God, the Lord is one.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:19.640]   And so when it comes to prayer,
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.720]   more specifically on personal prayer,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.400]   this is what Jesus has to say.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:29.240]   And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites,
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:31.840]   for they love to pray standing in the synagogues
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:35.120]   and on the street corners to be seen by others.
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.480]   Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.240]   But when you pray, go into your room,
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:46.360]   close the door and pray to the Father who is unseen.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:49.440]   Then your Father who sees what is done in secret
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:50.820]   will reward you.
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.800]   So again, we see the similar elements
[00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.160]   and themes right here, right?
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:58.840]   It start with the action, that is praying.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.960]   And the manner in which the hypocrites pray
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:03.000]   is to stand in the synagogues,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.380]   which is the epicenter of all things Jewish life,
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:07.760]   or on the street corner,
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:11.280]   which is also a public space with high visibility.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:12.640]   If you think of a corner,
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:15.480]   you can see through a corner, not just from one side,
[00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:17.360]   but from both ways as well.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.520]   And usually the foot traffic around the corner
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.720]   will also be a little bit slow
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:22.920]   because people will slow down
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:24.660]   when they're trying to turn a corner.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:26.800]   So the street corners are places
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.960]   with usually the highest visibilities that you can get.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:34.840]   And the motivation of doing these things,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.120]   once again, it is to be seen by other people.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:41.440]   And to these hypocrites, Jesus once again say that
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.460]   they have received their reward in full
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.640]   in the here and now,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:49.520]   the temporary and fleeting kind of reward
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.200]   that pretty much just goes away
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.920]   once your prayer is finished.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:56.940]   But on the contrary, Jesus taught that when we pray,
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.840]   go into the room, and not only that,
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.140]   close the door and lock it up
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.660]   so that no one else except God alone can see us.
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:09.500]   This is because the goal of our personal prayer
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:13.580]   is to commune with our Father and to abide in Him,
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:15.540]   not to impress other people.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:20.180]   And then Jesus continues with the same practice of prayer,
[00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.560]   but this time with a different kind of manner
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.740]   and also a different kind of motivation.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.460]   So verse seven,
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:31.620]   "And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like the pagans,
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.300]   for they think that they will be heard
[00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:35.500]   because of their many words.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.980]   Do not be like them,
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:41.420]   for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him."
[00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:43.860]   So besides praying in public places,
[00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:46.820]   another manner that we can be tempted to pray
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:51.620]   is to use fancy words or try to pray as long as we can
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:53.660]   without any actual content to it.
[00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.860]   Jesus compares this kind of prayer
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:00.060]   to the prayers of the Gentiles during their pagan worship,
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.260]   where they were pretty much like playing relate
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.300]   with the pantheon of gods,
[00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:05.940]   where they would repeatedly mention
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:08.240]   the names of different pagan gods
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.940]   with the hope that just maybe the right god
[00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:13.220]   would listen or hear their prayers
[00:21:13.220 --> 00:21:15.660]   and help them in their circumstances.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:17.940]   In other words, they pray
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:20.060]   because they try to manipulate gods
[00:21:20.060 --> 00:21:22.200]   for their personal benefits.
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:28.220]   But as God's children, we do not have to pray like that
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:32.580]   because our Heavenly Father is a different kind of God.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:36.260]   We don't need a secret passcode or say a certain phrase
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:39.860]   or special words for Him to hear our prayers,
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.560]   because He is a God who loves and cares for His people,
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:48.320]   one who knows our needs even before we bring it before Him.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.220]   He is a God who is eager to respond to our requests,
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.880]   and He is a God who delight in His children
[00:21:56.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   when we come before Him with our prayers.
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:03.020]   And as we step into this new theme
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:05.620]   of crossing over at our church here,
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.620]   one of the aspects that we'll be focusing on,
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:09.600]   like Pastor Mark said earlier,
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.300]   is on our relationship with Him, with God.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.180]   And so with that, I want to ask,
[00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:16.760]   how is your relationship with the Lord
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:18.580]   when it comes to your prayer life?
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:24.580]   On my trip back to Malaysia last October,
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.580]   I got to spend a lot of time just catching up
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:29.460]   and also hanging out with a lot of friends and family
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.980]   because I haven't been back for seven years.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:33.860]   However, one thing that I quickly realized
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:37.500]   is that in most of these gatherings or hangouts,
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.300]   people would always ask me to pray
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.060]   because they know that I'm a pastor here in the US.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:45.460]   And it got to the point where during dinner one night,
[00:22:45.460 --> 00:22:48.140]   it is just between me, my brother, and my mom.
[00:22:48.140 --> 00:22:50.020]   I had to stop and tell my mom,
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:52.900]   "Mom, can you stop asking me to pray every time?"
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.520]   Like people has been asking me to pray
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:57.640]   since I got back to my hometown pretty much.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:23:01.020]   And this experience makes me realize two things.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:04.740]   For one, for me personally,
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.700]   I feel the pressure to pray in a certain way
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:10.300]   to meet the expectation of people,
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:12.140]   especially with people acknowledging that,
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:13.400]   "Oh, he's a pastor."
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:16.620]   So I feel like I have to pray in a certain way.
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.860]   And so when I pray during those times,
[00:23:18.860 --> 00:23:20.100]   I feel like I'm praying more
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:22.580]   to meet the expectation of these people
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:24.960]   instead of genuinely praying to the Father.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.720]   But secondly, I sense that for some people,
[00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.560]   they have these false ideas that,
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:34.680]   "Okay, if a pastor prays for them,
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:36.600]   they will be extra blessed,
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.540]   or that God will be more willing to answer the prayer."
[00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:41.660]   For these people,
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:44.080]   they might feel like they don't really know how to pray,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.720]   or their prayer is less effective
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:47.480]   just because of the fact that
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.320]   they're not "professional Christian."
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.740]   But again, what we see right here
[00:23:53.740 --> 00:23:56.220]   is that this is not the case at all.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.920]   God does not concern with what words we use,
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:00.660]   or how long our prayer is.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:04.360]   In the following verse in Matthew 6,
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:08.720]   Jesus would go on to show us how we ought to pray.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:12.020]   And this has become known as the Lord's Prayer.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:14.220]   But for today, we'll skip over this portion first
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.900]   and come back to it later in my next sermon.
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:20.340]   And so, so far we have looked at the first two examples
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:23.460]   on giving to the poor and also on prayer.
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.020]   And now Jesus continues with his third practice
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:31.520]   of righteousness on fasting, beginning in verse 16.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:38.740]   So when you fast, do not look somber as the hypocrites do,
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.460]   for they disfigure their face
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.820]   to show others that they are fasting.
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:47.640]   Truly, I tell you, they have received their reward in full.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.880]   So the purpose of fasting is for us
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.780]   to kind of like have a heart of complete dependence
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:58.320]   on the Lord, right?
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:00.980]   And it's also usually also a way for us
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:03.080]   to kind of like practice humility,
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:06.700]   just knowing that we cannot depend on ourself.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:09.300]   However, the hypocrites,
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:12.260]   they would intentionally disfigure their face
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.020]   and make themselves look gloomy and miserable
[00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.660]   when they fast.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.260]   This is because in the Old Testament,
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.980]   fasting is often associated with repentance.
[00:25:21.980 --> 00:25:23.260]   And along with fasting,
[00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:26.560]   people will usually also put on ashes on their face
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.300]   and put on sackcloth
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.000]   in order to heighten the feeling of sin and mourning.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:35.140]   But when these hypocrites fast,
[00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.460]   they put on a show
[00:25:36.460 --> 00:25:39.420]   so that they can be recognized as more religious
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.260]   instead of coming out from a heart
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.000]   of mourning over their sins or mourning over the brokenness.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:49.700]   So instead of coming from a place of humility,
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.860]   this kind of performative fasting
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.220]   comes from a place of pride,
[00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.620]   of wanting to be recognized.
[00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.780]   And instead of an attitude of dependence on God,
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.580]   this kind of performative fasting
[00:26:01.580 --> 00:26:05.300]   comes from an attitude of dependence on yourself.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:07.860]   Pretty much, look at how righteous I am.
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:09.340]   Look at how religious I am.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:12.520]   And this kind of performative fasting
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:15.260]   is what Jesus is warning us against.
[00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:17.180]   And again, these hypocrites,
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.460]   Jesus say that they have received the full reward
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:22.140]   in the here and now.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.100]   So how should we fast then?
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:30.100]   So this is what Jesus say, verse 17.
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:35.100]   "But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:38.140]   "so that it will not be obvious to others
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.080]   "that you are fasting,
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.120]   "but only to your father who is unseen.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:46.280]   "And your father who sees what is done in secret
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:48.000]   "will reward you."
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.580]   So what Jesus meant is this.
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.620]   When you fast, clean yourself up
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:57.220]   and make yourself look presentable.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:01.020]   Go out of your way to make yourself look normal
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.200]   in order that no one will recognize that you are fasting,
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:07.540]   but only the Father alone.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:12.540]   So I want to end my sermon with these stories of someone
[00:27:12.540 --> 00:27:15.100]   whom I have the privilege of meeting,
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:18.960]   who perfectly embodies this kind of heart posture
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.380]   in their love of God
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:22.900]   and also in their service for other people.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:26.180]   In summer 2019, when I was still serving
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:27.660]   with another ministry,
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.040]   I spent the summer staffing a summer mission
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.080]   of about 20 plus college students
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:35.700]   from all across the United States.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:38.140]   And we're having our summer mission here
[00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:39.840]   in the inner city of Chicago.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.780]   And on our first Saturday,
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:46.100]   we partner with a pastor from South Side of Chicago
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.020]   to do a homeless outreach.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:51.140]   So this pastor, his name is Pastor Burton.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.240]   And he had been doing this homeless outreach
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.320]   for years already at that point.
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:27:57.760]   And every Saturday morning
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.520]   during the warmer months of the year,
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.320]   he would set up a table to give out lunches
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.920]   and essential supplies to the homeless person.
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:09.680]   So I have a few pictures from that summer.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.720]   Can anyone recognize where the pictures on the top right is?
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:15.460]   Where is that at in Chicago?
[00:28:15.460 --> 00:28:19.440]   Yes, it is on Canal Street
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.260]   and it is right across Pacific Garden Mission,
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.520]   which is a homeless shelter.
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:28.160]   But why does he specifically set up a table
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:30.720]   to provide these essential supplies and food
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:33.160]   and lunches for the homeless people
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:34.720]   outside of a homeless shelter?
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.920]   Well, because there are people
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:38.400]   who are not being able to accept
[00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:40.920]   into the Pacific Gardens Mission programming
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.600]   for various reasons.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.880]   And these are the people that Pastor Burton,
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.240]   he wanted to serve.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.360]   And after a couple of hours,
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.160]   just kind of like setting up the table at Canal,
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.760]   he would then drive to Lower Wacker Drive
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:56.200]   to give out some supplies
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.100]   and also check in on the people who live in tents
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.120]   and some of the max-shift shelters there.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.480]   So the picture on the lower left
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.920]   is actually at Lower Wacker.
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:08.200]   And if you have been to Lower Wacker before,
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.840]   you probably know that it is pretty much
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:11.920]   like a maze down there, right?
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.480]   It's not only is it dark
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.840]   and the street is a little complicated
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:18.400]   and your GPS like nine out of 10 times,
[00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:20.320]   it just doesn't work there.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:22.680]   So I've personally driven through Lower Wacker
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:23.520]   countless times,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:25.920]   but I actually never recognized anyone
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.440]   actually living down there.
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.200]   But the thing about Pastor Burton
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.980]   that really stood out to me,
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.600]   even until this day,
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:35.680]   is how he's able to remember
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.280]   where each of these individual lives.
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:41.020]   I remember that Saturday,
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:43.800]   we would just randomly stop at a spot
[00:29:43.800 --> 00:29:45.040]   like on Lower Wacker,
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.360]   and then he would just turn and tell us,
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:48.000]   "Okay, you guys can grab the supplies
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.560]   "and we're gonna head out now."
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.360]   And then he would lead us
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:54.800]   to all these different nooks and crannies
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.240]   on Lower Wacker,
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.740]   where all these people live.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.760]   And so not only did he remember
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.720]   where each of these people live,
[00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:04.600]   he also know them by their name.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.560]   He will call them,
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:06.640]   and these people will kind of like
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.520]   come out of the corners.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.440]   And he also knew the specific needs
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:12.400]   of each of these individuals.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   If it is a guy,
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:15.880]   he have some specific supplies for a guy.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.080]   If it is a mom with a few little kids,
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.640]   he also have some specific supplies
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.440]   for this mom and her kids.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.700]   And the most important thing is,
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.200]   you would never see Pastor Burton
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.240]   being on the news,
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.960]   being recognized for the good work
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:31.900]   that he has done.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.460]   And yet he show up week after week,
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.220]   because he knew that he was serving
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:39.320]   these people for the Lord.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:42.880]   For him, he is just living out his faith
[00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.520]   and being obedient to Jesus.
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.360]   And even though I only get to spend a day
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.800]   with Pastor Burton,
[00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.200]   his example has left such a huge impact
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.860]   in my life that I think
[00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.620]   it will pretty much last forever.
[00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.200]   And that summary also changed
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.640]   a lot of my perspective of Chicago
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.960]   as a city as well.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.100]   So before I end,
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.720]   I want to leave us with this question
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.780]   to reflect on.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.520]   What motivations tend to drive
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.940]   your acts of worship and service?
[00:31:12.940 --> 00:31:15.060]   Is it the approval of God?
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:18.340]   Or the admiration of others?
[00:31:18.340 --> 00:31:25.260]   Again, a worldly disciple pursues
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:28.300]   right living for the applause of people.
[00:31:28.300 --> 00:31:30.900]   And a kingdom disciples,
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:31.740]   on the other hand,
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.820]   pursues right living for the affirmation
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:35.720]   of the Father.
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.300]   So let's spend some time
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.300]   just reflect on these questions
[00:31:40.300 --> 00:31:42.100]   and I would end this with a prayer.
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:50.280]   (soft music)
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.700]   (soft music)
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:55.120]   (soft music)
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.540]   (soft music)
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:31:59.960]   (soft music)
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.380]   (soft music)
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:04.800]   (soft music)
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:10.660]   (soft music)
[00:32:10.660 --> 00:32:16.680]   (soft music)
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:22.640]   (soft music)
[00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:28.800]   (soft music)
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:31.220]   (soft music)
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:37.080]   (soft music)
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:42.220]   (soft music)
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:48.000]   (soft music)
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:55.220]   (soft music)
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:57.640]   (soft music)
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:04.640]   (soft music)
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:14.640]   (soft music)
[00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:24.640]   (soft music)
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.060]   (soft music)
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.800]   - Heavenly Father,
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:34.560]   I ask that you would help us
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.800]   to be a church and be a people
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:40.320]   who loves you,
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:41.640]   who serve others,
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:45.380]   not for the praise of people
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.140]   or to be recognized by the world,
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:51.400]   but to do all these things of generosity,
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.260]   this act of kindness,
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:56.680]   out of a pure motives of just loving you
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.200]   and also loving your people.
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:02.240]   Help us to be a people
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:04.080]   who is able to love selflessly,
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:06.700]   who is able to serve selflessly,
[00:34:06.700 --> 00:34:11.000]   because we know that we belong to your kingdom.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.080]   We know that we belong to you,
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:15.640]   our Heavenly Fathers,
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:18.200]   and that we're able to do all these things,
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:20.480]   not because of our own abilities,
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:23.200]   but because of the love that you have for us.
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.420]   So help us, Fathers,
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:31.640]   not to chase after the glory of man
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.600]   or the praise from the world,
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.620]   but to be your kingdom disciples
[00:34:37.620 --> 00:34:39.980]   who long for your affirmation
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.420]   and your approval alone.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:43.700]   Help us to be people
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.900]   who loves you
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:48.020]   and love others in a way
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:50.080]   that shows our kingdom identity.
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:52.340]   (soft piano music)
[00:34:52.340 --> 00:34:56.900]   So Father, as we finish our service today
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.300]   and just go on for our week,
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.940]   I just ask that you will help us,
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:03.940]   even in this week,
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:07.520]   to have opportunity to serve and love others
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:10.220]   in the way that you have called us to.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.360]   So I pray this in your Son's name, amen.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:18.060]   Okay, thank you for joining us this morning.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:23.060]   As Kelly said, we'll serve some lunch outside,
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.240]   so feel free to hang out
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.980]   and just fellowship with one another.
[00:35:27.980 --> 00:35:30.640]   Thank you.
