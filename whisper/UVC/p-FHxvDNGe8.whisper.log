[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.840]   It's a frightening privilege to be here with you guys today.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.040]   Before I begin, let's open in a word of prayer.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.440]   Would you bow your heads with me as we pray?
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:31.880]   Heavenly Father, you have been so, so good to us.
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.040]   And sometimes, Lord, these words come out of us a little contrite.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.040]   But God, you are the God, the creator of heaven and earth.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.840]   From your word, there was light.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.840]   And from your word, there was life in us.
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.320]   And so we come before you by the blood of your son, Jesus.
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.400]   Come humbly before your cross and ask that you would hear us, that you would know us
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:05.960]   and see us, that you would give us hearts that are softened to you.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:14.120]   Ask that you would use this moment as we proceed to open our eyes to your word, to help us
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120]   hear what it is that you have to say to us.
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.440]   For myself, Lord, I ask that you would guide my words, that you would help me speak good,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.480]   sound doctrine, that you would protect the ears of my brothers and sisters from anything
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.680]   I say that is not of you.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.680]   So we thank you, Lord.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680]   We praise you in Jesus' name.
[00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.680]   Amen.
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:49.880]   So for those of you who weren't here the last time I spoke, we are in the book of James,
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.960]   which is a letter from James to the Jewish Christians of the dispersion, which are the
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:01.640]   Jewish Christians scattered away from their homeland.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.840]   And what we find in James are instructions, instructions given to these Jewish Christians
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.840]   on how they should be living.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.240]   They're given so that James' brothers and sisters would live wise lives, lives that
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.100]   are reflective of the gospel that they have received.
[00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:33.000]   And what we find in James is that wisdom is not just knowing a lot about stuff, a lot
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.480]   about stuff that's about life, but rather wisdom must also include practical application
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.900]   of what we know about our God into every area of our lives.
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.280]   This is a theme that will come up again and again.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.480]   James writes with this idea in mind, that followers of Christ can't just be hearers.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.560]   No, not just hearers.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.400]   They must also be doers of the word.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.320]   So if you have your Bibles with you, I ask that you would open with me to the book of
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.000]   James.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.200]   The passage is also going to be on the screen.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.560]   I'll flip through the slides for you.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:28.680]   Today we will be reading from James chapter 2, verses 1 to 13.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:38.960]   Again, that is James chapter 2, verses 1 to 13.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   Let's read.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:53.960]   My brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not show favoritism.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:59.120]   Suppose a man comes into your meeting wearing a gold ring and fine clothes and a poor man
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.620]   in filthy old clothes also comes in.
[00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.280]   If you show special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Here's a good seat
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.440]   for you," but say to the poor man, "You stand there or sit on the floor by my feet," have
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.880]   you not discriminated amongst yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.760]   Listen, my dear brothers and sisters, has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:28.480]   of the world to be rich in faith and inherit the kingdom He promised to those who love
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.560]   Him?
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.760]   But you have dishonored the poor.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.840]   Is it not the rich who are exploiting you?
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.640]   Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.520]   Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of Him to whom you belong?
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.640]   If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, love your neighbor as yourself,
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.120]   you are doing right.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.160]   But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.720]   For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:01.800]   of it.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.120]   For he who said, "You shall not commit adultery," also said, "You shall not murder."
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:11.760]   If you do not commit adultery but do commit murder, you have become a lawbreaker.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.440]   Speak and act as those who are going to be judged by the law that gives freedom because
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:21.480]   judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:30.760]   Mercy triumphs over judgment.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:38.520]   Now the amazing thing about James is that his instructions are very, very straightforward.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:44.880]   Now look, my brothers and sisters, believers in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ must not
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.400]   show favoritism.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:54.120]   To his brothers and sisters, James says, "Since you believe in Jesus, you must not show favoritism."
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:55.120]   It's right there.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:02.440]   If you are a believer in Jesus Christ, you have no business showing favoritism.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:04.240]   So what is favoritism?
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.240]   Does anyone know?
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:09.360]   Can anyone give me a definition?
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.240]   Okay.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.920]   Well, I'll give you one.
[00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:22.440]   Favoritism is this practice of special treatment, okay?
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.840]   Special treatment of valuing things or people differently.
[00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:34.600]   And what often comes along with this word is that favoritism is unfair.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:44.520]   I think most of us here have experienced favoritism or even shown favoritism at some point in
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.520]   their life.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.660]   You know, sometimes it's the small things.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:58.460]   Maybe it looks like going...it might look like certain lunch suggestions being more
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.960]   acceptable and then you never get to go where you want to go.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.540]   It might look like the favorite food of your brothers and sisters constantly being eaten
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:13.720]   night after night because your parents love them very, very much and so you're stuck eating
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.360]   that food.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:24.420]   Other times, it might look like conversations that are cut short or even avoided so that
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.200]   you can spend more time talking to your closest friends.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.560]   It might look like excess friendliness to the professor who grades your papers.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:41.360]   It might look like friendliness towards the person who writes your paychecks.
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:46.840]   But let's let James show us what favoritism looks like.
[00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:50.800]   I realize now that I did not keep going with the slides so you can read along with me.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.880]   But that's okay.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:54.920]   We're going to look at James chapter two.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.800]   We're going to look at what favoritism looks like.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:01.460]   We're given this scenario in verses two to four, right?
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.460]   Look with me there.
[00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:12.040]   Two to four where we find two men joining believers in their place of meeting.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.580]   For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly and a poor
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:22.240]   man in shabby clothing also comes in, and if you pay attention to the one who wears
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:26.760]   the fine clothing and say, "You sit here in a good place," while you say to the poor man,
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:31.520]   "You stand over there or sit down at my feet," have you not then made distinctions among
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:35.960]   yourselves and become judges of evil thoughts?
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.960]   There's one man.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.600]   He's dressed in fine clothes.
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.480]   His fine clothes are bright and shining, right?
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:44.440]   That's the description that's given about him.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:48.080]   He wears this gold ring that lets everybody know.
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:53.820]   It announces how high his socioeconomic status is.
[00:08:53.820 --> 00:09:00.220]   The other is described as this poor man, a man in filthy old clothes.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:05.360]   In contrast to the man in fine clothing, this man's unwashed, right?
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.180]   And his clothes are mismatched.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:14.060]   It is easy to tell what rung of society he is on.
[00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:20.180]   Favoritism in this case looks like offering a good seat to the man wearing fine clothing
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:27.060]   while telling the poor man to stand there or sit where people are resting their feet.
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:35.380]   It's this honoring of the well-off man for his appearance, for his wealth, and this dishonoring
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:40.280]   of the poor man based on his lack.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:47.880]   Doing this, James writes, is not only favoritism that believers must not show, it's also discrimination
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.640]   against yourself.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:58.100]   And it makes you into a judge with evil thoughts, into a judge that judges poorly.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:03.540]   Remember that the people James writes to are a scattered people.
[00:10:03.540 --> 00:10:07.000]   These are people who live in a foreign land.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.440]   They are suffering under discrimination.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:11.280]   They are greatly in need.
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:15.800]   And so the judgment that is being made towards the poor man and the treatment he's given
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:23.920]   in this what-if scenario is the very same treatment and judgment that they are receiving.
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:30.680]   This is important to remember because we're so quick to think, of course, favoritism is
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:31.680]   wrong.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.840]   Anyone can tell you that.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:34.640]   You should not discriminate.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.640]   And you know what?
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.840]   It's not that difficult to avoid these things.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.000]   We think about that so easily and so quickly.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.680]   But think about these.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:49.160]   Think about how helpful it would be to a poor group of people if someone with wealth and
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.980]   resources were to join them.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:57.020]   Think about the extra burden that will be placed on this group of people just from having
[00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:02.340]   one more poor person join them, one more mouth to feed when you yourself have nothing and
[00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:06.120]   are struggling to feed yourself.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.160]   You see, favoritism is tempting.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.020]   Favoritism is very tempting.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:16.520]   And James writes this to his brothers and sisters because this is a real and present
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:17.820]   problem.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:25.820]   He talks about this because it's a real flaw in our character in Christians that keep us
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:32.280]   from being whole and complete in our entire being like Jesus.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.460]   So then, how does James tackle this problem?
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:43.400]   If you look with me to verses 5 to 7, I'll actually turn the slide this time.
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:46.560]   It says, "Listen, my dear brothers and sisters.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.180]   Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:55.540]   to inherit the kingdom He promised to those who love Him?
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.100]   But you have dishonored the poor.
[00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.100]   Is it not the rich who are exploiting you?
[00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:01.580]   Are they not the ones who are dragging you into court?
[00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:08.580]   Are they not the ones who are blaspheming the noble name of Him to whom you belong?"
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:09.900]   He starts to listen, right?
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:16.220]   "Listen," James says, "your attention right here, your attention on this," which is a
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:22.440]   rhetorical question, rhetorical meaning that this is a statement of truth that is disguised
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.580]   as a question, all right?
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:30.420]   "Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith,
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.620]   to inherit the kingdom?"
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:39.780]   And reading this, the response of James' brothers and sisters is, "Yes, of course, God has chosen
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.740]   those who are poor in the eyes of the world."
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:47.020]   They can't say otherwise because, you see, these are Jewish Christians.
[00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:55.660]   The history of their people, of those who are tied to the line of Abraham is just filled
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:00.300]   with God's concern for the lowly and the needy.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:06.380]   The literature of Israel is filled with this theme of God's love for the poor, for the
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:08.100]   widowed.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:15.100]   God's blessings are even promised to those who care for the poor, who see the poor and
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.140]   reach out to them.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:22.060]   Furthermore, what's even more than that is that the brothers and sisters in James, the
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:30.220]   audience to whom he writes, they are living proof of God's doing.
[00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:35.380]   God has chosen them, even though they were poor in the eyes of the world, to be given
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:39.820]   faith and to be heirs of God's kingdom.
[00:13:39.820 --> 00:13:44.980]   Instead of treating them poorly based on external appearance, God's attitude towards the lowly
[00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:51.340]   and the needy is that of compassion, of mercy, and of love.
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.340]   So yes, it's true.
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:56.660]   God cares for the poor in the eyes of the world.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:04.900]   So then, to dishonor the poor is to go against God's attitude, to go against the will of
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.780]   God, to represent the opposite of God's will.
[00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:15.580]   What we find here is that believers in Jesus must not show favoritism because God does
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:18.900]   not show favoritism.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:22.780]   Believers must not show favoritism because God does not show favoritism.
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:26.780]   God does not make judgment based on outward appearance.
[00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.220]   He looks at the heart.
[00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:35.420]   And so, James reminds his brothers and sisters of God's attitude towards the lowly and the
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:36.420]   needy.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.620]   He reminds them of God's attitude towards them.
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:44.780]   And by keeping this in mind and remembering God's compassion, believers can overcome this
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:48.300]   temptation to show favoritism.
[00:14:48.300 --> 00:14:50.500]   But James does not just leave it there.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   He doesn't just leave that be.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:58.140]   The issue with favoritism isn't just that it fights against God's compassion.
[00:14:58.140 --> 00:15:03.620]   You see, favoritism is a sin.
[00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:10.980]   This is the second point that we find in James, that believers in Jesus must not show favoritism
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:15.860]   because favoritism is sin.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:18.680]   Let's look at verses 8 to 11.
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.680]   If you really keep the royal law found in Scripture, love your neighbor as yourself,
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:25.500]   you are doing right.
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:30.400]   But if you show favoritism, you sin and are convicted by the law as lawbreakers.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:35.840]   For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles at just one point is guilty of breaking all
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.840]   of it.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.480]   All right?
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.440]   It's pretty straightforward.
[00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:45.200]   Believers that keep the royal law, right, they are doing right.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:46.600]   They're doing well.
[00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:49.680]   But here's another question.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.120]   What is this law?
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:54.320]   What is this law that he speaks of?
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:57.880]   This is the sovereign and royal law of God.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:04.380]   It points to the law of Moses that is declared again by Jesus and fulfilled in Jesus.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:10.520]   It points towards the commandments found in Leviticus chapter 19 of how God's people are
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:17.440]   to be holy, how they are to be set apart for him, and it points towards what Jesus declares
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:25.120]   to be the second most important of the commandments, to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:32.400]   In Leviticus 19, there is command after command given on how to treat those around you.
[00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:40.120]   Anyone and everyone you come into contact with in God's eyes is your neighbor.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.760]   You see, favoritism is sin.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:54.440]   Favoritism is transgression because both the poor man and the rich man are your neighbor.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:17:02.040]   It's not enough to just keep the commandments of God in some ways or even most ways.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:09.200]   Under the law, it is not good enough to almost be good enough.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:17.280]   To stumble at just one point, at just one point, is to be guilty of breaking all of
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.880]   the law.
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:26.040]   The law requires absolute perfection, and we're not perfect.
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:31.960]   Nobody here can say that they are a perfect keeper of the law.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:37.240]   If you understand this, then you are on the same page as James.
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:40.600]   Nobody can get to heaven through their perfect law keeping.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:45.720]   The statement of absolute requirement of the law is placed here to remind James' brothers
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:52.920]   and sisters of who they are because they're not people who have perfectly kept the law.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:58.360]   They are people who have had the law perfectly kept for them.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:02.200]   They're not people who are crushed under the judgment of the law that condemns.
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   No.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:12.360]   James' brothers and sisters are those that are under the law that liberates.
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.040]   What does James want his brothers and sisters to do?
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:27.160]   Well, we see in verses 12 to 13, 12 to 13, what not showing favoritism looks like.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.360]   This is what not showing favoritism looks like.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.480]   It looks like speaking and acting, not as someone who is under the law that condemns,
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:42.960]   but as someone who is under the law that gives freedom, as someone who is under grace.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:48.680]   It's the same reason that was given before in verse 5, because Jesus Christ did not show
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.640]   favoritism.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.160]   He did not judge you based on your outward appearance.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:19:00.160]   Instead, he saw you and he saw me in our helpless state.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:06.300]   And in that moment where we expected judgment, where we deserved judgment, we were instead
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:12.960]   met with a deep and overwhelming compassion.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:18.880]   Brothers and sisters, favoritism is such a poison to God's people.
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:26.480]   It damages relationships and it holds us back from spiritual growth without us even noticing.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:31.520]   Because of the sin of favoritism, too many of God's people have found their church to
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:37.700]   be one of the loneliest, most disconnecting places they have ever been.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:45.920]   To be surrounded by so many people while being unseen and unheard is just heartbreaking.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.240]   And this cannot be allowed.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.040]   We as believers of Jesus Christ cannot allow those who God has placed in our surroundings
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:20:01.760]   as our neighbors to remain separated and disconnected from the body of Christ.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:05.900]   Believers in Jesus Christ, you are under grace.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.600]   You were shown mercy.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:10.760]   Your sin was washed away once and for all.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:17.640]   And not only that, your identity is now more than a worldly measurement of ability or accomplishment.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:23.880]   You were chosen, you were elevated, and now exist as an heir to the kingdom of God.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:31.520]   And having been freed by this law that liberates, live as a child of God, as an heir to the
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.640]   kingdom of God.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:40.440]   Let your entire being be affected by the mercy of Christ and do not judge your neighbor by
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.360]   their outward appearance.
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.220]   Let's reflect on James' instruction.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:50.420]   Do not show favoritism because Christ did not show favoritism.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:54.640]   Do not show favoritism because favoritism is sin.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:59.720]   Instead, show mercy and show compassion.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:06.600]   See your neighbor the way Jesus sees them, the way that Jesus saw you, and approach your
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:13.560]   neighbor just as Jesus approached you in his compassion.
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.120]   Let me close us in a word of prayer.
[00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:18.800]   Would you bow your heads with me?
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:27.040]   Heavenly Father, again we are here before you because of your mercy and your grace.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:34.040]   Because you reached out to us and you pulled us close to you.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:39.640]   You decided for whatever reason in your mind that you wanted us.
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:48.360]   And so to an unlovable people, you loved us and you made us lovable.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.280]   And so I pray in this moment, Lord, for my brothers and sisters here, that you would
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.720]   lay your hand on them and that you would remove the calluses that they have formed.
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.520]   You would remove the calluses from their hearts and that you would renew their hearts and
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:10.880]   their minds to give them new eyes and new ears, to renew them, Lord, to display before
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:18.640]   them the glory of your cross and to overwhelm them with your love so that they might in
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:26.080]   turn be representatives of who you are, that they might live as people who are under grace.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:32.800]   And so help them find peace in you, Lord, help them find rest in you.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:38.720]   And help them live every single part of their life affected by what you have done for them,
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.720]   Lord.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:43.880]   We pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:53.880]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
