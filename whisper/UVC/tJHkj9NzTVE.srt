1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
 Well, before we go into God's Word, let me pray for us.

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:23,200
 Father, it is your Word we are going to read and study.

3
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:28,480
 So we trust you will give us your Word and it will return to you having accomplished

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:37,560
 your will and your purposes.

5
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:45,400
 Be glorified as your Word is preached and proclaimed.

6
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,720
 We pray in Jesus' name.

7
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:48,720
 Amen.

8
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:57,320
 So we are in 2 Timothy chapter 4, verse 6-3.

9
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:05,960
 So 2 Timothy is believed to be one of the last letters that Paul wrote.

10
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:21,120
 And it was written to his son and his apprentice, his disciple, Timothy.

11
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:29,360
 So you know, it's been said that when people are at the edge of death, that their life

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:34,320
 flashes before their eyes.

13
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,520
 So what do you imagine are the final thoughts you're going to have when you come to that

14
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:46,880
 day?

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,440
 Will you remember a life that has lived well?

16
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,320
 Maybe you'll have dreams that you remember, dreams that have been forgotten, plans that

17
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,960
 are not fulfilled.

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,000
 Perhaps you'll have no regrets at all.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,480
 Or maybe you'll have many regrets.

20
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:22,520
 And then what about what's on the other side of death?

21
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:29,320
 Do you think about what will be waiting for you?

22
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:36,640
 The Apostle Paul knows that he is about to face the end of his life.

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:43,440
 So he tells Timothy these final words.

24
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,480
 And it's from his second letter in chapter 4, verse 6.

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,560
 And he says, "I am already being poured out like a drink offering, and the time has come

26
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,360
 for my departure.

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,520
 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.

28
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,440
 Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,680
 judge, will award to me on that day.

30
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,600
 And not only to me, but also to all who have longed for His appearance."

31
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:39,400
 So Paul says, "I am already being poured out like a drink offering."

32
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:44,120
 And I believe he is talking about a drink offering, referencing a drink offering that

33
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:50,880
 is talked about in the Old Testament.

34
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:59,600
 And this drink offering involves wine being poured on a hot altar.

35
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:09,120
 So when the alcohol and the sugars burn up, there's this wonderful smell in the air.

36
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:14,480
 An offering that goes to God.

37
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:25,480
 And the idea is that God would smell this wonderful smell, and he would be worshipped.

38
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:32,000
 So yes, Paul is talking about that he is going to die soon.

39
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,960
 Kind of like pouring out a cup and saying, "It's over."

40
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:46,000
 But he's also referring to, "My life is being poured out like worship to God."

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,320
 So he's not just saying, "My life is over, I'm done."

42
00:04:52,320 --> 00:05:00,020
 But he's saying, "Look, my life is worship to God."

43
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:06,800
 And Paul talks and uses language that we would hear in athletics, in sports, and he's

44
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:16,080
 done this in other places too, but he does it here.

45
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:26,280
 So he says, "I have fought the good fight like a boxer."

46
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:31,220
 I have finished the race like a runner.

47
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,640
 And then he makes it clear, he's not just talking about physical activity, and he says,

48
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,720
 "I have kept the faith."

49
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:45,880
 In other words, Paul is saying, "Look, my life is filled with so much evidence that

50
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:53,640
 my life was lived for Jesus."

51
00:05:53,640 --> 00:06:00,800
 This life is a wonderful scent to God.

52
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:03,040
 But I ask, what about me?

53
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,260
 What about you?

54
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:15,920
 Is your life, is my life so filled with proof that we have lived it well for Jesus?

55
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:21,320
 That you and me, we could both say confidently, "Look, my life has been lived for worship

56
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,320
 of God."

57
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:42,100
 God would smell the scent of my life and be, "Ah, please."

58
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:51,140
 Think about what would people who know you say about your life?

59
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:57,460
 How about a coworker, or a neighbor, or a friend?

60
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,400
 Maybe a family member.

61
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:04,060
 Would they say, "Are you a Christian?"

62
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:08,460
 What if they came and surprised you, they visited you at this church, didn't know you

63
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:18,380
 go to church here, and they find you and they say, "Wow, you're a Christian?"

64
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:28,260
 Would they say, "You know, I thought you might be because of the way you act."

65
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:32,180
 I thought there was something different about you because the way you are always so kind

66
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:38,260
 to me and other people.

67
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:43,060
 I thought maybe you were a follower of Jesus because the way you live, it reminds me of

68
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,060
 Jesus.

69
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:53,100
 Or would somebody find you at church and say, "What?

70
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:58,820
 You're a Christian?"

71
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:05,380
 The way you're always complaining about the boss at work.

72
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:11,780
 How mean you are to the neighbors.

73
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:19,020
 Your language, the way you curse all the time and say evil words.

74
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,740
 I had no idea you were a Christian.

75
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:29,540
 What would people say of us?

76
00:08:29,540 --> 00:08:37,580
 See our lives, our speech, our attitude, our behaviors, these can tell people that something

77
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,580
 has happened to you.

78
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:54,100
 When Jesus has taken over our lives, people might ask, "What's going on?"

79
00:08:54,100 --> 00:09:00,940
 And what an opportunity to tell them, "It's because of Jesus."

80
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,300
 Let me tell you about Jesus.

81
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,580
 He's loved me.

82
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,940
 He's changed me.

83
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:14,740
 He's made me new.

84
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:21,420
 I hope that our lives would invite people to ask.

85
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:31,420
 Now let's not forget as we look at this passage that Paul knows that he's going to die too.

86
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,820
 He says, "The time of my departure has come."

87
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,780
 And he's not just going to a new city.

88
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:48,180
 He's leaving this world and he will be in the presence of God.

89
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,180
 But Paul is not worrying about it.

90
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,060
 He's not fearful of it.

91
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:58,940
 I think he's excited about it.

92
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,820
 That Paul sees this as a release.

93
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:07,780
 He's being untied.

94
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:12,540
 From this body of death.

95
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,980
 In another letter he writes to the Romans in chapter 7, he says, "What a wretched man

96
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:19,740
 that I am."

97
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:23,620
 This is one of the holiest men in the world.

98
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:36,020
 And he says, "What a wretched man that I am."

99
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:45,260
 He says, "Who is going to save me from this body of death?"

100
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,260
 And what does he say?

101
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:53,100
 "Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord because Jesus has delivered me from this

102
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,580
 body of death."

103
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:05,980
 So most of us know somebody who seems to be trapped in their body.

104
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,740
 Maybe they're paralyzed or handicapped in some way.

105
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,660
 Maybe they have some kind of physical weakness.

106
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,300
 And their body has become like a prison.

107
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:29,660
 And can you imagine that as we want to live, we also want to be free.

108
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,020
 It's like somebody trapped in a burning house or in a car that's been in an accident and

109
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:44,860
 you're trapped inside the car and you're saying, "Somebody please help me get out."

110
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:50,380
 "Rescue me."

111
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:58,980
 Paul recognizes that Jesus has rescued him.

112
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,140
 Has Jesus rescued you?

113
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:11,420
 Have you put your faith in the one who says, "I can save you?"

114
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:20,420
 The one who says, "Not only I can save you, but I want to save you.

115
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,100
 I want you to be free.

116
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:27,340
 I want you to have a new life."

117
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:30,420
 You see, what we really need is not a doctor.

118
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,820
 We need the great physician.

119
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:42,500
 What we need is not someone who cares about us for a little while and then forgets about

120
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:49,860
 us once we're gone.

121
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:53,860
 As much as you might have a great relationship with your doctor, do you think he thinks about

122
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:01,740
 you after you've left the office?

123
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:07,740
 Jesus is a doctor who never stops caring about you.

124
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:11,980
 He never stops thinking about you.

125
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:17,100
 He never stops working on you.

126
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,180
 He is our creator.

127
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,700
 He is the one who has made us.

128
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:33,100
 So we don't need somebody who will just, you know, take a cut and fix it.

129
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:41,420
 Or somebody who will give us temporary comfort or temporary pleasure.

130
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:49,580
 We need someone who has conquered death and hell.

131
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,380
 Jesus alone has conquered death and hell.

132
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,620
 Death cannot touch him.

133
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,820
 And he offers us eternal life.

134
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:06,580
 This great physician is Jesus.

135
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:11,460
 And he is the creator who loves us and cares for us.

136
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:16,940
 He is the one who conquered death and Hades.

137
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:24,100
 You see, Paul was this very religious man.

138
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,340
 He thought he had done everything possible, everything necessary so that he could also

139
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:36,580
 have eternal life.

140
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:42,660
 But then one day he met Jesus.

141
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:53,540
 He was actually on the way to go and arrest and harm the people that love Jesus.

142
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:59,060
 And Paul too believed and trusted Jesus.

143
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:06,620
 He had lived such a perfect life that in Philippians, another letter he writes, he says, "If anyone

144
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:11,220
 else thinks he has reason to put confidence in the flesh," meaning the things he has done

145
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:22,260
 with his body, he says, "I have more confidence."

146
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:27,260
 And basically he says, "I have obeyed all the laws.

147
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,780
 I come from the right kind of family.

148
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,540
 And I'm from the right nation.

149
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:44,820
 And the way I live has been with great passion for God."

150
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:51,660
 So passionate I even persecuted his church.

151
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:59,260
 He says, "As far as the law is concerned, no one could blame me."

152
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,500
 What does he say?

153
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,860
 For Jesus, all of this is loss.

154
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:16,140
 To all of Paul's Jewish peers, they would have said, "Oh, I wish I had his life.

155
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:21,820
 I wish I could be righteous like him."

156
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:31,380
 But Paul continues and says, "Whatever was my profit, I now consider loss because of

157
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,380
 Jesus."

158
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:37,380
 And then he says, "What is more, I consider everything loss compared to the surpassing

159
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:45,380
 knowledge of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord."

160
00:16:45,380 --> 00:17:01,220
 He says, "I consider it all rubbish, garbage, junk, worthless compared to knowing Jesus."

161
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,100
 Wow.

162
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:06,060
 Can you say that?

163
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:14,020
 That compared to knowing Jesus, everything else is just garbage?

164
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:23,460
 That without Jesus, everything is meaningless?

165
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:29,900
 That's why Paul says in verse 10 of chapter 3 of Philippians, "I want to know Christ and

166
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:34,780
 the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of sharing in his sufferings."

167
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:47,740
 Do you get that?

168
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:56,100
 Paul doesn't just say, "I want all the benefits of knowing Jesus."

169
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:01,500
 He says, "I even want to share in his suffering.

170
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,860
 Jesus is so valuable.

171
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:11,020
 I even want to know what it feels like to suffer like him."

172
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:23,540
 And then even becoming like him in his death so that he could have the resurrection.

173
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,820
 I mean this sounds like crazy talk, doesn't it?

174
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:30,660
 But see this is not false humility.

175
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:42,620
 Paul gave up everything because he saw that Jesus was such a treasure.

176
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:48,580
 Everything else was junk.

177
00:18:48,580 --> 00:19:00,620
 You see Paul met Jesus on the road to Damascus and his life was changed forever.

178
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,420
 That's when his race began.

179
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:13,820
 That's when his fight began.

180
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,740
 And Paul says, "I have fought the good fight."

181
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:30,580
 He says about the race, "I have already finished the race and I have kept the faith."

182
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:36,300
 It is believed that in ancient Rome and in ancient Greece that the athletes would make

183
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,340
 a promise.

184
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:52,380
 They would devote their race or their performance to their God.

185
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,980
 So if it was Zeus, that is their God, they would say, "For Zeus, I will run this race

186
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:04,020
 and I will win."

187
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:12,020
 And today we see this tradition carried out in the Olympics.

188
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:21,740
 Now I won't read their oath but you can go online and look up, Google the Olympic oath.

189
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
 What did they do?

190
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,740
 They promised that they are going to play fair.

191
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:32,740
 They are not going to cheat.

192
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:39,580
 They are going to compete honorably.

193
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:47,340
 And there is no question in my mind that Paul is thinking of this.

194
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:55,940
 All those who make promises to false gods, Paul says, "I have lived my life.

195
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,940
 I have run my race.

196
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:01,940
 I have fought my fight for the true God.

197
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:09,180
 I have kept the faith."

198
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:23,500
 So having completed what he was charged to do, Paul reveals his confidence.

199
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:30,300
 So look at 2 Timothy chapter 4, verse 8.

200
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:37,700
 He says, "Now there is in store for me the crown of righteousness which the Lord, the

201
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:43,780
 righteous judge, will award me on that day, and not only to me but also to all who have

202
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,780
 longed for His appearing."

203
00:21:44,780 --> 00:22:03,340
 Do you know what's waiting for you at the finish line?

204
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:12,060
 When the fight is done and the race is over, do you know what's waiting for you?

205
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:25,860
 When the ancient athletes won, they would receive a crown made of leaves.

206
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:30,300
 And while they might look beautiful and fresh for a moment, in just a couple days they will

207
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:38,820
 dry up and blow away.

208
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:46,860
 But Paul says, "I'm going to receive the crown of righteousness."

209
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:50,980
 This is an imperishable crown.

210
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:56,900
 This is a crown that the Lord delivers.

211
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:02,340
 And this is the crown that Paul says is not only for him, but it's for all of us who long

212
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:09,700
 for His appearing.

213
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:16,620
 So what does it mean to long for His appearing?

214
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:22,820
 Have you ever missed somebody?

215
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:28,620
 Maybe your husband or your wife had to go away on a long business trip.

216
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,260
 I figure in this room there are many immigrants.

217
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:44,880
 And it's a common story among immigrants that one husband or wife comes to America first.

218
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:53,020
 And sometimes it's years before they are reunited.

219
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:59,400
 That's what it's like to long for someone's appearing.

220
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:07,420
 That everything is focused on that day when you will see them again.

221
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:17,080
 And Paul says, "If you are this way with Jesus, you cannot wait to see Him again."

222
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:23,040
 The same reward is there for us.

223
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:26,120
 The crown of righteousness.

224
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,760
 And why is that?

225
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:35,720
 Because in Jesus is all of our hope.

226
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:44,400
 He's the one who holds our eternal future.

227
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:53,000
 Through Jesus, all the blessings of God come to us.

228
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 But see it's not just what He gives us.

229
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:03,160
 But it's because He's the one we love.

230
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,960
 He is our treasure.

231
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:17,400
 So what's waiting for you when the race is over and the fight is done?

232
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:28,060
 I hope that at the finish line, Jesus will say, "Well done, good and faithful servant."

233
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:32,000
 You see some of us are going to finish so fast and so strong, we're going to race across

234
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 the line.

235
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,440
 Others, we're going to think we're dying because we're so exhausted and we're going

236
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
 to cross the finish line.

237
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:58,160
 I have a feeling some of us, we're going to cross the finish line bloody, beat up.

238
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:05,000
 With our last breath, we'll cross that line.

239
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:13,520
 But for all of those who long to see Jesus coming, He will welcome us.

240
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,120
 He will reward us with the crown of righteousness.

241
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:26,960
 He'll say to us, "Well done, good and faithful servant."

242
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:41,600
 I hope every person in this room will hear those words.

243
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:55,240
 Will you be one of those who is shocked at the end?

244
00:26:55,240 --> 00:27:00,960
 Jesus talks about some who will come to Him on the last day and they will say to Him,

245
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,960
 "Lord, Lord."

246
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:17,320
 And they're going to be shocked because Jesus will say to them, "Who are you?

247
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,320
 I don't know you.

248
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,320
 Get away from me.

249
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,320
 You're an evildoer."

250
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:26,600
 And they'll even plead with Him.

251
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:35,280
 "But Lord, didn't we do all kinds of amazing things for you?

252
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,640
 Even in your name?"

253
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:45,120
 But Jesus will say, "Get away from me."

254
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,720
 And what is it that they're missing?

255
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:57,240
 See Paul says, "I have done everything I need to do.

256
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,280
 I've obeyed all the laws.

257
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:10,600
 But His salvation was not sure until He knew Jesus.

258
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,120
 Until He said, "I don't trust me.

259
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:18,360
 I trust Jesus."

260
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,840
 I don't put my faith in me.

261
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:27,000
 I put my faith in Jesus.

262
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 Where do you put your faith?

263
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:44,080
 You know, Paul reasoned God's solution to the sin problem that we all have.

264
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,000
 And it's best summarized, I think, in Romans chapter 5.

265
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,600
 And he says, "You see, at just the right time, when we were still powerless, Christ died

266
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,640
 for the ungodly.

267
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,720
 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man, though for a good man someone might possibly

268
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,200
 dare to die.

269
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,040
 But God demonstrates His love for us in this.

270
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:11,600
 While we were sinners, still sinners, Christ died for us."

271
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:38,200
 While we were still sinners, Jesus died for us.

272
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:43,480
 He took the punishment for our sin.

273
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:44,480
 Do you believe this?

274
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:52,040
 Urban Voice, do you believe this?

275
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:57,720
 Pastor, you must have a church that doesn't like to speak out during the service.

276
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:58,720
 It's very quiet.

277
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,360
 Don't be ashamed.

278
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,680
 Do you believe this?

279
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,680
 Yes.

280
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:11,120
 I hope so.

281
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:18,680
 This is our hope, that Jesus died for us.

282
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:27,640
 My friends, if you have not trusted Jesus, could today be the day of your salvation?

283
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:31,680
 Is Jesus saying to you, "What are you waiting for?"

284
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:45,440
 I'm going to ask everybody to close their eyes right now.

285
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,480
 Let's keep our eyes closed.

286
00:30:50,480 --> 00:31:01,480
 If there is someone here who has never trusted Jesus for the forgiveness of their sins,

287
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:10,400
 for eternal life, would you just raise your hand?

288
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,960
 No one's looking.

289
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:22,320
 It's just you and God.

290
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:26,960
 And would you tell Him in your own words?

291
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:27,960
 And it's okay.

292
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:32,640
 You can whisper it because He can hear you.

293
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,120
 Would you tell Him, "Jesus, I need you.

294
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:46,880
 I believe that you died for me because I am a sinner.

295
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,480
 I'm nothing like Paul.

296
00:31:51,480 --> 00:32:02,800
 And if somebody like Paul had no hope in his own righteousness, how could I hope in

297
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:08,240
 my righteousness?

298
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,640
 I need your righteousness.

299
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:18,040
 Forgive me for my sin.

300
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:22,160
 Wash me and make me clean.

301
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:27,440
 I believe Jesus can do this for me.

302
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,000
 I trust Him.

303
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:35,880
 I believe He can give me eternal life.

304
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:39,880
 I believe Him.

305
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:47,920
 And now I also believe He can teach me how to live for Him.

306
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,920
 Because I want to live for Jesus.

307
00:32:52,920 --> 00:33:03,480
 The one who loved me from the beginning and will always love me.

308
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:14,680
 The one who doesn't just say it, but the one who even laid down His life for me.

309
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:21,120
 Jesus, I trust you.

310
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:27,080
 Welcome me at the finish line.

311
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:35,040
 And say of me, "Well done, good and faithful servant.

312
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:41,960
 Enter into the joy of your master."

313
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:46,760
 Lord Jesus, I believe you will do this.

314
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,560
 Thank you.

315
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:52,200
 We pray in Jesus' name.

316
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,200
 Amen.

317
00:33:53,200 --> 00:34:02,400
 So my brothers and sisters, for those of us who have already put our faith in Jesus Christ,

318
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:11,560
 let's not be foolish runners who don't know where the finish line is.

319
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:17,040
 Who don't know that there is a finish line.

320
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,880
 We are not running just in any direction.

321
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:29,200
 We are running to our Savior.

322
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:39,000
 So I ask you again, can you say confidently like Paul, "There's so much evidence that

323
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,120
 my life has been lived well.

324
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:54,160
 There's so much proof that Jesus is in my life."

325
00:34:54,160 --> 00:35:03,960
 If there isn't, perhaps this is a day when you might think, "What do I need to do?

326
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:08,160
 How do I need to change?

327
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,480
 What do I need to pray and ask God to help me with?

328
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,040
 Maybe it's time to ask, "What are the things that are keeping me from living that good

329
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:25,040
 life?"

330
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,240
 And asking God for help.

331
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:34,240
 Do you think he will help you?

332
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,640
 He does want to help you.

333
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:44,880
 Do you think he wants you to live and experience the good life?

334
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,360
 Of course he does.

335
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:57,560
 So when we ask God something he wants to do, do you think he'll say no?

336
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:58,560
 Of course not.

337
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,080
 He wants to give it to you.

338
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:07,600
 He's waiting for us to ask so he can give it to us.

339
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:14,040
 Urban Voice, God loves you.

340
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:17,840
 God loves this church.

341
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,840
 He has given birth to this church.

342
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:28,320
 And he will finish the work he started here.

343
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,680
 And I hope we'll all run across the finish line together and hear those wonderful words.

344
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:36,260
 Urban Voice, well done.

345
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:46,240
 My good and faithful servant.

346
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:51,240
 Join me in saying amen if you agree.

347
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,240
 Amen.

348
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,240
 Thank you, John.
