[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hey guys, we will turn to the book of Genesis chapter 37.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140]   If you have your Bible,
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.080]   turn with me to the book of Genesis chapter 37.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.200]   And today we are going to begin a new topic.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.400]   This topic is called the providence of God.
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.560]   So we're gonna read the story of Joseph.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.480]   Now, anyone has any idea what the word providence means?
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.580]   What does it mean?
[00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.280]   It's actually two words together, right?
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.360]   Combined compound word, right?
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.640]   Meaning pro, ahead or beforehand,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640]   and then seeing, where we get vision, right?
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.480]   That is the providence of God.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.680]   And this is a precious teaching found in the Bible.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.680]   At times we might think or mistaken providence as fate
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.160]   or some sort of blind destiny.
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.460]   Everything is set, past, present and future,
[00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.960]   and everything is predetermined in your life, in our life.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.460]   Everything is pre-decided mechanically.
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.240]   So we're just going through our journey of life
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.600]   and every day is already preset.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.840]   Sometimes we have this wrong idea,
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.280]   but in the Bible, providence refers not
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.160]   the blind mechanism of the universe or in your life.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   Providence means God is caring and seeing ahead of time
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.600]   in whatsoever comes to pass, whatsoever.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.500]   The people that you meet, the coffee that you had today,
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.940]   driving here, right?
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.480]   Some more people got in your way, right?
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.120]   You probably yell at some people.
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.120]   You come here and join the worship.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.200]   Everything whatsoever comes to pass.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.060]   That is the biblical definition of providence.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.960]   It's not a mechanical, you know,
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.640]   everything decided and predetermined kind of fate
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.100]   that we're going through our lives,
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.800]   but God is seeing ahead of time and caring for you.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.280]   So that's what it means, providence.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.400]   And there are a lot of different Bible verses
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.600]   that has to do with providence.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.360]   For example, Psalm 139, one of the favorite Psalms, right?
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.400]   "Oh Lord, you have examined my heart
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.280]   "and know everything about me."
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.960]   Everything, see the key word here?
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.080]   Everything.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.960]   You know, when I sit down or stand up,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.960]   when you sit down, take a break,
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.480]   when you're standing up, doing something, working,
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.560]   Lord, you know my thoughts, even I'm far, far away, right?
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.360]   When you're traveling, we are not home.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:05.320]   Lord, you see me when I travel, when I rest at home.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.240]   That's NLT, by the way.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.860]   And you know everything I do.
[00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.600]   That is providence, isn't it?
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.440]   Right?
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.640]   Many scriptures teach the providence of God
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.220]   or the doctrine of divine providence,
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.220]   that your life is under the beforehand seeing of God,
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.900]   beforehand caring of God.
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.420]   Whether you believe it or not, right?
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.540]   Now there are also different Bible verses
[00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.540]   we're not going to dig into them,
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.740]   but this is something unique about the biblical culture
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.140]   or the Hebrew culture.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.500]   Even today, when you ask a rabbi a question,
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.400]   usually you don't get a direct answer.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.380]   The rabbi probably will respond, "Let me tell you a story."
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.260]   That's interesting, right?
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.580]   It's kind of different from our Western
[00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:00.020]   or urban kind of linear, you know,
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.460]   we all want to outline things
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:03.500]   and bullet points and all that, right?
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.140]   We're more abstract in our thinking,
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.260]   but in the Hebrew culture or Bible culture,
[00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.060]   they will tell you a story, right?
[00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:14.540]   Remember the prophet Nathan,
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.560]   when he was about to confront David
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.500]   for the great sin that he committed,
[00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.460]   what did Nathan do?
[00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.700]   (audience murmurs)
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.820]   He told him a story, told him a parable, right?
[00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.900]   And Jesus did a lot of parables, illustrations, right?
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.580]   Daily life illustrations
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.180]   in order to flesh out some of the truth, right?
[00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.660]   So today we're going to read story, all right?
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:43.820]   Big chunk of it, right?
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.060]   Biblical story of Joseph.
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.180]   You ready?
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.820]   Let me tell you a story, all right?
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.540]   Chapter 37, verse two.
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.020]   This is the account of Jacob and his family.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:59.700]   When Joseph was 17 year old,
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.900]   he often tended his father's flock.
[00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.500]   He worked for his half brothers,
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.580]   the sons of the father's wives, Belhar and Silpah.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.100]   But Joseph reported to his father
[00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.540]   some of the bad things his brothers were doing.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:18.220]   Jacob loved Joseph more than any of his other children
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:22.260]   because Joseph had been born to him in his old age.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.260]   So one day, Jacob had a special gift made for Joseph,
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.260]   a beautiful many color robe.
[00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:34.260]   But his brothers hated Joseph
[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.460]   because their father loved him more than the rest of them.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:42.960]   They couldn't say a kind word to him.
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.040]   This is interesting.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.660]   The Hebrew here is they cannot say shalom to him.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.300]   So they can't say good morning or hi to him.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.500]   Can't say a kind word to him, can't say shalom to him.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.580]   And then the following context reports
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:02.460]   about the two dreams that Joseph had.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.100]   And we're not going to go into it,
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.580]   but the main idea is that someday,
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.340]   the dreams are foretelling the future, right?
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:12.800]   Ahead of time, that Joseph will be greater
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.460]   than all his family members, his father, his mother,
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:18.580]   and all the brothers.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:21.980]   And that's why the brothers hated him, right?
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.500]   Imagine your little brother telling you,
[00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.020]   "Someday you're gonna worship me."
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.380]   No way, right?
[00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:32.220]   Your little brother or your younger sibling
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:38.220]   saying to you, "Someday I'm going to have
[00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.520]   "all your investment, all your bank accounts."
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.340]   No way, right?
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:45.580]   That's why the brothers hated him.
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.980]   And then verse 14.
[00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:52.180]   Now what happened here is Jacob said to Joseph,
[00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.620]   "Go and see how your brothers
[00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.820]   "and the flocks are getting along.
[00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.860]   "Then come back and bring me a report."
[00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:01.900]   So Jacob sent him on his way,
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.260]   and Joseph traveled to Shechem
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.620]   from their home in the Valley of Hebron.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:11.620]   When he arrived there, a man from the area noticed him
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.420]   wandering around in the field or countryside.
[00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:18.300]   "What are you looking for?" he asked.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.760]   "I'm looking for my brothers," Joseph replied.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.020]   "Do you know where they are pasturing their sheep?"
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:26.760]   "Yes," the man told him.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:29.260]   "They have moved on from here,
[00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:33.460]   "but I heard them saying, 'Let's go to Dothan.'"
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.540]   So Joseph followed his brothers to Dothan
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.060]   and found them there.
[00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:40.140]   Verse 18.
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.380]   When Joseph's brothers saw him coming,
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.500]   they recognized him in the distance.
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.940]   As he approached, they made plans to kill him.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:49.820]   "Here comes the dreamer," they said.
[00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:51.680]   "Come on, let's kill him
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:55.180]   "and throw him into one of the cisterns.
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:59.920]   "We can tell our father a wild animal has eaten him.
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.100]   "Then we will see what becomes of his dreams."
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:04.940]   Right?
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.740]   21.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:09.900]   But when Reuben pulled up the scheme,
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.460]   he came to Joseph's rescue.
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:14.380]   "Let's not kill him," he said.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:16.580]   "Why should we shed any blood?
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.500]   "Let's just throw him into an empty cistern
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:20.180]   "here in the wilderness.
[00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:24.740]   "Then he'll die without our laying a hand on him."
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:28.380]   Reuben was secretly planning to rescue Joseph,
[00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.500]   and return him to his father.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.180]   So when Joseph arrived,
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:37.180]   his brothers ripped off the beautiful robe he was wearing.
[00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:42.220]   Then they grabbed him and threw him into the cistern.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.220]   And the pit was empty, and there was no water in it.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.980]   Then, just as they were sitting down to eat,
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.860]   how can you eat with your little brother in the cistern?
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.700]   Crying out.
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.020]   They're having fast food here.
[00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:02.960]   They look up and saw a caravan of camels in the distance
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.700]   coming toward them.
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.280]   It's a group of Ishmaelite traders
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:10.660]   taking a load of gum, balm, aromatic resin
[00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.940]   from Gilead down to Egypt.
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:18.820]   Judah said to his brothers,
[00:09:18.820 --> 00:09:20.860]   "What will we gain by killing our brother?
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:23.820]   "We have to cover up the crime.
[00:09:23.820 --> 00:09:24.760]   "Instead of hurting him,
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.440]   "let's sell him to those Ishmaelite traders.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:30.360]   "After all, he is our brother,
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:32.740]   "our own flesh and our own blood."
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:34.440]   His brothers agreed.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.260]   So when the Ishmaelites, who were Midianite traders,
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:42.420]   came by, Joseph's brothers pulled him out of the pit
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:47.220]   and sold him to them for 20 pieces of silver,
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.700]   and the traders took him down to Egypt.
[00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:54.380]   Now, sometime later,
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.780]   Reuben returned to get Joseph out of the pit.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:00.220]   When he discovered that Joseph was missing,
[00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:01.580]   he torn his clothes in grief,
[00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.940]   and he went back to his brother and lamented,
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:04.900]   "The boy is gone.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.840]   "What will I do now?"
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.880]   Then the brothers killed a young goat
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.320]   and dipped Joseph's robe in his blood.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:14.820]   They sent the beautiful robe to their father
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:17.780]   with this message, "Look at what we found.
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.160]   "Doesn't this robe belong to your son?"
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.280]   And then we skip to 36.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:26.280]   Meanwhile, the Midianite traders arrived down in Egypt,
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.760]   where they sold Joseph to Polypher,
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:32.800]   an officer of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.420]   Polypher was captain of the palace guard.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.720]   Now, this is a long story, right?
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.580]   Whole chapter 37, pretty much we read every single verse.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.760]   It clearly tells us the older brothers of Joseph
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:50.880]   were ill-intent.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:53.480]   They wanted to kill Joseph.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.360]   Remember the pit, the cistern?
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.920]   What happened to it?
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:10:59.760]   Was there any water?
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.840]   No, there was no water, right?
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.840]   According to the Palestinian climate,
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.240]   this should be the end of summer.
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.400]   No water at all.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.800]   They wanted to kill him,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.280]   but they changed their mind and agreed with Reuben.
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.060]   And Reuben, all of a sudden, he intervened and said,
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:21.320]   "Hey, let's put this boy into the pit," right?
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:23.120]   Where there's no water.
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:28.120]   And he actually intended to come back and to rescue Joseph.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:34.720]   However, as the story goes, some traders,
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:38.800]   some international traders, Ishmaelites or Midianites,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.040]   they came by and they decided,
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.040]   according to Judah's suggestion,
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.080]   sell Joseph to the trader and bring him down to Egypt.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:57.120]   As you know, the story of Joseph runs very, very long,
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.440]   right, 37, chapter 37 to all the way to the end,
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:06.240]   chapter 50, end of the book of Genesis.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:08.560]   And we all know the end, right?
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.460]   Well, let me spoil it, yeah.
[00:12:10.460 --> 00:12:15.920]   Chapter 50, verse 20, finally,
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.320]   even the brothers and Jacob,
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.120]   the whole family came down from Canaan to Egypt
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:23.040]   because of famine, right?
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   And just eventually, Joseph rose from the pit
[00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:33.160]   to being the second in command in the nation of Egypt.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.240]   And he was kind of a savior.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.560]   He saved his whole family.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:39.900]   And eventually, all the brothers reconciled.
[00:12:39.900 --> 00:12:43.320]   And Joseph said to his brother, "That is the end,
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.880]   "almost the end of the story," chapter 50, 20.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:49.020]   "You guys intended to harm me,
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:52.320]   "but God intended it all for good.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.580]   "He brought me to this position
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:59.580]   "so that I could save the lives of many people."
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:01.320]   That's just a long story.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:03.720]   We will go through it, you know, chapter by chapter.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.700]   But this is how the Bible works.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.700]   Tell your story, a very complicated, very detailed story
[00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.520]   so you can chill upon it.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:17.800]   You can return the story again and again
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:21.160]   and think about the topic here, the theme here,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.000]   the providence of God in your life.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.040]   Providence of God in your life.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:32.040]   Somehow God is seeing or caring for you way ahead of time
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.680]   before you can see how your life unfolds.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.220]   God sees ahead of time.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:43.240]   So there are actually two points I want to bring out.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.240]   First, if you read the story, just read chapter 37,
[00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:52.640]   what I want to point out is everyone in the story
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:56.120]   is free to make choices, right?
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.560]   Jacob, the father, he probably worries about, you know,
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.040]   the flock and the brothers,
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:06.040]   and send his beloved son, Joseph, to check on them, right?
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:10.680]   Nobody forced Jacob to make any choice.
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:12.980]   He was a free agent.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:17.520]   He chose to send Joseph, right?
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:18.900]   Completely free.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:20.640]   So he made that choice.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.000]   And then the brothers were tending the flocks in Shechem.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.120]   Shechem, by the way, is in the north.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.960]   So he started, Joseph started in the south, Hebron,
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:33.480]   all the way up, probably walk three, two days,
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.960]   three or four days, to reach up north in Shechem.
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.280]   And as I said, it was probably late summer
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.640]   because the pit was dry.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:46.640]   And then the brothers made their own choice as free agents.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.700]   They moved from Shechem to another place called Dothan,
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.460]   which is further up north.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.360]   Probably they were trying to find water for the sheep.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:01.980]   But in any how, they were free to do so, right?
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:03.800]   Nobody forced them.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.920]   They made their own choices.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.820]   And then Joseph, the beloved son,
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:12.640]   he obeys his father and goes to Shechem.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:16.440]   And they're kind of wandering, he got lost.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.440]   And then finally he reached the brothers at Dothan, right?
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:24.580]   Joseph made free choices as well.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:30.780]   And then the brothers were held fully accountable
[00:15:30.780 --> 00:15:34.180]   for victimizing Joseph.
[00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.640]   The story lays blame on brothers,
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:43.740]   not Jacob, the father, not Joseph, the beloved son, right?
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:46.060]   No matter how Joseph is lovely or not,
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.340]   he's getting along with the brothers or not,
[00:15:49.340 --> 00:15:54.180]   or he's just a very wicked person or not, right?
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:55.820]   Good or bad.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.820]   The story lays blame only on the elder brothers, right?
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.940]   So everyone in the story is free to make choices.
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:08.700]   However, some things happen in the story
[00:16:08.700 --> 00:16:10.360]   out of expectation.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:15.200]   Nobody would have thought how the story unfolds.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.960]   For example, Joseph goes to Shechem,
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.560]   try to find his brothers, right?
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:23.960]   He's lost.
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:28.800]   Probably he has wasted some time, or a day or so,
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.960]   wandering in the wilderness, in the field.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.840]   And then surprisingly, a dude passes by.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:40.840]   And this dude, no name, right?
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.860]   Unnamed character in the story.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:46.600]   Just happened he heard what the brother said.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:48.880]   Remember what the brother says?
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.960]   Let's go out of Shechem and go to Doton, right?
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:56.480]   And then just, he heard about it.
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.080]   He heard about it, and then surprisingly,
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:02.000]   he found Joseph getting lost, right?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.040]   This young boy getting lost in the field.
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:08.000]   And then surprisingly, he goes to Joseph and ask,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.080]   "Hey, what are you doing?
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:10.400]   "What are you looking for?"
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.240]   Right?
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:13.720]   And then Joseph reply, "I'm looking for his brothers."
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.320]   "Oh, I heard about your brothers."
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:17.800]   You know, they just went from Shechem here
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.360]   to someplace else, to Doton.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.680]   So some things happen in the story
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.000]   out of expectation for anyone, anyone in the story.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.440]   Secondly, the brothers.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:31.760]   Now I talk about Joseph, right?
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.200]   Wandering, wasting some time.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.300]   And then the brothers, the brothers meant to kill Joseph.
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.360]   No question about it, right?
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:45.360]   But surprisingly, Reuben, the firstborn, intervenes.
[00:17:45.360 --> 00:17:50.280]   He intervenes, "Don't kill him, don't commit murder."
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:52.560]   And Joseph end up in the pit, right?
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.560]   Now, why did Reuben think so?
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.200]   I don't know, I don't know.
[00:17:59.200 --> 00:18:02.680]   Probably just, you know, spirit of the moment, right?
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:04.640]   Let's not kill him, let's not kill our brother.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.480]   Throw him in the pit, right?
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:11.260]   So the brothers, to them, something surprising happened.
[00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:18.520]   Three, the cistern, the pit was dry, the end of summer.
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.600]   If Joseph was left in the pit for too long,
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.680]   he would have died, right?
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:31.220]   Even he asked for help, nobody would have heard him
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:34.760]   because he would be too weak, right?
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.080]   The cistern was dry.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.520]   Nobody planned that, right?
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.820]   But something out of expectation happened.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:47.240]   And then finally, some of the merchants came by, right?
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.320]   Who were those guys, right?
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.400]   Medianites or Ishmaelites or whatever, right?
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.560]   Some international traders came by and said,
[00:18:54.560 --> 00:18:57.600]   didn't really talk to the brothers,
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:01.320]   but the brothers were having the, you know, fast food lunch.
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:06.320]   And they saw these guys going down to Egypt.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.660]   And out of expectation, Judah did not plan this.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:13.840]   And he had an idea, let's sell our brothers, Joseph,
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.840]   to the traders, and the traders brought him down to Egypt.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:23.640]   So unexpectedly, Joseph did not die in the pit.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:27.660]   Eventually sold to Egypt.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:34.220]   Now, the Hebrew Bible has a special word in the story
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:39.200]   to catch our attention.
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:41.200]   And usually this word is translated,
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.620]   behold or look, right?
[00:19:44.620 --> 00:19:46.540]   Some of the English translations, to my surprise,
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:47.980]   misses that.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:51.480]   And it's a word called hinei.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.140]   Hinei in the Hebrew word means
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:58.300]   trying to catch your attention, right?
[00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.600]   And they look, behold.
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:03.220]   And in this story, in chapter 37,
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.780]   hinei happens again and again.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.860]   Let me give you some example, 15, verse 15.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:13.860]   A stranger, a guy, found Joseph and hinei.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:17.060]   He was wandering, he got lost in the field.
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:18.220]   And the stranger asked him,
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.260]   and there was some, you know,
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:20.780]   correspondences between them.
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:26.060]   Verse 19, the brothers said to one another, hinei.
[00:20:26.060 --> 00:20:28.180]   Actually, the brothers did not expect
[00:20:28.180 --> 00:20:30.380]   Joseph would show up, right?
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:33.100]   'Cause Joseph is the beloved son.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.580]   He didn't have to work, right?
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:37.140]   He's always on the lazy boy playing games, right?
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:40.980]   He's beloved by the old father, right?
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:44.380]   Didn't expect Joseph would come and see how they're doing.
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.220]   Hinei, he comes the dreamer.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.040]   And then they try to scheme to kill him.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.300]   25, the brothers sat down to eat their meal.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:20:57.940]   As they raised their eyes, hinei.
[00:20:57.940 --> 00:21:00.820]   Raised their eyes and looked.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:05.620]   Hinei, look, behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites,
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:09.380]   the traders, coming from Gilead.
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:13.180]   Gilead is up north, and then they're going down to Egypt.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:15.220]   Now, these guys, these traders,
[00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:17.860]   were not slave traders, right?
[00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:21.140]   With all of the commodities they are trying
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:24.220]   to bring to Egypt, they have no interest
[00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:26.800]   in slavery.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:34.100]   Judah got the idea and sold Joseph to those traders.
[00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:39.660]   And then Reuben came back in 29.
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:43.200]   Now Reuben returned to the cistern,
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.940]   and hinei, look, surprisingly,
[00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:51.000]   Joseph was not in it, so he torn his clothes.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.740]   Surprise, surprise, surprise, surprise.
[00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:55.740]   At least there are four times here,
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.180]   hinei, the worst chosen.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:02.140]   So in the entire chapter, 37,
[00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.820]   especially the latter half,
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:05.580]   talking about the selling of Joseph
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:07.740]   or whatever he encounters,
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:14.260]   you get the idea that everything somehow is orchestrated.
[00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:20.500]   Everything is working together
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.480]   down to the finest detail.
[00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:29.040]   Joseph got lost in the field.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.680]   He wasted a day or two,
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:34.520]   and that's why he did not die in the pit.
[00:22:34.520 --> 00:22:36.880]   And he was sold to Egypt for a greater purpose.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:42.140]   Providence, by means of a beautiful story,
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:47.040]   it tells you that providence includes getting lost.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.200]   Have you ever got lost?
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:54.680]   Providence includes getting lost and wasting time,
[00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:56.560]   wasting time.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.740]   Have you ever, you know, stand in line in DMV?
[00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:06.280]   That's like the most frustrating hell on earth, right?
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:10.760]   Providence includes wasting time.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:17.400]   Now, how many of you are good chess players?
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.520]   How many of you are good chess players?
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.160]   I'm very bad.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.600]   I'm very bad.
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:27.060]   I just don't know how it works, right?
[00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:30.240]   When I was younger, I hate playing chess with my dad
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.360]   because he's much better.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.080]   He's a good chess player.
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:36.260]   And I hate playing with him because I,
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:38.820]   well, you know, playing with my dad,
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.600]   a better chess player, and I'm so bad,
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:46.280]   I am absolutely free to make any move.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:52.940]   But my opponent often puts me into some sort of situations,
[00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.940]   some sort of positions that I have to respond
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.640]   with another move, right?
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:23:59.820]   Some sort of moves.
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:05.740]   But I find that quickly, my moves lead to further
[00:24:05.740 --> 00:24:10.280]   his strategy to have him win.
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:13.180]   And he, of course, he wins at the end.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:18.340]   Or have you ever played chess with computer?
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:20.760]   AI, can you beat it?
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:22.780]   Probably not, right?
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:30.300]   Compared to God, we are all like bad chess players.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:34.720]   We're really, really bad.
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.600]   Because we can only see a step or two ahead.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.500]   But God see the whole thing.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:43.280]   God see the whole game.
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:46.500]   But there's a difference.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:51.220]   No, me and God, you and God, in his providence,
[00:24:51.220 --> 00:24:52.400]   there was a difference.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.240]   Because God's moves in your life
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.600]   are not mechanically programmed.
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:04.780]   He's relating to you, interacting with you all the time.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:10.020]   And another difference is God is not in your life
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.480]   in order to defeat you.
[00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:16.620]   That is not the intent of our Karen father.
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:21.480]   Our Karen father is driven by his compassion for us.
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:27.400]   His loving plan for you and for the world, right?
[00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:31.780]   Don't you find this doctrine, providence,
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:36.780]   comforting, encouraging, especially in times of difficulty?
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:43.880]   That you are not under the control of any blind faith.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:48.860]   You're not under control of any blind destiny
[00:25:48.860 --> 00:25:51.460]   that is predetermined.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.380]   Yes, there are things out of your control.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:57.800]   There are things that you pray for,
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:59.740]   you hope for, didn't happen.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:02.940]   But your life, the Bible says,
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.980]   is not under some sort of blind faith.
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:11.420]   The school that you're going to,
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:16.080]   or the school that you apply and rejected you, right?
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:20.160]   The girl you try to approach, rejected you.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:23.360]   I had that a lot when I was younger.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:29.940]   The people that you try to relate to,
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:35.840]   give you a cold shoulder, or whatever you encounter.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.720]   Don't you find it comforting
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:40.560]   if you know the biblical teaching of providence?
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.620]   Right?
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:46.200]   Now in the history of the church in the last 2000 years,
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.520]   many people, theologians,
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.960]   have tried to understand this mysterious,
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.300]   mysterious but comforting doctrine.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:00.340]   And they try to take through different places of the Bible
[00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:03.360]   and try to summarize it, right?
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.380]   And one of the great summaries of providence
[00:27:07.380 --> 00:27:09.260]   is found in something called
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:11.320]   Westminster Confession of Faith.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:14.340]   Now, what is Confession of Faith?
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.060]   It's actually a kind of a systematic summary
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:21.020]   of biblical teaching.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:23.900]   And this document is a very comprehensive document
[00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:27.360]   about all things related to the teaching of the Bible.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:29.900]   And it was drafted in the 17th century
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.220]   in the beautiful Westminster Abbey in London.
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:37.420]   In chapter five, article one,
[00:27:37.420 --> 00:27:41.860]   here is what it says about providence.
[00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.060]   Now I want you to pay attention to some of the words, okay?
[00:27:44.060 --> 00:27:45.460]   Let me read that.
[00:27:45.460 --> 00:27:47.780]   Five one, Westminster Confession of Faith.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:52.780]   God, who created everything, also upholds everything.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:59.260]   He directs, regulates, governs every creature,
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:02.120]   action, and thing.
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:05.100]   From the greatest to the least.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:10.340]   By his completely wise and holy providence,
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:15.120]   he does so in accordance with his infallible foreknowledge
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.920]   and the voluntary, unchangeable purpose of his own will.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:22.760]   All to the praise of the glory of his wisdom,
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.940]   power, justice, goodness, and mercy.
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:32.380]   God orchestrates from the greatest
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:35.180]   to the least.
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.140]   Everything is under his sight.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:43.580]   Nothing is out of his vision, his providence.
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:48.700]   Here, this summary is only one paragraph
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.460]   out of the many paragraphs that talks about God
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.860]   and his providence in this document.
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:57.140]   Here it says, God, the creator,
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:29:00.460]   transcends the creation.
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:03.580]   He's beyond us.
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:10.140]   But notice this, transcendence means his works
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.960]   are mysterious at times, right?
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:14.460]   Because he's beyond us.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:16.620]   He's outside time and space.
[00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:17.600]   This is our God.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:19.580]   This is the God of the Bible.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.380]   He created us all.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:25.420]   He orchestrates everything in our journey.
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:31.860]   Because he's beyond us, sometimes his works are mysterious.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:37.180]   But not irrational, because transcendence
[00:29:37.180 --> 00:29:41.100]   does not mean his absence, right?
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:44.260]   His beyond us does not mean God is absent.
[00:29:44.260 --> 00:29:46.740]   He's here.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:49.460]   He's here in your life.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.520]   And secondly, from this paragraph,
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:58.520]   we notice, or chapter 37 of Book of Genesis,
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.120]   God never condones evil and sin.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.840]   We are all accountable, just as the older brothers of Joseph,
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:07.480]   accountable to God.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.440]   But God can use the good deeds of the people
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.600]   to accomplish his will.
[00:30:11.600 --> 00:30:18.000]   He, God, God can use the evil actions of the people
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:23.160]   to accomplish his holy plan.
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.800]   God can use both.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.800]   Use our good works and the evil plans and actions of others.
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:40.440]   Number three, God orchestrates, sometimes directly
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:45.520]   and often indirectly, all the things
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:48.320]   from the greatest to the least in our life.
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.360]   But he's not inactive.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:53.480]   He is not silent.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.720]   He is always there.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:00.760]   And this paragraph says there's a purpose to it.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:05.360]   The purpose is for the praise and worship of God.
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:09.560]   If we really understand and really sink in
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:14.560]   this teaching of providence, we should find comfort
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.720]   and peace, even in times of difficulties and uncertainty.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:22.320]   Yes, we all have our moments that we doubt
[00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:26.880]   what is God doing and where am I heading, right?
[00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.560]   Especially when we think of our future, right?
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:34.720]   But the teaching of providence encourages us,
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:40.400]   even invites us to join the plan of God,
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.600]   to participate in the advancement of God's plan,
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:47.680]   preaching the gospel, building up the church,
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.280]   serving in obedience, working with God,
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:51.680]   cooperating with God.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.360]   He's orchestrating everything in my life,
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.640]   and that's why I can surrender my will to him.
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:01.680]   I can pray to God, God use me, right?
[00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:07.560]   Guide me, help me follow you, help me obey you, right?
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:11.520]   All the things, what does it say?
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.560]   From the greatest to the least,
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:18.800]   by his completely wise and holy providence.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:23.080]   We're gonna end today with our response song,
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.760]   and I wanna invite the worship team to come up here.
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:30.640]   Great is our God, and because he's so great,
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:36.600]   that's why we bow down and fall down before him to worship.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.320]   That's why we can lay our lives before him,
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:46.160]   because he is greatest, and he is holy and good.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:50.080]   We can trust in him.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:54.280]   No matter life throw at you, you can still trust.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:58.800]   Let's worship God, and then we'll close in prayer.

[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.640]   because everything in our life,
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.920]   from the greatest to the least,
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:18.720]   is under your careful watch.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.400]   Thank you for being our Lord and our Savior.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   Thank you for this comforting truth
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.880]   that we can lay our lives before you.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.880]   God use us, send us.
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:39.440]   Send us to where you want us to be,

[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:45.720]   And in times of difficulties and uncertainties,
[00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.680]   we pray that we will trust in you.
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:54.920]   Help us to know that you are our greatest God
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:56.440]   and in your providence,
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:36:01.320]   your will will be done in Christ's name.
