[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   Thank you.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.360]   Okay.
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.880]   So I have a friend named Grant,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.320]   and I'm guessing most of us have a friend like this
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.640]   in your friend group.
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.520]   Grant is that one person in your friend group
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.640]   who is heads and shoulders, smarter and more successful
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.960]   than everybody else in your group.
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.520]   If you know who I'm talking about for yourself,
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.460]   think about them.
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.440]   Grant is a genius.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.720]   Grant is very influential in his career.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.520]   And this guy,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.880]   we always joke that if you wanna feel bad about yourself,
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.720]   you should Google him
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:41.680]   because the number of podcasts he's on
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.400]   and the number of interviews he's been given
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.520]   and the number of lists in magazines
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.800]   that he's made it onto is a little sobering
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.320]   when you're like, "Oh, I'm about his age, that's great."
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.160]   And the reason Grant is successful and well-known
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.580]   is because Grant is an entrepreneur.
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.160]   So he opens businesses, he runs small businesses,
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.680]   and he's been doing this since he was 16,
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.320]   since he was maybe 14.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.680]   I am not kidding.
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.800]   When he was in his teenage years,
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.560]   this guy opened a thrift store in Hyde Park
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.920]   that is still running to this day.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.600]   He's also written books.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   He's made it into magazines.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.800]   And right now he runs a company
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.440]   that has more than 50 employees.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.020]   It's a little insane.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.040]   Now, one thing Grant always talks about
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.360]   when you talk to him about his businesses
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.060]   is he'll talk a lot about projects
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.440]   that they will dump or not do
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.920]   because of the fact
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.640]   that it doesn't fit their mission statement.
[00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.800]   And this is something he says he's been doing
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.600]   ever since he started opening that thrift store
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.200]   when he was in his teenage years.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   So Grant would tell you that when you open a business,
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.480]   your mission statement is the very foundation
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.760]   of what you do.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.460]   And you don't just have a mission statement
[00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.440]   because it's fun to put there.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.700]   You don't have a mission statement
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.120]   just because you need something to pitch to investors.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.360]   You have a mission statement
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.160]   because when an opportunity pops up,
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.680]   you can compare it to what you first set out to do
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.480]   and decide whether or not it's something
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.800]   you're going to do based on that.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.400]   So if you're opening a burger restaurant
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.400]   and your mission statement
[00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.200]   is to provide the best dining experience
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.400]   with the most unique burgers in Chicago,
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.280]   you're probably not going to jump
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.380]   on the chicken sandwich trend when it comes around.
[00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.720]   You're probably not going to have a Taco Tuesday special
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.020]   because it doesn't match your mission statement.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.400]   You're supposed to stay on point.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   Everything you do is born out of that mission statement.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.220]   It's a foundational piece.
[00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.960]   It's like the cement upon which you build a tower.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.680]   And he tells me that every single one of his businesses,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.520]   past and present, has always and will always
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.800]   have a very strict and defined mission statement
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.520]   because otherwise you're going to end up wasting your time.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.400]   So I want us to think today
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:23.480]   about what is your mission statement?
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.000]   Now, I know people are not like businesses.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.700]   We don't sit down and decide that we're going to
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.920]   build a person and then decide what they're about
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.480]   and what their core values are.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.900]   Most of us probably don't have an index card
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.360]   with our mission statement written down on it.
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.420]   I'm guessing most of us don't have an elevator pitch
[00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.440]   for who we are as a person.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.940]   That we can just recite at any moment, right?
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.160]   But the thing is that each and every single one of us
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.480]   has a mission statement,
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.920]   whether or not we understand that we do.
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.640]   Even if we don't think we do,
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.960]   there is still something that is that foundation
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.600]   that drives every action you do,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.420]   every day that you spend your time,
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.320]   it drives the decisions you make.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:16.920]   So I want you to pause for a minute
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.500]   and think about what that would be for you.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.480]   What is the thing that drives you?
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:26.960]   What gets you out of bed every single morning?
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   If I were to distill every action and motivation
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.080]   and every task you do and the way you spend your time
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.420]   and the people you hang out with,
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.520]   if I were to distill that
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.040]   into some kind of a mission statement or a purpose,
[00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.120]   what would that be for you?
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.580]   Think about that for a minute.
[00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:53.680]   Maybe your mission statement is,
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.640]   I want to provide for my family, right?
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.120]   Maybe it's, I need to make enough money
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120]   so that I can buy a house
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.080]   and have enough money for groceries
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.600]   and send my kids to college.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.800]   Maybe that's your mission statement.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.240]   Maybe you're in college right now
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.260]   and your mission statement is to either survive
[00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:11.680]   or get out with good grades
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.500]   and be in a position to get a good paying job.
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.720]   Maybe you're in high school
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:20.560]   and you want to please your parents with good grades.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.960]   Whatever it is,
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.560]   each of us has a mission statement right now.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.400]   And if you can't define it,
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.020]   that's probably a good indicator
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.480]   that you've just kind of been going with the flow
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.280]   and maybe the thing you're building your life on
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.820]   is being developed without you knowing it.
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.640]   That's not a good policy.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.240]   Today, we're actually going to discuss a time in the Bible
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.840]   when Jesus was asked
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.120]   about what the greatest moral commandment is.
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.360]   And Jesus gives an answer
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.400]   that I think fits into this mission statement box
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.080]   really perfectly.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.880]   And his answer tells a lot about why he's there.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.200]   And it also shows us a lot about
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.080]   why we make the decisions we make.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.400]   And whether you're in this room as a believer,
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.640]   whether you're in this room as somebody
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.120]   who's grown up in the church
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.500]   and you're not sure if you're a believer,
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.960]   maybe you're here or you're watching online
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:19.000]   and you're not a Christian, but you're intrigued.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.200]   I want you to be thinking
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.640]   about what that mission statement is for you.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.640]   And as we're talking about what Jesus endorses,
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:29.240]   think about how that compares and contrasts.
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.680]   We'll do that as we go along.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:34.520]   Let's pray that God would bless our time today.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:40.480]   God, we come to you today
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.960]   knowing that there is a lot
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.200]   of really difficult things in the world.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.560]   We know there's a lot wrong with existence right now,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.160]   from natural disasters to oppression to injustice.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.160]   God, we know and are fully aware of the fact
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:59.760]   that we don't live in a world that is easy
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.260]   or oftentimes fair.
[00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:06.120]   But God, it is all the more because of that
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.840]   that we thank you for your goodness.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.160]   And we thank you that you love us,
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.560]   even though we don't deserve it,
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:16.080]   even though it's not something that we earned,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.320]   it's not something that we should have.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.220]   And honestly, the fact that a God like you cares about us,
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:28.040]   even in the slightest bit, should astound us
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.520]   and should gobsmack us into silence for minutes at a time.
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:33.460]   We love you, God.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:36.120]   We ask that as we explore this topic,
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:37.880]   you would be moving in our hearts,
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.520]   whether we already believe in you
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:43.240]   and call you our God or not,
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:44.860]   would you be working in us
[00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:47.000]   so that we might experience your love
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.960]   and so that we might be moved in a certain way
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:54.520]   so that we know you more and are able to have lives
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.960]   that please you and look like you even more.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.720]   We pray this in your name, God.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.560]   Amen.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.000]   Now, the passage we're gonna be in today is Matthew 22.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.640]   So you can open up your Bibles
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:10.240]   or turn on your Bibles if that's your speed
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.760]   and turn to that passage.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.280]   I'll be in the, oh gosh,
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.740]   I can't remember if I'm in the ESV or the NIV today.
[00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:18.580]   You choose.
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:21.240]   But before we read the passage,
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.280]   I wanna give us a little bit of background
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.800]   into where we're dropping in.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.540]   So back in Jesus' day, right,
[00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:35.240]   the temple was the epicenter of religious life.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.820]   And since everybody in that day and age
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:39.680]   kinda had to be religious,
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.600]   the temple was kind of the center
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:44.340]   of everybody's life in general.
[00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:51.120]   So I want you to think about a sprawling religious building
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.680]   and I want you to think about people
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:56.400]   who are there all the time, okay?
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:59.220]   You would pass by this place on your way into the market.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.600]   When you're going about your dealings and visiting friends,
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.100]   you would pass by this place.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.440]   You would see people going in to make sacrifices,
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.920]   going in to talk to the Pharisees.
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.760]   You would be here often, right?
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.560]   And so at that day and age,
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:16.200]   there were people whose entire job it was
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:21.200]   to teach the law and the scriptures and the prophets
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:24.320]   at this building, at this temple.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.360]   And these Pharisees or these lawyers or Sadducees,
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.520]   whatever you wanna call them,
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.600]   they would be out in the temple courts preaching,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:34.400]   but most of the time,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.340]   they're doing it because they want a following.
[00:09:37.340 --> 00:09:39.560]   They want popularity.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.800]   They want political power.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.040]   At that day and age,
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.520]   political power and religious power
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.680]   were basically the same thing.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.200]   So these guys are out there
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.560]   and they're preaching and telling people
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.160]   how they should live their life,
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:54.480]   what the scriptures mean,
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.280]   and they're usually doing it
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:58.440]   because they want to have a following.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.960]   They want people to listen to them.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.080]   They want people to know their name and respect them.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.580]   They want to improve their rank, right?
[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:09.640]   So these guys are essentially people
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.320]   who just want the clout.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.820]   If they were alive today,
[00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:15.400]   they would probably be Twitch streaming.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.640]   That's a bit of a stretch, but trust me.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.760]   They do this kind of stuff.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:20.420]   They're in it for their name.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:22.420]   They're in it for the political power.
[00:10:22.420 --> 00:10:26.240]   And another way that they decide
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.020]   and they realize they can get that power
[00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:31.880]   is by debating people.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.600]   So let's say you're Bob the Pharisee
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.440]   and you out there
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.480]   and you're preaching to a bunch of people
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.720]   and people are following you.
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.840]   And then Dave over here
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.600]   sees that you have such a following.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:45.840]   Well, if Dave can call you out on something,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.240]   if Dave can debate you
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.560]   and make you look like an idiot,
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:52.840]   Dave is going to get more popular than Bob.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:54.560]   Dave is going to get those fans
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.300]   because he's shown everybody
[00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.520]   that Bob doesn't know what he's talking about.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.860]   So this kind of thing was something you would hear
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.540]   and see all the time.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.520]   You'd have crowds of people coming to these people
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.620]   and listening to them.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.820]   Now, Jesus, at this point in his ministry,
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.700]   Jesus does have clout.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.140]   Jesus is very popular.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.200]   People like this guy.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.100]   People are murmuring about maybe he's the Messiah.
[00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:23.120]   Maybe this guy is the one
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.140]   who is fabled to come and save our people.
[00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:27.460]   They're listening to him.
[00:11:27.460 --> 00:11:28.460]   And you know what that does?
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.540]   That paints a target on his back.
[00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.660]   That makes people want to seek him out and debate him,
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:36.820]   make him look dumb.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:41.620]   If they can just trap him in some kind of a mistake
[00:11:41.620 --> 00:11:44.240]   or make him say something that isn't actually biblical,
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.620]   or maybe it's unpopular culturally,
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.300]   they can take that popularity and power for themselves
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.980]   and invalidate him.
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:54.480]   So this is the situation
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:56.740]   and the sort of arena that Jesus enters
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:12:00.240]   when he's in the temple courts and he's teaching.
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:03.340]   So we're gonna start in verse 34
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.340]   and we're gonna go to 40.
[00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:10.340]   So hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees,
[00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:13.140]   that's basically a different political party
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.980]   or different religious party,
[00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.700]   the Pharisees got together
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.100]   and one of them, an expert in the law,
[00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:23.060]   the smartest among them,
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.920]   decided that he was going to test Jesus.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:27.760]   And he tested him with this question.
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.180]   (clears throat)
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.440]   Teacher, what is the greatest commandment of the law?
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.340]   Now, maybe this guy is thinking
[00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.140]   that he can get Jesus to say something wrong.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.860]   Maybe he's thinking he can get Jesus
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.380]   to say something unpopular.
[00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:47.580]   Whatever it is, this guy does not have positive intent.
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:49.060]   This guy ain't being sincere.
[00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:50.900]   He's trying to trip Jesus up.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.140]   Here's how Jesus answers.
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:56.140]   And most of us probably know this passage pretty well.
[00:12:56.140 --> 00:12:59.500]   Jesus replied, "Love the Lord your God
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.780]   "with all your heart, with all your soul,
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.460]   "and with all your mind."
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.540]   This is the first and the greatest commandment.
[00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.100]   And the second is like it.
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.400]   "Love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.700]   All the law and the prophets
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.900]   hang on these two commandments.
[00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.620]   Jesus is actually quoting Deuteronomy here.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:26.900]   So, excuse me, he is pulling his answer
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.680]   from scriptures that they all would have known.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.500]   So he's saying, "Love the Lord your God
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.760]   "with all your heart, soul, and mind,
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.660]   "and then love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.260]   That's the greatest commandment.
[00:13:39.260 --> 00:13:43.660]   So Brock, you're talking about mission statement.
[00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:45.940]   Why do you turn to this passage?
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:49.500]   I understand that it's not as if Jesus says,
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.420]   "Hey guys, this is my mission statement."
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:55.260]   This is not what's written on Jesus's
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:13:58.020]   about page on his website, okay?
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.380]   I recognize that he doesn't actually come out
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.020]   and say in his many words,
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:07.160]   "This is my mission statement," or "This is my purpose."
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:11.500]   But the reason I like to look at it through this lens
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.060]   is because it does seem to be like something
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.980]   that is very important and something Jesus sees
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.740]   as really meaningful.
[00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:22.300]   What do I mean by that?
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.300]   This story, most of you probably know Jesus answering,
[00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.180]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:30.860]   "soul, mind, and strength," right?
[00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:32.860]   And then love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.580]   It's because this story seems to be
[00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:38.980]   in three of the gospels, right?
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.020]   It seems to be in three different accounts
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:42.340]   of Jesus's ministry.
[00:14:42.340 --> 00:14:46.060]   We have it in Matthew, right?
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:48.220]   We have it in Mark and we have it in Luke.
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:49.980]   We're looking at Matthew today,
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.460]   but it's also in these other accounts of Jesus.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:59.740]   So when you see things that are in multiple gospel accounts,
[00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:02.660]   you should probably take notice.
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:06.380]   So here are two options when we see multiple accounts
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:07.660]   of this story, right?
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:12.660]   We say either all three of these writers
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:14.340]   found this as important
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:16.860]   and wanted to put it into their book.
[00:15:16.860 --> 00:15:19.060]   Or there's a second option
[00:15:19.060 --> 00:15:24.580]   that maybe this happened multiple times.
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:26.140]   Maybe there were three instances
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.380]   where Jesus gave this answer.
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:31.180]   So let's look at each of the actual scriptures.
[00:15:31.180 --> 00:15:32.180]   I won't go into detail.
[00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:34.600]   You can look at them yourself in your own time.
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.940]   There's a Wikipedia page that lists all of them in one.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.260]   You don't have to go to several different webpages.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.780]   Matthew, the one we just looked at,
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.180]   has a lawyer testing Jesus.
[00:15:45.180 --> 00:15:47.460]   It explicitly tells us that the Pharisees
[00:15:47.460 --> 00:15:50.500]   are conniving together and they're plotting something.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:52.980]   In Mark, it's a little different.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:56.460]   In Mark, there is a sincere scribe.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.980]   It says that there's a scribe,
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.380]   so somebody who writes down
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:02.040]   and his whole job is to copy the scriptures.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.420]   It says that in Mark, there's this scribe guy
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:06.820]   who's kind of sitting on the sidelines
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.820]   and he's like, "Huh, this Jesus guy,
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:10.340]   he's answering really well.
[00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:11.460]   He's giving good answers."
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:13.260]   So then he asks Jesus,
[00:16:13.260 --> 00:16:15.100]   "What's the greatest commandment in the law?"
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:16.100]   Not to test him,
[00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:19.820]   but because that's what he's working on 24/7.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.860]   He's like, "What is the most important part
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:25.860]   of this whole thing that I'm transcribing all day?"
[00:16:25.860 --> 00:16:29.420]   And in that account, Jesus says to the scribe,
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:31.500]   "Hey, you're close to the kingdom of God, man.
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:34.060]   Keep on, you're doing great."
[00:16:34.060 --> 00:16:37.100]   And then in Luke, it's similar to in Matthew
[00:16:37.100 --> 00:16:38.820]   where people are trying to test him,
[00:16:38.820 --> 00:16:41.020]   but Jesus doesn't actually answer himself.
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:43.460]   He says, "Well, what do you say it is?"
[00:16:43.460 --> 00:16:45.460]   He turns a question into a question.
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:47.540]   He says, "You answer this for me."
[00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.220]   So what is it?
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:54.860]   You could believe that all three of these authors
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:57.820]   remembered this instance differently,
[00:16:57.820 --> 00:16:59.540]   that it was one event
[00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:01.760]   and three different writers remembered it differently.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:02.920]   That's a possibility.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:07.380]   But what I believe, what I think seems to be the case
[00:17:07.380 --> 00:17:09.460]   since there are so many different,
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:11.740]   interesting, unique details,
[00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:16.540]   is that I think Jesus used this answer often.
[00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:23.500]   It seems that Jesus had this answer prepared
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.260]   for when people asked him,
[00:17:25.260 --> 00:17:27.620]   "What is the greatest moral commandment?
[00:17:27.620 --> 00:17:29.860]   What is the most important of these things?"
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.280]   You kind of get the sense that Jesus had this answer ready.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.800]   So it seems important to him.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.200]   And I think it fits the idea of a mission statement
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.840]   really, really well.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:48.320]   And we're gonna have to go look through
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.140]   what he's actually talking about here now.
[00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:52.720]   First of all, Jesus says,
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.720]   "You are to love God with all of your heart."
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.680]   That's your emotion.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.560]   That's the things that you feel.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:06.520]   You are to love God with all of your soul,
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.320]   all of who you are.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.560]   Think about the way that you define yourself.
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:15.900]   I am Brock, I'm a graphic designer.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:17.960]   That's my identity, right?
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:21.920]   Jesus is saying your soul, all that you are as a person,
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:25.080]   all of your identity and all of who you are,
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.580]   God is worthy of that.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:31.140]   All of your mind, your intelligence.
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.640]   How many of you have ever found a new hobby
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.920]   and you've gotten so into it
[00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:39.360]   that you learn the minutia and the details
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.760]   and you're on the subreddit looking at it every day
[00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.200]   and you are learning so much about this hobby or this thing.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:50.040]   And then eventually you just kind of lose interest
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.480]   because you've beaten it, you've conquered it,
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:55.580]   you've figured it out, right?
[00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:00.340]   Jesus is saying that God is worthy
[00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.240]   of all of your intelligence.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:06.400]   There is no point where you can exhaust that
[00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:08.120]   in your exploration of him.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:10.260]   Your strength, this isn't in the Matthew version
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:12.200]   we just read, this is in some of those other versions,
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.160]   so we're gonna include it as well.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.960]   This is your passion.
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:18.960]   This is the oomph with which you live your life.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.040]   When you're motivated to do something
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:23.140]   and it's outside of the ordinary,
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:25.860]   it's not what you just do with your everyday life.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.340]   When you put forth effort towards something,
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:30.720]   that's your strength.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:34.600]   Jesus is saying that your heart, your soul,
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.360]   your mind, your strength, all of it
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.620]   is worth being thrown at God.
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:42.880]   God is worthy of all of it.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:44.740]   Now I want you to think about your mission statement
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:46.120]   from before.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.820]   Even if you don't have it completely filled out,
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:50.960]   maybe you're just like, ah, I kind of seem security driven.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.880]   Maybe I seem a little bit driven by my own fame
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.080]   or popularity, or maybe I seem money driven
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.600]   or career or status driven, whatever it is.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.340]   Ask yourself, is the mission statement
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:04.840]   that you currently live your life by
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:07.620]   worthy of all of that?
[00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:12.720]   Most of us recognize when a person
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:15.960]   puts all of themselves towards a pursuit.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.260]   Sometimes we applaud it, right?
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:21.960]   You get basketball stars whose only goal is to win.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:25.840]   And when we have them on our fantasy draft, we like that.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.720]   But in real life, we don't really believe
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:31.480]   that that's the healthiest thing, right?
[00:20:31.480 --> 00:20:34.560]   We look at that and go, that's a little whack.
[00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:38.820]   To put all of yourself into one thing,
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:41.720]   whether it is success, whether it's status,
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.460]   is gonna leave you in a bad spot.
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:49.280]   Jesus is saying and affirming that all of you
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:53.580]   is worth throwing towards God.
[00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.400]   That if you're looking for something
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.400]   that is meaningful enough for everything in your life,
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.520]   it's God.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:07.860]   I want you to think about if your current mission statement
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.940]   lives up to that.
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:12.240]   So love God with everything.
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.300]   Here's the second part.
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.960]   Jesus says, love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:17.720]   Now this is interesting, right?
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:20.420]   He's asked what is the greatest commandment?
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:21.840]   And he gives two.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.260]   He doesn't leave this out.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.940]   That's weird, right?
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.400]   He could have just left it at love God with everything
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.160]   and that could have been it, but he doesn't.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.560]   He goes into more detail.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.860]   He includes and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:45.160]   Now, this is the part where if you're not a believer,
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.600]   if you don't actually consider God as your God,
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.500]   you don't look at Jesus and say, yeah, that's my Lord.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:54.720]   You probably would sign onto this.
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.360]   You would probably say, hey, I can get behind that.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:21:59.900]   Right?
[00:21:59.900 --> 00:22:01.180]   I might not like a lot of the rules
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:03.420]   or a lot of the things that tells me not to do in the Bible,
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:06.220]   but this part, this seems good.
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:08.660]   This seems fine, right?
[00:22:08.660 --> 00:22:11.820]   I can sign off on this.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.300]   I can say that this is a good thing,
[00:22:13.300 --> 00:22:16.300]   even if I don't vibe with everything else in the Bible.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.740]   Here's the reason Jesus says
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.780]   that they are intertwined though, right?
[00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:29.320]   Jesus says that these two commandments are very intertwined
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.280]   because you are not loving God
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.740]   if you are not loving your neighbor.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.640]   I'll say that again.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:41.600]   You are not loving God if you are not loving your neighbor.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:46.360]   And conversely, you cannot love your neighbor
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.940]   if you are not loving God.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.840]   You cannot love your neighbor if you are not loving God.
[00:22:52.840 --> 00:22:54.660]   I'll say those two one more time.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.560]   You are not loving God if you're not loving your neighbor.
[00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:59.760]   End of the story.
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.640]   You cannot love your neighbor if you aren't loving God.
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.640]   These two things, these two concepts are so intertwined
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:11.100]   that you can't have one thing without the other.
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.960]   I can't say to God, you're really great.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.560]   I like that you died for me.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.560]   I'm gonna make you my God,
[00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:21.200]   but I really, really hate other people.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.040]   I'm just not gonna deal with them.
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.100]   You can't do that.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.200]   And Jesus is also putting forth the idea here
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:34.200]   that you can't actually love your neighbor as yourself
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.060]   if you are not first loving him.
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:42.560]   This is an interesting idea, right?
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.280]   For those of you who are in Summit, you might remember this.
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.440]   I do, as Pastor Mark said, I do youth ministry here
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.440]   and we work with students in the church
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.880]   and students in the neighborhood.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.360]   And this past semester, we actually went over this topic.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.460]   We went over this verse
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:01.340]   and we were specifically looking at the idea
[00:24:01.340 --> 00:24:06.040]   of loving other people as yourself, right?
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.760]   Now, where we're at in Summit,
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:12.120]   where we're at with the kinds of discussions
[00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:13.400]   we have in our youth group,
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.000]   it's really interesting because rather than preach,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.040]   we just kind of discuss it and we talk about it.
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:19.920]   And we're at a spot where a lot of people
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.960]   are willing to talk about the things
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.400]   that maybe don't make a ton of sense to them,
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:27.020]   or they're willing to say, this doesn't make sense to me.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:30.220]   That seems like craziness.
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.040]   Let's talk about why that is.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:35.040]   And when we were talking about this idea,
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:40.040]   we had a young woman in our discussion who is whip smart
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:44.760]   and she's awesome, but she immediately locked on
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.680]   to some idea about this concept.
[00:24:47.680 --> 00:24:51.400]   She said, okay, loving your neighbor as yourself.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.180]   And as we're talking about what that actually means,
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.960]   as we're talking about what that actually looks like,
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:25:00.100]   she goes, that is a terrible life policy.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:06.640]   She identifies, she identified that this was not going
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.440]   to put you ahead, right?
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.680]   Loving your neighbor as yourself,
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.680]   giving them your spot in line,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.120]   preferring the things they want over what you want,
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.640]   giving your time and money to other people
[00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:21.180]   instead of using it for yourself.
[00:25:21.180 --> 00:25:24.240]   Like to the point where you would actually prefer
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.380]   other people's good over your good all the time.
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.860]   That does not make sense.
[00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:33.120]   Can you even build a life on that?
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.760]   Can you actually get anywhere with that?
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:40.760]   Aren't you always going to be left in need or wanting
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:43.360]   if you actually do that?
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   And here's the thing, she's right.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.740]   She's really onto something there.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.180]   There is no reason to love other people
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:00.340]   more than you love yourself
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:04.740]   if you do not have God in the equation, right?
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:11.060]   If you are a just random person here by accident,
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:16.580]   making it alone and making it in your life alone
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.180]   and you're watching out for number one,
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:20.420]   there really isn't any reason
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.780]   to value other people so highly.
[00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:25.680]   There's definitely a reason to care for other people.
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:27.560]   There's a reason to be kind for them.
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:31.080]   There's a reason to love them, sure,
[00:26:31.080 --> 00:26:33.860]   but to love them more than you love yourself,
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:35.760]   love them as yourself, what?
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.080]   That makes no sense.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:42.260]   This commandment only makes sense
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:47.260]   if there is first a God who has loved you so much
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:50.640]   that it would be crazy not to love your neighbor
[00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:51.600]   as yourself.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:55.840]   If the God of the Bible, right?
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:27:00.220]   If the God that is Jesus actually loves you,
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.600]   if he actually died for you,
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.020]   if he actually cares for you,
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:05.700]   if he's actually watching out for you so much
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.300]   that there will never be anything you need
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:10.120]   that he will not provide,
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.580]   whether that's physical, mental,
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:14.000]   whether that's financial,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.060]   whether that's emotional or relational,
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.100]   if there really is a God out there
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.020]   who cares that deeply about you,
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:26.660]   it would be crazy not to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.620]   If you've been given everything,
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:33.860]   why would you not want to share that kind of everything
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:35.060]   with other people?
[00:27:35.060 --> 00:27:41.040]   These commandments are intertwined.
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:45.400]   For one final time,
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:48.220]   I want you to think about the mission statement
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.700]   that you thought about at the beginning.
[00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:57.900]   I want you to think about what your life is defined by.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:28:02.820]   An easy way to do this is to think about your time.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.620]   How much time do you spend doing this thing
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:05.680]   versus that thing?
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:12.280]   Or how much of your thought life
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.000]   do you devote to something?
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:19.980]   Is your thought life always focused on the next promotion?
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:25.420]   Are the things coursing through your mind
[00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:29.740]   how you're going to get to the next step financially,
[00:28:29.740 --> 00:28:30.920]   that next stage?
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.220]   Are you consumed with another person
[00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:38.420]   and their thoughts of you?
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:40.600]   Is that where you get yourself worth?
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:45.200]   What are the things that drive you and motivate you?
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.080]   What is your mission statement?
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.060]   The reason I wanted to talk about this today
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.560]   is because what Jesus is putting forth
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:53.520]   is the only mission statement,
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:57.820]   the only foundation that is going to be satisfying.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:03.760]   If you live your life Saturday to Saturday,
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:06.380]   exhausted throughout the week,
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.640]   just looking for the next moment
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.400]   that you're gonna get for yourself.
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:14.040]   If you live your life looking for purpose or meaning
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:16.360]   and feeling like there's just none of it.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.160]   If you live your life feeling lonely
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:22.440]   and exhausted of being lonely,
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:25.920]   what Jesus is saying here and putting forth
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:28.600]   is something that is going to matter to you.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.920]   It's something that's gonna fill you up.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:35.680]   And think about what your life would look like then.
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:38.320]   You're not only fulfilled,
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:43.000]   you're also fulfilling others.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:44.440]   You're showing them,
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.080]   there's a God who loves you.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:49.740]   And I love you because he first loved me.
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:52.520]   I get to show you that I can value you
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:54.340]   more than I value myself,
[00:29:54.340 --> 00:29:57.440]   because God valued me more than he valued himself.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:04.920]   Everybody's life has some sort of foundation,
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.320]   some sort of mission statement.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.960]   Your actions don't happen randomly.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.520]   There is a value behind what you do.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:17.160]   And what Jesus is saying is that
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.580]   if you want to be fulfilled,
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:22.520]   if you want to be happy,
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:27.280]   if you want to know that other people are also loved,
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.100]   if you want to be able to love other people
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:31.920]   more than yourself,
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:34.880]   you have to know that first you are to love God
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.520]   with everything.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.280]   There is not a lot of things in this world
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:42.040]   that are actually worthwhile.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:45.880]   The older you get, the more you realize that.
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:51.440]   So much of what you do and care about now is dust later,
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:53.480]   or doesn't matter years down the road.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:57.880]   But what Jesus is saying is that this does.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:01.200]   And if you can't say with honesty
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:06.400]   that God has changed your heart to the point where
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.120]   you are able to love other people more than yourself,
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:12.000]   he's saying that you can have that,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.020]   that all you have to do is love him first.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:20.320]   Because the truth is he's loved you before that.
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:24.640]   Let's pray.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:30.360]   God, we thank you that these are not just words
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:31.700]   you're telling us,
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:36.000]   that it's not just some commandment you're giving to us
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.080]   and saying, good luck with it.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.960]   God, we thank you that this is something that Jesus did,
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.920]   that this is something you did first.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:50.440]   That Jesus himself loved God with all of his heart,
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:55.440]   soul, mind, and strength, all of his emotion,
[00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:59.120]   all of his intelligence, all of who he was,
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.360]   all of his passion.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.520]   And that because of that,
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.360]   he was also able to love his neighbor
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:09.840]   more than he loved himself.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:12.380]   That when he's in the garden of Gethsemane,
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:16.840]   on his face, sobbing and sweating blood,
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:19.880]   because he's terrified of the cross,
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.260]   that he prays to you and says, your will be done,
[00:32:24.260 --> 00:32:27.860]   and comes to the conclusion that he still loves his neighbor
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:29.500]   more than he loves himself.
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:33.380]   Thank you that rather than running,
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:37.980]   he turned and he walked towards the cross of his own will,
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.180]   because he loves us.
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.060]   God, would you give us a heart like that?
[00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.100]   Would you help us to live for something
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.240]   that actually matters instead of the rat race
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:48.740]   that this world is?
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.220]   Instead of all the things we could pour our heart and mind
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:55.160]   and soul and strength into that is going to go away soon.
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.580]   God, give us the wisdom to see that this
[00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:01.340]   is how we should be spending our life
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:04.300]   and that this is something that is going to fulfill us.
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:07.780]   And give us the conviction to follow through on that.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:11.420]   Not just to believe it's the case and say, that's nice,
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:12.780]   and I'll do that on Sundays,
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:15.780]   but to actually wake up every morning,
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:18.580]   so thankful and grateful that you love us.
