1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 Good morning, UV, it's good to be here.

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:06,040
 Excited to worship with you today

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,040
 and getting the word together.

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,600
 And thank you, Jason, for leading us this morning.

5
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:13,920
 We're gonna be looking in Ephesians chapter two

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,440
 this morning, Ephesians chapter two.

7
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,760
 If you wanna look there, turn there,

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,600
 look there in your Bible app.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,840
 We're gonna be looking at the first 10 verses

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,360
 of Ephesians chapter two.

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,360
 And we're gonna be talking about our identity

12
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:31,480
 and knowing our identity, these verses give us

13
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,320
 this powerful picture of who we are in Christ.

14
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:38,480
 So we're gonna read these verses together

15
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,960
 and then apply them to our lives

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,800
 and specifically what they mean for us in the church

17
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,320
 as a group of people who share this identity in Christ.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,160
 So let's read this.

19
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:53,000
 We're gonna begin in verse one of Ephesians chapter two.

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,600
 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins

21
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,560
 in which you once walked, following the course

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,720
 of this world, following the prince of the power of the air,

23
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,520
 the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience,

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,760
 among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh,

25
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,920
 carrying out the desires of the body and the mind,

26
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,040
 and were by nature children of wrath

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,760
 like the rest of mankind.

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:24,280
 But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love

29
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:27,240
 with which he loved us, even when we were dead

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:32,120
 in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.

31
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,280
 By grace, you have been saved and raised us up with him

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,160
 and seated us with him in the heavenly places

33
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:42,760
 in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages,

34
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,760
 he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace

35
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,800
 in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,760
 For by grace, you have been saved through faith

37
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,320
 and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of God,

38
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,480
 not a result of works, so that no one may boast.

39
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,280
 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,920
 for good works, which God prepared beforehand

41
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,240
 that we should walk in them.

42
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,800
 Let's pray real briefly.

43
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,680
 God, thank you for your word and for the truth

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,120
 that it has for us.

45
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,360
 I pray that you would speak to our hearts this morning

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,520
 and make your truth plain and clear

47
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,160
 and that we would be changed by it.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,480
 I pray that your truth would change our hearts this morning

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,400
 and through that change, it would change our actions.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,520
 I pray that we would go from this place different

51
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:35,560
 than when we came in, in Jesus' name, amen.

52
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,960
 All right, so this is probably kind of a familiar passage.

53
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,520
 Maybe you've heard it before, read it before,

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,840
 maybe you've read it many times, I hope so.

55
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,400
 This passage is such a powerful statement

56
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,040
 of God's grace and of salvation, redemption

57
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,720
 that we have in Christ and where it comes from.

58
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,640
 And we could spend a lot of time here

59
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,120
 just talking about that, about the grace of God

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,120
 and what this passage tells us about the grace of God.

61
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,360
 But this morning, we're gonna talk specifically

62
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:14,120
 about what this passage on the grace of God

63
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,880
 tells us about who we are

64
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,840
 and specifically about who we are in the church.

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
 And that's important because this letter

66
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,720
 was written to believers in churches,

67
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,040
 obviously in a very different time

68
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,240
 and a different culture than where we are right now,

69
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:35,000
 but in a lot of other ways, people just like us,

70
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 people who were probably in large cities

71
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,920
 surrounded by what we might call secularism,

72
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,340
 it was really paganism.

73
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,800
 They were surrounded by idol worship,

74
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,200
 they were surrounded by people chasing

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,080
 after destructive things in their life,

76
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:55,840
 they were surrounded by people who rejected

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,680
 the God of the Bible and sought their own happiness

78
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,000
 and pleasure and fulfillment in all these other things.

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,920
 They were surrounded by people who disagreed with them

80
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,560
 and who mocked their beliefs.

81
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,020
 So in a lot of ways, the experience of these believers

82
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:12,440
 was very similar to ours.

83
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,540
 And Paul's writing to them and he's telling them things

84
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:16,400
 that are important for them to know

85
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,660
 and then he's telling them things

86
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:19,840
 that are important for them to live out.

87
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,240
 And in the rest of chapter two,

88
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,200
 he's gonna talk about how important it is

89
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,960
 for them to live out unity in the church

90
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,520
 and how Christ has broken down these walls

91
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,280
 that divide us as human beings

92
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,200
 and made us into this new family.

93
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,880
 He's gonna go on and talk about that.

94
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,840
 But this is where he starts.

95
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,920
 He doesn't start with unity and with breaking down the walls.

96
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,380
 Before he gets to that, he starts with identity.

97
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,140
 And he starts with identity by talking about grace.

98
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:55,640
 And that's the most significant thing

99
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,660
 for us to understand about our identity

100
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,660
 is that in Christ, we are given this grace-based identity.

101
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:07,120
 That's who we are.

102
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,360
 We see it in this passage.

103
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,860
 There's this exchange from death to life

104
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,440
 that Paul makes really clear.

105
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,880
 And notice there are no qualifiers in these verses.

106
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:26,040
 Every believer who comes into relationship with God

107
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,920
 has been given this exchange.

108
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,320
 Every one of us has been brought

109
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:31,240
 from a state of spiritual death

110
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:33,900
 into a state of spiritual life.

111
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:40,280
 If you look at the first five verses here of the chapter

112
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,520
 and summarize them kind of in one sentence,

113
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:50,680
 it would be you were, but God, you are.

114
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,280
 That's the theme of what he's saying here.

115
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,240
 He's saying this is who you were.

116
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,320
 Then God intervened in your life.

117
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,640
 Now this is who you are.

118
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,240
 You have been changed.

119
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,440
 Your identity has been changed.

120
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,240
 And this is not an exchange of function or vocation.

121
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,760
 He's not saying you guys were peasants

122
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,360
 and now you're farmers.

123
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,980
 You guys were servants and now you're royals.

124
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,700
 He's not talking about a vocational change.

125
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,980
 And that's important for us to understand

126
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:23,980
 because in 21st century, especially in North America,

127
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:27,740
 we tend to identify ourselves by our vocation.

128
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,060
 We think who we are is what we do.

129
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,260
 So we think our job is our identity

130
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,640
 or our relationships are our identity

131
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:40,100
 or some choices that we make in our life are our identity.

132
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,040
 That's not what we're talking about here.

133
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,320
 It's not a change of our vocation or our function.

134
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,880
 It's a change of our essence.

135
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,440
 Death to life is a change of essence.

136
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,300
 It's a change of a state of being.

137
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,900
 It's not a change in your job.

138
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,460
 And that's what he's talking about.

139
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,740
 He's saying you were something before

140
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,700
 and God intervened and now you have

141
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,140
 a completely different essence,

142
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:09,220
 a completely different identity.

143
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,380
 And this is the gospel.

144
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,260
 This is the doctrine of regeneration.

145
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,180
 This idea that there's this supernatural work of God

146
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:20,940
 through the Holy Spirit whereby God gives life

147
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,760
 to sinners who had rejected God

148
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,700
 and were in a state of spiritual death.

149
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,980
 Our nature is fundamentally changed

150
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:30,440
 out of salvation by the grace of God.

151
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:34,600
 That's what we're being shown here.

152
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,820
 And we're further being shown that this exchange

153
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:40,980
 is made solely by God on the basis of his grace.

154
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,980
 We don't do anything to deserve it,

155
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,140
 to earn it, or to make it happen.

156
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,220
 That's really clear in these verses.

157
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:51,020
 Now, like I said, hopefully we all

158
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,660
 at least have heard that before

159
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,940
 and thought about it a little bit.

160
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
 And I'll be perfectly honest,

161
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,460
 all of us should meditate on that

162
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,840
 and really reflect on it a lot more,

163
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,660
 myself certainly included,

164
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,500
 because this is really the basis of our relationship with God

165
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,380
 is the basis of our relationship with one another.

166
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,620
 And so even though we've heard it before,

167
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,020
 we're like, yeah, I get it.

168
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,900
 For by grace are you saved, it's not of works,

169
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,900
 I know the verse.

170
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,420
 Still, we need to really reflect on that,

171
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:23,480
 consider it, and let it sink into our hearts

172
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,760
 and begin to change who we are.

173
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:30,140
 And that's, I think, what he's trying to communicate,

174
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,460
 why he's starting with our identity.

175
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,400
 He's telling us our identity

176
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,440
 is completely based in God's grace.

177
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,800
 It's founded on God's grace.

178
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,760
 That's where it comes from, that's the source of it.

179
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,660
 It's founded in God's unmerited favor towards us.

180
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:47,640
 We're forgiven because of God's grace,

181
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,480
 we're cleansed because of God's grace.

182
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,720
 What Jesus did on the cross,

183
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,920
 the sacrifice on the cross for us.

184
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,000
 We're accepted in the family of God because of God's grace.

185
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,400
 We're made like Christ, transformed into his image,

186
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,880
 sanctified as we live out the Christian life

187
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,220
 and as we follow Jesus,

188
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:05,280
 that process is also because of God's grace.

189
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:08,380
 And that's the essence of what it means

190
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,320
 to be a follower of Jesus

191
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,220
 and what it means to be in the church.

192
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,380
 I'll also just say this,

193
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:16,340
 it's not really where we're headed today,

194
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,700
 but it's just something important

195
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,420
 to understand about identity,

196
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:22,900
 is that the security of your identity

197
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:26,660
 is only as secure as the source of your identity.

198
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:28,220
 And that's important for us to understand.

199
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,140
 Even as believers, we can place our identity

200
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,420
 in other things.

201
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:32,940
 We can place it in our vocation,

202
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,380
 we can place it in our relationships,

203
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,700
 we can place it in our achievement,

204
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,980
 our education, our status.

205
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,400
 We can place it in our financial position,

206
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,020
 we can place it in our class,

207
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,700
 we can put our identity in all types of things.

208
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,580
 And the problem with that is,

209
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:53,420
 those things are all earthly, temporal things

210
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,340
 that can change and pass away.

211
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,420
 Our relationships can change,

212
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,980
 people that we love can move or they can age.

213
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,460
 And if our identity is in a relationship,

214
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,660
 even if it's in our own family,

215
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:08,500
 that can be taken away, that can be shaken.

216
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,180
 If our identity is in our job, we can lose our job.

217
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:13,680
 If our identity is in our possessions and our wealth,

218
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,820
 that can all disappear.

219
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,940
 If our identity is in our ability

220
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,260
 and the things that we're good at,

221
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,680
 that can be changed.

222
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,100
 We may have great beauty

223
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,140
 or we may have great athletic prowess

224
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,620
 or we may have great intelligence,

225
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,340
 but those things can go away, right?

226
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,820
 Our beauty fades with time

227
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,900
 and so does our physical strength and vigor.

228
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,540
 And our intelligence,

229
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:46,700
 we can still be outsmarted,

230
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,540
 we can still make a bad decision.

231
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,180
 All those things that we place our identity in

232
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,500
 ultimately end up being insecure.

233
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,200
 And that's why it's so important for us as believers

234
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,460
 to place our identity in Christ,

235
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,620
 because Christ is the only source of our identity

236
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,200
 that's not gonna change

237
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,740
 and it can't be taken away from us

238
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,380
 and won't be corrupted or won't disintegrate or diminish.

239
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,060
 And so if we have our identity in Christ

240
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:14,340
 and we lose our job, our identity is still secure.

241
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,540
 If we have our identity in Christ

242
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:19,660
 and someone mistreats us in a relationship,

243
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,660
 our identity is still secure.

244
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:24,820
 If we have our identity in Christ and we get old,

245
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:27,140
 our identity is still secure.

246
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,300
 And so it's really important for us as believers

247
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,860
 to put our identity in Christ,

248
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:33,380
 because the source of our identity

249
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:35,700
 determines the security of our identity.

250
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,160
 And that's the only place for us to be.

251
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,660
 But if we're placing our identity in Christ

252
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,460
 and understanding his grace,

253
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:48,820
 it has real significance for the way

254
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,300
 that we relate to one another, especially in the church.

255
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,820
 And that's what I want us to consider today

256
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,900
 because I think that's really why Paul starts here

257
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,980
 with identity and with grace

258
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,300
 and then moves on towards unity.

259
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,340
 So let's think about this.

260
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:08,340
 First, in Christ we're given this equality of identity.

261
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,720
 We're all equal in the grace that God has given us.

262
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,720
 But not necessarily uniformity of expression,

263
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,420
 and that's important for us to understand.

264
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:24,140
 In the first few verses here between verse one and three,

265
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,400
 there's a shift in speech from you to we.

266
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:30,300
 In verse one, Paul is speaking to the Gentile believers

267
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,820
 in Ephesus and speaking to them as a Jewish person.

268
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,620
 That's why he's saying you.

269
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,580
 You were in this condition.

270
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,560
 In verse three, he's being careful to make it clear

271
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,700
 that Jews were also in the same condition

272
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,800
 of sinfulness, fallenness, and need for Jesus.

273
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:49,340
 As he does this, what Paul's doing

274
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,660
 is he's both acknowledging the distinction

275
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:56,660
 between Jew and Gentile and also erasing

276
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,220
 the inferiority, superiority dynamic of the distinction.

277
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,680
 That's important for us to understand.

278
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,680
 We're all given this equal identity of grace in Christ.

279
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:15,220
 We have equal worth in the essence of our redemption,

280
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:19,140
 but we're still different in different ways.

281
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,660
 We still have different expressions

282
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:21,620
 of God's work in our life,

283
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,020
 and that's okay.

284
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,260
 We still have different cultures.

285
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:27,300
 We have different ways of doing things.

286
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,940
 We have different ways of expressing the gifts

287
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:31,780
 that God's given us.

288
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,580
 We have different gifts,

289
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,860
 and those are all beautiful things.

290
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,260
 The scripture's really clear about this.

291
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:39,340
 First Corinthians 12, verses four to seven says this.

292
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,740
 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same spirit.

293
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:43,740
 There are varieties of service, but the same Lord.

294
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,060
 There are varieties of activities,

295
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,980
 but it's the same God who empowers them all and everyone.

296
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,960
 To each is given the manifestation of the spirit

297
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,460
 for the common good.

298
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:55,980
 That means even though we're equal in Christ,

299
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,960
 we have this shared identity,

300
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,660
 our God-given distinctions and diversity are preserved,

301
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,000
 and that's a good thing.

302
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,540
 Our physical differences, our personality, our skills,

303
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:07,940
 our talents, our abilities, our spiritual gifts,

304
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,180
 even our cultural background and expressions,

305
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:15,580
 all those things are preserved and valued in the church,

306
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:17,860
 in the community of God's people,

307
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:21,840
 and that affects our relationships, right?

308
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,960
 When we understand, hey, I've been saved,

309
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,480
 I've been brought into this family by grace.

310
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,120
 My brother or sister,

311
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:31,480
 they do some things differently than me.

312
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,440
 They have different gifts.

313
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,840
 They have different things that are important to them.

314
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,480
 They have different ideas about how we should connect

315
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,880
 with the community and serve,

316
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,840
 or what the worship service should look like,

317
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:46,760
 or whatever it is, but I can value them

318
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,800
 because they were also brought into this community by grace,

319
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,060
 and they were saved with the same grace that I was,

320
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:56,480
 and so even though there's a different expression,

321
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,460
 we share that identity of grace.

322
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:04,140
 There's no inferiority or superiority here,

323
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,820
 and that's clear throughout the New Testament.

324
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,020
 Galatians 3, Paul talks about that.

325
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:12,020
 He says, in verse 27, this is Galatians 3, 27, 28.

326
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,740
 For as many as you were baptized into Christ

327
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:15,500
 have put on Christ, there's neither Jew nor Greek,

328
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,500
 there's neither slave nor free,

329
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:17,700
 there's no male nor female,

330
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:22,200
 for you are all one in Christ Jesus.

331
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,140
 That's what he's saying.

332
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,580
 He's not saying that once you come into the church,

333
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,260
 those things don't exist,

334
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,620
 that there's no longer Jewish people and Gentile people.

335
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:33,740
 Obviously, they still existed as Jews and Gentiles

336
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,220
 in the first century church.

337
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,780
 He's not saying that there were no men and women

338
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,620
 in the church.

339
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:41,020
 Obviously, they still existed as men and women in the church,

340
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,360
 but he's saying there's no dynamic of inferiority

341
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,740
 or superiority, that each one of you has equal worth

342
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,620
 and value and redemption and grace through Christ,

343
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,260
 and that when we come into the church,

344
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,820
 yes, we're still different,

345
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,840
 and we express that in different ways,

346
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,180
 we serve God in different ways,

347
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,700
 but each one of us has the same identity

348
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,500
 of grace and forgiveness.

349
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:09,860
 Now, obviously, we have to submit our differences

350
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,080
 to God's word.

351
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,620
 Sometimes we have differences of preference

352
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,940
 and things like that,

353
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,180
 that may be unbiblical,

354
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,540
 some of them may be unhealthy,

355
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,140
 so we have to submit those things to God's word.

356
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:24,080
 We have to say, okay, what are the things

357
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,540
 that are a part of my preferences or my background

358
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,620
 that maybe I need to let go of,

359
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,460
 maybe I need to release?

360
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,300
 We need to understand that all of us, as believers,

361
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,220
 are beautiful and broken.

362
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,880
 We're redeemed, but we still have sin,

363
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,540
 we still have brokenness,

364
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,140
 and so we have to submit those things to God's word

365
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:48,700
 and lift up the beautiful God-honoring things

366
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,140
 in our community of the church

367
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,460
 and be willing to lay down the broken things

368
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,620
 in the community of the church.

369
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,800
 There are things that we have to say,

370
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,900
 okay, this is a part of who I am,

371
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,500
 but it's actually not honoring to God,

372
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,660
 and so I'm gonna lay this down

373
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:03,800
 for my brothers and sisters in the church,

374
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,960
 but maybe there's something else

375
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,900
 that is not a part of who I am

376
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,540
 that's a part of my brothers and sisters,

377
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,660
 but there's nothing wrong with it,

378
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,660
 it's actually a beautiful thing, I can lift that up,

379
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,940
 even though it's unfamiliar to me,

380
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:18,660
 it's still something that I can celebrate

381
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:22,340
 because we have the same identity of grace,

382
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:26,100
 we have the same essence of forgiveness,

383
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,660
 and those things ultimately, those different expressions,

384
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,260
 even if they're unfamiliar to us,

385
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,700
 like I said, as long as they're not unbiblical,

386
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,400
 as long as they're not in a violation of God's word,

387
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,440
 those things become adornments to the gospel,

388
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,760
 and the New Testament's clear about that,

389
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,760
 that God desires a host of people

390
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,720
 from every nation, every background,

391
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,840
 with all different types of skills and talents and abilities

392
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,200
 and all different types of people

393
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,600
 to be in his family and to worship him,

394
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,840
 and that's really clear in the New Testament,

395
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,480
 and so if God wants that, then we can be okay with that too.

396
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,140
 We can say, you know what,

397
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,300
 my brother and sister,

398
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,800
 they do it a little bit differently than me,

399
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,700
 have some different ideas than me,

400
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:17,760
 but they have the same redemption that I have,

401
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,360
 they've been brought into the same family of God

402
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,600
 that I have been,

403
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,360
 and so I can value and love and respect them,

404
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,440
 and even experience fellowship with them

405
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,880
 because we have this same redemption in Christ.

406
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,640
 Our grace-filled identity's really important.

407
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,300
 To our unity.

408
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:41,540
 We see in verses four to seven

409
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,140
 the equality of that redemption in Christ.

410
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:47,660
 That God, being rich in mercy because of the great love

411
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,700
 with which he loved us even when we were dead

412
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,760
 and our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ.

413
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:58,900
 And by grace you have been saved and raised us up with him

414
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,420
 and seated us with him in the heavenly places

415
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,740
 in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages

416
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,960
 he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace

417
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,400
 in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.

418
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,800
 Everyone in the church who truly knows God

419
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,760
 and has relationship with him experiences the same grace.

420
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:20,340
 There's no one who gets like class one salvation,

421
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,880
 there's no first class salvation,

422
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,960
 an economy class salvation.

423
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,380
 We all get the same grace,

424
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,160
 we all get the same forgiveness,

425
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:35,160
 we are all accepted and embraced by Jesus in the same way.

426
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,980
 We're all welcomed and valued into the family of God

427
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:39,900
 in the same way.

428
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:44,940
 We all have equal worth and equal value before Christ.

429
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,940
 And every person in the church matters equally.

430
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,580
 Sometimes that's hard for us to understand

431
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,700
 because we say, well, there's different roles

432
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:58,660
 and there's different functions in the church.

433
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,020
 And so it seems like one role or function

434
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,420
 is more important than the other.

435
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,380
 There are different roles and functions in the church,

436
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:06,260
 that's biblical.

437
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,240
 The Bible lays that out for us

438
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,620
 and it gives us those things so that the church

439
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,960
 can function well in pursuit of its mission

440
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,340
 of glorifying God, knowing him,

441
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,640
 and reaching the world, making disciples.

442
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:24,540
 So that's something that we should have.

443
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,100
 But we shouldn't misunderstand and think that

444
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:30,020
 because there are different roles and different functions,

445
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,580
 that that means people have different worth

446
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:33,900
 in the body of Christ.

447
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,000
 It's not true at all.

448
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,620
 Just because someone is a part of serving in the church

449
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,500
 or because they stand on the stage,

450
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,340
 doesn't mean they have more worth.

451
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,020
 They don't have more worth in God's eyes,

452
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,340
 they don't have, like I said,

453
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:52,320
 they don't have a higher level of salvation.

454
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:54,380
 All of us are given the same grace

455
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,500
 and all of us are valued equally before our savior.

456
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,220
 And each one of us matter in the same way.

457
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,860
 And everyone is essential to the body.

458
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,860
 Again, in 1 Corinthians 12, talking about the unity

459
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,380
 and the working of the church,

460
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,180
 in verse 20 and 21 it says this,

461
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:13,260
 "As it is, there are many parts, yet one body,

462
00:21:13,260 --> 00:21:16,000
 "that I cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you,

463
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,780
 "nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you."

464
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,380
 Everyone who is a part of the church

465
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,640
 is essential to the body.

466
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,440
 Even though the roles are different.

467
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,200
 And I love that illustration that Paul uses

468
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,140
 of the physical body,

469
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,860
 because there are parts of our physical body

470
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,100
 that we think are more important, right?

471
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,660
 Like we think our hand is more important

472
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,240
 'cause it does so much stuff.

473
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,700
 But there are other parts of our body

474
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,860
 that we may notice much less,

475
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:47,260
 but they're essential to the working of our body.

476
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,780
 And that's this illustration in the church.

477
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,100
 We can't look at different roles and say,

478
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,340
 this is worth more, this person has more value

479
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,600
 in God's sight, that's not true.

480
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,860
 Every one of us is essential to the body.

481
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:04,420
 And in verses four to seven,

482
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:08,940
 we also see as he's talking about what God has done for us,

483
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,860
 he's shown us the immeasurable riches of his grace,

484
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:15,780
 that that is again given to all of us.

485
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,600
 Think about that.

486
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,300
 In the church, all of us are given the same Holy Spirit,

487
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,360
 all of us have the same access to God relationally.

488
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:27,260
 Now that doesn't mean we all walk with God in the same way,

489
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,380
 and that doesn't mean that all of us are at the same place

490
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,980
 in our walk with God, right?

491
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:32,780
 There is such a thing as spiritual maturity,

492
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,740
 and there are people who are walking with God

493
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,380
 in a deeper way than others.

494
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:40,180
 And again, that's biblical.

495
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:42,440
 But we're all given the same access.

496
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,260
 We all have the same access to God.

497
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,940
 We all have the same opportunities to know God.

498
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:51,740
 We all have the same privileges and spiritual riches

499
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:53,180
 as children of God.

500
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,900
 God doesn't say, well, I'm gonna give some blessings

501
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,380
 to this person 'cause they're really special,

502
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,900
 but the other believers don't get to have that.

503
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:06,900
 No, we all have those same privileges as a child of God.

504
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:10,700
 We all have those same spiritual riches

505
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,340
 that we have access to.

506
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:15,260
 And we all have the same destiny in heaven.

507
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,700
 Bible's clear about that.

508
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,700
 Now, that doesn't mean everything is the same

509
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,860
 in our lives, right?

510
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,420
 And again, that's okay.

511
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,380
 The Bible speaks to that.

512
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,580
 We're gonna have different experiences in our life.

513
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,380
 We're gonna go through different things.

514
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,620
 Some of us are gonna grow in spiritual maturity

515
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:34,200
 at a different rate, and that's okay.

516
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:40,660
 But what we need to understand is that our physical resources

517
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:43,780
 and opportunities and the things that we go through

518
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:48,780
 on this earth do not mean that we matter more

519
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:54,840
 or have more worth in God's eyes.

520
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,540
 And that's been a problem in the church

521
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,620
 since the beginning, right?

522
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,460
 James talks about it, how we're not supposed

523
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:04,700
 to show partiality when someone comes into the church

524
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,020
 and we say, oh, this person's wealthy or influential,

525
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,900
 so we're gonna make sure this person

526
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,460
 has the first-class experience.

527
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:13,500
 And he says, don't do that, that's wrong.

528
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,340
 Because that's always been a part of who we are as humans.

529
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,780
 We're tempted to say, well, this person,

530
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,340
 their physical experience, their life experience

531
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,340
 here on earth, they have more wealth

532
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,620
 or they have more influence or there's someone with power

533
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,740
 or there's someone, so maybe we should treat them

534
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,220
 like they have more worth in the church as well.

535
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,220
 But that's not true.

536
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,580
 And that's what we have to remember.

537
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:38,860
 It's fine that we have different experiences,

538
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,940
 that we have different resources,

539
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,280
 that we're in different places in life.

540
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,420
 That's fine.

541
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:47,840
 But don't get confused and think that that makes people

542
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,380
 worth more in the eyes of God, because it's not true.

543
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:56,620
 What we're seeing in this passage is that in Christ,

544
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:00,380
 the foundation and the ground of our equality,

545
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:05,380
 which ultimately results in unity, is one of grace.

546
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:08,500
 Verses eight to 10 make that so clear.

547
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,340
 For by grace you've been saved through faith,

548
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:13,680
 and what you're doing is the gift of God,

549
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,160
 not a result of work, so that no one may boast,

550
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,660
 for we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus

551
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:21,080
 for good works, which God prepared beforehand

552
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,280
 that we should walk in them.

553
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:26,520
 None of us have room for pride or to think

554
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,080
 that we're better than someone else.

555
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,580
 That's what he's saying there.

556
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:34,800
 In the church, this equality of worth that we have

557
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,560
 before Christ comes from grace.

558
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,000
 And that's really important for us to understand.

559
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,520
 We live in a world that really wants equality, right?

560
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,160
 It's an important value in our world,

561
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,640
 and people are seeking it.

562
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,480
 Unfortunately, people usually seek it in the wrong ways.

563
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:54,920
 And one of the really backward conceptions

564
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:58,360
 that the world has of equality that just doesn't work

565
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:03,360
 is we're trying to seek after an equality of exaltation.

566
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,400
 We're saying, who is the person that has the most,

567
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,520
 and let's try to raise everybody to that level, right?

568
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,760
 We think that would be fair.

569
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,920
 That's not what the Bible does.

570
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,640
 The Bible gives us a true equality,

571
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,000
 but it's totally different.

572
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:22,000
 The Bible says, hey, everyone's equal,

573
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,840
 but not in exaltation.

574
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,140
 Everyone's equal in need.

575
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,480
 Everyone's equal in brokenness.

576
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,360
 The most equal place in the universe

577
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,160
 is the ground at the foot of the cross,

578
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,960
 where we come before Christ, and every one of us,

579
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,720
 regardless of our background or our family heritage

580
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,160
 or our culture or our possessions, our wealth,

581
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,120
 regardless of all of that,

582
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,880
 every one of us is at the foot of the cross saying,

583
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,920
 I have no hope.

584
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,640
 I'm spiritually dead.

585
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,720
 I'm separated from God.

586
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,560
 I'm broken.

587
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,720
 I'm in need.

588
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,480
 And everything else about me, my money, my background,

589
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:06,020
 whatever, can't help me, and I need a savior.

590
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:10,700
 And that's the place where we find really true equality,

591
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:13,080
 because that puts us in a place

592
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,360
 that is really an antiseptic to our pride.

593
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,140
 It destroys that pride that we have,

594
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,920
 thinking like, well, I'm better than someone else

595
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,420
 because I did this or I did that.

596
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,380
 No, at the foot of the cross, we did nothing.

597
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,920
 We earned nothing.

598
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,920
 There's nothing for us to boast in,

599
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,380
 as this passage tells us.

600
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:34,420
 At the foot of the cross, we can't look at someone else

601
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:39,260
 and think, well, there's kind of a moral hierarchy here.

602
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:44,260
 I'm better than them in some way, because we're not.

603
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,540
 Even if we're a person who knows Jesus

604
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,860
 and we're following him and God's at work in our life

605
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,300
 and there's good works coming out of that,

606
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,060
 because that's what verse 10 says is gonna happen,

607
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:57,420
 even if we're that person, we have to say, wait a second.

608
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,800
 Even any good work coming out of my life

609
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,980
 is because of Christ.

610
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,660
 So I don't get to look at anyone else,

611
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,780
 think I'm better than them.

612
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:12,580
 There's no room for pride, there's no room for boasting.

613
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:18,260
 Those types of things are poisonous

614
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:20,620
 to a spirit of equality.

615
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,940
 They're poisonous to a spirit of unity.

616
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,500
 And that's why Paul is starting with this.

617
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,300
 He's saying, look, if you guys are gonna be unified

618
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,100
 in living out the mission God has for you,

619
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,340
 you gotta understand who you are in Christ

620
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,500
 and where that comes from.

621
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,180
 It comes from grace.

622
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,220
 And because of that, you can treat one another

623
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,820
 like everybody matters just as much as you do,

624
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,580
 because that's the truth.

625
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,500
 And you can treat one another like the only way

626
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:50,260
 you got in the door was because of Jesus.

627
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,280
 That's the truth.

628
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:54,400
 No one got in the door because they were wealthy.

629
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,860
 No one got in the door because they were well-connected.

630
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:57,700
 No one got in the door

631
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,960
 because their family knew somebody.

632
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,540
 No one got in the door because they were smart.

633
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:04,860
 No one got in the door because they were gifted

634
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:09,860
 or a celebrity or they were beautiful or none of that.

635
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:15,140
 In the church, we only come in

636
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,940
 because of Jesus and what he did for us

637
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,940
 and because of his grace and the forgiveness

638
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,180
 and acceptance that he offers us.

639
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,600
 And that's so important for us.

640
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:33,500
 And so in closing, I want us to just think about that

641
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,320
 for a minute.

642
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,740
 So much of identity is enculturated.

643
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:42,460
 It's as we grow up, it's the water we swim in

644
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,260
 and we're taught that, right?

645
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,780
 You can, I'm sure, remember instances like that

646
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,260
 from when you were a kid when maybe you had a question

647
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,580
 about why do we do this?

648
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:56,740
 And your parents said, "That's what we do, right?

649
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,480
 "This is who we are.

650
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,560
 "This is why we eat what we eat.

651
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
 "This is why we go where we go.

652
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,220
 "This is why our house looks like this."

653
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,460
 So much about our identity and who we are

654
00:30:08,460 --> 00:30:12,340
 is just taught to us as we grow up

655
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,900
 and then we live it out, right?

656
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,500
 But think about that in the church

657
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,160
 and think about that in light of these 10 verses.

658
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,700
 If we start to live out this culture

659
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,200
 that Paul is pointing us towards here,

660
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,880
 where our identity is grace-based,

661
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,660
 where it has, it's nothing to do with our performance

662
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:41,420
 or our possessions or anything else.

663
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,700
 It's just grace-based.

664
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:46,860
 What kind of culture does that build, right?

665
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,740
 'Cause in our human cultures,

666
00:30:48,740 --> 00:30:51,640
 we can build identities that have beautiful things

667
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,180
 but also very broken things in our human cultures, right?

668
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,920
 We see that in our human cultures.

669
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,820
 But Paul is putting in front of us

670
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,180
 something that's, there's no brokenness in it.

671
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:05,660
 This is the grace of God.

672
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:09,520
 And if we built a culture based on this in the church,

673
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:15,540
 that would be something, that would be truly beautiful

674
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,220
 and would be truly life-giving to people who are in it

675
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,060
 and people who are outside it and would see it

676
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,180
 and would wanna be part of it.

677
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:27,280
 And it certainly would lead to the type of unity

678
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,820
 that is discussed later on in this chapter.

679
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,120
 And this is where it starts.

680
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:35,400
 It starts with this identity of knowing

681
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,680
 that we are here because of God's grace.

682
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,920
 And because of that, we can have that same grace

683
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,720
 and humility and love and care for everyone else

684
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,220
 that God has put in our church, in our local body

685
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,040
 as we live life together.

686
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,540
 We can treat them with that grace

687
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,520
 because that's why we're all here.

688
00:31:55,520 --> 00:32:00,040
 And each one of us has received that from Christ.

689
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,960
 None of us earned it, none of us got it.

690
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,240
 We all were given it by Jesus.

691
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:09,340
 And each one of us got it.

692
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,400
 No one got it halfway.

693
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,720
 That's who we are, and that's how we can live

694
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,680
 into our relationships with one another in the church.

695
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,520
 Let's pray.

696
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:23,200
 God, I thank you for the truth of your grace,

697
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,400
 and I thank you for the way that it levels our pride

698
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:32,440
 and it turns us towards one another with a heart of love.

699
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:36,580
 And I pray that would be true in our lives, God,

700
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:40,380
 as we live out what it means to be your followers,

701
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,380
 your church, both in this setting where we come together,

702
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,780
 we gather with one another and we're facing one another,

703
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:52,060
 but also then tomorrow and through the week

704
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,840
 as we go out into the world and we face the world.

705
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,780
 God, may we, in both of those places,

706
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,460
 may our identity be grounded in your grace.

707
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:05,420
 May we see that we're only here

708
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,720
 because of what you did for us.

709
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,400
 And that's true of everyone else in the room,

710
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,240
 and may we really love one another

711
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,320
 and be unified and care for one another

712
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,740
 because we see the grace that you've given

713
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,020
 to each one of us.

714
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,460
 God, we just thank you and praise you for what you've done.

715
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,080
 In Jesus' name, amen.
