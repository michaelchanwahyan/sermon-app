1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
 - Hey, good morning everyone, good morning church.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,840
 And let's turn to our scripture today.

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:09,000
 And if you have a Bible, turn to 2 Timothy chapter three.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,560
 And we're going to study this chapter

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:15,820
 and take root in the word of God.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,880
 But first of all, we have the verse of the week, right?

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,280
 Remember the first one is Psalm 119, 105, right?

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,960
 Can we recite it together?

9
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:25,000
 Let's do that.

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,260
 Psalm 119, 105.

11
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:31,480
 Your word is a lamb to my feet and a light for my path.

12
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,560
 Wonderful verse, right?

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,000
 You got that memorized?

14
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,080
 I'm sure you do, right?

15
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,360
 And then the second one, which is last week,

16
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,560
 which is last week's verse of the week.

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,440
 And this is from Matthew, and that's what Jesus said.

18
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,680
 Let's recite it together.

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:51,560
 You must love the Lord your God with all your heart,

20
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,000
 all your soul, and all your mind.

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,680
 This is the first and greatest commandment, all right?

22
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,120
 Got it memorized, right?

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:02,760
 And today I'll give you another one, all right?

24
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,960
 But before that, we're going to dive into chapter three

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,360
 of the book of 2 Timothy.

26
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,700
 And as I told you, this chapter, 17 verses long,

27
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,680
 there were two parts.

28
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:17,800
 The first part, which I talk about,

29
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,480
 and we studied last week,

30
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,480
 was about the dangers of neglecting the word of God,

31
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:29,960
 of the ignoring, of not knowing the word of God.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,300
 That is chapter three, verses one to nine.

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,340
 And today we come to the second part of the chapter,

34
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,080
 2 Timothy chapter three, verses 10 to 17.

35
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:43,880
 And that chapter talks about the benefit

36
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,600
 of knowing God's word, of learning God's word.

37
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,640
 Speaking of the first part,

38
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:53,000
 the dangers of neglecting the word of God.

39
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,400
 And this is a real danger because as you remember,

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,400
 in the first nine verses, Paul is talking to his mentee,

41
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,140
 his disciple, his disciple pastor, Timothy.

42
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,360
 And he warns him that there will be a very difficult time

43
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,400
 in the last days.

44
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:12,320
 And I'll remind you, the last days in New Testament terms

45
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,880
 is the period of time, indefinite period of time

46
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,600
 between the first coming of Christ

47
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,560
 and the second coming of Christ, which lies in the future.

48
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,120
 So that period of time is called last days

49
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,680
 in the New Testament.

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:29,220
 And we are actually in the last chapter of human history,

51
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,080
 according to biblical timeline.

52
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,360
 So we are in the last day and Paul is not naive

53
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,420
 what is going on in our time.

54
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,160
 Remember how he characterized our time,

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,360
 dangerous and violent, and people are lovers of themselves

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:48,240
 and they slander others and have no self-control.

57
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,080
 They are haters and they hate what is good.

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,560
 And these are indeed our time, right?

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,040
 And we see right in front of our eyes,

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,100
 political violence that happened

61
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:01,320
 in the Trump Valley yesterday.

62
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,640
 It was terrifying, right?

63
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,160
 We are left speechless hearing the news

64
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,860
 and watching videos of such senseless violence.

65
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:15,840
 And my prayers go out to all those who were traumatized

66
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,040
 by this yet another incident, right, in America.

67
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,680
 And we're in Chicago, we are not foreign

68
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,800
 to those incidents, right?

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,520
 It happens almost every single day.

70
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,640
 The other day, I think a couple of days ago,

71
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,480
 I saw a news reporting.

72
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,520
 There was another gun violence happening

73
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:41,660
 not too far from us in Chinatown.

74
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:47,220
 And again, it's gun violence, it's senseless violence.

75
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,060
 What can we do, right?

76
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,060
 We ask the question, what can we do?

77
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:55,740
 It is easy for us to isolate ourselves, right?

78
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:59,220
 You know, in times of darkness, in times of uncertainty,

79
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,260
 we just wanna take care of ourselves.

80
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,820
 And it's very easy, it's very natural for us

81
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,820
 to just hide in our own comfort zone, right?

82
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:11,780
 We just do our own things, right?

83
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,660
 Make sure everything's under my control, right?

84
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:17,240
 Look what Paul is doing here.

85
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,860
 Paul in chapter three, he knows the time.

86
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,620
 He warns about it.

87
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:24,540
 And the last days will be very difficult.

88
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,060
 It's indeed very difficult for Christians, right?

89
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,100
 In America, we are relatively better, right?

90
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:35,100
 Because we have liberty, we have freedom, right?

91
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:39,620
 I've been meeting with some pastors online

92
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:45,540
 on a weekly basis in the past two plus years.

93
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:48,980
 Yeah, it's amazing to meet with pastors

94
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,000
 from the communist China.

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,060
 We have been meeting almost every single week

96
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,340
 in the last two weeks.

97
00:04:57,340 --> 00:05:01,220
 And we started toward the end of the pandemic.

98
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,880
 And we're still meeting together.

99
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,900
 When we meet together, there are a few of them,

100
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,180
 they never turn on their camera, of course.

101
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:16,180
 And there are times we share, we pray for one another.

102
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:20,680
 There are times I give some instructions.

103
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,940
 It's just amazing how long it has lasted, right?

104
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,220
 Because originally we thought that we just meet together

105
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,380
 for three months.

106
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,220
 And then it continues and continues and continues

107
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,980
 until today, right?

108
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:40,180
 So on a weekly basis, we meet together.

109
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,880
 But I'm also amazed by their faith.

110
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,900
 I'm also amazed by their faith.

111
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,620
 They cannot go open with what they learn

112
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,940
 and what they preach.

113
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:58,260
 They are often under persecution.

114
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:03,340
 In America, we are pretty easy, right?

115
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,720
 We're pretty easy.

116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,780
 We're quite comfortable.

117
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:10,780
 However, what Paul says remains true, right?

118
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,260
 Being Christian these days can be difficult, right?

119
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,780
 Being a solid Christian is very difficult

120
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:20,460
 because there's so much temptation out there.

121
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,940
 There's so much distraction out there.

122
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,180
 And Paul knows the time of last days.

123
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:27,060
 And he described the last day in vivid terms.

124
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,700
 And Paul is not naive.

125
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,140
 And we should not be naive, right?

126
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,460
 So he continues to talk about not only the dangers

127
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,660
 of not knowing God's word,

128
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:38,820
 but the benefits of knowing God's word, right?

129
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,420
 Yes, the time is difficult.

130
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:42,340
 The time is chaotic.

131
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:47,340
 We can easily be hijacked by fear and uncertainty, right?

132
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,780
 Talking to some of the friends and some of the people,

133
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,900
 we are still trying to come out of the pandemic fear, right?

134
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:59,100
 Just there's so much fear out there,

135
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,300
 so much uncertainty out there.

136
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,940
 And Paul is saying to us,

137
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,900
 remember this is a very difficult time, right?

138
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,620
 I still remember during those years in the pandemic,

139
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,820
 there was so much misinformation out there.

140
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,580
 There was so much misleading content online

141
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,700
 and conspiracy theories and sensationalism out there.

142
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:20,940
 And what happened today, yesterday,

143
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,340
 the senseless violence,

144
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,140
 immediately, the social media is flooded

145
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,140
 with all sorts of, you say,

146
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:33,300
 conspiracy theories or falsehood or something like that.

147
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:38,020
 And people just feed on those, feed on those things.

148
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:43,900
 To combat against the spread of unbelief and falsehood,

149
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:48,380
 Paul suggests two things.

150
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:51,100
 And he talked to Timothy about two things.

151
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,020
 First, he says, remember,

152
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:56,060
 you need to stand on the foundation of the Word of God,

153
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:59,100
 on truth, on biblical truth.

154
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:02,860
 And the first thing he says is to learn from good leaders.

155
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,820
 Remember the good examples in your life and follow them.

156
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,660
 And secondly, which is the last two verses, 16 and 17,

157
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,660
 he talks about the importance of scripture, Holy Scripture.

158
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:19,220
 Well, let's take a look at what Paul is talking about here.

159
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,180
 Verses 10 and following.

160
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,180
 He said, he talked about the last days,

161
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:27,860
 the difficult time in vivid terms.

162
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:30,820
 And in verse 10 and following, he said,

163
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,460
 but you, Timothy, certainly know what I teach

164
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:39,780
 and how I live and what my purpose in life is.

165
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,780
 And you know my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance.

166
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,700
 You know how much persecution and suffering I've endured.

167
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,460
 You know all about how I was persecuted

168
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,340
 in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.

169
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:00,860
 But the Lord rescued me from all of it.

170
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:03,660
 Yes, and everyone who wants to live a godly life

171
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,660
 in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.

172
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,860
 But evil people and the imposters will flourish.

173
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:14,500
 They will deceive others and will themselves be deceived.

174
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,140
 This is a dangerous time, right?

175
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,860
 But Paul is reminding Timothy,

176
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:23,660
 you have great example in front of you,

177
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,100
 and I am one of them.

178
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:29,260
 And Paul is reminding Timothy, you know my faith, right?

179
00:09:29,260 --> 00:09:32,380
 You know my patience, you have learned from me.

180
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,300
 I'm not just doing empty talks.

181
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:40,620
 I live the faith, I walk the faith, and you have seen it.

182
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,780
 Right, because Timothy has been following Paul

183
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:47,820
 in many different missionary journeys.

184
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,900
 You can check from the book of Acts, right?

185
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,940
 And Timothy follow Paul to different mission fields

186
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,180
 and different cities in the Roman world

187
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,340
 and preach the gospel.

188
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:01,060
 And it was very, very difficult

189
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,580
 because the Jews were after him

190
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,900
 and other people opposing to the gospel.

191
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,180
 And Paul endured all of this.

192
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,620
 You know, isn't it nice we have great examples

193
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,580
 of faithful followers of Christ in our life, right?

194
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:22,020
 Now I want you to do one thing, think about it.

195
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,020
 Are there any good examples

196
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:27,300
 of faithful Christians in your life?

197
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,940
 Are there any?

198
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:31,620
 You can think of something, some names, right?

199
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,300
 And you can think of some faces, right?

200
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:38,500
 And Paul is older and wiser and more experienced

201
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:43,300
 than Timothy, and Paul urges Timothy,

202
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:45,540
 follow my example, right?

203
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,700
 See my example.

204
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:52,300
 I myself have benefited so much

205
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
 from great mentors in my life.

206
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:00,180
 Remember, oh boy, it was mid-90s.

207
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:03,620
 It was mid-90s, I was in seminary.

208
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:05,980
 And I was required to do internship

209
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,700
 when I was studying in a seminary.

210
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:14,700
 And part of the credit hour has to be internship

211
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,140
 at a local church.

212
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:19,460
 And I want to tell you honestly,

213
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,940
 you know, in North America,

214
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:26,540
 the design for seminarians internship

215
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,300
 is actually not quite well designed, okay?

216
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,380
 All right, this is a trade secret, right?

217
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:37,380
 You know, in the MDiv program, for example,

218
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,220
 yes, you're required to do maybe two terms of internship,

219
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:46,220
 but it's not very solidly or well-crafted program.

220
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:52,100
 Field education, so-called, it's not really the priority.

221
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:56,740
 Most of the priority we spent our time in MDiv

222
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,980
 was in the classrooms, right?

223
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,820
 With the books, right?

224
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,340
 And most of the internship programs,

225
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,860
 yes, they're required, but the evaluation is very loose.

226
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,860
 Usually it's just pass, not pass.

227
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,460
 Pass, fail, right?

228
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:14,860
 I mean, how easy for you to pass a class, right?

229
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,540
 You just submit something, right?

230
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:20,020
 Internship report, you know, you can just make it up, right?

231
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,540
 You make it up and submit it,

232
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:25,740
 and the teacher or the professor will grade as pass, right?

233
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,420
 So it was very, very easy, right?

234
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,000
 And think about it, it's quite sad, you know?

235
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,860
 It's quite sad.

236
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,340
 You know, many of the students that I know

237
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:44,500
 did not learn so much from field education, right?

238
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:51,140
 They might learn well with exams and papers.

239
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:57,400
 They might do well in their homework.

240
00:12:57,400 --> 00:13:02,400
 However, dealing with people on the field, right?

241
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,440
 You know, we're doing church ministry, right?

242
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,440
 Church ministry, the essence is people, right?

243
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,060
 How to read people, how to understand people,

244
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:12,140
 how to relate to people,

245
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:15,820
 so often is very, very low in priority.

246
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:19,420
 Whether you can learn something solid from the field,

247
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:21,500
 from field education or internship,

248
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,260
 often the seminary student is the only one

249
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:29,680
 who is responsible, right?

250
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,300
 If he is smart enough, if he is wise enough,

251
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,180
 he will make it happen.

252
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:40,180
 If he's not so quick to learn the field education,

253
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:43,620
 then it's gonna hurt, right?

254
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,660
 It's gonna hurt.

255
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:46,520
 Notice what Paul says here.

256
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:51,020
 The emphasis is the personal pronouns, right?

257
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:55,420
 You know, not you know the faith,

258
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,420
 you know my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance, right?

259
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,820
 In the same way, speaking to all of us as Christians, right?

260
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:08,300
 We come to the church often with a mentality

261
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,180
 that is not biblical.

262
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,560
 We come to church often with a mentality

263
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:17,560
 of being a consumer, being just passive audience, right?

264
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,940
 We come here, beautiful music, right?

265
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,020
 Beautiful environment, you know, nice coffee we have,

266
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,460
 nice snack we have, and refreshment.

267
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,980
 The church is nice because, you know,

268
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:30,540
 you have great service or something like that.

269
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:36,160
 I get what I really want, and when people let us down,

270
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,040
 you know, church are full of broken people, right?

271
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:43,020
 Should I remind you that, right?

272
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,180
 We're all broken.

273
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,540
 The pastors are broken.

274
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,900
 The leaders are broken.

275
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,140
 The laymen are broken.

276
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,340
 Everyone is broken.

277
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,100
 Everyone is sinner, and we all need Christ, right?

278
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,940
 But we come in with a consumer,

279
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,240
 well, religious consumer kind of mentality.

280
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:01,340
 We will be disappointed.

281
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,460
 We can always be disappointed.

282
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:06,220
 You know, I can tell you from my experience,

283
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,460
 I'm often disappointed by other people,

284
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:13,580
 or even I'm disappointed by myself, right?

285
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:18,580
 And in some sense, with that kind of consumer mentality,

286
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,180
 we feel dissatisfied, right?

287
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:23,980
 Because we don't receive good service,

288
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,500
 like in the restaurant, right?

289
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,060
 You go to a restaurant, you don't get very good service

290
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,980
 from waiter or waitress, right?

291
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,540
 You feel upset, right?

292
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,860
 Feel upset, you feel being used,

293
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:36,180
 because you come in with the consumer,

294
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,420
 you know, customer mentality, right?

295
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,180
 Lousy waiter, lousy food and poor service, bad quality,

296
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,580
 and then give you one star, right?

297
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:49,980
 Write about it in your review, right?

298
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:53,140
 But that sort of mentality, religious consumerism,

299
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:55,160
 is unbiblical, right?

300
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,500
 It's in fact anti-biblical, right?

301
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:02,140
 On verse 14 and following, Paul said,

302
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:04,380
 "But you must remain faithful

303
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:08,140
 "to the things that you have been taught.

304
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,820
 "You know they are true,

305
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:13,080
 "for you know you can trust those who taught you.

306
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:16,340
 "You have been taught the Holy Scriptures from childhood,

307
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:20,340
 "and they have given you the wisdom to receive salvation

308
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,700
 "that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus."

309
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:27,380
 Now, Paul is encouraging Timothy to look beyond himself.

310
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,820
 Remember the first part, he said,

311
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:34,620
 "Look to me, my patience, my teaching, and my faith,"

312
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,540
 right, and follow it.

313
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,860
 And then Paul now is encouraging Timothy

314
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,340
 to persevere in difficult times.

315
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,940
 And he said, "Remember the Scripture you have been taught."

316
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,700
 And also recall something very, very important.

317
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,780
 Paul says to Timothy,

318
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:54,100
 "You have been taught the Bible from childhood," right?

319
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,980
 Since he was a little kid, since he was a baby.

320
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,300
 And Timothy, as we know from the book of Acts

321
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,620
 or from other Scriptures,

322
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:06,620
 he has a godly mother and godly grandmother, right?

323
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:10,700
 Now, we're reading chapter three of 2 Timothy,

324
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:14,180
 but early on in the first chapter,

325
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,860
 Paul actually mentioned the name

326
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,900
 of Timothy's mother and grandmother.

327
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:21,140
 In chapter one of the same letter, same book,

328
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,340
 Paul opens with these words,

329
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:28,460
 "I remember, Timothy, your genuine faith,

330
00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,660
 "for you share the faith that first filled

331
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:35,660
 "your grandmother, Lois, and your mother, Eunice.

332
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,580
 "And I know that the same faith continues strong in you."

333
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:43,220
 What is the name of Timothy's mother?

334
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,420
 Lois, right?

335
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:48,140
 And his grandmother is Eunice.

336
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,140
 So in that sense,

337
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:55,140
 Timothy is the third generation Christian, right?

338
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,180
 Paul is asking Timothy in this difficult time,

339
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:03,340
 "Look to those whom you can learn,"

340
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,900
 including Paul, the mentor himself,

341
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,900
 and also his mother and his grandmother.

342
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:16,100
 We call the examples you have seen from them, right?

343
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,940
 In other words,

344
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,620
 "Fix your eyes upon your spiritual mentors,

345
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,780
 "father, spiritual father, so-called spiritual mothers."

346
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:28,980
 Now, as a parent, this is what I'm trying to do, right?

347
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:33,620
 You know, I'm a father, and of course, I'm broken,

348
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,300
 and I am weak, I have many shortcomings.

349
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,740
 But one thing I wanna do is that,

350
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,820
 one thing I don't do at home is that

351
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,060
 I never push faith down my children's throats.

352
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:51,420
 I just never did it, you know?

353
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,260
 I never did it.

354
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:55,060
 I never preached to them.

355
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:58,020
 I remember just one time I preached to Rachel.

356
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:01,180
 Yeah, she was upset, and she refused to go to sleep.

357
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,820
 So I was kinda angry, right?

358
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,580
 So I stormed into her room, right?

359
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:08,020
 She was about maybe 10 months old, 11 months old.

360
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,180
 And I stormed into her room,

361
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,340
 and I preached a five-minute sermon.

362
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:13,100
 I said, "You cannot be selfish, okay?

363
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,940
 "Because we have to go to bed, okay?

364
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,260
 "We have to go to sleep, and you have to go to sleep."

365
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,900
 Something like that, I mentioned the name of Jesus,

366
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,900
 or something like that, right?

367
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:23,540
 But because I just went out, you know?

368
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,340
 I was in lack of sleep, you know?

369
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:27,100
 Come on, what do you want, right?

370
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,780
 So that was only one time I really just preached to her,

371
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:31,700
 right, preached to my child.

372
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:36,140
 But most of the time, I just try to live authentically

373
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,180
 as a man of faith.

374
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:42,540
 And I want to let them know I need grace as well.

375
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,460
 I need Christ to strengthen me.

376
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,860
 I need the Word of God, right?

377
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,860
 Indeed, I think that's the most important mission

378
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,020
 we have as Christian parents, right?

379
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,940
 To live in front of the eyes of my children.

380
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:08,180
 Let them know we are authentic followers of Christ.

381
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,740
 We are not perfect, but we are authentic.

382
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:15,340
 And indeed, as a Christian, we are called

383
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,180
 to live a Godly life so that our life

384
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,820
 can inspire other people.

385
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:23,980
 We can inspire other people,

386
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,540
 the building of the grace of God.

387
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:31,100
 And for ourselves, we must find great examples to follow.

388
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,060
 Remember, I asked you earlier, think of faces,

389
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,780
 think of names in your life.

390
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:40,020
 God, put those people in your life.

391
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:44,540
 Maybe a mentor, maybe a pastor, maybe a brother and sisters,

392
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,740
 maybe other followers of Christ.

393
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,620
 They have names, they have faces.

394
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:53,540
 And these are great examples that we can follow

395
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,260
 and encourage us to go on in the truth.

396
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:59,580
 And I'm sure in every church that emphasize

397
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,780
 the gospel truth, the biblical teaching,

398
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:04,820
 you will find good examples to follow, right?

399
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:07,380
 If you are tentative, if you look around,

400
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:10,380
 if you observe, you know there has to be

401
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,940
 a few good examples.

402
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,260
 Of course, in the church, there are many broken examples.

403
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:18,740
 But if you are attentive to learn and to listen to stories,

404
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,700
 to learn about the lives of people,

405
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:23,700
 you will find great people and great example to follow.

406
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:27,100
 I told you about internship in the mid-90s in my life.

407
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,460
 When I was a young intern in the church,

408
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:35,340
 I tried to pour out my heart into the community

409
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:37,580
 and try to serve the community.

410
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:42,380
 And I have met many, many good people, good mentors,

411
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:47,380
 and godly and wise and well-equipped in the word of God.

412
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,540
 And I remember one of them is the Sydney pastor

413
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,380
 at that point.

414
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,260
 You know, I was young and as you know me,

415
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:59,020
 you know, I'm quite rebellious, right?

416
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:00,260
 I like to think outside the box.

417
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,180
 I don't like to do things out of the box.

418
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:04,420
 I don't like policies.

419
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,540
 I don't like regulations, you know.

420
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
 I don't like guidelines.

421
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,940
 I'm quite rebellious.

422
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,660
 I don't like to follow rules.

423
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:12,460
 And sometimes I create my own rules.

424
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,580
 I like to try different things.

425
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,940
 But, you know, I meet with this pastor,

426
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,500
 mentor on a regular basis.

427
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:24,420
 And there was not much I remember what he preached.

428
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:30,100
 Whatever he taught or whatever great sermons he has preached,

429
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,140
 you know, I just don't remember.

430
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,140
 I remember nothing.

431
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:37,380
 But I remember I observe his life.

432
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:43,780
 How he deals with challenges and oppositions in the church.

433
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:48,740
 How he deal with all those with grace, with prayers,

434
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:52,540
 with humors, with joy.

435
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,540
 I learn so much from him.

436
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:56,980
 And today we're still good friends.

437
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,260
 We are lifelong good friends.

438
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,100
 Sometimes he call on me and sometimes I call on him.

439
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:06,780
 And he will check on me and, you know, we'll talk, right?

440
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:11,780
 But one time I bum into him and his wife in Jerusalem.

441
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,940
 I was studying in Jerusalem and just in the hotel,

442
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:18,140
 I didn't know, oh, you are here too.

443
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,460
 And we had a great time together

444
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,500
 because he was on a pastoral tour

445
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:26,260
 or a pastoral Israel trip to learn, right?

446
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,860
 And I was there to learn as well.

447
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,580
 And we were in the hotel lobby.

448
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,660
 We just talked until 2 a.m.

449
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:36,940
 Mentors like this, you know, we all need these people.

450
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,900
 And that's how we learn, right?

451
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:42,100
 You can ace in all your tests and all your exams,

452
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,740
 but you need the people skills.

453
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:47,420
 You need to learn from good examples, right?

454
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:52,700
 And in the church, in our Christian growth,

455
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,860
 it is the same way, isn't it, right?

456
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,100
 In order for us to grow spiritually,

457
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,540
 emotionally, holistically, we need other examples.

458
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,540
 And Paul is trying to encourage the young mentee, Timothy,

459
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:10,220
 not just to study scripture,

460
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,340
 but before he talks about studying scripture

461
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,460
 in verses 16 to 17, he talks about three examples,

462
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,380
 himself, Paul himself, and Lois, his mother,

463
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,100
 Eunice, his grandmother.

464
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:25,820
 And there are many, many benefits of learning

465
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:29,980
 from just real life example, right?

466
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:33,300
 And we are encouraged to continue in our faith.

467
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:37,420
 So we come to the last paragraph of this wonderful chapter,

468
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,660
 chapter three, verses 16 to 17, but we don't have time,

469
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,420
 but we'll continue next week

470
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,500
 to talk about these two wonderful verses.

471
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,860
 And this becomes the verse of the week,

472
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:55,980
 chapter three, verses 16 to 17, all right?

473
00:24:57,380 --> 00:25:00,500
 Let's recite it together to conclude our service.

474
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,740
 All scripture is breathed out by God

475
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:08,460
 and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,

476
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:10,580
 and for training in righteousness,

477
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,420
 that the man of God may be complete,

478
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:18,420
 equipped for every good work, 2 Timothy 3, 16 to 17.

479
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,740
 Let's all pray together.

480
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,260
 Father, we give thanks for all the great examples

481
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:25,060
 that we have in our life.

482
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:28,380
 Thank you for placing these people in our life journey

483
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:30,180
 so that we can learn a thing or two.

484
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:35,380
 In this lifelong faith journey of following you,

485
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,980
 we once again ask you to strengthen our faith

486
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:43,500
 so that we can take root, deep root in the Word,

487
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,300
 in the truth of the Bible.

488
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,780
 Help us to meditate on your Word,

489
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,580
 to study your Word, to dig deeper and deeper

490
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:59,580
 so that our lives will be on the firm foundation

491
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,900
 that will never move.

492
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:07,140
 Help us to be wise, wise in your Word, wise in our life.

493
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,580
 Again, thank you for all the teachers,

494
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:15,020
 all the great examples that we can follow in our lives.

495
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,820
 Help us to meditate upon them as well,

496
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:20,740
 how they deal with faith,

497
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,220
 how they deal with difficult times,

498
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:24,580
 how they deal with challenges and crises,

499
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:29,420
 how they learn wisdom, how they impart wisdom on us

500
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:32,460
 so that we will continue to follow you.

501
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,020
 Thank you for calling your people

502
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:40,740
 to be part of your kingdom, to be your sons and daughters.

503
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,940
 Thank you for your grace in Christ and pray.

504
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:46,020
 All right, God bless you.

505
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,340
 I know it's raining really, really hard out there, right?

506
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,820
 It was, no?

507
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,860
 All right, it's a difficult day to come here.

508
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,340
 And thank you for coming.

509
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:57,140
 God bless you and see you next week.
