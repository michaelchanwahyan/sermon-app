[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   Hey guys, good morning.
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.400]   I just want to show you,
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.720]   a little kid gave me a gift today
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.800]   and really surprised me
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.240]   because I wanted to have this for the longest time.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.040]   And she, after the 10 o'clock service,
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.440]   she walked to me and say,
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.880]   "Oh, you know, I have this gift for you
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.480]   "and I think you should be the best recipient for this."
[00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.320]   And it's actually this.
[00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.480]   You know what is this?
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.160]   Huh?
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.600]   You don't know?
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.240]   Okay, it's not a gift box, okay?
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.640]   It's the Ark of Covenant model, okay?
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640]   So you can see here, there are two rods here
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.160]   and there's a rectangular box
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.160]   and on top of it is the guardian of the sacred place.
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.200]   What they call?
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.720]   Cherubim, yes, right, Cherubim.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.560]   Yeah, right.
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.240]   And then inside, inside you see there's this thing.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.320]   The two tablets, right?
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.360]   Yeah, the stone tablets of the Ten Commandments
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.200]   and also the Rod of Aaron.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.180]   This is so little, so nice, so nice.
[00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.760]   I want to have this for a long time,
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.580]   but I just don't want to waste money buying it.
[00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.000]   But now I got it for free, so that's great, yeah, right?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.600]   So that's great.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.480]   It will go on my bookshelf, right?
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.800]   Let's pray for one another and I see Chee's back
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.440]   and let's welcome him.
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.280]   And he got a visa, right?
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.680]   So that's great, God answer our prayer.
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.700]   Let's pray together.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.440]   Father, we give thanks for the brothers and sisters here
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.980]   and we all have different challenges
[00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.720]   and different issues in our lives,
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.680]   but we know that you are abundant.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.920]   We know that you are always faithful to us.
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.160]   So we come and worship you.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.200]   We want to acknowledge that you have the lordship
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.680]   and sovereignty over our lives.
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.000]   And once again, we come to you and open our hearts
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.080]   and lay down all of our burden
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.380]   and even our heart before you,
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.320]   knowing that we have to trust you.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.680]   We have to continue to rely on you,
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.120]   knowing that you are our faithful God
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.320]   and guiding our steps.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.320]   Thank you for granting Chee a successful trip to Malaysia
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.640]   and come back for the successful application of the visa.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.780]   And just pray that you continue to bless this ministry,
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.860]   the youth ministry and the English ministry here.
[00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.520]   And also want to pray for one another.
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.520]   We know there's a GA general assembly next week.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.600]   Pray that you will grant our hearts
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.200]   and our church with a sense of unity.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.400]   We come to get to know the financial situation of our church
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.320]   and any other planning for our church
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.720]   and just use us and use our gifts
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.480]   and use our talents, use our resources to build your body
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.840]   so that your church will bring glory to you.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.340]   Thank you again for bringing us together
[00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.360]   even in the midst of rain
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.960]   and pray that you will teach us your truth
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.720]   and may your Holy Spirit lead us into your word.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.580]   We'll get to know you more in Christ and pray.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.500]   All right guys, today is going to be part four
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.820]   of our series on seven letters to the seven churches.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.940]   And as you remember, we have gone through
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.860]   three letters already from Ephesus, Smyrna to Pergamon.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.560]   Today is church number four, Phaetia.
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.300]   Phaetia is a little bit inland.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.740]   It's an old city.
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:43.240]   It's a prominent city of textile industry.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   So if you want to get some clothes or get some fabric,
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.740]   this is the place you go to in the ancient world,
[00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.620]   as particularly in today's Western Turkey.
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.080]   You will find linen and wool and tanners
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.600]   and trading of different kinds of textile.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.300]   In fact, this city is already mentioned in the book of Acts.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.300]   And if you remember, in Acts 16, when Paul was in Philippi,
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.260]   he met a woman called Lydia.
[00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:15.400]   Can you see that?
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.900]   Lydia is from her hometown, the city of Thyatira.
[00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.460]   And she was a pagan.
[00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.460]   She was a Gentile, kind of a God-fearer.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.980]   You know, she was attracted to Judaism at the time
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.020]   and worshiping the one and only God.
[00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.700]   And she left her home city, Thyatira, and moved to Philippi.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.740]   And there she met Paul and heard the gospel
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.900]   and respond to the message of Paul.
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:49.900]   And she became one of the first church members
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.220]   in the first century.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.060]   And by the way, if you remember,
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:57.220]   Paul was also a tent maker, right?
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:02.660]   Instead of just preaching the gospel full-time,
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:07.660]   he is also working part-time as a tent maker.
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.220]   I think he learned this trade from his hometown,
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.740]   Thessal or Thyatira, or maybe he learned it
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:19.940]   from Lydia as well.
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:24.780]   In any case, Paul was into the textile industry as well.
[00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.940]   So we come to this city called Thyatira.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.580]   As you can see, it's a Roman city at the time.
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.140]   And it's also a thriving city
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.180]   with a lot of industry going on.
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.460]   And this city has a church,
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.540]   and the house churches are receiving this letter
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.860]   from Jesus, verse 18.
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.700]   It says, "To the angel of the church in Thyatira write,
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.220]   "these are the words of the Son of God,
[00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:52.180]   "whose eyes are like blazing fire
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.560]   "and whose feet are like burnished bronze."
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.260]   Try to picture that, try to picture that.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.860]   Jesus introduced himself as the Son of God
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:05.260]   with eyes with blazing fire
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:09.060]   and with his feet like bronze, you know?
[00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.900]   He's a shining figure, right?
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.900]   And by the way, calling Son of God,
[00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.900]   today we'll understand Son of God as the divine, right?
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.940]   Someone who is fully divine.
[00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:25.780]   Of course, Jesus is the truly divine Son of God,
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.040]   and He is fully divine.
[00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.820]   However, when you mention Son of God in those days,
[00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.740]   remember, we have to read the Bible
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:35.500]   with the context in mind, right?
[00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:36.820]   In the first century context.
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.980]   When you mention Son of God,
[00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:43.980]   automatically people will think of Roman emperors, right?
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.220]   Because the Roman emperors, each of them,
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:52.220]   each of them call themselves Son of God, Son of Divine.
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.300]   And if you pick up some of the coins,
[00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.020]   I know we don't use coins anymore, right?
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.880]   Usually we don't use cash, but in those days,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:01.940]   when they use cash,
[00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.400]   when they have little coins in their pocket,
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.880]   when they do trading and buying something,
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.720]   they look at the coin,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.200]   and the coins usually have the head of the emperor,
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.100]   and on the reverse side, you will see other symbol
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:20.120]   with some of the inscription on it called Son of God.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.400]   So coins were a propaganda machine.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.160]   It was like the TV station of today,
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:33.420]   and the Roman emperor are claiming to be the Son of God.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:37.480]   But Jesus said, "I am the Son of God, not the emperor.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.200]   "I am the true Son of God."
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.480]   And his eyes are like blazing fire,
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.480]   and his feet are like bronze, shining bronze, right?
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:51.220]   All of these images actually are mentioned in chapter one,
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.400]   when Jesus showed up as the Son of God,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.520]   rose from the dead to join the disciples.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.620]   And his appearance reminds us God himself,
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.280]   because in the Old Testament, all of these phrases,
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   shining, lightning, and blazing fire,
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.680]   all of them are imageries of God showing up.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:19.440]   Now in the New Testament, God of the New Testament is Jesus.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.640]   So God of the Old and the New Testament are the same God,
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.480]   right?
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:27.560]   Jesus claiming himself to be the Son of God.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.400]   Indeed, he's the Son of God,
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   and he is with a blazing fire and a bronze color,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.720]   remind us of God himself, and he is the judge.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:44.720]   He is the supreme sovereign over the whole creation,
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:47.600]   just like God in the Old Testament.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:50.240]   So Jesus show up himself and introduce himself
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.800]   to the church in Thyatira as the Son of God
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:55.400]   with blazing fire as the righteous judge.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.600]   He said, "I know your deeds.
[00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.040]   "I know your works, your love, your faith,
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.560]   "your service, your perseverance,
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:06.940]   "that you are now doing more than you did at first."
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.180]   Is that a good church?
[00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:14.160]   I think this is a church that deserve praises, right?
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.960]   You know, this series, we ask the question,
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:20.560]   what does Christ think of his church, right?
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:23.320]   When he think of this church in Thyatira,
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.680]   he find that this church, this small community,
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:28.360]   is a Christ-honoring community
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.880]   because they have good works.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.360]   What are the good works?
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.320]   He said, "I know your deeds.
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.280]   "I know your good works."
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:37.880]   And he unpacked that.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.540]   What does it mean by showing good works?
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:46.120]   Your love, your love for God, your love for one another,
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:51.560]   and your faith, you rely on God, you trust in God,
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:55.720]   and your service, using your gifts to build up the church.
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:59.760]   And lastly, it's perseverance, your patience,
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.200]   in the midst of hardship, in the midst of difficulties,
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:04.240]   right?
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:08.240]   You know, a part of our package of following Christ
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.440]   is actually not so comfortable
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.680]   because we will encounter a lot of difficulties.
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.520]   We will encounter a lot of challenges, right?
[00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:20.920]   I'm sure you, since you are following Christ
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:24.120]   since day one, you have encountered a lot of questions
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.680]   and a lot of doubts, a lot of difficulties.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.240]   Believing Christ or relying on the Lord
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.080]   does not mean he will take away all the problems,
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.080]   but God promised himself to be your guidance.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:43.440]   God is bigger than your problems,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:45.880]   and that is testing our faith, right?
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.360]   And God, a God-honoring church is a group of people
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.160]   like us who have faith and love
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   and service and perseverance.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:11:00.160]   This is a Christ-honoring church with good works.
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.400]   And I pray and I hope that our church is like this, right?
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:06.520]   Now, it's not about size,
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.160]   it's not about how much money we have,
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.520]   but about our deeds, our good works.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:16.880]   Jesus even praised this church by saying,
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:20.520]   "You are now doing more than you did at first."
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.480]   Now, how long has this church exist?
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:25.760]   Probably for some years, right?
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:28.080]   And how long you've been the Christians?
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.160]   Probably for some years, right?
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.320]   Or for some months.
[00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:36.320]   You are doing more than you did at first,
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:41.320]   and that receives the attention of Jesus, the Lord himself.
[00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.600]   So the first point here in this letter
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:48.440]   is that a Christ-honoring church has good works,
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.800]   has good works.
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:51.160]   Do we have good works?
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.680]   Do we have good works?
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:59.120]   Our love, our faith, can we show them to other people?
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:03.200]   Our service and our perseverance, right?
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.880]   And the most important thing, I think, is number four,
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.120]   is perseverance.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.920]   In the midst of difficulties, in the midst of challenges,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.520]   we still press on, and that is the essence of faith,
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:18.520]   right, we believe that Christ is more than enough
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.120]   to help us, and His grace is sufficient.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.480]   And point number one, point number one is
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:25.800]   the church has good works,
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.200]   and that is a church that is honoring Christ.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.040]   Point number two here is that a Christ-honoring church
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:35.280]   takes the truth seriously.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:38.600]   Let's continue to read this letter.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   Now, this is a long letter,
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.240]   let me just give you a heads up.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.240]   It's a longer letter than other letters.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.160]   So a Christ-honoring church is a church with good works.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.240]   And not only that, they take the truth,
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.540]   they have to take the truth seriously.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.360]   If you take the truth seriously, then your church,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.840]   then our church, will be honoring to Christ.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.100]   Verse 20 and following.
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:05.920]   "Nevertheless, I have this against you," Jesus said.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.440]   "You tolerate that woman, Jezebel,
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:12.540]   "who calls herself a prophetess.
[00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:16.020]   "By her teachings, she misleads my servants
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:18.100]   "into sexual immorality,
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:21.760]   "and the eating of food sacrificed to idols."
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:25.080]   Now, this is a pretty stern warning, right?
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.140]   Pretty stern warning.
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.380]   It's not very comfortable words.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:30.340]   However, we have to hear this.
[00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:32.440]   We have to hear this.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:35.760]   The questions in Thyatira,
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.000]   Jesus has something against them.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.600]   And what is that?
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:43.120]   Here we see the name Jezebel.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.080]   Jezebel, who is this?
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:46.120]   Who is Jezebel?
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.360]   We call any stories about Jezebel?
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:52.940]   It's a female name, right?
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.800]   The other day, I was talking to some of the young couples,
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.040]   and they were trying to think of names for their babies.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.240]   Now, if you have a baby girl,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:05.760]   you probably won't want to name your girl Jezebel, right?
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.320]   Got a bad rap, all right?
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.000]   Very, very bad name.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Now, Jezebel was the wife of King Ahab.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.960]   Remember King Ahab in the book of Acts,
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.940]   or in the book of Kings?
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.040]   It's a bad king, right?
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.160]   If you want to name your baby boy,
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.280]   don't pick this name, Ahab, right?
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:28.440]   It's a very, very bad name, right?
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:29.280]   It's a very bad name.
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:30.100]   Why?
[00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:35.100]   Because Jezebel was originally a pagan, a Baal worshiper.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:38.680]   She worshipped Baal, and Baal, who's Baal?
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:42.400]   Baal is a storm god of Canaan.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:46.800]   If you go to Oriental Museum in University of Chicago,
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.400]   by the way, it's a very good museum,
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.280]   and they got a lot of artifacts.
[00:14:52.280 --> 00:14:53.840]   People just don't know, right?
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.800]   Just don't know Chicago has such a great museum,
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:00.240]   Oriental Museum in University of Chicago,
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.800]   and they got tons of great artifacts,
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:05.900]   especially from the Middle East.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.200]   By the way, it's free.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:10.840]   You can go and just go in and take a look,
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:12.880]   and it's free donation, all right?
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.360]   If you go to Oriental Museum,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.440]   you go to the gallery for Syria Palestine,
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:20.700]   you'll find this,
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.840]   the image in the middle,
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.840]   and that is Baal, B-A-A-L, Baal.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:31.640]   It means Lord.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.860]   Now, Baal is a storm god of Canaan.
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.020]   You know, people would have to worship
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.560]   some sort of storm god in Canaan,
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:41.320]   because if you're farmers,
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:46.320]   what you need in Canaan to survive is rain and storm.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:48.200]   Whenever rainy season comes,
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   which is usually the winter from October to March,
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.320]   those are the months you want enough rain
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:00.000]   to be rain on your farm and the land.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.840]   Otherwise, you will have famine.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.400]   You have drought.
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:07.560]   So you need to worship some kind of storm god,
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:11.420]   and in Canaan, the biggest storm god is Baal himself,
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:16.420]   and he will bring rain and storm to the land in season.
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:21.160]   You see Baal, what kind of posture he has?
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:24.820]   He has his right hand lifted up, right?
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:27.960]   You see the right hand, there's a hole in there, right?
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.120]   Now, we got, it's lost already
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:32.020]   because it's so many years ago, right?
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:38.000]   You find some of the old sites, the idol of Baal,
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   and the hole actually holds a thunderbolt, you know?
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.580]   He's a thunder god.
[00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:52.920]   He can send thunder and send rain to the land.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:57.920]   And Jezebel is a devout Baal worshiper.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.260]   And Ahab married Jezebel,
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:04.960]   and Jezebel brings in this false religion,
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:08.720]   this false god Baal into the land of Israel.
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:13.320]   That's why it was such a big deal in those days
[00:17:13.320 --> 00:17:17.660]   because Israel is supposed to worship the only one god
[00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.120]   whose name is Yahweh, right?
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120]   Whose name is Yahweh.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.800]   He is the Lord, he's the true Lord, he's the true God.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:25.920]   But Jezebel brings in a false religion
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:30.920]   and try to synchronize it, mix it with Yahweh.
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:33.320]   So Baal and Yahweh mixed together.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:36.920]   And that's why you got the story of Elijah, right?
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:39.480]   He's a true prophet and he confront the king.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:42.800]   He confront the people and lead them back to Yahweh,
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:43.920]   the true God.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.200]   In any case, Jezebel enticed the entire,
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:51.000]   the whole nation of Israel to worship Baal.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   And here in Thiatira, the same Jezebel show up, right?
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.800]   Now, of course, it's not the historical Jezebel
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.880]   in the Old Testament, but it's probably a nickname
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:09.880]   for some kind of leaders in the house churches in Thiatira.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:15.000]   And these false leaders and false prophets,
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.800]   they may be encouraging Christians to compromise their faith,
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:20.560]   to compromise their faith.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.760]   You need to understand our Christian faith
[00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:27.460]   can be compromised, right?
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:30.940]   We can do lip service to God,
[00:18:30.940 --> 00:18:35.120]   but in the bottom of our heart,
[00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:38.520]   we probably are compromising our commitment to God.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.880]   There are two things mentioned here.
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.920]   By the way, the painting on the left is Jezebel, right?
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:46.520]   Isn't she beautiful?
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:49.720]   That's why she could entice the entire nation
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.560]   to worship Baal.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.240]   The two things in this letter mentioned,
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.120]   Jesus have against the church in Thiatira.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:18:59.280]   Sexual immorality.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:03.640]   The all pagan religions in general
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.480]   are very relaxed in sexuality, in sexual life.
[00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:10.320]   All kinds of sexual activities outside the marriage covenant
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.000]   are permitted, tolerated, or if not encouraged.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.660]   So that's one thing Jesus had against the church.
[00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:22.880]   The second thing is eating of food sacrificed to idols.
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:26.520]   Now in the pagan world, in the Roman world,
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.100]   in the first century,
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.960]   you will encounter a lot of different festivals.
[00:19:31.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   So moon festivals, by the way,
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:39.200]   we just had the mid autumn festival, right?
[00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.900]   It's actually kind of a pagan festival.
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:45.640]   But in the Roman world,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:50.640]   the pagan festivals happen in pagan temples.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:53.480]   And you need some sort of membership.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:55.540]   You need some sort of association
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.280]   in order to get the benefit out of it.
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.420]   Now, what kind of benefit are being offered
[00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:03.680]   in pagan temples, in pagan festivals?
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.640]   Well, some of the benefits would be eating the meat.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.620]   You know, in the most of the Mediterranean diet
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:15.180]   are vegetarian, right?
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.240]   They don't get meat often.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:20.540]   But from time to time, they would join.
[00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.460]   You have to join some sort of temple association.
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:27.500]   And you have to come to their faith
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:29.060]   to worship their false god
[00:20:29.060 --> 00:20:32.580]   in order to get those benefits, right?
[00:20:32.580 --> 00:20:36.760]   Just like today, if you want to get good meat,
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.980]   you need to have a Costco membership, right?
[00:20:39.980 --> 00:20:42.940]   You got to pay for the membership, right?
[00:20:42.940 --> 00:20:44.460]   Well, lucky for us,
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:47.940]   Costco is just a secular warehouse, right?
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:50.260]   So it would not compromise our faith
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:52.940]   if we go to Costco today or join their membership.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:55.220]   But not so in the first century.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.260]   In the first century, Costco is a temple, right?
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.020]   You need to go to the warehouse
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:02.820]   and you have to worship some kind of pagan gods
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.420]   in order to get in.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:05.980]   You know, I have a friend in Taiwan
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:08.300]   who just visited Chicago not too long ago.
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:13.300]   And he moved from Hong Kong with his young kid,
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:17.540]   small family, moved from Hong Kong to Taiwan for some years.
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:22.060]   And we were having coffee and he shared with me
[00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:25.020]   why he stayed in Taiwan for a few years only
[00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:26.760]   and he could not tolerate anymore.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.340]   And he moved back to Hong Kong.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:34.340]   And the reality was that in the city that he lived in, Taiwan
[00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:36.940]   you know, the kids, the children,
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:40.660]   they go to elementary school, right?
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:46.580]   But from time to time, especially before their final exam,
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:50.040]   before some sort of standardized test,
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:54.500]   you know, he said the whole class of kids
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.100]   would have to go to some sort of temple next door.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:01.660]   You know, they got to worship,
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:06.500]   they got to get some lucks or some fortunes from the temple.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:10.580]   And then before they take the test, you know.
[00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:13.740]   So it's kind of very, very strange and pagan culture.
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:18.620]   And you have to pray to the gods and even small kids,
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:22.540]   you know, they grow up in that kind of environment
[00:22:22.540 --> 00:22:26.340]   and they have to pray to the pagan gods
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:30.700]   to bless their upcoming exams or whatever, right?
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.340]   So my friend said he just can't stand it anymore.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.960]   He can't stand the folk religion culture in Taiwan.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.260]   It's just too much for him.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:40.860]   So he moved away.
[00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.460]   Now that kind of environment
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.340]   is kind of like the first century environment
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.420]   where the church or the Christians
[00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.420]   attempted to compromise their faith, right?
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.920]   To go to some sort of pagan gods to get the blessing
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:59.060]   and not knowing that the true source of blessing
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:02.140]   is actually from Jesus Christ himself.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.460]   So they were being tempted to have to eat the meat
[00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.100]   and you have to get the membership,
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.500]   you have to get the association.
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:11.340]   And then the problem becomes you bury
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:15.520]   the line between Christians and pagans, right?
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.980]   You get one foot in there, right?
[00:23:18.980 --> 00:23:20.900]   Try to get some benefit.
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.620]   Now here's the key issue.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.460]   It's compromising our faith with the surrounding culture.
[00:23:26.460 --> 00:23:30.100]   Now in America, of course, our society,
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:35.100]   our culture is less religious, right?
[00:23:35.580 --> 00:23:38.720]   However, we also face another challenge, right?
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:41.480]   Secularization.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.860]   Because our society, our world is so secularized, right?
[00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.280]   And faith is being treated as something,
[00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.100]   you know, just private, just personal, right?
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.780]   You don't have to show it.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.080]   You don't have to live it.
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:24:00.300]   However, if you come to the Bible,
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.540]   biblical faith is always public.
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:07.780]   Biblical faith is always witnessing, right?
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.060]   You bear witness to other people.
[00:24:10.060 --> 00:24:13.780]   I don't care what you do for your day job.
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:16.540]   You may work in the kitchen.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:21.540]   You may work in the IT field, doing computer works,
[00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:25.820]   or you do, you know, any kind of works.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:30.280]   Your faith has to be open, has to be public.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:31.940]   That is biblical faith.
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.700]   And also, the faith in the Bible,
[00:24:34.700 --> 00:24:39.540]   if we believe in Jesus, is in essence exclusive, right?
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:43.780]   Yeah, in our environment, in our culture,
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:47.960]   we always treasure tolerance, right?
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.420]   We tolerate all kinds of views, right?
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:56.740]   But biblical faith is always down to the bottom.
[00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:58.180]   It's exclusive.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.620]   Jesus is the way.
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.980]   It's not one of the ways.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:06.620]   Jesus Christ is the way to God.
[00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:10.860]   You put your faith in Christ, you believe in Christ alone,
[00:25:10.860 --> 00:25:15.860]   and Christ has a claim for every single aspect of your life.
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:17.060]   When I first came to faith,
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.660]   one of the little book that helped me
[00:25:18.660 --> 00:25:21.460]   was "My Heart Cries Home."
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.300]   The book title is called "My Heart Cries Home."
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.820]   And it's a story about inviting Christ into your house,
[00:25:28.820 --> 00:25:29.980]   into your home.
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:33.180]   And in a lot of houses, there are different rooms, right?
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:35.820]   You got your bedroom, you got your living room,
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.920]   you got your kitchen, you got your different kinds of room,
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.100]   and even your closet.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:43.820]   And the story goes, Jesus is being invited into the house,
[00:25:43.820 --> 00:25:47.220]   and he has to have the key to every single room,
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:51.340]   because Jesus is the Lord of all, right?
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.180]   Your entertainment, Jesus is the Lord.
[00:25:55.180 --> 00:25:57.460]   Whatever you watch, right?
[00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.260]   YouTube, TikTok, or whatever.
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.620]   Christ is the Lord.
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:08.060]   Christ is going to say, "Okay, you know, you can read this.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:12.580]   "You can watch this, but you cannot watch this, right?
[00:26:12.580 --> 00:26:15.080]   "You have to follow my leadership.
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.980]   "Jesus is the Lord of everything."
[00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:23.340]   Our faith is comprehensive, right?
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:26.140]   Christ's worship should be comprehensive.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:30.180]   You cannot mix some of your past religion
[00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:33.900]   with Christianity, with biblical faith.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.120]   And again, our faith has to be public,
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.440]   has to be going outside and being open
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:44.220]   to invite other people, to see who Christ is.
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:45.380]   Remember what Jesus said,
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:49.220]   "We are the salt and the light of the world,
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:53.200]   "and we are being called to transform wherever we are."
[00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:58.880]   That little phrase has been really, really helpful for me
[00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:00.020]   since I came to faith.
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:04.960]   The phrase has to do with our relationship
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:07.880]   with the world, with the culture.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.100]   And that phrase is, is love.
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:15.820]   That phrase is in the world, but not of the world.
[00:27:15.820 --> 00:27:20.700]   We Christians are in the world.
[00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:22.900]   We're not going to isolate ourselves, right?
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:25.780]   We are living in the world,
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.160]   but we are not of the world, right?
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.980]   You're living in the world, but not of the world.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.860]   What a reminder for us.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:39.340]   And the Christians in Thyatira are being wanted,
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:43.660]   wanted not to compromise their faith.
[00:27:43.660 --> 00:27:46.580]   So number two, point number two,
[00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.300]   is a Christ-honoring church
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.300]   will take the gospel seriously.
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:56.740]   It's exclusive, it's open, it's comprehensive, right?
[00:27:56.740 --> 00:28:02.860]   Verse 21, Jesus continues His warning.
[00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.820]   He said, "I've given her Jezebel,"
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:08.240]   or some of the false teachers in the midst of the church,
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:11.440]   "given her time to repent from her immorality,
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:12.960]   "but she is unwilling.
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:15.260]   "So I will cast her on a bed of suffering,
[00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:18.900]   "and I will make those who commit adultery with her
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:23.800]   "suffer intensely unless they repent of her ways.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.020]   "I will strike her children dead.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:28.940]   "Then all the churches will know that I am He
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:31.700]   "who searches hearts and minds,
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:35.820]   "and I will repay each of you according to your deeds."
[00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:38.840]   Boy, this is very, very difficult words, right?
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:41.560]   Not very comfortable words.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:47.220]   But that's the treasure of the Bible, right?
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:49.500]   That's the treasure of the Word of God.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.420]   It's not just scratching you, you know,
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.220]   just to make you comfortable,
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:54.580]   but it's to shake you up
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:28:59.320]   so that you will live a holy life, right?
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:02.380]   Jesus said, "I've given her time."
[00:29:02.380 --> 00:29:05.380]   Those who compromise their faith,
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:09.140]   given them time to repent.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:12.300]   And use very vivid metaphor, right?
[00:29:12.300 --> 00:29:14.460]   The metaphor of adultery,
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.800]   the metaphor of sexual immorality
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   to describe the act of compromising one's faith.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.780]   And there was also warning for these consequence,
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:28.980]   and the consequence is nothing but death, right?
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:33.460]   Now, don't take these words like,
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:35.500]   okay, it's talking about child abuse.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:40.500]   No, it is using the ancient way of saying things,
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:45.900]   ancient rhetoric to wake you up, to shake you up
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:50.820]   so that you know who you really believe in, right?
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:55.540]   That's the good news of the Bible, right?
[00:29:55.540 --> 00:29:56.440]   The goodness of the Bible,
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.460]   you have to understand the bad news first,
[00:29:59.460 --> 00:30:02.620]   that we are sinners, we are up for judgment,
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:05.980]   no one can save ourselves.
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:08.900]   And that's the bad news.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:10.060]   Once we get the bad news,
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:12.420]   we understand what the good news is.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:14.940]   We have to repent and turn around
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:19.140]   and run to Jesus and we'll be saved.
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:20.820]   And that is the warning for all of us.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:25.060]   If we compromise our faith in any way, any single way,
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:28.500]   this is the time for us to repent and to return
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.660]   so that our faith can be vibrant, we can be used by God.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.860]   Otherwise, judgment is waiting at the door.
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.020]   Verse 24, let me finish this letter.
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:42.740]   "Now I say to the rest of you in Thyatira,
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.260]   to you who do not hold to the teaching of Jezebel
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.580]   and have not learned the way of Satan,
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.580]   the so-called deep secrets,
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:57.380]   I will not impose any other burden on you."
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.060]   Hey, that's a good news.
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.460]   Some of the people in Thyatira,
[00:31:00.460 --> 00:31:03.820]   some of the Christians are standing firm in their faith.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.580]   They're being solid in their commitment
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:07.860]   and they don't buy the teaching of Jezebel,
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.780]   the so-called secret, right?
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:12.900]   There's nothing secret about it.
[00:31:12.900 --> 00:31:14.380]   It's actually satanic.
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:17.740]   And Jesus is encouraging them,
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:23.180]   the rest of you who do not hold to the false teaching,
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.740]   I will not impose any other burden on you.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.340]   I will give you strength.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:33.340]   25, "Only hold on to what you have until I come.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.220]   To him who overcomes and does my will to the end,
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.100]   I will give authority over the nations.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:43.740]   He will rule them with the iron scepter.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.180]   He will dash them to pieces like pottery,
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:50.900]   just as I have received authority from my Father."
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.980]   Now this is from Psalm 2.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:54.860]   Remember Psalm 2 is a royal psalm
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.620]   that talks about God has chosen his son,
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.540]   his king on earth to rule the nations for him.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:04.980]   And that promised son is kind of like David
[00:32:04.980 --> 00:32:06.500]   and finally being fulfilled
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:08.700]   in the person and work of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.580]   So Jesus is quoting that psalm that applies to him.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:14.420]   He will rule them with iron scepter.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:16.700]   He will dash the nations,
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:19.740]   the rebellious nation in judgment,
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:24.060]   like breaking them into pieces like pottery
[00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:28.420]   because that is the comprehensive authority
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.420]   of Jesus Christ himself.
[00:32:30.420 --> 00:32:32.700]   If he does not have that kind of authority,
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:34.460]   he is not Christ.
[00:32:34.460 --> 00:32:36.140]   He is not the true God.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.420]   He is not the true Lord,
[00:32:37.420 --> 00:32:41.580]   but he indeed has that kind of authority over everything,
[00:32:41.580 --> 00:32:45.380]   over all nations, over every single aspect of your life.
[00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.220]   And that's why we have to turn to him
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.700]   and worship him alone.
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:54.140]   28, "I will give him the morning star.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:56.260]   He who has an ear,
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:58.820]   let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:01.900]   The morning star, right?
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:07.380]   It's kind of a symbol for divine status.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:09.580]   You know, the highest status
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.420]   is to receive that kind of morning star.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.900]   And that is also from the Old Testament.
[00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:19.140]   Simply put, if you overcome,
[00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:22.860]   if you continue to believe in Jesus and follow him,
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.020]   if you listen to his word,
[00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:28.940]   Jesus has promised you the morning star.
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:34.260]   You will shine like morning star in the sky,
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.860]   in the dark sky.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:39.860]   And that is the status of authority
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.020]   and status of dignity.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:46.500]   And that is the promise to encourage each and every one of us
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.020]   to continue and not to compromise,
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:51.540]   to stand solidly in our faith,
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:53.620]   to hold on to our faith,
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:54.780]   hold on to the gospel.
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:01.780]   Now, there are ways to avoid spiritual compromise.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:07.620]   Let me end with some of the points here, all right?
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:10.780]   How do we avoid compromising our faith?
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.580]   Number one, well, first of all,
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:17.940]   you have to identify your weakness,
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:22.140]   your shortcoming, where you have to compromise.
[00:34:22.140 --> 00:34:25.620]   So first step is to identify.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:28.220]   You have to know your situation.
[00:34:28.220 --> 00:34:30.180]   There are some environments,
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:31.660]   there are some situations,
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:34.580]   some places that we put ourselves in
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.500]   that will lead us into compromise.
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.860]   We have to identify it, right?
[00:34:39.860 --> 00:34:42.700]   Bring it to the open, you know?
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.740]   Tell other people to pray for you, right?
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:49.740]   To identify the situation where you are often being tempted.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:52.700]   And second is to repent.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:55.780]   Confess our sin, right?
[00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:59.700]   Ask God for mercy, and He's always there.
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.620]   He's always there.
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:03.660]   Confess our sin.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:07.780]   And number three is set boundaries.
[00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:14.060]   That means having the courage to walk away from temptations,
[00:35:14.060 --> 00:35:18.060]   walk away from places that will lead us
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:20.300]   into compromising our faith, our commitment.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:25.820]   Number four is to renew our spirit and our mind.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.660]   Now, there's no shortcut here.
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:32.140]   To renew our mind, to renew our spiritual life
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.540]   so that our spiritual life will be vibrant,
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:35.980]   there's no shortcut.
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:37.740]   We need much prayers.
[00:35:37.740 --> 00:35:39.300]   We need to continue to pray.
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:42.300]   For us, stick to our prayer life,
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.700]   pray consistently, and reading the Word of God, you know?
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.780]   Immerse ourselves in the Word of God.
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:52.100]   Knowing the Word of God is a daily habit.
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:52.940]   There's no shortcut.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.820]   We have to build this kind of habit, right?
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.940]   So that our spiritual life can be strong.
[00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:01.780]   And also, we have to plug into the community.
[00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:07.780]   No one can be a Christian alone, by himself or by herself.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.980]   We need other people, right?
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.260]   We need to serve other people,
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:13.540]   and other people have to encourage us
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.980]   and to keep us accountable, right?
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:20.060]   These are the ways that we can avoid spiritual compromising.
[00:36:20.060 --> 00:36:26.020]   Let's close with a short word of prayer.
[00:36:26.020 --> 00:36:29.540]   We're gonna pray to God,
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:32.900]   asking Jesus at this point,
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:37.300]   hey, are there any places, you know,
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.340]   I find myself compromising my commitment?
[00:36:40.340 --> 00:36:43.220]   Confess our sin.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:49.540]   And ask God for the courage and the strength to walk away,
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.420]   and to renew our spirit,
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:56.500]   so that we can truly, truly worship God.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.740]   Let's all pray together.
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.660]   (soft piano music)
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:19.900]   Father, listen to our prayer.
[00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.540]   Tell us the good news.
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.780]   So, though we are broken,
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.180]   although we are sinful,
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:32.380]   but you are there.
[00:37:32.380 --> 00:37:37.100]   Thank you for what you have done for us in Jesus.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.580]   Come before you, we pray that you will remind us.
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.260]   Shine a light into our hearts, any dark corners.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:47.380]   That we do have some places
[00:37:47.380 --> 00:37:50.420]   that we compromise our commitment to you.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.860]   And I pray, and I pray that as I confess our sins,
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:37:59.860]   you'll cleanse us.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:05.580]   Because you are righteous, you are holy,
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:06.860]   and you are full of grace.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:11.060]   Father, cleanse each and every one of us.
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:14.220]   Cleanse our heart and our mind.
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:17.100]   Renew our spirit,
[00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:20.820]   knowing that you are full of love and full of grace.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:22.100]   That's why we run to you.
[00:38:22.100 --> 00:38:27.660]   As we confess our sin, you will grant us forgiveness.
[00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:29.020]   Yes, indeed, you will.
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:32.380]   Thank you for your forgiveness,
[00:38:32.380 --> 00:38:34.940]   and thank you for your acceptance.
[00:38:34.940 --> 00:38:37.780]   I pray that you will renew our spiritual life,
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:40.940]   so that we will not continue to be weak.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:44.420]   We'll be strong because of your grace.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:47.340]   We'll be solid in our commitment because of your grace.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.300]   Renew our mind and our lives,
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.220]   so that we can follow you wholeheartedly.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:56.660]   Can worship you and call you our Lord and our Savior.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:57.900]   And you'll lead our life.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.420]   Let your comprehensive lordship over us.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.100]   We surrender our life.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:10.420]   Help us and cleanse us and renew our lives,
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.580]   so that we can be used by you.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.980]   May our faith be open.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:16.740]   May our faith be inviting other people
[00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:20.740]   to enjoy your presence, to come to taste your grace.
[00:39:20.740 --> 00:39:27.140]   May your Holy Spirit be with us as your church.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:30.580]   And we are a community that is totally,
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.820]   totally committed to you,
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:35.780]   to serve you and to honor and to worship you.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.900]   Thank you for listening our prayer.
[00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:41.260]   Thank you for your everlasting grace.
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:44.980]   Again, we come to worship you and we love you.
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:48.300]   Thank you very much for being our loving
[00:39:48.300 --> 00:39:49.340]   and gracious Father.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:52.940]   In Christ name we pray.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:59.860]   Well, once again, we are very blessed to have you,
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.540]   and have your presence and to worship together.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:05.300]   And today we're gonna have Bible study
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:08.580]   and we're gonna have a quick lunch, right?
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:11.820]   No, Patrick, he's already outside and prepare.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:13.580]   Is it taco today?
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:16.220]   Yeah, we have a taco lunch, all right?
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:21.220]   And then after the lunch, we will speak to two groups,
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:23.380]   Chinese group and English speaking groups,
[00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:26.100]   and we'll continue to dig into the Word of God, right?
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.140]   We will continue our study on the Book of Romans,
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.060]   and chapter one and two.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:34.580]   And I tell you, we have to understand these two chapters.
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:37.300]   The good news of Jesus Christ
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:39.220]   come from these two chapters, all right?
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.820]   So stay with us, all right?
