1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,740
 - Hey guys, let's turn to the Bible

2
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,740
 and we will start a mini series called Way of Wisdom.

3
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:09,960
 Way of Wisdom.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,280
 Okay, so my first question for you is that

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,920
 when you think of wisdom or being wise,

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,920
 what does it mean?

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,000
 What does it mean to be wise?

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,720
 What does it mean to have wisdom?

9
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,960
 And who can you think of someone,

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,960
 a name, a face, someone who is a wise person?

11
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,040
 Can you think of anyone like that in your life?

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,200
 Someone who is wise, someone who has,

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,480
 you know, embodied wisdom in their life?

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:50,360
 Now, does wisdom, does wisdom mean intelligence?

15
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,340
 Just intelligence?

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:59,840
 Or, you know, you get a 4.0 GPA, straight A student.

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,280
 Does it mean you have wisdom?

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,800
 Can your paycheck number on your paycheck

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,280
 will tell you whether you have wisdom or not?

20
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,340
 Some of the questions we need to ask,

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,980
 what does it mean to have wisdom?

22
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:20,380
 Especially in our generation, you know,

23
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:24,200
 you listen to all sorts of different discourses out there,

24
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,320
 political discourse, public discourse,

25
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:32,320
 private conversations or conversations in our relationships.

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,660
 Can we pick up some wisdom?

27
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,040
 You know, this generation, we need wisdom.

28
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,040
 Especially men, all right?

29
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,800
 I know I'm old school, but, you know,

30
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,240
 we need to embody wisdom.

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,040
 What does it mean to live a life of wisdom,

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,480
 a way of wisdom?

33
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:52,840
 Many years ago, maybe I'm dating now,

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,840
 many, many years ago, back in the 90s,

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,000
 back in the 90s, you know, as I told you, I'm getting old.

36
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,640
 Back in the 90s, there was a new label or new topic

37
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,280
 that everyone was talking about, mid 90s.

38
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,240
 Emotional intelligence, emotional intelligence.

39
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,120
 That was a term, emotional intelligence

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,000
 or emotional quotient, EQ,

41
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,720
 coined by a scholar named Daniel Goldman.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,640
 And he published his studies

43
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
 because he followed some of the best students

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,360
 out of Harvard, out of MIT,

45
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,760
 followed their career path

46
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
 and followed how they managed their life.

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,080
 And he finds that many of those people have just high IQ,

48
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,200
 does not mean they live successfully,

49
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,000
 does not mean they work with wisdom,

50
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,440
 does not mean they manage their life

51
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,960
 and their career successfully or wisely.

52
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:03,960
 So he publishes his work called "Emotional Intelligence,"

53
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,320
 "Emotional Intelligence,"

54
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,680
 and the subtitle of the book says it all.

55
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:11,720
 So the main title of the book is "Emotional Intelligence."

56
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:16,720
 The subtitle is "Why It Can Matter More Than IQ."

57
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:21,800
 So why EQ matters more than IQ?

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,800
 So in his study,

59
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:28,160
 he finds that there were five essentials for human life.

60
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,800
 How we manage our life,

61
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,920
 how we manage our life in the sense

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,200
 that we will be so-called successful.

63
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,680
 So he named five essential elements of EQ.

64
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,680
 First, listen up, first, is self-awareness, self-awareness,

65
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:47,400
 self-awareness, that's the first thing.

66
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,520
 Second, self-regulation,

67
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,080
 how you regulate yourself,

68
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,000
 you know, how you discipline yourself.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,940
 Number three, motivation,

70
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:03,460
 how you have motivation at work, in life in general.

71
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,380
 Number four, empathy, empathy,

72
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,760
 how you relate to other people,

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,320
 how you make other people feel,

74
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,520
 how you connect with other people, empathy.

75
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,800
 Number five is social skills,

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,320
 how you relate to one another,

77
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,080
 you know, how you build friendship,

78
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,800
 you know, trust between people.

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,680
 So number one, five elements of EQ,

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,760
 Daniel Coleman said, the first one is what?

81
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,080
 Self-awareness, self-awareness,

82
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,720
 that you are aware of your problem,

83
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,240
 you're aware of who you are

84
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:48,960
 and you know how to carry yourself, self-awareness.

85
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,200
 Second is self-regulation, how you discipline yourself,

86
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,560
 how you live your life, regulate your time.

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,000
 Number three is motivation,

88
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,120
 you find yourself getting motivated this morning

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,780
 when you get up, so tired,

90
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,760
 what's wrong with you?

91
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,760
 There's something wrong with us.

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,340
 Self-motivation, number three.

93
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,340
 Four, empathy, right, empathy.

94
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:18,000
 Number five, social skills.

95
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,740
 These five, he says, is the five big things

96
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:28,900
 to manage your life, so-called emotional intelligence.

97
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,040
 So it doesn't have to do with IQ,

98
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,760
 whether you get a PhD or get a professional degree

99
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,980
 or you are very, very educated, it's all here, right?

100
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,340
 The most important things that Coleman said

101
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,260
 is your emotional intelligence.

102
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:49,700
 Speaking of that, that is pretty much similar

103
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:52,100
 to what the Bible has to say about wisdom.

104
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:55,220
 Now the Bible says a lot about wisdom.

105
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,540
 If you want to be a wise person,

106
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:02,540
 if you want to be a wise, for me, being a wise father,

107
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:08,720
 wise husband, spouse, wise friend,

108
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:14,160
 worker, neighbor, all of this,

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,880
 the Bible has a lot to say about wisdom.

110
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,960
 Has a lot to say about how we live our life wisely.

111
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:24,480
 You know, when the Bible uses the term wisdom,

112
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,920
 it usually means that something related to practical skills.

113
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,680
 Practical skills.

114
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,680
 You are skillful in certain things.

115
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,160
 That means you are wise in certain things.

116
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:41,720
 So Exodus 36, there were a couple of verses,

117
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,440
 it says there were a couple of people,

118
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:49,440
 Pastor Al and Oholiab, Oholiab,

119
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,360
 anyways, how you pronounce it,

120
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,240
 it doesn't matter, it's Hebrew, anyway.

121
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,840
 Oholiab, and every skill-wise person

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,000
 to whom the Lord has given skill and ability

123
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
 to know how to carry out all the work

124
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,920
 constructing the sanctuary, the tabernacle,

125
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:09,920
 to do the work just as the Lord has commanded.

126
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,300
 Now, what's going on here?

127
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:14,600
 The Israelites were in wilderness,

128
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,200
 and God said, "You guys need to build a home for me

129
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,880
 "so I can dwell among you, I can live among you."

130
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,740
 And that is tabernacle, or translated sanctuary here.

131
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:30,400
 It's a portable temple so that God will lead his people

132
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,760
 in the midst of them, living in the midst of them,

133
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,820
 walking in the midst of them, to relate to them.

134
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:37,680
 So it has to do with worship,

135
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,240
 it has to do with relating to God in the wilderness.

136
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,740
 And so the sanctuary has to be built,

137
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,080
 and the tabernacle has to be built.

138
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
 You know, tabernacle has different items,

139
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 different furniture items, like manure,

140
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,320
 and the show table, and the fabric,

141
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,520
 the poles, and all of this stuff,

142
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,920
 those are practical things that you need

143
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:02,600
 to set up the temple, the portable temple tabernacle,

144
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,060
 in the midst.

145
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,900
 So God has chosen some of the people here

146
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:12,900
 who are wise, skilled in certain things.

147
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,280
 So probably they can do metalworking,

148
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:19,680
 they can do carpentry,

149
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:25,280
 so that they can set up the right, proper worship among them.

150
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,560
 So God needs wise people to build his church, right,

151
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,360
 to build his presence, to build up the tabernacle

152
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,220
 in those days when the Israelites were in the wilderness.

153
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:40,600
 So the Bible has a lot to say about wisdom.

154
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,760
 And one of the books in the Bible

155
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:45,440
 that has to do with wisdom,

156
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,900
 has a lot to do with wisdom, is the book of Proverbs,

157
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,340
 found in the middle of the Bible.

158
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,300
 And I wanna emphasize something,

159
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:57,320
 that when we read again this book,

160
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:01,220
 we try to understand what the world is like in this book.

161
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:05,420
 Now, if you read the book from verse one to the last verse,

162
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,800
 there are 31 chapters,

163
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,340
 you find that there is some sort of world structure

164
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,420
 presented by the book.

165
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,500
 And you find something really clear in this book,

166
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,960
 in the book of Proverbs,

167
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:24,280
 is that there is some sort of moral structure,

168
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,340
 some sort of spiritual structure in this world.

169
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,240
 In general, what it means is you do something,

170
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,620
 and then there's consequence.

171
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,980
 Your actions always have consequences.

172
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:43,460
 If you do good, in general, you will receive reward.

173
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:47,540
 If you do badly, then you will be penalized,

174
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,100
 you will suffer.

175
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,680
 So this is kind of the general truth, it's not always true.

176
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,700
 It's not universal truth, it's not promises.

177
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,020
 But in the book of Proverbs,

178
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:02,180
 you find a lot of this has to do with the order

179
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:05,180
 of the universe that God has arranged,

180
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:08,500
 so that in this moral order, in this spiritual order,

181
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,820
 we have to behave in a certain way.

182
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,760
 Give you an example here, chapter 11, verses 24 to 25.

183
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,760
 It says, "A man gives freely, yet gains even more.

184
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,100
 "And other men withholds."

185
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:27,660
 Doesn't want to give, but comes to poverty.

186
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,900
 25, "A generous man, alive,

187
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,460
 "living in generosity, will prosper.

188
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:39,320
 "He who refreshes others, give away for others,

189
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,220
 "and help others, will himself be refreshed."

190
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:46,700
 You see the cause and effect here.

191
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:49,460
 The spiritual order, or the cosmic order,

192
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:52,280
 if you honor God with your wealth, you will increase.

193
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,020
 Even your heart will increase.

194
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,060
 You will get a sense of satisfaction.

195
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,500
 You will feel good.

196
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,100
 If you give freely to others, to bless other people,

197
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,700
 you, yourself, will be blessed.

198
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,740
 If you serve other people, it's not because

199
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,580
 you're giving up all the time.

200
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:18,340
 You will get something back, and your life will be blessed.

201
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,740
 So that is the world of Proverbs.

202
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:25,180
 There is always consequence in the order.

203
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:27,800
 Just like law of gravity.

204
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:32,700
 You drop something, it will break.

205
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,860
 You have a glass of water, you drop it on the floor,

206
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,780
 on the ground, it will break.

207
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,060
 The glass will shatter.

208
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,740
 That's consequence to our actions.

209
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,420
 So that's what the life of wisdom is.

210
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,640
 So the book of Proverbs is encouraging us

211
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,640
 to observe the moral universe and the spiritual order

212
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:58,340
 that God has set up in our world,

213
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:02,460
 so that we can live accordingly to those principles.

214
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:05,960
 Now, one of my favorite passages

215
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,560
 in the book of Proverbs is this.

216
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,940
 Let me read that first.

217
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,780
 Chapter 24.

218
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:17,000
 Now, here the wise teacher,

219
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,060
 the wise man, like the teacher in the book of Proverbs,

220
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:26,280
 he did something, and then he observed something,

221
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:28,100
 and then from his observation,

222
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,260
 he gets some spiritual principles out of it.

223
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,980
 He said, "I went past the field of this lucker,

224
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,860
 "past the vineyard of the man who lacks judgment.

225
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:44,240
 "Thorns had come up everywhere,

226
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:47,720
 "and the ground was covered with weeds,

227
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,860
 "and stone walls was in ruin."

228
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:56,340
 Now, look what the wise is doing.

229
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,340
 He opened his eyes, and he observed

230
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,820
 what is going on in the world.

231
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:06,900
 He passed through a farm of a lazy person,

232
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,940
 a lazy farmer, sluggard,

233
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:13,180
 because he does not do anything to the farm.

234
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:15,300
 He does not put in his effort

235
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,280
 to cultivate the ground, the soil.

236
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,120
 So he passed through, and he observed.

237
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,380
 He observed something because of his lack of judgment,

238
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,920
 because the farmer is being lazy,

239
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,820
 he's not doing his work,

240
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,240
 and then you got weeds,

241
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,240
 and you got all sorts of problems for your soil,

242
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,360
 and your farm is in ruin,

243
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,300
 and stone wall is also in ruin.

244
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,960
 Now, what he observes here

245
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:45,160
 is that there is some sort of arrangement

246
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,700
 in this world.

247
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:50,060
 There's some sort of spiritual order in this world.

248
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,800
 If you do something, there's consequence.

249
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,520
 If you don't do something you're supposed to do,

250
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:58,420
 there's also consequence.

251
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:02,580
 If you're lazy, you're not putting effort in your life,

252
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,900
 in your farm, in this case,

253
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,580
 you know, there's always true

254
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,500
 that your farm will go into ruin.

255
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,180
 Your house, your stone wall,

256
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,800
 they will always fall.

257
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,660
 You know, the wall of stones,

258
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,960
 you stack stones and bricks on top of it

259
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,460
 so that it will protect you.

260
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,560
 If you don't maintain it,

261
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,800
 if you don't put in energy,

262
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:29,620
 if you're not being proactive,

263
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,420
 the bricks or the stones,

264
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,460
 they will inevitably fall.

265
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,840
 Okay?

266
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:42,280
 The fallen stone will not go back to the wall

267
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,320
 unless you pick it up and put it back on.

268
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,840
 But if you do not maintain your life,

269
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:49,720
 if you don't maintain your stone wall,

270
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:52,400
 the stone will drop.

271
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,900
 Law of gravity, right?

272
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,720
 Well, it doesn't take Newton to understand it.

273
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:02,720
 So the wise is trying to help us to observe

274
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,600
 the life of the lazy person.

275
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,700
 I mean, look at your bedroom.

276
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,400
 If you don't put energy to it,

277
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,860
 look at your house,

278
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,420
 it will be in chaos.

279
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,120
 There's always a cause and effect in this world.

280
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,860
 And what the wise is trying to understand is,

281
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:25,760
 again, it's the spiritual order of things.

282
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:28,300
 Life will always deteriorate.

283
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,260
 Life always deteriorate.

284
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,660
 And life naturally descends into chaos.

285
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:39,300
 Just like stone wall will fail.

286
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,600
 It will fall.

287
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:43,100
 Now, what he observed is that

288
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,780
 once you have order,

289
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:48,140
 stone wall, your farm, good soil,

290
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,180
 order in your house,

291
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:53,280
 it will eventually lead to disorder.

292
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:56,920
 Order always goes to disorder.

293
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:01,520
 Order always goes to chaos.

294
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:06,480
 It will never happen naturally from chaos to order.

295
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:11,660
 It always happens that order goes to disorder.

296
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,560
 Unless you put energy into your life

297
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,800
 and put things back to order.

298
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,840
 Repair the broken wall.

299
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,420
 Pick up the stone and bricks,

300
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,100
 put it back on the wall.

301
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,500
 You see?

302
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,980
 32.

303
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,940
 Verse 32, he says,

304
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,660
 "I apply my heart to what I observe

305
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:35,920
 "and learn a lesson from what I saw.

306
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,800
 "A little sleep, a little slumber,

307
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,220
 "a little folding of hands to rest.

308
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,820
 "Poverty will come on you like a bandit,

309
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:50,540
 "and scarcity like an armed soldier.

310
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,800
 "You will be attacked."

311
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,680
 You know?

312
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,320
 I don't know if you understand it

313
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,620
 or if you can observe or agree with the wise.

314
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,520
 Our life is always going to the direction of chaos.

315
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,340
 Unless we're proactive enough

316
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:14,080
 and we are active enough to make corrections,

317
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:14,920
 to maintain it.

318
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,300
 Your finance.

319
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,920
 If you just have money sit there,

320
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,320
 you don't do anything about it,

321
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:28,040
 it will always be devalued, right?

322
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,660
 Your house, your bedroom,

323
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:33,880
 your schedule,

324
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,600
 your calendar.

325
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,360
 If you don't do anything, folding of hands,

326
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,720
 if you're lazy, if you don't observe and you don't learn,

327
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,520
 it will always go to chaos.

328
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,840
 Anyone remember when you were in college,

329
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,380
 you learn second law of thermodynamics?

330
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,380
 Ring any bell?

331
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:56,240
 Second law of thermodynamics?

332
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,360
 Okay, no, right?

333
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,820
 So you guys didn't go to chemistry class.

334
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:05,320
 Second law of thermodynamics says in this universe,

335
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,920
 things always go to chaos, right?

336
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,180
 The entropy in our lives always increases.

337
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,820
 Unless you put energy into it and correct it

338
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:17,400
 and bring it back to order.

339
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,320
 That's what the wise is trying to teach us.

340
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,480
 Now, as you can tell from the book of Proverbs,

341
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,320
 it's not like a prophetical books.

342
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,120
 It's not like other books in the Bible.

343
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,400
 Like the prophets, the prophets will come to you

344
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,760
 and say directly, this is what the Lord has said.

345
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,160
 Thus says the Lord, you have to do this,

346
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,640
 thou shall do this or thou shall not do this.

347
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,280
 It's a direct command.

348
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,760
 But the wise in the book of Proverbs

349
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,000
 is that he uses his observation,

350
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:50,280
 he'll open his eyes and observe other people,

351
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,720
 observe life in general, and then learn something.

352
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,880
 So it's not from top down, it's from bottom up.

353
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,140
 That's what wisdom will take you.

354
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:03,220
 Observe your spiritual life.

355
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,540
 Now, I've been a Christian for decades.

356
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:12,360
 If I just being lazy and I don't care

357
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,280
 about my relationship with God,

358
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,800
 things will always go to chaos.

359
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:23,080
 You have less strength to withstand temptations.

360
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,080
 You have less faith, less confidence to withstand issues,

361
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,360
 to deal with difficulties in your life.

362
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,960
 It is always harder to worship God

363
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:40,780
 unless you train yourself and strengthen yourself.

364
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,880
 It's kind of a physical exercise, right?

365
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,840
 How many of you can do a seven minute plank?

366
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:50,020
 How many of you can do it?

367
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:54,400
 Probably only a few people can do it, right?

368
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,560
 Well, how come people can do a longer plank?

369
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,180
 Because they train themselves.

370
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:04,320
 They strengthen themselves so that the muscles are going

371
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,380
 so that they can do what they want to do.

372
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,840
 Our spiritual muscle always needs work.

373
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,800
 You go to the gym, you train yourself,

374
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,800
 you fight against chaos,

375
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:22,400
 you try to tame the chaos in your life.

376
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:26,760
 Every single morning, you try to deal with all this disorder

377
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,680
 in your work, in your relationship, in your marriage,

378
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:33,320
 in your family, in your neighborhood.

379
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:37,700
 You always try to rely on God and you train yourself

380
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:42,040
 so that your life can withstand trials and temptations.

381
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:46,520
 They will come at you whether you ask for it or not.

382
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:48,480
 Difficulties, challenges, issues

383
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,360
 will always come to threaten your life

384
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,440
 and will pull you apart and separate you from God.

385
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,760
 So every single morning, you have to have the motivation

386
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:02,880
 to fight the chaos, be a man,

387
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:07,240
 put in energy and put things back to order.

388
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,800
 So after the sermon, you probably need to go back home,

389
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,240
 put things back to order, right?

390
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,040
 So long you're just folding your hand

391
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,680
 and you don't care much.

392
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:22,080
 After the sermon, you go back to your life,

393
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,200
 your personal life, you know, read the Bible,

394
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,240
 read the Word of God, just meditate on the Word of God.

395
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,120
 Unless you do that, you don't have the Word of God,

396
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,120
 you don't have the strength of God inside of you.

397
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,600
 And then you will be defeated

398
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,600
 because chaos will take over.

399
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,480
 Unless you do that, what the wise is trying to do

400
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,200
 and understand if we fold our hands to rest,

401
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,240
 poverty, spiritual poverty will come upon you.

402
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,140
 And that is your responsibility.

403
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:56,480
 That's not the church's responsibility.

404
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,080
 That's not your mentors' responsibility.

405
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:00,240
 That is your role.

406
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,360
 You need to take charge.

407
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:06,000
 You need to take leadership.

408
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,680
 That is the way of wisdom.

409
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,940
 Now there's one big question I always meditate on

410
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:17,560
 is that many of these wise sayings

411
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,080
 are from someone called Solomon.

412
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,740
 Solomon has the reputation of being the wisest king

413
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,700
 of all the earth.

414
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:32,140
 You remember that, the book of Kings,

415
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:34,580
 when Solomon was being introduced?

416
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:37,280
 He was so wise and he has the wisdom

417
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:41,540
 to bring righteous judgment to his people.

418
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,840
 He can rule his kingdom with righteousness and justice.

419
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,540
 There's so many sayings that come from King Solomon,

420
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:56,160
 but I don't know why Solomon failed at the end.

421
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:00,740
 He failed miserably at the end.

422
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,460
 Yeah, he had the glory,

423
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,660
 but at the end of the last chapter of his life,

424
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,300
 everything just spiraled into chaos

425
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:11,000
 and the kingdom is gone, is in ruin.

426
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,000
 And the nation of Israel was divided into north and south.

427
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:21,660
 How did that happen to the wisest king on earth?

428
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:27,620
 And then one day I was searching some of the Proverbs,

429
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:30,580
 some of the passages, and I find this really interesting.

430
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:36,000
 And it's really, really a great reminder for all of us.

431
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,860
 Why did the wisest person, the wisest king, Solomon,

432
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:41,580
 fail at the end?

433
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:44,300
 1927.

434
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,980
 Proverbs 1927.

435
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,440
 Stop listening to instruction, my son.

436
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,540
 You will stray.

437
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:59,600
 Not you may stray, not possibly you will stray,

438
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:04,440
 but you will definitely stray from the words of knowledge,

439
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,100
 the knowledge of God, the knowledge,

440
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,560
 the wisdom to walk in the way of God.

441
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,880
 Stop listening.

442
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,440
 One day you find yourself, you check yourself,

443
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,060
 check your heart.

444
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:20,300
 Dude, I don't need to listen to this.

445
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,400
 Dude, I don't need to study this.

446
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,900
 I don't need to find out and learn something more

447
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,660
 from the word of God.

448
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:32,060
 You stop right there, you stop listening to instructions,

449
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,020
 spiritual instruction, my son,

450
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:37,780
 you will definitely stray away.

451
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:40,700
 Now I have seen a lot of Christians in my life

452
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,520
 who did just that.

453
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,220
 When they were younger, happier,

454
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,580
 and they were really, really solid in their faith.

455
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:56,920
 But I just scratching my head, what is going on with them?

456
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,940
 What is going on with them?

457
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,740
 There has to be something wrong.

458
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,700
 And you just hear the person complain about this and that,

459
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,900
 this and that, you know?

460
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:12,880
 But this verse says, there's a heart issue here.

461
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:17,020
 There's something deep inside, it's the inner issue.

462
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:20,660
 Inner issue of stop listening.

463
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:25,660
 And the Bible says it, adultery.

464
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,560
 Because you always listen to someone.

465
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:32,200
 If you don't listen to God, you listen to the counterfeit God,

466
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:38,240
 the false gods, the culture, the world, or even yourself.

467
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,040
 And you deceive yourself.

468
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:43,400
 And then you spiral down into spiritual chaos

469
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,800
 because of this.

470
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:49,800
 You stop listening, my son, you will definitely stray.

471
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:54,320
 You will go astray from spiritual knowledge.

472
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,840
 What a reminder to all of us.

473
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,160
 I remember in the beginning of this year, in January,

474
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:04,720
 I preached on a series called Atomic Wisdom.

475
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,560
 Remember that?

476
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,840
 Remember that?

477
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,900
 It's been so long.

478
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,800
 It's not that long, guys, it's not that long.

479
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,000
 It's just a few months ago.

480
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,780
 I preached on this series, Atomic Wisdom,

481
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:23,780
 and we went into the Bible and we said,

482
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,960
 there are small atomic habits

483
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,920
 that will bring you huge effect if you do that.

484
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:36,440
 Just a little bit small good habit,

485
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,840
 it will bring you fruitful life.

486
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:42,940
 And I just wanna remind you and challenge you,

487
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,900
 since the beginning of this year,

488
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,060
 what has changed in your habits?

489
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:50,020
 What has changed in your life?

490
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:55,100
 Are there any small habits or good habits

491
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,780
 you have already built up?

492
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,400
 The foundation of small habits go a long way, guys.

493
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,700
 And what's standing in the way,

494
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:09,200
 sometimes we say, is life is too busy.

495
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,620
 Indeed, life is very busy.

496
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,460
 Who is not busy here?

497
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,660
 Everyone is busy.

498
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,620
 So often we say, because life is too busy.

499
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,780
 Come on, God, just give me a break, all right?

500
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,840
 When I have a vacation, then I'll read the Bible.

501
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,120
 When I have spare time, dude, I'll read the Bible.

502
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,940
 Now, sometimes we say that to ourselves

503
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,500
 because we wanna deceive ourselves.

504
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,820
 We say, life is busy because, no,

505
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:39,820
 this guy's reading the Bible more because he has more time.

506
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:42,060
 I have less time.

507
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:47,260
 But seriously, it's just self-deception.

508
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,840
 Everyone here has 24 hours a day.

509
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,780
 We say that as an excuse, but deep down,

510
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:59,320
 it's probably pride.

511
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:03,100
 Probably we are too proud of ourselves.

512
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,320
 You know what pride is?

513
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,640
 Pride is not being mean.

514
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,280
 Pride is self-satisfaction.

515
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:14,900
 I'm all good by myself.

516
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,780
 I don't need the other voice

517
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,740
 to tell me what to do.

518
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,140
 I don't need God to tell me what to do.

519
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:21,980
 I don't need God to define me.

520
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,500
 I don't need God to tell me what to do

521
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,780
 and how do I see myself, my identity,

522
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,060
 and my future, everything else.

523
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:29,880
 I don't need God.

524
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,720
 I don't want to learn.

525
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,380
 I don't want Him in my life.

526
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,460
 The most important thing is me.

527
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,380
 The most important thing, the defining factor of my life

528
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:41,500
 is just me and now.

529
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,760
 And that is pride in the Bible.

530
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,260
 That is stop listening to instruction.

531
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,620
 Stop having other people to speak into my life.

532
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,980
 I just shut down, you know.

533
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,580
 I just, please shut up, guys.

534
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,740
 You know, I don't need to listen to you.

535
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,700
 Please shut up, God.

536
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:59,820
 I don't need to listen to you.

537
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:03,500
 And that is the way of foolishness

538
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:09,400
 because you will stray from the word of spiritual knowledge.

539
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,020
 I don't care what you did in the past,

540
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,640
 but if you stop listening, then you will go astray.

541
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,040
 Chapter 9, verse 10.

542
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:24,000
 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

543
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,520
 Knowledge of the Holy One is understanding.

544
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,240
 You see the parallel here?

545
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,600
 The fear of the Lord, the proper relationship with our God,

546
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,660
 the fear of the Lord is parallel

547
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:37,240
 with knowledge of the Holy One.

548
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,680
 Fear of the Lord, knowing how to fear God

549
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,260
 is to know God.

550
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:46,900
 To know God means to fear Him,

551
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:51,300
 to understand who He is and relate to Him properly.

552
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,880
 And aren't we blessed that we have Jesus Christ

553
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,480
 in our lives?

554
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:01,320
 It's in Jesus and in Christ that we are related to God,

555
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:04,360
 restore our relationship with God properly,

556
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:08,120
 that God is our creator, God is our Father,

557
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,280
 and we are His sons and daughters.

558
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:12,880
 We are His people.

559
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,160
 That's how we know God.

560
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,760
 But here the why says, the fear of the Lord

561
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,400
 and the knowledge of the Lord is the same.

562
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:23,520
 And that is the foundation of your life.

563
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:28,740
 That is the foundation of your house

564
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,200
 that you have to build on.

565
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,960
 And you keep on listening to God,

566
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,840
 keep on being open to God,

567
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,960
 because God is actively doing something in your life.

568
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:44,100
 The problem is we don't feel like God is doing something

569
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,060
 because we stop listening to Him.

570
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:49,840
 We just close down.

571
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,640
 So a final reminder is that, you know,

572
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:56,880
 today is October.

573
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,780
 Oh my goodness.

574
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,160
 This year is almost over.

575
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,000
 But it's never too late.

576
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
 It's never too late.

577
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,000
 If we're willing to fear God,

578
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,840
 if we're willing to know Him, to relate to Him,

579
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,440
 God will bless you.

580
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:16,140
 So I want to remind you to read the Bible.

581
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,860
 Read the Word of God every day.

582
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,520
 There's one very wise suggestion

583
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,600
 to how to read the Bible

584
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,340
 if you don't know how to begin with,

585
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,360
 or you haven't been reading the Word of God

586
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,000
 for a long, long time.

587
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,440
 There's one good suggestion,

588
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,880
 is to take the book of Proverbs,

589
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,760
 because there are 31 chapters in the book,

590
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,720
 and you read one chapter a day.

591
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,560
 Go home and read it.

592
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:47,480
 And it's not just reading the Bible,

593
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,520
 it's to pray to Him.

594
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:55,460
 To pray and to be open what God is doing in your life.

595
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:58,520
 What is God doing in your life?

596
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:01,760
 What does God want you to do?

597
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:05,220
 Pray for other people.

598
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,800
 Maybe there are some friends that we need to pray for them.

599
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,820
 Church ministry, we need to pray for.

600
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:14,840
 And the growth of the church, we need your prayers.

601
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,160
 We need to pray for the church.

602
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,880
 It's not just, I want this, I need this, I want this, God.

603
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,080
 Give it to me, give it to me.

604
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,720
 If you don't give it to me, you're not God anymore.

605
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,680
 This is not worshiping, this is not fear of the Lord,

606
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:32,240
 this is using God in the name of God for your sake.

607
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,960
 And that is pride.

608
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:34,940
 That is idolatry.

609
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,640
 Read the Bible, pray to God.

610
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:41,980
 Now observe the time of worship

611
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:45,200
 because this is probably the entire week

612
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,560
 you can just sit down and be open to God,

613
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:52,740
 open your heart and listen to what He is saying to you.

614
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:56,680
 And you listen and obey.

615
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,940
 As we close, why don't we pray together?

616
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:05,580
 (pages rustling)

617
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:11,260
 Probably we have forgotten God, but let's pray.

618
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:12,920
 God is full of grace.

619
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:16,820
 God is always there to knock on our doors,

620
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:19,780
 to welcome us into His presence.

621
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:29,080
 Hey, Father, dear God, thank you for being our God.

622
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,120
 (gentle piano music)

623
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,820
 Help us to come before you now.

624
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:40,080
 Open our hearts and our mind, our lives,

625
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,460
 so that we don't,

626
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:48,000
 we are not occupied with ourself, our ego.

627
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,520
 But God, let us know, let me know

628
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,680
 what I need to get rid of in my life

629
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,480
 so that I can put my life back to order.

630
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,880
 My spiritual relationship with you,

631
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,580
 my relationship with other people,

632
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:08,960
 to learn how to fear you,

633
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,720
 to learn to listen to your voice.

634
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,520
 And God, thank you for being our loving Father,

635
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:20,320
 even though we are weak

636
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,520
 and we have so many shortcomings,

637
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,380
 yet you are here to embrace us.

638
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:29,480
 You are here to accept us in Jesus Christ.

639
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:35,560
 Thank you for being our loving Father,

640
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:39,100
 always waiting for us to return.

641
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,800
 So we come before you as the Spirit

642
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:49,180
 to help us, to help our hearts to return to you,

643
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:52,100
 to enjoy our time with you,

644
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,840
 to cultivate our relationship,

645
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,880
 the fear of the Lord in our life,

646
00:34:56,880 --> 00:35:02,260
 to allot time in our busy schedule

647
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:05,760
 to relate to you,

648
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:13,320
 and pray, we just pray that your Spirit will renew,

649
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,580
 renew our faith.

650
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:18,120
 Help us to have the strength to deal

651
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:20,220
 with all the chaos in our lives,

652
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,960
 the disorders in our lives.

653
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:27,500
 Yes, we are of little faith, but help us, God.

654
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,700
 And thank you for being our God, always there.

655
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,460
 Help us to grow spiritually, help us to grow mentally,

656
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,680
 help us to grow emotionally,

657
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,580
 so that we walk in the way of wisdom.

658
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:47,580
 This is our prayer, and I pray that in this coming week,

659
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,040
 you will be with us, strengthen us, carry us through,

660
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:56,000
 and help us to continuously to rely on you,

661
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,800
 to pray to you, and to worship you,

662
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,600
 knowing that you are our strength and you are our rock.

663
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,920
 You never abandon us,

664
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,820
 and nothing will separate us from the love of Christ.

665
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,920
 Thank you for being our Father, our God.

666
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,920
 In Christ, we pray.

667
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,440
 Well, God bless you all,

668
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,600
 and we have some refreshment outside,

669
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,160
 and please enjoy some time of fellowship together.

670
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,500
 Make sure we spend this time together

671
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:24,600
 to get to know each other.

672
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,040
 I know there are some friends here, some new friends here.

673
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,040
 Welcome, and we wanna get to know you,

674
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,920
 and please get to know us as well.

675
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:36,200
 So yeah, God bless you, and I wanna see you next Sunday,

676
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,460
 and we continue to serve God and worship Him.
