[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   All right, all right guys,
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:03.880]   today I would like to meditate with you
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.960]   a very important subject, very important message,
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.120]   very important theme in the Bible.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.200]   In fact, if in the Old Testament,
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.480]   if you take the New Testament away, the Old Testament,
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:16.440]   this is the most important passage of all.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.960]   It's the passage of 10 Commandments.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.280]   All right, I wanna do this because
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.400]   this is the end of the year,
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   and we'll linger into this passage next Sunday as well.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.880]   Next Sunday will be 2025, right?
[00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.960]   And this is a very, very important subject
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.760]   for us to meditate on, especially at the end of the year.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.600]   And why?
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.040]   Because this is the 10 Commandments.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:45.120]   The 10 Commandments has been known as the most important
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.120]   and most influential document of probably in the West,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.200]   at least in the West, in the Western civilization.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.840]   That is the, probably one can say
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.480]   is the moral and ethical foundation of all mankind
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.680]   that God has given to us.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.600]   That is the 10 Commandments.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.560]   And the series is titled,
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.400]   New Principles for New People,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.040]   and it's taken from Exodus 20.
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.640]   So in the entire Old Testament,
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.400]   if you have to remember a biblical reference, all right,
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.440]   from which book and from which chapter,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.600]   probably you have to memorize this, Exodus 20.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.640]   Exodus 20.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.760]   And that's where you found one of the versions,
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.160]   one of two versions of 10 Commandments.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.980]   The other version you can find is Deuteronomy 5,
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.020]   but you can memorize in your head, in your brain,
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.500]   memorize this is Exodus 20.
[00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.280]   Now, when we look at the New Commandment,
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.200]   the 10 Commandments, oftentimes the word commandment
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.960]   carries some sort of negative connotation, right?
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.560]   You believe in Christ and you're a Christian
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.200]   and you're a follower of God,
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.440]   and then you heard a lot of about commandments.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.440]   And commandment has a very restrictive sense to it, right?
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.720]   Because when we hear a commandment,
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.520]   this is commanded for you,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.080]   and you be commanded to do something,
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.480]   and not to do something.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.920]   So often it sounds very restrictive
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.880]   because it's kind of like, you know,
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.100]   boxing in our freedom, our choices.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.480]   But, you know, if you turn to the Bible,
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.880]   especially the Old Testament,
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.040]   how the Bible described this document
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.540]   of what we call now 10 Commandments,
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.880]   it's not even using the term commandment
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.260]   in the Hebrew scripture.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.840]   It's using terms like 10 words.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.600]   And that's why we get the translation,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.400]   dekala, dekala, dekala, 10, right?
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.800]   Logos, 10 words.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.960]   Or one can describe the 10 Commandments
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.200]   not so much as the restrictive sense
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.360]   of the word commandment mean.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.360]   We should describe it as constitution.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.520]   Just like in the United States,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.700]   we have the constitution, we have the document.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.600]   It's not legal code.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.480]   It's not something that attorney would go to
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.840]   and then find out which code to prosecute someone
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.760]   or to make sure someone is in line
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.800]   or prosecuting a crime or something like that.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.000]   So it's not legal code, it's a constitution.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.960]   The constitution has a general sense of being principles,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.200]   all right, being living principle or the big principles.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.480]   And that's why this series is called
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.820]   New Principles for New People, for new people.
[00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.760]   Now, these are big principles.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.520]   Larger principles or higher level principles
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.800]   for the new people of God.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:00.680]   And these principles are like the United States Constitution.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.080]   Those terms and the amendments and all those statements
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.760]   are general guiding principles so that you can apply those
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.080]   to a specific situation or context.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.080]   So we have to remember,
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.200]   it's not so much of commanding you to do this
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.840]   or that or not that or do this or that.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.820]   It's not a list of things to do or things don't do.
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:30.240]   It's 10 words or 10 things,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.000]   10 principles for the people of God.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.700]   And because this is a very familiar passage, I hope, right?
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.840]   I hope to read this passage
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.880]   from the beginning to the end.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.880]   There are 17 verses for the 10 commandments or 10 words.
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:52.960]   Okay, let me read this through first.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.800]   Exodus 20, "And God spoke all these words,
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.260]   "I am the Lord your God who brought you out of Egypt,
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.840]   "out of the land of slavery.
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.140]   "You shall have no other gods before me.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:11.900]   "You shall not make for yourself an idol
[00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.960]   "in the form of anything in heaven above
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:15.680]   "or on the earth beneath,
[00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.540]   "or in the waters below.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.460]   "You shall not bow down to them or worship them.
[00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.740]   "For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God,
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.540]   "punishing the children of the sin of their fathers
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.180]   "to be the third and fourth generation
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.340]   "of those who hate me,
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.200]   "but showing love to a thousand generations
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.240]   "of those who love me and keep my commandments.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.380]   "You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God,
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.160]   "for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.460]   "who misuses his name.
[00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.940]   "Remember the seventh day by keeping holy.
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.000]   "Seven days you shall labor and do all your work.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.920]   "But the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord your God.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.980]   "On it you shall not do any work,
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:06.700]   "neither you nor your son or daughter,
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.700]   "nor your manservant or maidservant,
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.140]   "nor your animals,
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.060]   "nor the alien within your gates.
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.860]   "For in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth,
[00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:22.040]   "the sea and all that is in them.
[00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:25.060]   "But he rested on the seventh day.
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:28.080]   "Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.460]   "and made it holy.
[00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.980]   "Honor your father and your mother
[00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:33.820]   "so that you may live long in the land
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.980]   "the Lord your God is giving you.
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.020]   "You shall not murder.
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:40.100]   "You shall not commit adultery.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.720]   "You shall not steal.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:45.440]   "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.780]   "You shall not covet your neighbor's house.
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.080]   "You shall not covet your neighbor's wife
[00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.520]   "or his manservant or maidservant,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.380]   "his ox or donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.420]   There's 70 verses, 10 commandments.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.820]   Have you heard of it?
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:04.380]   Yeah, you have heard of it, right?
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.020]   Have you got it memorized?
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.660]   All 10 commandments?
[00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:10.900]   Well, those are 10 words, right?
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.900]   Those are 10 big principles for the people of God.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.380]   Now, you have to understand at the time of Exodus,
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:19.500]   at the time of Moses,
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.260]   now Moses got this 10 commandments on the mountain
[00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:24.420]   called Mount Sinai.
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:27.100]   Now what happened before they got
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.300]   the so-called download from the cloud,
[00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.340]   download from the cloud,
[00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.060]   the 10 words from the top of Mount Sinai,
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.460]   beforehand, what happened to them?
[00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.600]   It was Moses called by God to lead the Israelites
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.220]   out of the land of slavery, out of land of Egypt.
[00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:49.540]   And they have been oppressed for a hundred years.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:51.900]   And God saved them by grace.
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.380]   And through the, well,
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:59.500]   they walked through dry ground,
[00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.420]   crossing the Red Sea,
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.380]   and then through the wilderness,
[00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:07.160]   and they finally come to the most important mountain
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.060]   in the Bible, which is Mount Sinai or Mount Horeb.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:14.900]   Now they are at the foot of mountain,
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:18.340]   and Moses went up to the mountain top of Mount Sinai
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:21.900]   and download the 10 commandments in two tablets.
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:24.020]   And now they are new people of God.
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.740]   The Israelites were saved by God, saved by grace.
[00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.580]   Saved by grace.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.020]   It's not because God looking down in Egypt
[00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:34.480]   and find that the Israelites are behaving well.
[00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:37.180]   So God decided, okay, I'm going to save you guys.
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:39.800]   No, they were sinners.
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.940]   They were in the land of slavery.
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:45.760]   They did nothing to merit the salvation of God.
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.720]   And God saved them because God is faithful to them.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:51.340]   So God saved them totally by grace.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.100]   And now they are being led to the foothill
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.960]   of the Mount Sinai.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:01.080]   And they are now the new people of God and the new nation
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.900]   and living under new principles.
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.120]   So they have this new identity.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.280]   That's why the 10 commandments are given to them.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.600]   The 10 words, the 10 principles,
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.040]   so that they will live as the new people of God.
[00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:15.240]   This is a totally different people
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:17.720]   from all the other peoples on the earth.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:19.940]   Now at the time of Moses, different nations
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.960]   and different kingdoms will make covenant,
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:25.640]   will make agreement with other people.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   And so often these international agreement or covenant
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.940]   between nations, between kingdoms for diplomacy.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.120]   Like kingdom A will make agreement with kingdom B.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:44.060]   It's kind of like the United States
[00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:46.660]   has different diplomatic relations
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.780]   with other countries, right?
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:53.780]   Canada is one of our friendly ally.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.460]   UK or EU is our ally.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.420]   And all those things are actually happening
[00:10:01.420 --> 00:10:03.320]   in the time of Moses as well.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.160]   So in the ancient world, when nations come
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.420]   under some sort of relation, some sort of diplomacy,
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.280]   the relationship, political relationship
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.880]   or arrangement with each other,
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:16.480]   they will have a document to spell out the details,
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.340]   to spell out the terms or the laws between them.
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.880]   Especially when a bigger king, a greater king,
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.080]   will make agreement with a smaller kingdom,
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.360]   with the smaller king.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.300]   And the great king will lay out all the details
[00:10:33.300 --> 00:10:35.220]   and all the terms.
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.660]   What we call now is the Suceran Treaty,
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.180]   Suceran Covenant.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.580]   Now I know that's a big word, but just bear with me.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:45.860]   It's just a political arrangement
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:49.220]   between a great king and a lesser king.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:54.060]   In the time of Moses, that's how they do diplomacy,
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.940]   international relation.
[00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:57.660]   What we call now is Suceran Treaty.
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.720]   Suceran meaning the sovereign, right?
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.080]   The bigger king.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.560]   And he will lay out all the terms
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.580]   and all of this documents and agreements between nations
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.580]   in the time of Moses, about 1500 BC or 1200 BC,
[00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:18.360]   they will follow a similar format.
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   And a similar format are pretty much right here I outline.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.280]   Usually those documents, Suceran Treaty,
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.560]   will begin with introduction.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.200]   The introduction of the great king.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:34.200]   So the great king will introduce himself as I am so and so.
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.660]   I am so and so king of Hittite.
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:38.680]   I'm making a covenant,
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:41.720]   I'm making a Suceran Treaty with a smaller king.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.600]   Or I am the great king of Egypt,
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.640]   great king of other land.
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:48.960]   And he will introduce himself a little bit,
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.680]   and then he will come to the second element,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.680]   which is the history, or what we call historical prologue.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:58.320]   What it does is that the great king
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.880]   will recite some of the historical relation
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:03.960]   with the lesser kingdom,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.520]   and how he has protected them,
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.740]   how he has guaranteed their security,
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:12.440]   how he has bussed the smaller nation.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:15.440]   And it will detail some of the historical events
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:22.480]   that happened before between the big kingdom
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:24.040]   and the smaller kingdom.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.460]   And that's the second element.
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.240]   The third element after the introduction of the great king
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:32.400]   and the historical prologue is the laws.
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:35.960]   The laws or regulations, or the stipulations.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:40.080]   And those are kind of the thou shall do this
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:43.120]   or thou shall do not, all right?
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.240]   Thou shall not or thou shall.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.040]   You should do this and you should do that,
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:50.840]   and you should not do this or that.
[00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:54.760]   Things like you have to be faithful to me.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.020]   So the great king will say to the lesser king and say,
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.060]   "Hey, because I have protected you
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:03.080]   "in the history of your nation,
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:05.520]   "I've been blessing you guys,
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:08.020]   "and that's why you guys need to be loyal to me,
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:10.700]   "and you need to pledge allegiance to me."
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:12.260]   Those are the laws.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.540]   And then number four, the fourth element,
[00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:16.660]   is the succession element.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:21.660]   Succession element meaning when the document is draft,
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:24.300]   when the covenant is agreed upon,
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:27.040]   the lesser kingdom and the greater kingdom
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.620]   will agree to continue the agreement.
[00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.920]   Kind of like the end of the year,
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.580]   you have to sign some sort of document
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.940]   to renew your insurance policy,
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:40.060]   to renew your relation with somebody else.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.460]   Those are what we call succession elements.
[00:13:44.460 --> 00:13:47.600]   And that's number four.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.540]   Number five is calling upon all kinds of witnesses
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:55.500]   to draft the document, to finalize the document.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:59.140]   They will call upon the gods or goddesses
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:04.140]   to witness the event of coming into relations
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.260]   with each other between the two nations.
[00:14:07.260 --> 00:14:09.500]   And then finally, there will be a section
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:13.020]   called blessing and curse.
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.820]   And what those are statements that will say,
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:19.700]   "If you are faithful to me,
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.760]   "then you will enjoy this blessing.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:23.940]   "You will enjoy my presence.
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:27.120]   "If you are disloyal to me,
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.600]   "if you rebel against me, then there will be curses.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   "The greater king will threaten the lesser kingdom,
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:36.820]   "the lesser kingdom, and will say,
[00:14:36.820 --> 00:14:38.360]   "if you are disloyal to me,
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.900]   "then I will send my army and destroy you."
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.580]   And all sorts of things.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:47.220]   So those are very, very long section,
[00:14:47.220 --> 00:14:49.700]   and with a lot of different statements saying,
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:53.420]   "You will be blessed if you do be faithful to me.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.740]   "You will be cursed if you rebel against me."
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:01.500]   Now, if you can kind of read through these elements,
[00:15:01.500 --> 00:15:03.440]   one, two, three, four, five, six,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:07.260]   and then you compare these six elements
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.680]   with the biblical documents,
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.960]   especially the first five books of Moses,
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:16.220]   you will find these elements in different places.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.820]   Like the introduction, you will find the passage
[00:15:20.820 --> 00:15:23.100]   which is read, the very beginning,
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:26.600]   which is the introduction of the great king
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:29.020]   being Yahweh himself, right?
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.300]   The true God who saved Israel out of the land of slavery.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.420]   And that's number two.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:40.540]   Versus chapter 20, verse 2b.
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:42.660]   That is the history, right?
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.580]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.020]   I have saved you out of the land of oppression.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.060]   And then number three, element number three,
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.980]   are those laws, what we call 10 commandments.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.380]   You shall have no other God before me.
[00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:59.140]   And all that, one, two, three, four, five, up to 10.
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:00.420]   10 words.
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:03.020]   And then there are also some sort of elements
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.860]   of secession, right?
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.860]   Deuteronomy 31, it talks about, you know,
[00:16:08.860 --> 00:16:12.700]   you guys need to be, the Israelites need to be
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.200]   continuously faithful to God.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:17.220]   And then not only in this generation,
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.280]   but the next generation, not only you,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.420]   but your children and your children's children.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.080]   You guys need to be faithful to me
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.740]   and you have to recite this document again and again,
[00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:29.820]   again and again to renew your faithfulness again and again.
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:33.700]   And then there's also in Deuteronomy 30, witnesses.
[00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.660]   And because, you know, in the biblical religion,
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:39.080]   there's only one true God, right?
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.340]   And all the other gods are false gods.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.140]   And they cannot be witnesses.
[00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:46.660]   So in Deuteronomy 30, being called upon to witness
[00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:51.660]   the event of the covenant is heaven and earth.
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.500]   It's the entire cosmos.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:59.460]   So the creation is witnessing this foundational moment
[00:16:59.460 --> 00:17:04.460]   that God and his people enter into a treaty, a covenant.
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.700]   And then of course, in different chapters
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.740]   in the five book for Moses,
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:13.640]   there were so many sections on blessing and curses.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:16.460]   And those are statements that says,
[00:17:16.460 --> 00:17:19.120]   if you are faithful, then I will be faithful to you.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.360]   If you are not faithful, then you go into exile.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:27.260]   Now, having revealed the format
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:29.500]   of the 10 Commandment document,
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.020]   and we now come to the point that we need to understand
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:35.580]   not only the draft documents
[00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:38.100]   according to the format of the day,
[00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:42.860]   but they also practice it in such a way
[00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.620]   that will align with the practice
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.880]   of the nations coming into covenant.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:50.740]   Say for example, two nations,
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:53.180]   and they formalize the covenant,
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:56.180]   they will inscribe the terms of the covenant
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:58.500]   on stone tablets.
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.460]   So the 10 Commandments,
[00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:02.140]   that's why we have the two tablets, right?
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:06.060]   Inscribe on stone tablets, something that is permanent.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.860]   So God and Moses, when they talk about,
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.740]   agree upon the treaty terms,
[00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:18.440]   the terms will be inscribed on stone tablets.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.860]   So that's why God told Moses,
[00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:25.180]   hey, you come to the top of the Mount Sinai
[00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:29.420]   and bring two copies of the stone tablets.
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:32.700]   And what they did is align with other nations
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.860]   when they come into a diplomatic relationship,
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.660]   because they will bring two tablets
[00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.360]   and then inscribe their international covenant
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:45.760]   on the tablet, and then one copy for me,
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.540]   and one copy for you.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.900]   And then you're gonna bring your copy,
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.440]   the stone tablet with all the terms of the covenant,
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.700]   you bring it to your capital,
[00:18:54.700 --> 00:18:58.380]   and in your capital, usually there is the biggest temple,
[00:18:58.380 --> 00:19:02.300]   and you put it in the holy place of your biggest temple.
[00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:04.940]   And I will do the same thing.
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:08.020]   And that's why there were two exact copies
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.260]   being made in the covenant-making moment.
[00:19:11.260 --> 00:19:17.420]   So often the modern impression is that
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:18.260]   there are two tablets,
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.740]   and one tablet is for Commandment 1 to 5,
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:25.740]   the second tablet has Commandments 6 to 10.
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:28.980]   We thought, you know, maybe one tablet is not enough,
[00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:34.180]   you need another copy to write the rest of the commandments.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.900]   No, that is not the way.
[00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:39.780]   That is our modern misinterpretation.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:42.060]   The right interpretation should be
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:45.180]   two tablets of exact copies,
[00:19:45.180 --> 00:19:47.540]   and one for you and one for me.
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.460]   And that's why in the Israelite temple,
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.440]   which is Tabernacle in the wilderness,
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.820]   and then later on in the capital city, Jerusalem,
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.740]   the stone temple, in the holy place,
[00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:02.700]   there is a copy of the stone tablet.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.180]   That is for the nation of Israel,
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:07.460]   for the new people of God.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:10.060]   So they put the tablet, put the covenant
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.260]   in the very holy place, the most holy place of the temple.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:16.460]   And then God, of course, Yahweh himself,
[00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:20.140]   he's the true God, and he has only one temple to go to,
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.140]   right, which is the earthly copy of the heavenly temple
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.980]   in Jerusalem or in the wilderness in the Tabernacle.
[00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:32.980]   So he also put the tablet, God's tablet, in the same place.
[00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.260]   And that's why in the nation of Israel,
[00:20:37.260 --> 00:20:41.940]   in the Tabernacle or in the Jerusalem temple,
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:45.700]   you will find two exact copies in the most holy place.
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.100]   So having said that, we need to understand
[00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:52.520]   when God gave the 10 commandments,
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:54.680]   when God gave the constitution,
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.120]   it was the climax moment of the entire Bible.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:05.020]   So the laws of God were not for the purpose of restriction,
[00:21:05.020 --> 00:21:09.040]   but it is a way for the people of God being saved by grace
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:12.600]   to respond with thanksgiving.
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.920]   So the 10 commandments are being given,
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:18.860]   not so much as you shall not do that, you shall do this.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.120]   It's not so much of a list of do's and don'ts,
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:24.760]   but statement of grace.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:28.580]   So when the people first heard about the 10 commandments,
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:32.500]   they would have responded with thanksgiving
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:37.500]   because God saved me, saved us out of the land of slavery,
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:41.000]   land of sin and land of death and oppression.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.960]   God saved us by grace.
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:48.880]   So in some other tradition, like the Jewish tradition,
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:53.000]   the first commandment actually is not starting
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.840]   from verse three, which is thou shall have
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:21:57.000]   no other God before me.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.480]   In the Jewish tradition, the first statement
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:04.360]   of the 10 words, the first word of the 10 words
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.920]   is actually verses one and two.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.260]   To be exact, it's verse two.
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:14.120]   It says, I am the Lord your God, I'm Yahweh your God,
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:18.120]   who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:23.080]   Now it's not so much of do this or don't do that, right?
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:26.200]   It's not even moral code.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:29.040]   It is a statement of grace.
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:33.200]   I have saved you, I brought you out of Egypt by grace.
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.960]   And now you are free and you come under me
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:39.240]   and I am your true God.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.240]   I am your new Lord, no longer Pharaoh being your God,
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.160]   your Lord, Yahweh is your Lord.
[00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:53.480]   So the Lord are given as a way of telling the people
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.160]   that you need to be thankful, right?
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:59.640]   Now as a Christian for many years,
[00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:05.640]   I've always reminded how God has saved me out of grace,
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.280]   right?
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.360]   He has saved me by grace.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:13.880]   And that is the foundation of my relationship with God.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:16.840]   And so your relationship with God as well.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.440]   So often we messed up.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.480]   We think what we do or what we don't do
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.960]   will count us as the people of God,
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:25.680]   as a follower of Christ Jesus.
[00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:30.120]   No, the foundational truth for spiritual life
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.120]   is that God has saved you by grace.
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.360]   It's not because what you have done.
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:40.600]   It's because God has done something wonderful in your life.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:44.520]   And that's why you receive the new principles
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.640]   to live as someone else, with a new identity
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.640]   as the children of God, as a son and daughter of God,
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.160]   as a follower of Christ.
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:55.640]   I have a new principle in my life to live differently.
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.240]   So I manage my time, I manage my life differently.
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.520]   I manage my family differently.
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:03.400]   I treat my children differently.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.280]   I treat my job differently.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.120]   I treat everything God has provided for me differently.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.440]   It's a totally different principle.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.600]   With that in mind, we come to the so-called first commandment.
[00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:21.160]   You shall have no other gods before me.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.880]   Now in the ancient world, there were many gods.
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.760]   It's polytheistic.
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:30.000]   And all the gods, interestingly, are territorial.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.840]   All the gods are territorial.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:36.960]   It's kind of like our Chinese or Asian religious tradition,
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:39.200]   the Eastern religious tradition.
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:41.400]   Different gods have different realms.
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:43.040]   Different gods have different territories,
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:44.840]   different areas that they rule.
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:50.560]   It is also true in the ancient world of Israel.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.480]   In the Bible, one god, one force god is the storm god.
[00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.240]   Another god is the sun god.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.360]   Another god is the moon god.
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:02.640]   And they have their own territory.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.560]   And the statement here,
[00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:10.440]   you shall have no other gods before me.
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:15.640]   What is new here is the word actually before me.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:20.600]   Yahweh said, the true God said, there's no God before me.
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.120]   You shall have no God before me.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.720]   The emphasis is actually on before.
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:27.480]   It's in my face.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.560]   Literally, it means in my presence, in my face.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.240]   And that means the God of Bible is all present.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.000]   He is everywhere.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.480]   He's everywhere.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.920]   And you cannot hide from him.
[00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:40.840]   You cannot hide from him.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.520]   You cannot say, oh, I don't go to church,
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:43.720]   so I hide from God.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.280]   You know, God cannot see me.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.520]   You know, I don't wanna show up in the church
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.560]   because I don't wanna see God.
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.040]   I don't wanna have God see me.
[00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:52.160]   No.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:55.360]   It says, no other gods before me.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:00.360]   So the entire universe is filled with the presence of God.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   Everywhere in the universe is before God.
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:07.000]   So here is a monotheistic statement.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.120]   Says that one God only.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.320]   He is the one and true God.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.000]   He's not territorial
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.080]   because your entire life is under his surveillance.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:20.680]   Your entire life, every single moment,
[00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:25.480]   every single aspect of your life is before God.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.320]   So commandment number one says,
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.240]   you shall have no other God before him.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:31.560]   Before the true God.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:37.400]   Number two, you shall not make for yourself an idol
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:40.240]   in form of anything in heaven above
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:44.080]   or on the earth beneath or in the waters below.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   You shall not bow down to the idols or worship the idols.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:51.080]   For I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God,
[00:26:51.080 --> 00:26:53.360]   punishing the children for the sin of the fathers,
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:56.800]   the third and fourth generation for those who hate me,
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.160]   but showing love or kindness to a thousand generations
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:04.320]   of those who love me and keep my commandments.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.280]   Now that's interesting here.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:08.000]   It's the word jealous.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.680]   But jealousy is usually a bad thing, right?
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:15.200]   Most of the time it's a bad thing.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.320]   You know, jealousy is I don't want you to have something
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.560]   that I don't have, right?
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.840]   It's like you are more beautiful than me.
[00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.440]   I don't like it, right?
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.000]   That's why I want to destroy you, right?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.720]   That is jealousy.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.040]   Jealousy is usually a bad thing.
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:33.160]   It's a hateful thing.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.240]   But you know, in the entire cosmos,
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.200]   there are two types of relationship.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.200]   There should be jealousy.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:42.400]   There should be jealousy.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.040]   You say, wait, what?
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.840]   There are two types of relationship.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.400]   There should have jealousy.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.440]   It means exclusiveness.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:58.640]   And one of the relationships is marriage, right?
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:02.200]   In marriage, we should have jealousy
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.520]   because marriage is a one man and one woman
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:10.520]   making covenant and being faithful to each other only, right?
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:16.360]   So the first relationship that should have jealousy
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.840]   is marriage.
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:20.440]   And the other one is here.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   It's your relationship with God
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.520]   because God is a true God.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:29.200]   And you have a relationship with God,
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.680]   has a spiritual relationship with Him.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.680]   Your relationship and how God see His relationship with you
[00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:39.600]   is also in terms of jealousy
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:43.200]   because you cannot worship other gods.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:45.600]   You cannot worship other idols.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:47.960]   You cannot have someone who has the first place
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.400]   in your life other than God Himself.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.360]   That's why the commandment two, principle two says,
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:58.720]   "In your life, there should be no idols."
[00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.920]   Now, idols can be anything,
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:06.080]   whatever, whoever occupies your heart
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:08.520]   more than God Himself.
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:13.200]   So whatever occupies your heart, your mind,
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:15.400]   more than God is an idol.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.960]   Whoever occupies your heart more than God is also an idol.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:27.160]   So idols can be your career.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:30.240]   It can be your money.
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.440]   It can be your family.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.520]   It can also be your children or your grandchildren
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:40.560]   or some other human relationships.
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   No one and nothing should take the place of God.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.200]   God is number one.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.840]   God is number one.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:56.560]   If anything that occupies the number one place is an idol.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.360]   And so often we try to use our human effort
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:05.240]   to take control of our own life
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:11.520]   instead of yielding our worship to God Himself.
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:15.400]   To recognize Him as the ultimate Lord, right?
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:20.360]   So number two says, you know, God hates idols.
[00:30:20.360 --> 00:30:21.600]   God hates idols.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.220]   Now quickly, we go to number three.
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.400]   You put God as your number one.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.560]   No other God, no other gods before the true God.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.880]   And no idols will occupy or compete
[00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:40.200]   with the lordship of the true God.
[00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:42.080]   Number three, it says,
[00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:46.160]   you shall not misuse the name of God, the Lord your God,
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.680]   for the Lord will not hold anyone guiltless
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.320]   who misuses His name.
[00:30:51.320 --> 00:30:54.720]   Now we usually take this verse
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:58.600]   as meaning you should not curse, right?
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.680]   You should not say the name of God,
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:07.520]   Yahweh, Jesus Christ, you know, in vain, right?
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.200]   Is it the real meaning of this statement?
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:13.280]   Well, I would say no,
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:15.720]   because in the ancient world,
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:20.040]   name, name is not merely a label.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:24.960]   It's not merely a label like, okay, I call you John, okay?
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:26.960]   And you're Peter, so I'm calling you John.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.480]   John is unique.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.320]   Name is not just a label in the ancient world.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.440]   Name is power.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:35.200]   Name is authority.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.240]   Name is reputation.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.720]   So statement number three here,
[00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:43.560]   commandment number three, has to do with God's power.
[00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:46.560]   So what do you deal with, how do you deal with God's power?
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:48.520]   The name of the Lord your God.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:53.000]   Is that you shall not, thou shall not misuse
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.280]   the name of the Lord your God.
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.440]   Now, a little bit footnote here for the verb misuse.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.160]   As I said, it's not so much of, you know,
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:10.160]   saying the term God or using the name of Jesus Christ
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.600]   in our statement.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.000]   The verb misuse, translated misuse,
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.120]   actually means carry or lift up.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.840]   It's like you pick up your backpack, okay?
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.480]   You pick up your backpack.
[00:32:25.480 --> 00:32:30.440]   That is the Hebrew word behind the English word misuse.
[00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:35.280]   So literally, the verse can be translated as shown here.
[00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:39.440]   You shall not carry the name of God in vain.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.880]   You shall not carry the name of God in vain.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.360]   And what it means is that you cannot
[00:32:45.360 --> 00:32:50.440]   carry the brand of God in vain.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:52.680]   Let me give you an example.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:58.240]   Let's say you own a McDonald's franchise, all right?
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.000]   You know McDonald's runs with franchise, right?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.840]   And you apply for it, and then you own the franchise,
[00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:06.400]   and there's a great opportunity for you to earn money,
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.280]   of course, but, you know, come with that franchise
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:14.280]   is that it requires you to make significant investment
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.360]   in managing the business.
[00:33:16.360 --> 00:33:19.120]   It's McDonald, right?
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.120]   It's a McDonald.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:24.280]   And it requires you a high level of commitment,
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:29.280]   and you must also follow the corporation's standards,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.920]   like food quality, right?
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:35.760]   If you get one star or five star, then, you know, you're out.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.600]   And you better keep up with the standards
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:43.600]   set by the corporate, set by the name, McDonald's.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:48.480]   And you have to carry the good name of McDonald's
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:52.240]   when you own the franchise, when you manage the franchise.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:57.200]   Now, with that example, we understand what this verse means.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   You shall not carry the name of God in vain.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.440]   What it means is much the same way
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:07.640]   that since you are saved by grace,
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:12.280]   you're owning God's franchise,
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.560]   that in your life, you have the franchise of God,
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:19.240]   the true God, and you have to do everything
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:24.080]   to honor the name so that when people see you,
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:27.600]   when people look at you and see how you manage your time,
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:30.480]   manage your money, manage your career,
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:33.400]   manage everything in your life,
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:37.360]   they will see that, "Oh, wow, that is a good brand.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.840]   "That is a good name.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:42.160]   "I want to join that franchise as well," right?
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:47.040]   And we must admit and confess that sometimes
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:51.480]   we just not very up to the standard, right?
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.200]   We just thought that we are saved by grace
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:56.720]   so we can do anything we want.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:59.920]   That's not how it works, guys.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.160]   That's not how it works.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:03.360]   No, you can lose your salvation.
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:05.040]   You can lose your identity
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.040]   if you do not honor the name, the franchise of God.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:15.120]   And what a challenge to all of us at the end of the year.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:21.200]   As we reveal the past year, what have we done?
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:25.320]   And what kind of effort we put into making
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:30.240]   or carrying the name of God, right?
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:32.080]   And people see us.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.480]   The spouse see us.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:35.000]   The children see us.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.600]   We see that, you know what?
[00:35:37.600 --> 00:35:39.320]   God is real.
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:42.200]   When I see your life, your children will say,
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:44.560]   or your friends will say, "Oh, man,
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.800]   "she is different.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:49.920]   "He is different, and I wonder why."
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.560]   And you'll be able to tell them, "You know why?
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:58.760]   "Because I'm carrying the name of God.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.320]   "My life is the brand of God.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:04.160]   "My life is the reputation of God."
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.520]   So we are saved by grace,
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:13.520]   and we come to God with new principles.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.000]   We, because we are managing His franchise.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:22.160]   Are we doing everything to honor the name of God?
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:27.840]   Are we doing everything in terms of managing our time,
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.000]   in terms of managing our schedule,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:32.160]   in terms of managing our priorities?
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:36.120]   I know it probably has been challenging for you
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.400]   in the past year.
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.560]   However, you know, because we're saved by grace,
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.480]   and that is the foundation of all.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:47.320]   We are saved by sheer grace of God,
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.720]   and my life is carrying His name,
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:54.120]   and His name is precious.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:56.480]   His name is to be honored by all.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:37:01.120]   Now, as we close, why don't we have some moment
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:04.480]   of reflection, and we come before God and say,
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:09.480]   you know, probably we have to confess for our shortcomings,
[00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:12.760]   confess our weaknesses,
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:16.600]   or sometimes, you know, kind of outside our mind for us.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:20.560]   We just follow the motions as a Christian,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.560]   and we are not really worshiping God.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.920]   We're not really serving Him, right?
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.280]   We treat it as a job.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:31.600]   God said, "You shall not misuse.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.600]   "You shall not miscarry the name of God in vain."
[00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.400]   Why don't we come before God and have a moment of reflection?
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:48.760]   And let us pray together.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:56.080]   Father, as we close this year, 2024,
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:02.280]   we count how many opportunities that You have given to us,
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.840]   the provision that You have provided for us.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:11.120]   And we come before You with thanksgiving.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:17.000]   Thank You for granting us all the good things,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.800]   for all the good things come from our Father in heaven.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.720]   And we wanna give You thanks and give You, say thank You.
[00:38:24.720 --> 00:38:30.280]   And not just that, we come before You
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.440]   not only with a thankful heart,
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.320]   but a renewed mindset,
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:41.240]   knowing that we are Your people, we are Your children.
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:47.640]   And God, help us dig into the bottom of the heart,
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.520]   that are we really honoring You?
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:53.920]   Or are we making excuses in our life?
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.560]   Trying to run away from You,
[00:38:56.560 --> 00:39:01.320]   even though we know for sure that You love us so much.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:05.360]   Father, we confess our sins.
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:08.120]   We confess our weaknesses
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:14.920]   or our tendency to, we're so prone to wander,
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:18.080]   wander away from Your truth,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:19.640]   wander away from Your grace.
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:23.120]   So yes, we come before You,
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:26.200]   know that You are the God of all grace.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:30.160]   Thank You for the forgiveness
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.520]   You have provided for us in Christ Jesus.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.880]   Forgive our sins and cleanse us.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.560]   And renew our mind and our heart
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.480]   so that our heart will belong to You
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.680]   and belong to You alone.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.640]   You are the true God, You're the only God.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:51.800]   And thank You for creating us,
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:54.520]   redeeming us and guiding us.
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:59.360]   So help us to make a commitment before You,
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:03.440]   knowing that because You have been faithful to us.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:07.960]   And that's why we live by Your principles,
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   to be Your new people,
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:15.120]   to be people that carry Your franchise,
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:19.240]   carry Your name, carry Your reputation,
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:21.760]   that our lives will attract other people
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.920]   to come follow You.
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:30.240]   Help us to walk in the way of godliness,
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.920]   the way of holiness and purity.
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:35.760]   Help us God.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:40.920]   And we know that You are full of grace and kindness.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.120]   So help us to live in Your love,
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.480]   live in Your presence all time.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:53.440]   And help us to abide to Your wonderful principles
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.840]   so that our lives will be different.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.280]   Thank You for calling us to be Your church.
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.320]   And thank You for being with all of us,
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:07.640]   even though in the past year or so,
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   our church has a lot of different issues and challenges
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:17.400]   and many changes,
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:19.920]   but we know that You are still faithful to us.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:24.600]   So in the head of us, the new year,
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:30.440]   we recognize and acknowledge that You are still faithful.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:32.640]   So help us to be faithful.
[00:41:33.480 --> 00:41:34.480]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:41.080]   God bless you all and hope to see you next year,
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:45.640]   next Sunday, and continue to worship our one and true God.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.140]   Right?
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.720]   (gentle music)
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.300]   (gentle music)
