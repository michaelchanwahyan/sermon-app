[00:01:52.240 --> 00:02:00.480]   Series called back to basics and I want you to remember and practice some of the basic
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:07.480]   Habits, you know in in your Christian life and if we have those slide ready, we will
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.400]   first reveal the verse of the week and
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.520]   This verse of the week is if you have the Bible, I don't have a slide yet
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.960]   You have the Bible, please go to
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:25.720]   Philippines the bow Philippines chapter 4. Yeah, Phoebe. Can I have the slide please?
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:34.000]   Anyways, we'll go to chapter 4 verse 6 and 7 verse 6 and 7. All right
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.880]   Here it says don't worry
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.640]   Here we go. Don't worry about anything
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.080]   Instead pray about everything tell God what you need and thank him for what he has done
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.200]   Then you will experience God's peace which exceeds anything you can understand
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.680]   His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.920]   Philippians 4
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:08.120]   Verses 6 to 7 what a wonderful verse right? What a wonderful sentence or a paragraph
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.840]   to
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.800]   Tell us, you know, especially those of us who worry some
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   Worry a lot and overthinking a lot. Are there anyone here?
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:26.200]   You constantly overthink you constantly think a lot, you know about your future about you know issues or problems
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.220]   This verse gives you peace. Don't worry about anything instead pray about everything now
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.280]   I want to let you to understand this is taken from the book of or the letter to the Philippines and
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.440]   what this letter is as you understand the New Testament has a total of
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:45.120]   27 books or 27
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.520]   You know pieces of writings some of them are letters. Some of them are stories
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.580]   Some of them are histories and you know different different types of literature
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.240]   But if you go to the New Testament Bible
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:03.760]   there were 27 books there or 27 writings and some of the writings we call epistles or letters and
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.940]   Many of the letters are actually written from a pastor
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.080]   From a pastor leader to a church a very very small church
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:17.400]   very very small house churches in different cities and here we find the letter of
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:25.280]   Letter to the to the to the Philippines and it's written by Paul the Apostle Paul the pastor Paul and
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.640]   He wrote this letter
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.920]   Call we call the letter to the Philippines and writing to the Christians the house churches in
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.920]   Philippi one of the Roman
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.480]   Quarantine in in in Greece and
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.280]   If you read this letter
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.400]   There were only four chapters is very very short
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:52.320]   Book a very very short letter you can sense that this is a personal letter
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.560]   With with a lot of personal tones a lot of personal
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.080]   Feeling to it and
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:01.840]   There are two reasons why
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.280]   first because
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:05.720]   Paul actually found this church
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:13.280]   He established this church in his second missionary journey if you check the book of Acts, which is the history of the earliest
[00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.760]   the first generation
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.560]   Christians you'll find some of the stories that Paul
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.200]   came to the city called of Philippi is a Roman city and
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.240]   He tried to preach the gospel and some of the individuals came to faith and he established the church
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.440]   And he's like a father to the church in Philippi
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:39.680]   He's like a father to the Christians the Philippian Christians. And the second reason is the church has been
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.000]   supporting Paul
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.120]   and his mission and his
[00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.960]   ministry and sometimes they send
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.320]   the supplies or
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.480]   Essentials to Paul and at this point when when when Paul write this letter the letter to the Philippines
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:59.320]   He was in prison
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.120]   He was in Rome. He was in the capital city of the Roman Empire
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:06.600]   He was right there in house arrest
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.840]   for almost two years as far as we can reconstruct the
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:17.400]   The last few years of Paul and he was waiting for trial because he want to appeal to Caesar the king
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.400]   the Emperor of Roman Empire and
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.040]   He did not know the result yet
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:31.720]   He was in house arrest and in his house arrest in the Roman world. You can still receive, you know information from other people
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.240]   You can receive visitors. You can have friends and you can send letters and that's the context of the Philippian
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.080]   Letter and in this in this letter you get the sense that you know, he's trying to reply to something
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:52.560]   Because we find some verses in this fourth chapter the book of Philippians that Paul is trying to thank
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.120]   The church in Philippi, right? He was in Rome, right and
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:04.640]   The Philippian Christians are in Philippi and they send someone to to give the essentials or offer essentials to support
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.360]   Paul while he was in prison and
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.240]   For example, you can go to the last chapter chapter 4
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:19.160]   417 what does he say? He say I don't say this because I want a gift from you
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:25.720]   In other words a possible receive a gift a financial gift from the church in Philippi rather
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.480]   I want you guys to receive a reward for your kindness at the moment
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:34.000]   I have all I need and more more than enough
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.720]   I'm generously supplied with the gifts you send me with
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:46.640]   Epaphroditus Epaphroditus and they are sweet smelling sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to God now
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.640]   Who's this guy before Titus?
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.880]   It has to be a member or even a leader from the church in Philippi and he traveled all the way
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.400]   to come to Rome to find Paul in house arrest and give him some
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:08.160]   Essentials probably some food items probably some clothes or anything that he needs in two years and constantly he does so and
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:17.280]   Epaphroditus is kind of like, you know, kind of like a UPS, you know a delivery delivery guy or uber eat, you know
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:25.440]   he's gonna support Paul and make sure he's being fed and he's he's being strengthened and to help him and to stay with Paul and
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.160]   From the letter we see that Epaphroditus was really sick
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:34.120]   It's probably because he travels so much to help Paul
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.800]   and maybe he was got so sick and even to the point of death and
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.040]   He was by the side of Paul and Paul is really really
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.820]   worried about this brother and maybe because
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.480]   Paul and
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:50.480]   Epaphroditus they talk about
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:56.160]   the church and there was so much anxiety for the church because the small church is under a lot of pressure and
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:09:01.640]   oppositions and Paul want to send Epaphroditus back to the church in
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:08.320]   Philippi and he wants to send Epaphroditus back with a letter and this is the letter
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:13.640]   Right the letter to the Philippians and he you can imagine he's just quickly grab some
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:21.520]   parchment paper and write a letter in four chapters a very very short a very personal letter and send it with the
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:26.720]   Mailman, you know the UPS guy Epaphroditus and send him back to
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.480]   Philippi and that's how we find the letter to the Philippines and finally we come to the
[00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:35.880]   last chapter chapter 4 and
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:40.240]   And Paul is trying to close the letter and he's trying to you know
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:47.680]   Give give his encouragement as much as he can in this letter and chapter 4 verse 1
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.760]   He said therefore brothers and sisters you whom I love and long for my crown and my joy
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.160]   You got that personal tone
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.800]   It's a personal letter and that's how you should stand firm in Lord dear friends. I
[00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:05.220]   Plead with you dire and I plead with
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.940]   Syntaghy to agree with each other in the Lord and yes, I ask you loyal your fellow
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:18.020]   hope this women who have contended at my side in the cause of gospel along with
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:25.840]   Clement and the rest of fellow workers whose name are in the book of life rejoice in the Lord always I say again
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:31.260]   Rejoice, let your gentleness be evident to all and the Lord is near
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:38.560]   Now that's the closing chapter right there. There are two women being named here, right you dire and
[00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:42.880]   Synecdoche, right, but perhaps these two women are
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:46.440]   Some of the leaders
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:49.160]   In in Philippi some of the leaders of a church
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:56.600]   perhaps they invite the church or fellowship to the living room and have the house churches meeting possible and
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:03.640]   These two women and from from the context, you know, these two women don't agree with each other
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:08.280]   Right, they got some tension inattention or probably
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.840]   Disagreement for some reason they were in disagreement and Paul is writing this letter encourage them to be united
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.020]   To be of one heart right and that's actually the tone for the entire letter
[00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:25.160]   Paul the pastor wants the church to work in unity
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:30.920]   To along with other people like Clement right other fellow workers
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:36.120]   So that brings him joy, right and you know from from the wording he used
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:41.480]   The communities in Philippi they are working toward that goal already
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:48.720]   So Paul is trying to encourage them to continue to work in unity and that brings him joy
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:53.040]   Right the entire letter only four chapters, but over and over again
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.160]   Paul is expressing his joy and he's happy
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.480]   He's joyful
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   because of the gospel
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:09.920]   Because the church is being established because the church is trying to stand up and be strengthened in faith. And this is a powerful
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:17.040]   Passage because as you can imagine someone who is in house arrest and
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:20.760]   You just don't know what it will turn out to be
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.920]   Right, whether you will live or where you would die, right?
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.760]   he is waiting to be to go on trial and
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:34.560]   He was in house arrest and he was in prison and just such powerful
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   Wordings that he was trying to use you guys are my joy and my crown and there's a secret here
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:49.920]   Why did Paul do that? How could Paul do that? You know, imagine you're in prison, right or in house arrest
[00:12:50.720 --> 00:12:52.200]   right
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.200]   And you can't go anywhere
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:13:01.120]   You don't have your strip of your freedom, right and you are being mistreated
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.720]   What is the secret of being joyful here?
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.440]   You can tell from verse 3
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:15.520]   Paul says all of their names are written in the book of life, right the book of life
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.720]   You believe in Christ Jesus if you trust holy trust in the name of Jesus your name
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.560]   Is in the book of life, right?
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:30.120]   Your eternity is secure, right? You are on
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:35.160]   the team of team Jesus, right, you know, the Olympic has
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.680]   begun and
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.280]   there were different athletes right and
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:47.080]   The they they are honored to join team USA, right or the team of the country, right?
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:53.800]   Just joining the team the name being on the team is such an such an honor, right?
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:01.080]   Right. Yeah, you can imagine if your name is on team USA, right? What kind of honor would that be?
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:06.160]   Right, we're gonna throw a big party for you, right too bad. Your name is not there, right?
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.240]   Yeah, but your name is on team USA you get the honor and you are happy, right?
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:14.440]   And that's the secret of a Paul
[00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.040]   It's if your name is in the book of life
[00:14:18.040 --> 00:14:24.440]   You have the ground to be joyful, right? You're joyful not because you are successful
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:32.960]   You're not you're not because because you're not you're not you're not joyful because you're successful in the in the worldly perspective
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.120]   You're joyful because your name is in the kingdom, right?
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.600]   And then he goes on to encourage the questions encourage us that the Lord is near
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:49.600]   Right now it is usually translated in the in the sense of time, you know temporal sense
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.920]   The Lord is near meaning Jesus is coming anytime
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:58.680]   It's just coming anytime soon, right? It can be today. It can be the next hour
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:05.160]   It can be five years later anytime right Jesus coming second coming is right around the corner
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:10.240]   That's the temporal sense. But you know here another sense is is often forgotten
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.320]   In those words the Lord is near
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:16.560]   It's the spatial sense
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:25.280]   So what Paul is saying is that the Lord is near Jesus is near is that Jesus is right by your side
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:32.720]   Jesus is present with you if you're facing difficulties or you're facing some sadness and depressed
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:35.480]   moments in your life
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.800]   Know that you know, the Lord is right next to you
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:45.400]   Right right beside you. The Lord is near he is someone you can trust
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.520]   He's right next to you and it makes a world whole world of difference, right?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.760]   It makes a whole world difference knowing that there's supporting friend right next to you
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:00.200]   Right when you are feeling down when you're feeling bad or sad, right?
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.920]   I usually
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.720]   visit
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:09.280]   People who are sick in the hospital, right and you can tell from their eyes
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.160]   When you go in and you preach you are present with them
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:18.440]   They are encouraged right? They are comforted and
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:24.680]   That's why it's hopeful for many of us to sometimes to talk to someone who is wiser
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:30.640]   Like a wise counselor, right? Either professional counselor or you know a layman
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.480]   Find someone who can talk to you find someone who can listen to you to understand
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:40.000]   Your voice right understand your mind
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.800]   That is so important. And and that's what it means. The Lord is near right friends if you're going through some down period
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:53.800]   If you're going through some difficult time know that the Lord Jesus is near
[00:16:53.800 --> 00:16:59.120]   He is right next to you and Paul goes on to talk about one of the basic practice
[00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:05.440]   Of Christians and don't forget that he said do not be anxious
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:12.600]   That's NIV do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and petition
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:19.320]   With Thanksgiving present your request to God and the peace of God which transcends all
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:25.080]   Human understanding will guard your heart and your minds in Christ Jesus
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.760]   he says
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:29.240]   Don't worry
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:31.240]   Right. Don't worry
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.200]   Don't worry too much
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.640]   Don't be too anxious about anything or perhaps our essentials, right?
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:46.320]   Don't be anxious about anything but in everything you pray and you present your petition to God, right?
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:49.440]   They're almost synonyms prayer and petition
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.640]   not the exact wording but you know words that
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:57.040]   Express our way of you know
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:04.680]   Talking to God right and that is prayer. That is the basic practice that we all have. Let me ask you this
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.480]   Do you pray?
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.320]   Constantly regularly
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.160]   Every day. I want to encourage you you take 10 minutes of
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:22.680]   The best time of the day to pray to God right now so often we we we misunderstand
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:31.840]   What prayer is right? Sometimes we think prayer has to be in some sort of using some some sort of big words, right?
[00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:37.560]   Beautiful words so we can approach God that way. No, that is not the spirit of prayer
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:41.120]   I still remember the first year in in seminary
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:46.000]   I was taking a class and there's a very very
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.920]   old and wise professor
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:56.840]   Hey, he always begins the class with prayer and end the class with prayer and when he prays
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.640]   No, it's just beautiful prayer
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:04.520]   He uses King James Version English to pray
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:11.480]   You know Tao T and it's just beautiful right because he grew up in the Christian family
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:16.560]   Very devout Christian and he used to that kind of language, you know, King James
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:23.160]   It's very very old old English. But you know when you hear his prayer, you just feel like my goodness
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:25.080]   This is beautiful
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.400]   Every time he he opened his mouth. It's like writing poem, right?
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:32.240]   Do we have to pray like that?
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.680]   No, we don't right, you know one of the shortest prayers in the Bible
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.880]   remember that is
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:43.400]   Lord help me
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:50.920]   That's one of the shortest prayers in the Bible right so his prayer in the Bible the spirit of prayer is authentic
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:58.080]   sincere honest and open you just tell God what you need and how you feel right and
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:02.840]   It's kind of like baby talking to to daddy and mommy
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:10.400]   Right. Do we as as dad and mom do we mind the young child?
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:18.360]   Not knowing what to say and you know, just bah bah bah all the time, right? We love those those voices, right?
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:25.420]   To make known right his or her feeling that that's how we approach God, you know
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:27.560]   Will prayer is authentic
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:35.880]   Authentic sincere honest and open right and we need to practice that right?
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:39.080]   We need to practice that and then Thanksgiving
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:44.000]   He said by prayer and petition with Thanksgiving, right?
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:48.160]   When you when you cultivate the spirit of being thankful
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.200]   You are constantly reminded
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.960]   What God has done in your lives, right?
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:21:02.480]   Sometimes we are so overwhelmed by you know, the problems that we have right the worries that you know in our mind
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:05.280]   And then we forget
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:07.920]   No, God has been good to us, right?
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:12.720]   God has been good to us in the past and that's why we can keep on
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:17.760]   Trusting him right there. God has the track record, right?
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.560]   of being good to us
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:23.120]   And that reminder will help us
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.480]   To worry less right a christian author
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:32.320]   Says listen up christian author says this. I think it says it's very very
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:34.880]   correctly
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:37.040]   The way to be anxious about nothing
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.600]   Is to be prayerful
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.600]   about everything
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.480]   The way to be anxious about nothing
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.280]   Is to be prayerful
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.440]   about everything
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.680]   Right. What a wonderful reminder, right?
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:57.940]   We come here. Paul says don't be anxious about anything but in prayer petition and thanksgiving
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:03.520]   You come before God, right? And that's a wonderful verse, right? But it's also interesting, right?
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.400]   you know you think about it from a
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:11.280]   Just our our human perspective if God wants us to worry less
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:18.880]   Why doesn't God just give us everything that we ask for right? Do you want a bigger house?
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.640]   Do you want to win the the lottery
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:30.560]   And retire early right is sitting by the beach of cancun, you know all the time, right, you know sipping
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.440]   You know pina colada all day
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:35.520]   Don't you want that?
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.520]   Right. Don't you think you need that?
[00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:41.600]   You want bigger bigger car or a better car, right?
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:49.520]   Um money, you know lottery new house right new car right, you know
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:56.800]   Uh, you think God God would be good to us if if if God just shower us with
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:22:59.600]   all this material possessions
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.560]   You think you think that's the goodness of God?
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:10.720]   You say so right you say so but you know what if if you have all that you want, right?
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:14.000]   Sometimes your spirit is poor
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.920]   Right because it doesn't build up your character
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:25.360]   Right, it doesn't give you the strong spirit to withstand changes to withstand difficulties, right?
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.680]   And that's why paul is saying, you know
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.840]   God treats us
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:33.440]   in a different way
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:35.360]   God gives you peace
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   Right god gives you peace
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:44.160]   And peace that is beyond human understanding transcends all understanding and talking about peace
[00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:51.520]   You know to the uh to the years of uh, the philippians in the roman city roman colony
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:57.760]   And uh, they should uh, they should immediately understand what it means peace, right?
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:01.220]   Sometimes we read the word peace we use our understanding
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.040]   uh
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:06.000]   And our perception but in the to the roman
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.800]   To the romans and and philippian, uh, they're living in a roman city a military city
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:17.440]   They do know what peace is right and there's a slogan
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:24.320]   Back in the uh, first century roman empire is pax romana, right pax romana latin
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:29.520]   It means roman peace, right? You know what what roman peace is?
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:33.200]   You know, uh, rome is a dictator, right?
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.480]   Roman peace means I beat you up
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:43.040]   And then you're gonna obey me right I conquer you right and you're not gonna do uh
[00:24:43.040 --> 00:24:48.640]   You're not gonna be rebellious. You're not gonna rebel against me. That is called peace, right? That is roman peace
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:56.880]   Pax romana, right? I was trying to organize some of the materials lately and uh, I find this uh, roman coins
[00:24:56.880 --> 00:25:03.360]   Golden coins and what we call this kind of coins are first jewish revolt coins
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:08.640]   You know the first jewish revolt happened in uh, a d uh, 66 to 70
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:17.200]   Those few years, uh, some of the jewish people especially in judea in jerusalem. They rebelled against rome and they fought against rome
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.760]   and um, of course they
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:27.520]   Um, ultimately they failed right and the roman army came to palestine and suppressed the revolt
[00:25:27.520 --> 00:25:33.680]   And after the suppression after roman, uh, the romans conquered, uh, all those, uh,
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.400]   rebellious people
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:38.000]   uh, they
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:43.760]   Will uh, they will send a propaganda to the entire empire by minting coins
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.560]   And coins with a message, right?
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.040]   You know coins have message, right?
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:53.520]   And on the left you see there's a military victory
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.240]   procession
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:26:03.120]   And all the armies and horses, you know and with a horn, you know proclaiming the victory of rome and in front of it
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.560]   The little guy, you know the first guy in the procession
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   Uh, he has a name
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:11.440]   And his name is simon
[00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:13.200]   simon son of
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.720]   Uh, gilora
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.560]   And he's one of the leaders
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:18.720]   of the uh first jewish revolt
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:26.080]   And uh, the romans came and say we are triumph over you. Okay, right and we beat you up
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:31.200]   And you are the head of the procession and we're going to tell other people all the tribes in all the nations
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.000]   That we are the winner and you are the loser, right?
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.240]   And then who's the winner?
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:38.000]   that's bastion
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.880]   The middle the middle face middle face of a coin, right? That is one of the roman empires
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:44.720]   emperors
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.680]   And on the right you see the word judea
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:50.320]   Can you make make it out judea?
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:52.800]   And it's a woman
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:54.640]   captive
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.480]   You know being bound
[00:26:56.480 --> 00:26:58.160]   of her hands
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.440]   sitting at the foot of uh, uh the palm tree
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.560]   And she was defeated

[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:15.440]   Now what I want to tell you is this is the room. This is the roman peace
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:20.640]   This is the peace of roman empire they beat you up, right?
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:27.840]   So you cannot rebel anymore, right? And philipi was guarded heavily by

[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:37.140]   And if you live in philipi, if you're one of those who read the letter of philippians
[00:27:37.140 --> 00:27:41.520]   You understand you because you will see soldiers all around you, right?

[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.520]   Roman army is to guarantee the roman peace, right?
[00:27:51.520 --> 00:27:56.160]   That is the peace that they understood
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:58.400]   right
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.760]   roman peace
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.220]   I still remember, uh the first year of the pandemic
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:06.240]   Remember that we have national guards here
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:09.680]   You know guarding the in and out of downtown
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:11.840]   Remember that?
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.000]   You know, they they got uh, you know military trucks and uh, you know all over the cities, right?
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.440]   And I remember I have to help uh international student to move
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.320]   and uh, I I rent an
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.960]   a 10-foot u-haul
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:29.360]   And she has to move out of the uh, you know the the building in downtown
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   And I I drove that u-haul
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:35.040]   You know across all the checkpoints, right?
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:40.080]   Dude, I was so scared, right? Well, what are you doing? You know people are using u-haul to
[00:28:40.080 --> 00:28:42.960]   you know to to to uh
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:46.560]   To to break break down the wall and uh steal things right?
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:51.280]   And it was pretty scary right? I have to talk to the guard and you know, I I'm a pastor
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:55.040]   I'm helping I want people to move, you know, I know this is a bad time, but you know
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:58.240]   The street is like a ghost town, right?
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   Do you think that was peace
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.520]   In a way it was right, we're quite peaceful
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:08.960]   It's quite peaceful nobody on the street, right?
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:12.640]   But that is the roman peace
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:15.680]   The peace that paul talks about is the peace
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.680]   of god
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.560]   Right the peace that we find in jesus christ
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:24.160]   And first of all that peace is that we have a restore
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:33.100]   Relationship with god the father right in jesus because of the cross that we have that peace that ultimate peace
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:37.100]   Restore relationship with our creator with our father. We can call him father
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:43.580]   We are sons and daughters and that is the peace talk paul talks about peace given by god, right?
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:46.140]   So paul pictures god's peace
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.620]   as the garrison
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.740]   As military soldiers keeping guard
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:58.860]   Over your hearts and your minds to protect you from all kinds of attacks
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.180]   that is
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:03.180]   the peace of god
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.520]   And that's why it's beyond human understanding
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:10.380]   Right, you know that your eternal destiny is secure in christ
[00:30:10.380 --> 00:30:14.140]   You know, your identity is secure in christ
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.380]   And you are not shaken
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:19.260]   No matter what comes your way, right?
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.420]   sickness
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:23.420]   right separation
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.280]   Heartbrokenness
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.580]   All this all these issues are coming in your way
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.260]   If you know that your identity is secure
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:38.540]   You have peace and that is the peace from god, right?
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:41.820]   And we can rely on god
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:49.020]   You know, rachel has been driving a lot these days, uh, I told you, you know in the in the beginning a couple years ago
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.340]   She hates driving
[00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:53.100]   Now she likes driving
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:54.780]   She enjoys driving
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:30:57.020]   And um, you know, she drives one of our old cars
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.820]   and uh, she always always comes on, uh, she always comes home and uh,
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:03.500]   uh, tell me
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.500]   with a little phrase
[00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:10.860]   And she said dad, uh, the car is low on gas
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:18.540]   The car's low on gas and she didn't say anything right because she trusts
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:26.300]   That i'm the i'm the good father, right? I'm gonna add uh gasoline to the car when the gas is low, right?
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.940]   And um, I really admire that kind of chill out spirit
[00:31:30.940 --> 00:31:36.620]   Uh, you know just trusting me that I will always provide right? I will always provide
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.300]   Yeah
[00:31:38.300 --> 00:31:40.380]   I think that kind of spirit we need to have
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:44.540]   Without god, right
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:47.020]   We're low on gas
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:50.140]   And father heavenly daddy, we're low on gas
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.700]   And that is the spirit of prayer, right? That is the spirit of prayer
[00:31:54.700 --> 00:32:00.700]   We come before god. We are open. We come before god. We are sincere and honest and that is
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:04.060]   Our daily prayer life, right?
[00:32:04.060 --> 00:32:07.420]   Come before god to tell him our request
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:09.980]   Tell him our feelings
[00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:13.180]   Tell him what is what is going on in your life?
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:17.100]   And god is there to listen and the lord is near
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.100]   That is the mentality of paul, right? He was in prison. Remember?
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.340]   He was um
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:25.340]   under a lot of pressure
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.300]   Uh opposition there was no light at the end end of tunnel
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.900]   He just doesn't know what the future holds for him. But there was a habit in paul. There was a habit of uh,
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.380]   of a faithful living
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.340]   To pray and to be thankful all the time, right?
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.500]   That takes care of a lot of different issues and worries
[00:32:43.500 --> 00:32:50.780]   Beyond our thinking beyond our reasoning, right? Don't we all don't we all overthink, you know from time to time?
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:58.140]   Right. We thought that we think that our thinking can can take care of things. No, we don't right and paul is saying and
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:00.540]   Trust trust in god
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:03.100]   Right and the peace of god will be with you
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:06.540]   You know, I watched the uh
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.540]   olympic game opening
[00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:11.260]   And one of the uh, most inspiring moments
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:13.980]   is celine dion
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:16.940]   You watch that celine dion present
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.980]   her uh singing
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:26.460]   It's just inspiring right, you know in the past few years she has gone through just
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:33.020]   Just no enormous difficulties, right? Yeah losing losing family member
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:35.660]   um, you know, uh
[00:33:36.220 --> 00:33:38.780]   You know where disease, you know striking her
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:41.260]   but um
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:43.260]   She keeps on fighting, right?
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:48.860]   You know, it doesn't come overnight, you know that kind of spirit doesn't come overnight
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.500]   Because she has been a fighter
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:58.860]   For so long right she had this habit this pattern of life this perspective of life to keep on fighting, right?
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.300]   Here we see this we see the spirit in paul
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.580]   And paul is trying to encourage us. Hey
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.460]   You know
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:10.780]   God is with you
[00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.780]   Trust in him, right?
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:14.140]   pray
[00:34:14.140 --> 00:34:16.780]   So I want to encourage you to uh to develop
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:22.540]   A constant prayer life. It's very simple. There's no it's not rocket science, right?
[00:34:22.540 --> 00:34:25.260]   Uh, take 10 minutes
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:28.460]   The best time of your day
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:31.340]   To pray to god, right? You can take pray verbally
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:37.900]   And even non-verbally right and god knows, uh your heart, right
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:41.580]   Let's do that
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:43.580]   and um before we conclude
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:48.060]   Uh, let's recite this, uh, wonderful passage again, right?
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:51.400]   See
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.400]   philippians 4 6 to 7
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:57.900]   Don't worry about anything instead pray about everything
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:03.180]   Tell god what you need and thank him for all he has done
[00:35:03.180 --> 00:35:06.220]   Then you will experience god's peace
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.900]   Which exceeds anything we can understand?
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:16.700]   His peace will guard your heart and mind as you live in christ. Jesus
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.060]   That's our prayer
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:22.620]   Father no matter what life comes
