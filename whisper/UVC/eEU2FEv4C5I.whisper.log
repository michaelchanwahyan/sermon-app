[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   Well, why don't we say a happy new year
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.720]   to the neighbors next to you, in your own language.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.960]   All right?
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.460]   And then we'll begin our sermon series.
[00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.300]   All right?
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.880]   Great, all right, all right.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.160]   That's cool.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.200]   We do have some refreshments out there, right?
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.960]   Yeah, I hope those guys won't devour everything.
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.880]   (laughs)
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.240]   And save some for us, all right?
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.360]   So it's very, very happy you come in.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.120]   There's a photo booth you can use.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:33.940]   Right after service, you can take some pictures
[00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.020]   or some family pictures with your friends, okay?
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.020]   So happy to celebrate China's New Year with some of you.
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.620]   We will continue our sermon series on The Chosen,
[00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.480]   and this is part two.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.480]   And I have picked episode two of season one.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.180]   How many of you checked out The Chosen since last week?
[00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.040]   Please do, please do, all right?
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.980]   We will send out the link in the social media group,
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.660]   and you can watch it for free.
[00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.320]   And Josh remind me, not only all the episode
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.580]   have the captions for different languages,
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.920]   including Chinese or different languages,
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.300]   but also there's audio, right?
[00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.720]   There's audio for different languages as well.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.180]   I'm not sure how I feel if Jesus speaks in Mandarin.
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.800]   Not quite sure, yeah.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.560]   But anyways, but in Chosen, Jesus speaks English,
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.940]   which is kind of strange, right?
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.520]   Because the original language he spoke
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.920]   was Aramaic or Hebrew, right?
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.320]   In any case, it is a well-crafted TV series,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.440]   and it's become so popular.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.000]   No matter you like the episodes
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.280]   or you like how they craft the story or not,
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.040]   I think watching it will help you picture
[00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.460]   what life was like in times of Jesus,
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.320]   because all the scenes that they pick,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.640]   all the, you know, the houses
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.520]   or the background they pick are pretty realistic.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.080]   It's very realistic.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.240]   If you understand history,
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.800]   you understand the historical background.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.120]   They actually did a good job.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.480]   So watch The Chosen and think about the Bible
[00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.940]   and your faith.
[00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.440]   Let's see, last time, we were at
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.740]   episode two, episode one.
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.780]   Now, episode two, let me give you a summary,
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:31.140]   just highlight.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.580]   Now, remember episode one,
[00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.120]   it was Mary Madeline was tortured by many demons,
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.500]   and Jesus finally cast out all the demons
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.500]   and free her from the tyranny of Satan, of the demons.
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   And then she is now free,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.900]   and now Nicodemus, the respected rabbi,
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.980]   is trying to find out what happened to Mary Madeline,
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.160]   because remember, Nicodemus, the rabbi,
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.820]   was being called upon to minister to Mary Madeline
[00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.180]   when she was tortured and possessed by the demons,
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.100]   and Nicodemus failed to cast out all the demons.
[00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.340]   But that's how the story goes.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.580]   It's not in the Bible, right?
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.100]   But it's kind of interesting.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.540]   You try to creatively, you know,
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.640]   woven all the stories together.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.300]   But in any case, Nicodemus failed,
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.380]   and he wanted to find out what happened to Mary Madeline,
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.660]   and who cast out the demons, which he could not.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.400]   And now, back to Mary, in episode two,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.900]   she prepares the first Shabbat meal,
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.740]   and she has invited some of her friends
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.940]   and those who are socially outcast,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.800]   the blind, the disabled, and two of the disciples of Jesus,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.900]   being invited to the home of Mary Madeline.
[00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.940]   And of course, at the end, the surprise guests show up
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.300]   at the first Shabbat of Mary Madeline, right?
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.880]   And that surprise guest is Jesus, right?
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.380]   Jesus show up at the end of the episode.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.220]   Now, the key issue here I want you to think about
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.220]   is the Bible background.
[00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.240]   Why they were so concerned about casting out the demons,
[00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.900]   like miracles that is done by Jesus.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.020]   Why did the Pharisees was so upset
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.860]   or so concerned about who is doing what,
[00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.560]   and why were there miracles?
[00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.460]   They want to authenticate all the miracles.
[00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.820]   No, you get that kind of sense
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.020]   in the opening chapters of all gospels.
[00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.140]   When Jesus came out publicly,
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.460]   he did a lot of miracles, signs and wonders,
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.620]   including casting out the demons.
[00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.900]   And then the Pharisees from Jerusalem
[00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.060]   came out to Jesus and challenged him.
[00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.240]   They are trying to authenticate in whose authority
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.100]   Jesus did all those things, right?
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.740]   Why did they so concerned about all of this miracles
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.180]   and they want to authenticate
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.660]   whether someone is using the authority of God,
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.200]   the name of God properly?
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.800]   Because the Jews in those days,
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   they thought if true miracle happened in our time,
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.820]   that means the kingdom of God is finally here.
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.480]   It's finally here.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:31.480]   Remember the Bible background before the New Testament,
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.800]   there was an Old Testament, right?
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.840]   Between the Old Testament and the New Testament,
[00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.000]   there were several hundred years
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.460]   that God seems to be silent.
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.740]   What we call the silence period.
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.500]   It's about three to 400 years.
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   We call it intertestamental period between the old and new.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.300]   And the Jewish people, they were waiting and yearning
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.880]   for God to come and to arrive.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.020]   The king will arrive, finally will restore his kingdom,
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.300]   the long lost kingdom of David.
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.520]   And when the new Messiah,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.320]   when the new king arrive at the scene,
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:12.560]   he will arrive with signs and wonders
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.180]   and casting out the demons.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.280]   And that's why the New Testament opens
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.520]   with signs and wonders done by the Messiah, Jesus Christ.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.240]   Now we were all in the Bible study, right?
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.000]   The gospel of Mark.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.400]   We just finished chapter nine, right?
[00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.120]   We just finished chapter nine.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:35.880]   And the first eight chapters were all about the signs
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.160]   and miracles that done by Jesus.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.620]   And, you know, reading between the line,
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.120]   you see the Pharisees and the authorities from Jerusalem
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.800]   is trying to check them out, right?
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:51.720]   To challenge Jesus and to ask Jesus by who's the authority,
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.400]   you are doing all of this, right?
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:58.400]   And of course, for those who are unbelieving, they resist.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.760]   They resist to acknowledge the divine authority Jesus had.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.240]   And they try to blame him for casting out demons
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.400]   with some other power, maybe demonic power, right?
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:17.400]   In fact, in chapter 11 of the gospel of Luke,
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.200]   Jesus said, after he cast out demons,
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:23.140]   and the authorities, the Pharisees,
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.040]   the religious teachers from Jerusalem challenged him,
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.240]   by whose power you're doing this, Jesus said,
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.200]   but if I am casting out demons by the power of God,
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:37.040]   then the kingdom of God has arrived among you.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:41.600]   Jesus speaks here, he says, you know,
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.700]   because I'm casting out demons with the authority of God,
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.760]   you know, the kingship of God has already arrived.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.020]   And because of me, when you see me work,
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.600]   when you see me saying things and teaching and preaching,
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.480]   you know the power of God has already arrived in our midst.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.120]   And that's what he said here.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.360]   The kingdom of God has already arrived.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.800]   Pay attention to the tense here.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.120]   It's not a past tense, it's not future tense,
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.600]   it's a present perfect tense, right?
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.280]   Has already arrived among you.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.000]   And you better acknowledge that because of power of Jesus.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.720]   Now this episode, try to, you know, intervere,
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:30.680]   interconnect all the stories together
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.440]   and talking about the first Shabbat
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.700]   prepared by Mary Madeline, all right?
[00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:37.920]   Of course that is not in the Bible.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.600]   The Bible never recorded, you know,
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.760]   Mary Madeline preparing for Shabbat,
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.420]   preparing for a meal on the seventh day of the week.
[00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:47.440]   But we know that is the background
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.480]   because it's Jewish people.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.640]   For them, the most important thing is the Shabbat meal.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.480]   The most important thing.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:58.880]   Even today, modern Israelis,
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.720]   they will celebrate Shabbat
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.360]   and they will take it very, very seriously, right?
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:06.480]   It's kind of like those of you
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:11.480]   who have Chinese heritage, right?
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:15.800]   You have Chinese heritage
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:17.320]   and you have that cultural background
[00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.600]   and you want to celebrate Chinese New Year, right?
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:22.120]   Some of you do, right?
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.400]   We don't.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.520]   I don't.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.440]   Because we just too lazy.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.880]   So my son is back for the weekend
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.400]   and all we did is that we went out for lunch yesterday
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.480]   and we found a restaurant that is less crowded.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:41.320]   So we had lunch, right?
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.920]   And that's all, right?
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:44.120]   I don't give them money.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.760]   I wish they can give me money.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:51.120]   But we lost kind of the Chinese heritage.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.640]   But for many of you, because of the cultural background,
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.160]   you still take it seriously, right?
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.240]   And that's why you've got some refreshment out there.
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:01.200]   That's why you've got some, you know,
[00:10:01.200 --> 00:10:04.280]   decoration or the red color, right?
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.120]   That you have.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:08.120]   This is only red shirt, kind of red shirt that I have.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:10.040]   So I save it for Chinese New Year.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:13.520]   But you know, for the Jewish people,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:16.040]   Shabbat meal or the Shabbat
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.600]   is a super important sign and ritual.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:22.760]   And where does it come from?
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.920]   It comes from the second book of the Old Testament.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.320]   Remember the first book is Genesis.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.120]   Second book is Exodus.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.600]   Exodus chapter 20, here this entire passage
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.200]   is the 10 commandments.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.640]   Now, why there were 10 commandments?
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.640]   Because when God saved the Israelites out of Egypt,
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:49.240]   the land of slavery,
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:52.800]   he redeemed them and saved them by grace
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:55.440]   and saved his people and out of Egypt,
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.840]   they passed through wilderness and finally they came
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   to the first most important mountain called Mount Sinai.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.520]   And they were there and God show up in clouds and thunders,
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.840]   clouds and thunders and lightning and fire
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:14.720]   at the top of the mountain.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.640]   And at the foot of the mountain,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:20.240]   the people of God just redeemed.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.920]   And God spoke to them because I save you by grace.
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:28.920]   I led you out of the land of slavery, land of sin.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.200]   Now you become my people and I give you the principles
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:39.200]   to live by because you have a new identity as my people,
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   as the new people, that's why you live differently.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.200]   And God spoke the 10 words, the 10 principles,
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.720]   what we call the 10 commandments.
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:53.480]   And those commandments are the basic constitutional
[00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   principles lived by the new people of God.
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.040]   And in the fourth commandment,
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:07.280]   it speaks of the Shabbat or the Sabbath.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.180]   Now this is super important.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.560]   Chapter 20, verse eight and following.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.920]   It says, God said to the new people of God,
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:20.920]   remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.080]   You have six days each week for your ordinary work,
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.080]   but the seventh day is a Shabbat day or Sabbath day of rest,
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:34.600]   dedicated to the Lord your God.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:39.000]   On that day, no one in your household may do any work.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.760]   This includes you, your sons and daughters,
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.080]   your male and female servants, your livestock,
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.280]   any foreigners living among you.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:52.760]   For in six days, the Lord God made the heavens,
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.760]   the earth, the sea and everything in them.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.560]   But on the seventh day, he rested.
[00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.760]   That is why the Lord God plus the Sabbath day,
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:06.980]   the Shabbat day and set it apart as holy.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.400]   Now this is very interesting.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:11.120]   Let me point out something here.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:16.120]   The Shabbat, what is interesting, the Sabbath is time.
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.920]   It's time.
[00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.600]   All right.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.280]   From a particular time to another particular time.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:30.760]   You know, time is being set apart here, being set aside
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.240]   and being seen as something more important
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:37.160]   than all those times, the ordinary time.
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:40.360]   That's very interesting.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:44.400]   Right, the first thing God told the people of God,
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.440]   God said to them, God said to us,
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.840]   there was certain time period of the week
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.240]   that you have to see it differently
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:59.560]   from all those other times, right?
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:03.160]   Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday afternoon,
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.040]   those are ordinary time.
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:08.360]   And there's a special time during the week
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.600]   that God sees it as important.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:15.540]   And he said, remember to keep that holy.
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:21.020]   Now people of God are to refrain from working,
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:25.720]   the normal, ordinary work, right?
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.640]   And then on the seventh day, what we call Shabbat, right?
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.160]   They stop working and set it aside
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.720]   and keep that apart from all the other time.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.040]   Now what does the word Shabbat or Sabbath mean?
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:43.960]   What does it mean?
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:49.120]   It means stop, right?
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:53.080]   Cease, ceasing, ceasing to do something
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:55.160]   you have already done.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   Just stop doing this and then you do something else.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.000]   Well, as I said, modern Israelis
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.440]   would take Shabbat seriously,
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:09.000]   especially those who are on the orthodox side,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.600]   and they will stay home and they would rest.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:17.300]   They would go to synagogue to worship,
[00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:20.000]   and they will have, of course, the Shabbat meal
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.680]   as their family time, they enjoy it.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.200]   You go to modern Israel on the Shabbat day,
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   which begins on Friday at sundown,
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:36.320]   the streets are suddenly quiet,
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:41.600]   no cars traveling, no one driving,
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.540]   no one on the street.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.020]   Those people you usually find on the street,
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.200]   they are on the way to somewhere else.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.320]   They may go to a synagogue,
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:56.320]   they may go to a Western wall to pray, to worship, right?
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:00.600]   So what an interesting social phenomenon, right?
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.320]   On Shabbat, they just cease everything
[00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:09.100]   and go to synagogue and stay home for Shabbat meal.
[00:16:09.100 --> 00:16:14.860]   Now the Sabbath is important because it is the sign,
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.980]   the indication of who you are.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:21.260]   And for the people of God in Israel,
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:24.580]   for the Old Testament people,
[00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:29.060]   as the people of God, Shabbat, Sabbath,
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.260]   is a special sign of their relationship with God
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.180]   because God has entered a covenant,
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:38.920]   sort of a serious agreement with them.
[00:16:38.920 --> 00:16:42.260]   God, Yahweh, and the people of God,
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:44.240]   and between them, there's a covenant,
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.900]   there's a relationship.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:50.700]   And God said, "One of the signs that you show the world,
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.860]   "you show yourself, is to stop working
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:56.700]   "and you come to worship me.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.940]   "You rest so that I can work," right?
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.540]   To acknowledge my kingship,
[00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.380]   to acknowledge that you are in control
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:06.500]   and I am not in control.
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.060]   That is the most important sign in the Bible.
[00:17:10.060 --> 00:17:12.220]   And according to Jewish tradition,
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.060]   Shabbat begins a few minutes before sundown.
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:20.300]   There was some rabbis in Jesus' day,
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.460]   they said, "How do you know how to tell time?"
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.380]   Today we have the Apple Watch, we have the clock, right?
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.660]   We have the internet to tell us the world clock, right?
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:31.780]   What time it is right now.
[00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:33.580]   But for those people in Jesus' day,
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.900]   they didn't have a watch,
[00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.820]   so those rabbis were discussing
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.100]   when exactly does the Shabbat begin?
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.740]   And some of the literature tells us
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:45.540]   the exact time to begin Shabbat
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:50.300]   is when three stars appear in the night sky.
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.200]   So they observe the stars and the moon, right?
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:58.180]   They find three stars appearing in the sky.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:18:00.820]   That's when Shabbat begins.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:02.420]   And you see it's working.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.140]   Remember, Shabbat or Sabbath means stop, right?
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:09.100]   And they just drop everything, right?
[00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:10.900]   They don't even cook.
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:12.980]   They don't even cook, right?
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:17.980]   One of the most interesting experience
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.820]   that we have when we go to Israel,
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.180]   when I lead church groups to Israel,
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.580]   is that sometimes we'd stay in the hotel, right?
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.180]   And Friday night, when Friday night comes,
[00:18:28.180 --> 00:18:33.260]   and all through Saturday for 24 hours,
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.100]   the hotel kitchen is closed, right?
[00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.620]   So what are we gonna eat, right?
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.620]   What are we gonna eat?
[00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.600]   We eat the leftover.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:49.820]   Because what they do is that they leave the steamer on,
[00:18:49.820 --> 00:18:55.520]   and all those trays of food are being heat up, right?
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.060]   So they don't do any work in Shabbat, right?
[00:18:58.060 --> 00:19:03.060]   Because starting a fire or electricity is considered work.
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:08.980]   So they turn it on on Friday and leave it on for 24 hours,
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:11.500]   and that's all you eat, right?
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.420]   So Thursday night, whatever you eat,
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.980]   you probably will eat the same thing Friday night, right?
[00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:22.980]   And then Friday breakfast becomes Saturday breakfast,
[00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:25.880]   because they take this seriously.
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:30.880]   And in the entire Bible, anyone in the nation of Israel,
[00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:35.600]   if they fail to observe Shabbat,
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:37.880]   if they fail to observe Shabbat,
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:42.440]   that will show that this thing or this respect
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:47.300]   for the special relationship between God and Israel.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:51.480]   Like for married couples, right?
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.760]   Some of us are married couples.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.960]   If one side, with one person,
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:20:02.500]   trash some of the symbols of the relationship,
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:08.220]   trash it, not losing it, not unintentionally,
[00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:10.420]   but if you trash it, some of the symbols,
[00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:15.420]   like wedding ring, certificate, right?
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:18.400]   Or something that is important between the two people,
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.920]   if you intentionally trash it,
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.360]   that means you show disdain toward that relationship
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.320]   and toward the person in that relationship.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:30.720]   And that is what Shabbat becomes.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:33.400]   It becomes a sign to tell you,
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.320]   that tell ourselves and tell the world
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.640]   that God is important, right?
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.160]   God is important.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:45.160]   So the Jewish people have already respected this tradition
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:47.320]   throughout the history,
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:50.060]   because they understand it's not just a commandment.
[00:20:50.060 --> 00:20:53.240]   And this commandment rests on
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:58.240]   how God order the entire universe.
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.680]   Now we read this passage, Exodus chapter 20.
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:06.000]   It says you have to remember this day,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   to observe this day, and then guard it, to keep it holy.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.240]   You know, I like that word, guarding.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.920]   You know, guarding is actually used for military context.
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.860]   It's like a soldier trying to watch out
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.740]   for enemies approaching, standing on the watchtower.
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:26.780]   You know, you're always ready and self-disciplined, right?
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:29.400]   It's not a come and go.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:33.540]   You guard it and you keep it,
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:36.020]   because it's so important, right?
[00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:37.900]   It's not by accident.
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:40.580]   To guard the day.
[00:21:40.580 --> 00:21:44.580]   Now this passage is based on how God work, right?
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:49.260]   Verse 10, seven day, right?
[00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:54.040]   Seven day, or six days each week for your ordinary work,
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.400]   but seven day is the Shabbat day of rest,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:01.200]   dedicated to Yahweh, the Lord your God.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:05.600]   On that day, no one in your household may do any work.
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:10.460]   Now it's actually referring to the book of Genesis,
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:11.360]   the first chapter.
[00:22:13.020 --> 00:22:16.600]   The first chapter of Genesis from verse,
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.300]   chapter one, verse one to chapter two, verse three.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.140]   We recorded how God work in the entire week.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:28.460]   Let me read this passage, chapter two, verse one.
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:30.860]   So the creation of the heavens and the earth
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:34.300]   and everything in them was completed.
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:38.540]   On the seventh day, God had finished his work of creation,
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:42.460]   and so he rested from all his work.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:47.100]   And God blessed the seventh day and declare it holy,
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:51.100]   because it was on this day, on the day when he rested
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.540]   from all his work of creation.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:59.040]   Now this entire creation week being recorded
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.020]   and being narrated from Genesis 1, 1,
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.680]   all the way up to chapter two, verse three.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.340]   Now, of course the Bible is not interested
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:11.100]   in scientific stuff, right?
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.100]   Moses or people in those days,
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:16.300]   they didn't have iPhone, right?
[00:23:16.300 --> 00:23:17.340]   They didn't have iPad,
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:19.460]   they didn't have all these modern technology.
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:22.620]   They didn't even have electricity back then.
[00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:26.020]   So the creation week is not a scientific account.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:29.460]   It is a spiritual account.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.700]   It is a theological writing.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:35.220]   It's more interested in theology.
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.020]   It's more interested to tell you who God is
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:42.380]   and who we are if we relate to God.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:47.380]   So God's act of creation is being presented as one week,
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:51.340]   the work of one week, what we call six-day creation.
[00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.600]   Now, if you remember chapter one,
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.340]   day after day, day after day,
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.660]   talking about how God set up the cosmos.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.300]   He set up the entire universe,
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:06.220]   and after six day of work, God rested from all his work.
[00:24:07.620 --> 00:24:09.500]   He rested on the seventh day.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:13.780]   Now, we modern readers, we come before the Bible and say,
[00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:15.420]   "God rested."
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:16.980]   That's interesting, right?
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:19.340]   The eternal God would rest?
[00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.900]   Does it mean he is getting tired, right?
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:23.660]   Just like we get tired, right?
[00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:27.140]   After all day of studying, writing paper,
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:30.340]   or going to work, geez, we are so tired,
[00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:35.340]   and we just sit on our lazy boy, right?
[00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.740]   And sip a cup of wine or something,
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:40.980]   and then we want to rest, right?
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:44.540]   Now, in the ancient time,
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:48.620]   when people talked about God resting,
[00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:52.380]   it does not mean God is exhausted.
[00:24:52.380 --> 00:24:56.220]   It does not mean God is tired like we get tired.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.000]   No, when the ancient people, the Bible people,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.400]   when they talk about resting, God resting,
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.080]   they said, what they meant was,
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:12.080]   God enter into his temple, and he started to rule.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:18.600]   It's actually going up and be seated on his throne.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:22.780]   That is the meaning of God resting.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.200]   So it's not because God is tired.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:28.720]   God is going into his house, the temple,
[00:25:28.720 --> 00:25:32.520]   and inside the temple, there is one part in the temple,
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:37.080]   the very center of the temple, called Holy of Holies.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:39.920]   And there you find the Ark of the Covenant.
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:43.400]   And the Ark of the Covenant is actually God's throne,
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:46.960]   God's own seat, his kingly seat.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.800]   And he was sitting there, and that is what it meant,
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.360]   what it meant, God rested.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.640]   So God rested means God enter into Holy of Holies,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.680]   and God is in charge.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.800]   God is now the king.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:02.120]   He runs the entire universe.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:04.080]   So God is in control.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.760]   A modern analogy is that,
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:09.820]   how many of you have recently purchased a new computer?
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.640]   A new computer?
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:18.660]   There are some on sale in Costco, gaming PC, right?
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:19.940]   You can check it out.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:23.880]   I mean, you buy a PC, or you buy a computer,
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:27.680]   and you move it to your house, right?
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:30.320]   And you open the box, right?
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.400]   You get the tower, and you get the monitor,
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.520]   you get the stand, and keyboard, and all that stuff, right?
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:38.120]   And then you plug in all the cables,
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.760]   and all the connections,
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:44.200]   and whatever would make the computer work.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.880]   So you work a whole day in order to set up your workspace,
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:50.840]   right, to set up your work computer.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:53.400]   And after you set them all up,
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.480]   plug in all the cables with electricity,
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.240]   and all that stuff, what do you do?
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.040]   Do you go to bed?
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:00.980]   No, you don't.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.440]   You turn it on, right?
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.200]   And that's when you start to rule, right?
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.040]   You control it.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.800]   And that's what it means when God enters
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.040]   His holy of holies.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.360]   God rested.
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.880]   It means He controls everything.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.600]   The entire universe, your life, your family,
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:27.580]   your career, your work, everything.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:33.720]   So that's what this Shabbat commandment mean.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:37.960]   It means honor the day.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:41.700]   Honor this 24 hours.
[00:27:41.700 --> 00:27:44.480]   Keep that holy to worship God.
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:49.100]   What it means is that God is the one who is in control,
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:50.820]   not me.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:53.340]   God is operating my life.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:57.220]   God is orchestrating everything around me.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:27:59.860]   God is in control every single thing
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:01.540]   from the greatest to the least.
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:03.900]   God is the king, God is the Lord.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:08.820]   And after six days of labor, I've done enough.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:13.100]   The Shabbat is telling you enough is enough.
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:15.120]   This is time for you to stop
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:18.380]   and come before the presence of God to worship Him.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.980]   Because you know, ultimately,
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.020]   God is the one who controls everything,
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.340]   not you and not me.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.460]   Do you ever find it interesting
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:30.020]   in the entire week of creation,
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:35.020]   God never set apart some things as holy.
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:39.220]   The entire creation of Genesis,
[00:28:39.220 --> 00:28:44.180]   God did not sanctify or set aside a tool
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:48.900]   or a vessel or a building or a piece of land.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.740]   God never did that.
[00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:55.740]   In the entire creation week, God set aside time.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:29:01.700]   God set aside time to be holy, to sanctify it.
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:03.940]   What is it?
[00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:05.940]   It's a period of time during the week.
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:12.260]   Now what it reminds us is that how we use our time
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.380]   tell us who we are.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:18.340]   How we use our time, how we manage our time,
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:23.340]   tell ourselves and other people who our true God is.
[00:29:24.180 --> 00:29:29.260]   You know, we human beings, we live in time and space,
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.020]   concrete time and space, right?
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:33.540]   We watch the clock, right?
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.460]   We follow the clock.
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:38.180]   Sometimes we have to clock in and clock out for our work.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:39.020]   Right?
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:40.140]   We live in time.
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:43.980]   And sometimes we are busy, right?
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.540]   Probably most of the time we are busy, right?
[00:29:46.540 --> 00:29:50.540]   And we don't have time to do this or to do that.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:56.580]   But if we say we don't have time to worship God,
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:00.900]   to serve God, what it really means is that
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:02.740]   it's not that we don't have time.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.300]   Because God is so very fair.
[00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:09.100]   Each one of us gets 24 hours a day, right?
[00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:11.460]   Nobody gets 26 hours, right?
[00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:13.540]   Nobody get more, nobody get less.
[00:30:13.540 --> 00:30:18.140]   The matter is whether we have time or not,
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.020]   it's not the matter.
[00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:23.860]   It's whether we have the priority right, right?
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:26.900]   What it really means when we say we don't have time
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:29.660]   is that we don't have the priority, right?
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:34.500]   Such and such does not have my priority, right?
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.220]   It's not number one.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:37.860]   That's why we say we don't have time.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:39.180]   Actually, we do have time.
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:44.540]   What goes wrong is our life priority.
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:49.420]   And Genesis 2 tells us, with Exodus 20,
[00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:52.220]   is that God is most important.
[00:30:52.220 --> 00:30:55.420]   God is most important.
[00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:58.820]   We rest and we come before God to worship Him.
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.260]   Now when we came to Christ, our view of time,
[00:31:03.260 --> 00:31:08.260]   or our perspective on time should change,
[00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:12.420]   should be modified, should be reconfigured
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:15.900]   in such a way that we will honor and keep that holy
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.380]   one day a week.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:19.580]   And realize, because we realize that time
[00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:23.340]   is a gift of God, right?
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:25.340]   Don't you realize that?
[00:31:25.340 --> 00:31:28.820]   Some weeks ago, one of the guest speakers talks about
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:34.260]   young people, or relatively young people passed away,
[00:31:34.260 --> 00:31:37.380]   right, because of cancer, because of some terminal disease.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:40.780]   This is tragic, right?
[00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.620]   And life is not in our control.
[00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:47.180]   Time is not in our control, right?
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:49.740]   And that's why the Bible tells us we have to value time
[00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:53.780]   because time is gifted by God.
[00:31:53.780 --> 00:31:55.220]   It's a sheer gift.
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:32:01.020]   And time is entrusted to us as treasure, and as money.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:04.580]   Just like money, just like our investment,
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.220]   that we need to take care of it,
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.060]   and we need to manage it well.
[00:32:09.060 --> 00:32:12.540]   And the Bible, entire Bible, from the first page
[00:32:12.540 --> 00:32:16.060]   to the last page, it says, if God redeem us,
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:17.980]   if we know Christ is our Lord and Savior,
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.980]   then we are called to faithful management
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.660]   of all those good things God has given to us,
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:26.700]   and that includes time.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:30.380]   How we manage our time, right?
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:31.940]   Now, with the resurrection of Jesus,
[00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:35.940]   of course, the calendar for Christians has changed.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.140]   It's shifted from the seventh day to the first day.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:39.980]   And why?
[00:32:39.980 --> 00:32:43.860]   Gospel of John, chapter 20, it says,
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:46.860]   early on the first day of the week,
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.980]   Mary Mellon found the empty tomb.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:53.460]   On the first day of the week, Jesus rose from the dead.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.300]   And the New Testament tells us,
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:59.220]   because Christ came and Christ is true Shabbat.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.060]   Christ is a Shabbat.
[00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:04.100]   In Him, we find rest.
[00:33:04.100 --> 00:33:06.420]   In Him, we find the kinship of God
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:08.260]   because Jesus died on the cross,
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:10.220]   and He redeemed us from sin.
[00:33:10.220 --> 00:33:12.260]   And He was buried in the tomb for three days,
[00:33:12.260 --> 00:33:15.340]   and on the third day, He rose from the dead, right?
[00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:19.260]   He rose from the dead to give us new life and new hope.
[00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:21.140]   And that's what we have in Jesus.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:24.020]   So the day of Shabbat gradually
[00:33:24.020 --> 00:33:26.780]   shift from the seventh day to the first day.
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:29.740]   And that's why we gather here, right?
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:32.500]   Right, whether it rains or it shines,
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.300]   we gather here because we acknowledge
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:36.780]   that only Jesus is our King.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:42.700]   Shabbat, faithful management of time, right?
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:47.900]   Now, my questions toward the conclusion is,
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:51.780]   are these, there are some evaluation questions
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.140]   we need to ask ourselves.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:59.260]   How often do I use Sunday, today,
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:04.380]   the day of worship, as an extension of six days of work?
[00:34:05.220 --> 00:34:08.020]   Right, from Monday to Saturday,
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:09.900]   oh, I got so much to do, right?
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.420]   That's okay, I'll use Sunday as the extension, right?
[00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:17.140]   I'll keep on doing stuff, right,
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:20.740]   to do my own thing on the day of rest,
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:24.460]   or on the day, the worst day of worship.
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:26.500]   How often do we do that?
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.020]   Yeah, we do that all the time, you know,
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.300]   including myself, right?
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.060]   Now, that does not mean we just don't do anything
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:36.420]   and sit on the sofa for 24 hours, right?
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.620]   But today, the day, the time of Shabbat
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.860]   is to be set aside, and the first priority
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.700]   is to worship God and to serve Him, right?
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:45.780]   To serve Him.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.340]   To rest and to read scripture, to pray,
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:51.020]   to reflect on the past week,
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.420]   and to chart the course for the next week,
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.500]   for the coming week.
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:34:58.220]   And that's what Shabbat should be like.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:35:01.100]   But how often do we use it as an extension
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.220]   of the six days of work, right?
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:06.380]   Let us repent and let us change.
[00:35:06.380 --> 00:35:09.100]   You pick up the Bible today,
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.220]   you know, think about God in a more deep way,
[00:35:13.220 --> 00:35:15.980]   to reflect on His word,
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.700]   to reflect on what God has done in our lives.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:22.860]   And how do I honor the lost day in action?
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:24.580]   Question number two.
[00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:26.460]   How do I honor it, right?
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.620]   I show up to worship God, no matter what.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.700]   To serve Him, no matter what.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:36.260]   And how should I plan ahead the lost day
[00:35:36.260 --> 00:35:39.500]   so I can truly worship God, right?
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.580]   Remember what I said, the Jewish people,
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:46.580]   they would take time to prepare for Shabbat, right?
[00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:48.820]   It's not like, okay, I wake up this morning,
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.820]   I find out, oh, it's time to go to worship.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.780]   Oh man, I didn't plan for it.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.380]   But okay, let's go, right?
[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:56.140]   Or I don't go.
[00:35:56.140 --> 00:35:58.820]   It just happened incidentally to us, right?
[00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:01.820]   No, Shabbat has to be prepared.
[00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:04.220]   Observe and keep it holy.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:09.020]   That means we take action to guard it,
[00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:12.860]   to plan ahead, so that my time worshiping God
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:15.100]   will be pleasing to Him.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:17.180]   Let us all do that.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:19.660]   Why don't we close in prayer?
[00:36:19.660 --> 00:36:25.260]   And just remember that God is the King of the universe
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:27.860]   and He controls my life.
[00:36:27.860 --> 00:36:31.300]   And how should I honor Him with my time?
[00:36:31.300 --> 00:36:32.140]   Let's pray.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:34.180]   Father, we give you thanks
[00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.580]   because you are the God of creation.
[00:36:37.580 --> 00:36:40.660]   Everything is in your hand,
[00:36:40.660 --> 00:36:45.580]   including all the details in our lives.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:49.740]   We can rest in you because you rested.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:52.140]   You rested in your holy of holies.
[00:36:52.140 --> 00:36:56.360]   You are ruling the entire universe.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.980]   You are managing every details of our lives.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.500]   So we rest in you.
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:06.220]   We don't have to over worry about things in our lives.
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:08.060]   We don't have to overwork
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.900]   because we know you are in control
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:13.180]   when things don't seem to be in control.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.820]   We know that you can calm the storm,
[00:37:16.820 --> 00:37:19.820]   even though our life can be going through
[00:37:19.820 --> 00:37:23.500]   some stormy period of time.
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:25.140]   We know that you are our King.
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.440]   And thank you, Jesus, for loving us.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:32.120]   And today we come before you and honor your kingship
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:34.160]   to worship and to serve you.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:37.280]   And I pray that you will bless us the rest of the week,
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:41.760]   that we'll continue with our labor of six days,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:44.400]   but we'll worship you in our attitude,
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:45.800]   worship you in our heart.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:50.360]   And when we honor and observe the Shabbat,
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:53.000]   we know that you are always in control
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   and you are indeed worthy of our praises and our worship.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.020]   Thank you for calling us to be your people
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:06.280]   and help us to have wisdom how to manage our time well,
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.880]   because you are a good God.
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:10.800]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:14.460]   Well, God bless you all and happy new year to all of you.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.260]   And hopefully I'll see you next week.
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:19.300]   All right, make sure if you have time,
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:24.300]   join our Super Bowl party tonight.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.640]   You can just bring some stuff
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.920]   and we can enjoy our time together.
