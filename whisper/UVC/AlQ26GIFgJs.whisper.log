[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300]   - Some weeks ago, oh, I forgot to turn it on.
[00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.720]   I'm sorry, yeah.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.220]   You know, this movie is about emotions inside out,
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.940]   and quite a few weeks ago, I remember Speaker Brian Ame
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.440]   was with us, and he talks about the emotional will, right?
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.560]   Remember that?
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.000]   Yeah, how we should articulate our emotion correctly,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.360]   and how we process our emotions, okay?
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.700]   So here's my question to you this morning.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.640]   Is where are you gonna put yourself in the past week
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.460]   on the emotional will?
[00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.680]   Where are you gonna put yourself?
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.720]   Okay, so pick a color, pick a color, or pick one emotion.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.080]   Well, you have some stronger emotion,
[00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.940]   so-called positive emotions, happy,
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.500]   you know, feeling strong and pump up, right?
[00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.660]   And then on the other side is feeling sad and depressed,
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.260]   bored, exhausted, lonely.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.160]   And then down there, there's fear, the emotion of fear.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.840]   And then on the upper right is feeling mad, you know,
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.340]   feeling mad about something, okay,
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.180]   or feeling mad about someone, all right?
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.400]   So take a look at the emotional will.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.520]   Where are you gonna put yourself?
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.020]   Where are you gonna put yourself in the past week?
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.240]   All right?
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.580]   So how many of you put yourself in the fear section?
[00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.660]   Fear section.
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.500]   Wow, you guys are so bold, okay?
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.060]   No one's in fear, all right?
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.820]   How many of you, just take a sample,
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.740]   how many of you put yourself in the mad emotion?
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.700]   The yellow.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.000]   Paul, you were mad, right?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.440]   Yeah, mad about someone, probably.
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.580]   (laughs)
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.420]   Or mad about yourself, right?
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.260]   How many of you feel the sad part?
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.040]   Depressed a little bit?
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:53.400]   Okay, all right.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.260]   How about on the left side, the strong side,
[00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.200]   the happy side?
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.520]   How many of you fall into that quarter?
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.740]   No?
[00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.400]   Okay, those of you who didn't vote,
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.380]   those of you who didn't vote,
[00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.200]   you're probably being emotional less,
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.620]   which is not good, right?
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.660]   Which is not good.
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.400]   All right, so I'm sure the past week
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.260]   probably very hectic for you.
[00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.480]   Whatever happened in your life journey,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.960]   we need to understand,
[00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.200]   as we look at one of the Psalms today,
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.620]   we have been looking at the book of Psalms,
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.640]   using different Psalms, different songs
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.620]   in the book of Psalms to study.
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.200]   You need to understand emotion is a window.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.580]   It's a window to your soul.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.600]   It's a window to something inside of you.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.720]   Now, this is very interesting
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.460]   because you look at the book of Psalms,
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.040]   there were 150 Psalms recorded,
[00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.720]   being collected together.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.880]   And those Psalms are actually prayers of people to God,
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.560]   words of humans to God.
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.020]   And at the same time, we collected those Psalms,
[00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.680]   and those Psalms are collectively God's word to us, right?
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.740]   So 100%, they are prayers to God, right?
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.620]   From a human poet, from a human player,
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:19.440]   playing a song, playing a prayer to God.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.040]   At the same time, it is God speaking to us.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.320]   If you run out of materials for your quiet time
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.760]   or devotions, you always can go back
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.080]   to the book of Psalms, right?
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.620]   You never get tired of thinking about,
[00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.900]   pondering on the words of the Psalms.
[00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.480]   So, you look at the 150 Psalms,
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.940]   you find all this kind of colors,
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.260]   and all this kind of emotions.
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.420]   And that's why I want to ask you how you feel today.
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.620]   How are you feeling in the past week?
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.260]   Let's process your emotions, right?
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.120]   Life is hectic, right?
[00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.860]   You have to take care of many, many different things,
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.240]   and you have to tackle different challenges and issues.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:07.400]   But it's time for you to come before the presence of God
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.700]   to process your emotions.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.740]   How do you feel today, right?
[00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.040]   How do you feel today?
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.200]   And let us go to Psalm 63.
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:22.940]   Now, as we read through some of the verses of this Psalm,
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.680]   I want you to understand and hear
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.760]   what David is trying to say, his prayers,
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:37.260]   his words to God, and how did he feel.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.480]   A Psalm of David.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.400]   And he was in the wilderness of Judah.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.640]   "O God, you are my God.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.600]   "Earnestly I seek you.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.720]   "My soul thirsts for you.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.860]   "My body longs for you.
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.160]   "In the dry and withered land, where there is no water,
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.120]   "I have seen you in the sanctuary,
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.700]   "and beheld your power and your glory.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.000]   "Because your love is better than life,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.240]   "my lips will glorify you."
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.640]   The first few verses that we have just read
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.720]   are the prayers of David.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:17.080]   And he made this prayer, he made this Psalm,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.160]   he composed this Psalm, where?
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.620]   In the wilderness, right?
[00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.220]   In the wilderness of Judah.
[00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.060]   Now, if you go back to the background of the Psalm,
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.720]   you will understand wilderness is actually part
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.960]   of the landscape of Israel.
[00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.780]   It's part of the landscape, a default geographical setting
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:43.620]   of any Israelite living in the land of Canaan.
[00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.180]   They know where the wilderness is.
[00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:50.100]   You climb the mountain and you descend the other side,
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.180]   you will see wilderness.
[00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:54.620]   The land of Israel is very interesting.
[00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.280]   It's very engaging.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.460]   Next week, I'm leading about 10 people
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:02.040]   going to the land of Israel.
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.880]   It's gonna be interesting.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.960]   I want to tell you something, it's very interesting.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.620]   When we drive from west to east,
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:12.080]   we drive west to east,
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.140]   you see a total different two worlds.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.880]   All right, let me show you how.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.160]   The land of Israel, going from left to right,
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.960]   from west to east, is actually a mountain
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.500]   climbing all the way up to almost about 2,000 feet
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.840]   above sea level, 2,500 feet.
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.300]   That's where Jerusalem is.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.380]   Can you see that?
[00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.640]   Can you make it out?
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.960]   And then after Jerusalem, you continue to drive,
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.160]   and then you will continue to descend
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.140]   in terms of elevation.
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.620]   You continue to descend and you can hear it,
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.680]   you can sense it because your ears pop, right?
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:53.960]   Because you are descending so much
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.180]   to the lowest point on earth,
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.420]   1,400 feet below sea level.
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.380]   It's very interesting to drive from left to right
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:06.620]   and from west to east,
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.720]   because when you pass Jerusalem,
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.280]   there's a tunnel in Mount of Olives.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.420]   You go through that tunnel,
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.060]   before you went through the tunnel,
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.540]   everything looks kind of green.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.420]   After you went through the tunnel,
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.460]   you went to the right side,
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.320]   the right side of the blue line,
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:25.320]   where the water shadows.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.380]   After you pass that, everything looks brown and yellow,
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.760]   because there's no grass growing
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.540]   on the other side of the,
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.580]   the right side of the watershed.
[00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.740]   Now, what is important is the watershed, the blue line,
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.440]   because the rain cloud is moving from left to right,
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.900]   from west to east.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:49.260]   And when the rain clouds move through the land,
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:51.560]   especially in the rainy season, the winter season,
[00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.700]   about October to March,
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.480]   it will rain on the left side of the watershed.
[00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:00.080]   And then after the rain clouds go through,
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.000]   went through the watershed line,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.600]   there's no more rain.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.160]   So after that watershed,
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:09.100]   there's no more rain on the right side of the watershed.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.960]   So let me show you two pictures.
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:13.280]   You'll see the difference.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:17.440]   The left picture is the left side of the watershed.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.660]   You see kind of green, right?
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.380]   Most of the time, there are greens.
[00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:27.360]   And then after you move through the,
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.560]   past the line of watershed, past Jerusalem,
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.880]   you will see everything is dry, right?
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:34.100]   Everything is so dry.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:35.800]   It's like desert.
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:38.140]   That is wilderness of Judah.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:43.600]   So for Israelite, for the people of God,
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.000]   in the Old Testament, they know what wilderness is.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.800]   They climb the mountain and they will see wilderness.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.200]   They will go into the wilderness.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:57.340]   And David, as the title of the psalm says,
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:00.860]   he wrote the psalm in the wilderness of Judah.
[00:09:00.860 --> 00:09:04.240]   Now, because wilderness is kind of default setting
[00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:07.240]   for David and for the people of God,
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:13.660]   wilderness becomes a metaphor, a metaphor of life.
[00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:17.840]   It represents testing and tough times
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:21.740]   you have to go through in your life.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.260]   Challenges and trials and temptations.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:28.180]   And from the landscape, you see the soul scape.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:33.180]   What is going on in your life, right?
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.500]   Perhaps today, you are going through some wilderness.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.260]   Perhaps recently, life has been tough for you.
[00:09:41.260 --> 00:09:43.600]   Life has been challenging to you.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:47.160]   And because of the background of the psalm,
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:49.660]   we understand this wilderness.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.520]   It's unavoidable.
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.400]   There's no way you can avoid it, right?
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.440]   You lost a job, that's a time of wilderness.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:04.780]   You lost someone you love, that is time of wilderness.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:08.080]   You lost some of the good things in life,
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:11.840]   that is a time of testing, time of wilderness.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:15.400]   Now, the most important question is,
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.780]   if you are going through wilderness, what do you do?
[00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.120]   How do you maintain and sustain yourself
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:27.180]   through wilderness, through the dry
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.200]   and weary season of your life?
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.040]   And here, the psalmist David said,
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:37.460]   "Oh God, you are my God.
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:42.040]   "Earnestly I seek you, my soul thirsts for you,
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.880]   "my body longs for you.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.480]   "In a dry and weary land of wilderness, there is no water."
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:50.080]   What is he doing?
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:52.520]   You know, something is not right in his life.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:54.920]   And in fact, the context tells us,
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:59.520]   if you continue to read Psalm 63, he was on the run.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:01.280]   David was a fugitive.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.740]   You know some stories of David
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.320]   in the book of First and Second Samuel.
[00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:12.200]   He got a lot of enemies trying to kill him,
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.360]   pursue him, and take his kingship and take his power.
[00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.980]   So he was on the run.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:23.480]   And where are you gonna run when there is trouble?
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.040]   Where are you gonna run when you are pursued by enemies?
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.180]   You run into wilderness.
[00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:30.280]   It is a land of fugitives,
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.280]   land of escape,
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.420]   land of going through some tough time.
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.200]   Wilderness becomes a metaphor for all of us.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.280]   And he was on the run, and he was praying the psalm
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:46.200]   in the wilderness where there's no water.
[00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.320]   It was time of testing for him.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:51.520]   And of course, if you're in the wilderness,
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.360]   the first thing you want is water.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.900]   You need water.
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.900]   When you are thirsty, you need a glass of water.
[00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:04.320]   I go to Israel quite often,
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:07.960]   and the most important thing you need to bring
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.760]   when we are on a day trip,
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:14.120]   we leave our hotel or Airbnb very early in the morning,
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.660]   and then there's a day trip for us,
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.320]   and we won't come back until probably evening,
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.040]   after sundown.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:22.700]   The most important thing in our backpack
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.120]   is the bottle of water.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:28.800]   You probably have to drink at least one to two liter
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.960]   of water every single day.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.960]   Dry and wiggly land.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.400]   The first thing you want, your body thirst for, is water.
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:42.040]   But David is doing something very interesting here.
[00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:44.840]   He transformed his physical experience
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.180]   into a spiritual experience.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:52.620]   He take that as a spiritual transformation moment.
[00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:55.120]   It's for him to yearn for God.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.040]   Because if you know,
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:01.340]   if you have gone through life for some period of time,
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.360]   whether you're going through some really tough time,
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.320]   or your lack of money, you worry,
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.640]   or you deal with a lot of negative emotions,
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:12.900]   you need to understand that
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.740]   in terms of the physical body,
[00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:19.380]   the water can do something to your body,
[00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.820]   can crunch your thirst.
[00:13:21.820 --> 00:13:24.520]   But there's emptiness in your life.
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.640]   Water cannot crunch.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:31.200]   There's only one thing that can crunch the thirst,
[00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:33.260]   crunch your yearning.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:36.640]   And Psalm 63 says, "It is God."
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:37.960]   God himself.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.460]   Only God can fulfill and make you satisfied
[00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.220]   from the inside out, from your heart.
[00:13:46.220 --> 00:13:50.260]   So seek God and thirst for God.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:53.840]   That is what David does in the wilderness.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.580]   Notice what he says, "You are my God."
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.060]   My God.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:01.900]   Now usually the English pronoun,
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.020]   we don't think it is important.
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.260]   But in this Psalm, verse one,
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.100]   "God, you are my God."
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:10.700]   God of mine.
[00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:12.780]   That personal pronoun is important.
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:15.620]   Because for David, God is his God.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:18.240]   His personal God.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.660]   He has a vibrant, personal, living relationship
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:24.280]   with God himself.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:27.700]   So God for David is not someone else's God.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:30.220]   It's not some other pastor's God.
[00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.480]   It's not some other family member's God.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.520]   It's not some other friend's God.
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:36.680]   Why so often we associate with God
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:38.200]   and our relationship with God
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.860]   is by other associations, right?
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:44.260]   I have a good friend who is very good Christian,
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:45.780]   who is very solid Christian,
[00:14:45.780 --> 00:14:48.140]   who is very, very solid believer.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:51.220]   And because of him, I kind of close to God, right?
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.660]   But it's got your God.
[00:14:53.660 --> 00:14:56.980]   It's got your personal, relatable being.
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:02.540]   Self-sufficient in the wilderness.
[00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.960]   David said, "You are my God."
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:10.820]   God and me is a personal relationship.
[00:15:10.820 --> 00:15:13.740]   I'm not sure where you are in your relationship with God.
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:16.500]   Can you really call God your God?
[00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   Can you really call Jesus your savior,
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.200]   your Lord and your leader?
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:26.360]   Yours, not someone else's.
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:30.020]   Personal relationship in the wilderness.
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:33.260]   He remembers his relationship with God.
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:37.540]   And that's the thing, that helps him.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:41.480]   I want to challenge you.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.760]   You probably heard of Jesus.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:44.720]   You probably accept the gospel,
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.560]   you know, here and there for some time.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.640]   But can you really pray 63 verse one?
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.180]   "Oh God, you are my God.
[00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.120]   "And Jesus, you are mine."
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:56.720]   Right?
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.120]   And secondly, what does he do?
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.160]   He recalls his past experience with God.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.280]   He continues his prayer.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.780]   He says, "I have seen you in the sanctuary,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.800]   "in the temple, in the temple of Jerusalem."
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:14.800]   David used to be a worshiper, regularly, weekly,
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:18.420]   on Shabbat, on Sabbath, Sunday.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:23.800]   He goes to the temple, he goes to the court,
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.220]   worshiping God with the community, right?
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:31.180]   He remembered that in the wilderness.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.360]   I really appreciate the comment made previously
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.780]   about the need for community.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:40.420]   Need for a friend, right?
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:43.060]   You know, in my circle, recently there was a big news
[00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:45.400]   about some people being lured
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:50.780]   into a human trafficking trap.
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:57.900]   You know, in my circle, there's some people from Hong Kong.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:01.820]   They are being tempted by some human trafficker
[00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:06.540]   to go to Cambodia or Thailand
[00:17:06.540 --> 00:17:09.460]   to make some big money, right?
[00:17:09.460 --> 00:17:10.780]   And they're being tempted
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.100]   because there's so lack of money, right?
[00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:16.340]   They wanna make some quick money, quick income,
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:19.380]   and that's why they got themselves into the trap
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.560]   and they followed the head of the human trafficking scheme
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:27.060]   and went to Cambodia,
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:32.820]   and they never able to return, they disappeared.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.980]   It's a horrible news.
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:36.900]   It's a horrible news.
[00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:39.820]   There's no bottom line in morality.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:45.400]   But what they did was that they were in a time of weakness,
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.700]   time of wilderness, so to speak,
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.860]   and they are being tempted to get some quick money
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:58.540]   but got themselves into huge trouble.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:03.880]   What David did in the wilderness
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.780]   is that he recall something
[00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:09.520]   that he had experienced with God.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.020]   Memory defines us.
[00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:17.340]   Think of your memory, your spiritual memory.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.380]   What do you remember?
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:23.300]   Reading the Bible, God speaking to you,
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:25.800]   the Holy Spirit touching your life.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:27.220]   You know, here and there,
[00:18:27.220 --> 00:18:31.980]   there must be some sort of spiritual encounter with God.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:35.320]   Some people would encounter God with a different ways.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.140]   Some people would encounter God
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:39.600]   in a totally different means,
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.080]   and some people would cry for three days.
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:45.980]   Some people would just feel it, and life goes on.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:47.540]   But those are real experience.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.280]   Those are real spiritual encounter with God,
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:53.260]   and that goes into our memory,
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.780]   and this is what exactly what David is doing.
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:19:00.940]   He recall in his memory, in the midst of wilderness,
[00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:03.320]   in the midst of tough time.
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:05.100]   Do you do that?
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:08.360]   Do you do that when life gets difficult?
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:10.120]   When life gets tough?
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.100]   You recall memories with God, right?
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:17.600]   I wonder if you have ever lived with someone
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:20.680]   who has suffered Alzheimer's disease.
[00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:24.420]   Have you ever?
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.940]   Have you ever?
[00:19:25.940 --> 00:19:29.260]   For some years, my mother-in-law
[00:19:29.260 --> 00:19:32.680]   was suffering Alzheimer's disease.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:36.260]   Now, Alzheimer's disease is painful to see.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.860]   It's painful to experience with her,
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.740]   because at least physically,
[00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.740]   I mean, her organs or body functions
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.340]   are continually deteriorating.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:51.380]   But I think the most painful thing
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.860]   to see her going through suffering Alzheimer's disease
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:57.700]   is the loss of memory.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.040]   She lost much of her memory,
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.160]   and she lost herself.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.500]   She doesn't know who she is.
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:12.080]   Not to mention where she is, right?
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.180]   I remember that one time, she always go out for a walk,
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:19.760]   and there was one afternoon, I came back home,
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:24.020]   and we came back home, and we don't find her.
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:26.680]   So we're kind of very desperate.
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:31.880]   And then I drove my car around the neighborhood,
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:34.740]   every single block, searching for her.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:38.940]   And all of a sudden, on Western Avenue, on Western,
[00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.620]   I found a cop, and there she is.
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:47.700]   The cop is talking to her, but she doesn't know English.
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:52.100]   She doesn't know where she is.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:54.880]   And then, thank God, we found her.
[00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:57.100]   And then I talked to the cop, and he says,
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.720]   "My mother-in-law, okay, I want to pick her up."
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.360]   So he was kind enough, and no question asked,
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:05.200]   and we bring her home.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.580]   It's painful to see that she just don't know where she is.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.740]   She don't know who she is.
[00:21:12.740 --> 00:21:18.020]   And after she came home, a couple hours later,
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.460]   we asked her, "What happened?
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:22.820]   "What happened, Mom?"
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.400]   She cannot recall.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.200]   She cannot recall.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.300]   And I told her, "We were searching for you.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.280]   "You got lost in the neighborhood,
[00:21:31.280 --> 00:21:34.000]   "and some of the neighbors encountered you
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.120]   "and called the police.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:37.320]   "That's why you came home."
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.500]   And she cannot remember, recall any of this experience.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.700]   I think God is merciful to those people,
[00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.220]   because they just don't know who they are.
[00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.720]   And they even cannot sustain their belief.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:01.540]   If you ask her questions about faith,
[00:22:01.540 --> 00:22:04.040]   she cannot respond positively.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:07.240]   Memory loss.
[00:22:07.240 --> 00:22:08.900]   Now, what I'm trying to say is,
[00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:11.300]   memory is a powerful thing.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:12.800]   Memory defines us.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.000]   When you meet someone who's new to you,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.320]   meaning a new friend, what do you ask?
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:21.320]   How do you know someone?
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.780]   Hearing the story, right?
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:26.180]   If you want to get to know someone
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:29.640]   or introduce yourself to someone else, what do you do?
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.200]   You talk about yourself.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:33.980]   You talk about your story, your history,
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:35.960]   your memory, where it came from,
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:39.360]   and what did I do, and what happened to me
[00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.900]   in the past few years, or whatever.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.980]   It's your memory that connects with other people.
[00:22:45.980 --> 00:22:49.020]   And memory is a powerful thing.
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.860]   And in the wilderness, Psalm 63,
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:54.400]   David is recalling his past experience with God.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:57.700]   I have seen you with my own eyes.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.240]   The sanctuary, the temple, the glorious temple,
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:05.440]   the sacrifice, the songs that I hear,
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:08.780]   the choirs that are singing the praise and worship.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:11.120]   Other people of God in the community.
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.300]   That's why his spiritual life is vibrant.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.280]   Now, how do you sustain yourself?
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.860]   How do you even grow in the wilderness?
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:22.020]   The answer is to remember.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.740]   To memorize what God has done in your lives.
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:31.740]   So often we think when life is not going well,
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.600]   only if God can turn around my bad situation,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.880]   then everything will go well, right?
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:38.960]   This is our naive prayer.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.660]   Now, of course we want to get healing, right,
[00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:43.880]   when we're sick.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:45.480]   Of course when we lack of money,
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:49.580]   we want God to shower us some cash, right?
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:53.400]   Turn around our circumstances, turn bad into good,
[00:23:53.400 --> 00:23:55.720]   and then we'll praise God, we'll thank God, right?
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.360]   No, of course, we'll pray that way, right?
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:00.940]   We'll pray in that orientation.
[00:24:00.940 --> 00:24:05.340]   But don't you know, at least from the Old Testament,
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:06.900]   or from our real life situation,
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:11.060]   when people find themselves, everything is going well.
[00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:13.080]   It's going well.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:16.020]   They forget about God.
[00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:19.960]   For the Old Testament, story after story,
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.840]   the people of God, when God bless them,
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:26.260]   they forget about God, right?
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:31.080]   They forget about Him, and they follow the idols.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:32.580]   They follow money.
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:35.960]   They worship gold and silver.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.880]   This is the irony in our relationship with God.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:43.940]   However, David is not praying
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:48.260]   that God will take him out of wilderness.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:51.340]   In the wilderness, he recall his past experience.
[00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:55.500]   He recall his experience of worshiping God in the temple,
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:59.500]   worshiping God with other people.
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:04.880]   And guys, this is how you keep yourself,
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.320]   sustain yourself in the presence of God,
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:09.960]   in the love of God.
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:13.960]   It does not merely depend on your circumstances.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:20.100]   It does not depend merely on your external condition.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.480]   It is right here, the soul scape.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.800]   It's not the landscape that defines you.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.960]   It's the soul scape.
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:31.300]   It's your relationship with God Himself.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:37.360]   I remember I had a really good friend,
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.020]   and his life really inspired me.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:44.600]   What it means to be a Christian.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.440]   You know, he's a very humble man, very quiet man,
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.300]   but his faith is rock solid.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:52.640]   I remember in his last days,
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:56.460]   I went to ICU to visit him.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.380]   He couldn't talk.
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:01.400]   He couldn't talk.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.760]   He could only say a few words.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:06.100]   But his faith is rock solid.
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.920]   Now that inspires me because,
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:12.180]   not because he was so blessed, right?
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.380]   Not because everything is going well with him.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:16.420]   On the other hand, he's not going well, right?
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:18.040]   He was suffering from cancer.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.880]   But in his whole life,
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.480]   he becomes inspiration for many of us,
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.480]   because even in times of wilderness,
[00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   he lives in the presence of God.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.080]   He and God have a relationship.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:39.420]   Have a close, personal relationship.
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.340]   And that inspired me because of his faith.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:46.500]   He reminds me there is some other reality in the world.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:50.540]   It's not just something we can hear
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:52.280]   or we can touch right now.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:53.740]   It's not just here and now.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.220]   There is another world.
[00:26:55.220 --> 00:26:59.300]   There is another hope that transcends everything.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.660]   That inspires me.
[00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.320]   The goodness of God.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.780]   Now we will continue to study the psalm,
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:10.140]   but I want to leave you this challenge today.
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:12.060]   Is God really your God?
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:16.160]   Or you just follow your friends?
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.380]   Yeah, we have a good time, right?
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.880]   But God is just someone else's, not yours.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.380]   You are my God.
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:27.800]   Earnestly I seek.
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.340]   And if you find yourself in times of wilderness,
[00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:34.880]   I pray that your life will continue
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:37.500]   and completely transform.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:39.680]   It's not just a quick fix.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:41.380]   All right, everything goes well.
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.100]   And then I forget about God.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:44.520]   And life goes on.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:49.380]   God is taking the landscape into your soul scape.
[00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:54.400]   He's working something transformative in your spirit
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:59.180]   so that you will draw closer and closer to God.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.960]   Let's all pray together.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.060]   No matter where you are
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.340]   and what is going through in your life.
[00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.060]   I pray that you take a moment before God
[00:28:09.060 --> 00:28:10.820]   to reorient yourself.
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:16.600]   God, thank you.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:20.000]   You are the God who listens to our prayers.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.660]   Thank you for all the emotions that we encounter.
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.640]   All the emotional highs and lows
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.220]   that you allow to have happen in our lives.
[00:28:32.220 --> 00:28:35.220]   For our experience to transform us,
[00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.380]   to bring us closer to you.
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:41.620]   I pray especially for those sisters and brothers
[00:28:41.620 --> 00:28:44.420]   who are going through some tough time of wilderness
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.620]   where there's no water and they're exhausted.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:49.820]   I pray for your strength.
[00:28:49.820 --> 00:28:53.300]   I pray that your presence will be real to them.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.700]   You will walk through the wilderness with them.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.700]   You will be with them.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:01.780]   You will let them sense your presence
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:06.120]   as something so real that we can take it
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:10.360]   and call you our God, our personal God.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:16.180]   And thank you for being our great and faithful Lord.
[00:29:16.180 --> 00:29:20.660]   I pray that every step of the way in this coming week,
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:24.820]   you will grant strength and grace to your people.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.980]   That your church will be built up
[00:29:26.980 --> 00:29:30.140]   and your people will be closer to you.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:32.800]   In Christ's name, we pray, amen.
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   Amen.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:34.640]   Amen.
