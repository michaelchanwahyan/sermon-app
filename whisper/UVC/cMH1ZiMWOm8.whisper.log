[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520]   Good morning, UV.
[00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.920]   I hope all of you are able to stay cool this past week.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.040]   I'm thankful for just the church here.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.440]   Mark brought a portable AC on Monday,
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.200]   so it came in clutch for me this week.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.340]   But before we get into the word, let's pray.
[00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.780]   Heavenly Father, we thank you
[00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:26.600]   that we are able to come together this morning
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.700]   and be here worshiping you and fellowship.
[00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.220]   We find another, I just ask that,
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.120]   as we're about to open up your word and study your word,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.560]   I ask that your Holy Spirit will be with us,
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.600]   that your spirit will open up our heart
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.400]   so that we're able to receive what you have for us today.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.440]   And I ask that your word will be transforming in our life
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.480]   and that it will, yeah, just make a change
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.280]   in the way that we live our life.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.200]   And I also ask for your spirit will be with me as I preach
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.400]   and that you would take away anything
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.360]   that is not from you and that your word,
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.320]   and your word alone will be preached today.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.020]   Pray this in the son's name, amen.
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:11.140]   Okay, so I've been at UV for about two months now,
[00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.660]   and usually on Sunday morning,
[00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:13.860]   right before the English service,
[00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.200]   you can find me serving over at the kids ministry.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.740]   And one of the things that I noticed,
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.820]   especially with some of the younger kids,
[00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.860]   every time when they're being told to do something,
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.180]   they usually like to do the opposite.
[00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.360]   Wendy's right here so he can testify to that.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.400]   And one of the prime example of this is,
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.960]   we have one song that is called "Jesus is Alive."
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.280]   So usually at the beginning of the song,
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.760]   they will ask them to like hop around,
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.000]   clap their hands, stomp their feet.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.560]   And then right in the middle of the song,
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.880]   there'll be a part where it would say, "Everybody freeze."
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.640]   And this started off with just one kid,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.960]   and then more and more kids just like follow along.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.680]   So basically, every time when the song starts,
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.280]   them to clap their hands or like stomp their feet,
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.020]   they would just like stand there and like not move at all.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.060]   When it comes to the part where the song told them to freeze,
[00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.460]   they would start like running around
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.540]   and then like clap their hands
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.000]   and basically just do the opposite
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.860]   of what they were being told.
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.940]   And while some of them think that they're funny
[00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.360]   and like sneaky, not trying to let the teachers recognize it,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.620]   but when you do things in an opposite
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.180]   with like basically the rest of the room,
[00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.180]   it is not hard to notice about it.
[00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.660]   And so in the same ways, in the Greco-Roman world,
[00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.380]   one of the reason that Jesus causes such a huge stir
[00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.980]   during his time on earth
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.560]   is because his teaching and his lifestyle
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.380]   is actually completely opposite
[00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.640]   compared to the culture around him,
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.180]   that the people cannot help but notice it.
[00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.260]   So today we'll take a look at the Jesus Sermon on the Mount
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.160]   and what this upside down kingdom of God looks like.
[00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.220]   So every country in the world,
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.960]   in some ways there is certain guiding principles
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.940]   when it comes to the governance
[00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.820]   and the ruling of the country, right?
[00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:57.100]   So I have to look it up for the US constitution.
[00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.180]   These are some of the guiding principles,
[00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.980]   popular sovereignty, limited government,
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.180]   separation of powers, checks and balances and federalism.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.800]   And so similarly in the kingdom of heaven,
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.640]   there are certain guiding principles
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.300]   that outline what life in God's kingdom looks like.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.020]   And the place where this can be found
[00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.540]   is on Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.100]   So starting off today,
[00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.140]   I will kick off a series on Jesus's Sermon on the Mount.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.180]   And throughout this series,
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.020]   we will explore what life in the kingdom of God
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.060]   or kingdom of heaven.
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.300]   I will use this term interchangeably.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.820]   So I hope you guys don't get confused.
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.900]   So kingdom of God, kingdom of heaven,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.260]   in the book of Matthew, they refer to the same thing.
[00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.380]   So the Sermon on the Mount
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.320]   contains some of the most elaborate teachings of Jesus
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.180]   on how we are to live rightly in his kingdom.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.020]   And some of you might ask,
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:48.980]   so Chi, you have been talking about God's kingdom
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.260]   of this kingdom of heaven for a while now,
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.460]   but what exactly is God's kingdom
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.900]   or this kingdom of heaven?
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.020]   So we can actually spend an entire sermon series
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.320]   just on this topic.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.520]   But one of the important aspects of God's kingdom
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.780]   that I want to highlight today
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.020]   is that this kingdom of God is already, but not yet.
[00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.840]   It is already, but not yet.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.680]   So some of you might already be familiar with this term,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.400]   but the already of this kingdom refers to
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.380]   when Jesus died and rose again 2000 plus years ago.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.780]   In some ways, he ushers in a new kingdom,
[00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.100]   a kingdom of heaven here on earth.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.120]   And so what that means is that in some ways,
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.020]   we're actually living in this kingdom of heaven right now.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.500]   However, this kingdom is not yet fully being realized.
[00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:34.280]   This is why we still see a lot of brokenness around us.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:39.280]   This is why we still see sufferings and pain,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.660]   those of the, those brokenness around us.
[00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.980]   So this is actually the not yet part of God's kingdom.
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.020]   And this will only come in full realization
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.420]   when Christ come again in the future.
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:52.540]   And what does this already, but not yet aspects
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.160]   of God's kingdom meant for us?
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.780]   As we continue to explore this series,
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:58.900]   I think it will be helpful to keep in mind
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.420]   that this counter-cultural way of living
[00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:04.100]   laid out by Jesus in his sermon on the mount
[00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.900]   is something that all believers, we should aim towards,
[00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.980]   we should work towards on this side of heaven.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.880]   At the same time, we also have to understand
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.340]   that God's perfection can only be attained
[00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.220]   when Jesus comes again.
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:20.740]   So the sermon on the mount, even though there are,
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.040]   it can seems like a rules or set of regulation
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:24.120]   for us to follow.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.780]   But I want to emphasize this,
[00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:28.380]   that this is not supposed to be a burden
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.620]   or a set of impossible rules that no one can live up to.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.820]   But this is supposed to be an invitation
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.380]   to a way of life that will lead to blessings
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:39.300]   and a way of life that will lead to flourishing as well.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.000]   So before I would get into a passage today,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.740]   I just want to give an overview
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:47.260]   for the entire sermon on the mount as a whole.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.820]   So Jesus' sermon on the mount
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:50.540]   span across three chapters,
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.780]   from Matthew 5 all the way to Matthew 7.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.840]   And this is just not some random collections
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:00.900]   about Jesus that Matthew kind of like compiled
[00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.960]   and put it together.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.100]   But it is actually a very carefully designed
[00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.140]   and structured section.
[00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.980]   And it follows right from Jesus' preaching
[00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.540]   about the kingdom of heaven in chapter four,
[00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:13.560]   especially in verse 17.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.640]   So at the beginning of Matthew four,
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.520]   we see that Jesus,
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.880]   he was being tempted in the wilderness.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.600]   And after he basically able to resist
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.320]   all the temptation from the devil,
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:30.720]   he basically began his ministry right after that.
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.160]   And the central message that Jesus preached
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.720]   in his ministry is this.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.040]   So Matthew four, verse 17,
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.320]   "From that time on, Jesus began to preach,
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.120]   "repent for the kingdom of heaven has come near,
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.560]   "for the kingdom of heaven has come near."
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.380]   And so right following after that,
[00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:48.840]   beginning in Matthew five,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.200]   the sermon on the mount is basically
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.320]   where Jesus explains what he meant
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.820]   when he said the kingdom of heaven has come near.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:58.280]   And so I put together this,
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.640]   a slide about the structure
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:02.620]   on the sermon on the mount as a whole.
[00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.200]   So at the beginning and the end,
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.020]   there's the introductory narrative framework
[00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:09.040]   that basically set up the physical settings
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.000]   of this entire sermon on the mount.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.520]   And then we get to the main part of it,
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.240]   where there's an introduction,
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.360]   a main body and a conclusion.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.400]   So we'll be focusing on the introduction today.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.600]   And then there's the main body,
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.240]   which can further divide into three parts as well.
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:26.520]   The first part talking about the relationship
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.000]   between the law, the Old Testament law,
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   to the new covenant of Jesus.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.520]   And then the second part talks about religious hypocrisy,
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.320]   basically what true and false piety
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.920]   or being religious looks like.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.900]   And then the third part talks about
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:43.900]   how are we to relate with one another,
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.480]   the kingdom ethics or kingdom perspective.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:48.680]   And then this section's on sermon on the mount
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.700]   and with basically two different kind of ways,
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.660]   two different kind of fruits
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:54.000]   and two different kind of foundations.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.560]   Jesus basically is giving his audience an options.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.100]   You can either choose the way
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.500]   that will lead to fullness and blessings,
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.260]   or you can choose the way that leads to destruction.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.440]   And so if you're more of a visual learner,
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.920]   this is a video from the Bible project
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:15.020]   that they put together and we'll take a look at it.
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.140]   Hopefully it will work.
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:34.980]   - Gospel of Matthew is one of the earliest accounts
[00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:36.460]   of Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.260]   - And in chapters five through seven,
[00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:41.300]   we find a collection of Jesus's most well-known teachings
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.300]   often called the sermon on the mount.
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.900]   Here we learn what Jesus means when he announces
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.420]   that the kingdom of the skies has come near
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:51.220]   and what it looks like to participate in God's kingdom.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:54.020]   The whole sermon has been given a three part shape.
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.740]   There's the introduction, then the large main body,
[00:08:57.740 --> 00:08:59.220]   and then the conclusion.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.620]   The introduction announces the surprising
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:04.020]   counterintuitive identity of those
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.820]   who were part of God's kingdom.
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:07.360]   Then comes the main body of teaching
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.580]   where Jesus explores what he means
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.060]   when he calls his followers to be righteous.
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.180]   - What does he mean by righteousness?
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.980]   - Righteousness is about living in right relationship
[00:09:16.980 --> 00:09:18.900]   with God and with others.
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.220]   It's a character trait that creates justice
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:22.660]   and peace in the world.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.020]   Then the body of the sermon is like Jesus's manifesto
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:29.300]   on righteousness examined from three angles
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.980]   and three big parts.
[00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.780]   How this righteousness relates to the Torah,
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.500]   how this righteousness relates to religious practices
[00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:39.240]   of his day, and how this righteousness is expressed
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.340]   in our relationships with God and with neighbor.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:45.200]   Finally, Jesus concludes the sermon by calling people
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:47.960]   to make a choice about how they're going to respond.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.800]   - Okay, I see it.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.720]   Three main parts of this whole sermon
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:53.400]   and the middle part itself has three parts.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.800]   - Right, and then every one of these parts
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.880]   itself has three parts.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:01.280]   There is a lot of design in the structure
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.520]   of the sermon on the mount
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:05.420]   and we're gonna go over all of it.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.360]   In the introduction, Jesus offers a surprise announcement
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.240]   to the people standing in front of him.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:13.000]   They are invited to experience the good life
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.280]   of God's kingdom.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.340]   He first offers nine sayings that redefine
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:19.600]   who is experiencing the good life,
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.680]   commonly called the Beatitudes.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.120]   Here, we learn that those entering God's kingdom first
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:28.720]   are the lowly outsiders who hunger for righteousness
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.400]   and suffer as peacemakers.
[00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.800]   - Next, Jesus calls his followers salt of the land.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.640]   What's this all about?
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.680]   - In the Hebrew scriptures, salt is a symbol
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.280]   of God's long-lasting covenant relationship with Israel.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.840]   So Jesus is claiming that he and his followers
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.600]   are carrying Israel's covenant relationship
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.880]   to its fulfillment.
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:49.340]   - Next, Jesus calls them the light of the world
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.200]   and a city set up on a mountain.
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:54.320]   - Jesus is referencing here a promise from the prophet Isaiah
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.880]   that one day the inhabitants of Jerusalem
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.060]   would reflect God's light and peace and blessing
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.220]   out to all the world.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.880]   - So Jesus is saying that he and his followers
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.640]   are fulfilling that promise.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.480]   - Right, and how they go about doing that
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.560]   is what the rest of the Sermon on the Mount is all about.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:17.640]   - Okay, so I hope that is a helpful way
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.440]   to kind of illustrate this whole entire Sermon on the Mount.
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.200]   So let's look at Matthew five together.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:28.960]   And yeah, so Matthew five, verse one.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.720]   Now, when Jesus saw the crowds,
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   he went up on the mountainside and sat down.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:37.200]   His disciples came to him and he began to teach them.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.400]   So in this part, we basically find out the who
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.080]   and the where for this entire section
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.440]   on the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:46.240]   So the who, of course, there is Jesus up there,
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:49.100]   but then there's two different kind of like distinct groups
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:54.100]   that Jesus differentiates, the crowds and the disciples.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.720]   So the crowds are probably people
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.000]   that are on the outer circle of Jesus's life,
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.680]   and the disciples are in his inner circles.
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:04.520]   So Jesus began this by withdrawing from the crowds
[00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:08.200]   from the outer circle so that he can focus his time
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.420]   on his inner circle, the disciples.
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.520]   But the funny thing is at the concluding part
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.120]   of this entire Sermon on the Mount in chapter seven,
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.720]   we find that the crowd are present as well.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.880]   They probably hear that Jesus is like teaching
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:23.220]   his disciples in the mountain,
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:26.120]   and they kind of like follow him along as well.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.800]   So this is the who and the where.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:31.400]   So Jesus, he went up on a mountainside
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.640]   and sat down.
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:34.600]   So this is pretty much where the Sermon on the Mount
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.100]   gets its name, because Jesus is basically preaching
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:42.440]   this entire sermon in the settings of a mountain.
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:45.880]   And for us in the 21st century America,
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:48.040]   this might not mean a lot to us,
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.900]   but for some of the early Jewish followers of Jesus,
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.440]   and even some of the early Christians
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.280]   who are familiar with the Old Testament,
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.840]   when they see this or when they hear this,
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:00.960]   they will probably immediately recall the event
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.280]   in Exodus at Mount Sinai,
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.680]   where the Lord basically gave the laws through Moses
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.040]   to the people of Israel.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.320]   And so right here, Matthew is actually,
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.000]   in the way that he structure the Gospel of Matthew,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.800]   he's very intentional in presenting Jesus
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.440]   as the faithful Israel,
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.560]   who is able to live out God's law perfectly.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:25.600]   So I sort of like make a chart here
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.800]   that compare some of the parallel
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.120]   between the people of Israel in Exodus
[00:13:30.120 --> 00:13:32.680]   and also Jesus in the Book of Matthew.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.320]   So in the Book of Exodus,
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.000]   we have the Exodus event, right?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:39.160]   Where the people of Israel left Egypt.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.160]   And in the Book of Matthew,
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:43.280]   he also presented these stories about Jesus's life.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.620]   When Jesus was being born,
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:48.480]   like Herod is trying to basically kill all the babies.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:51.360]   So to escape that, Jesus's parents have to
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:52.960]   basically bring him along
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.520]   and like live in Egypt for a little bit.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.160]   And so once Herod,
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:14:01.560]   the Herod that is trying to kill all the babies was dead,
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:04.560]   Jesus and his family then moved out of Egypt
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:07.320]   and back to Jerusalem.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.720]   And so this is kind of like the parallel event
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.280]   to the Exodus in the Book of Exodus.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:15.960]   And right after the people of Israel left Egypt,
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.840]   they wander in the wilderness
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.080]   and they were being tempted for 40 years.
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:21.460]   And during this time,
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:23.680]   they make a lot of complaints to Moses.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:26.360]   When they have no food, when they have no water,
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:29.160]   they basically came to Moses and asked him like,
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:32.400]   "Why do you even bring us out of Egypt,
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.780]   where we would like starve to death?
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:35.680]   We would rather be slave in Egypt
[00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.680]   than to like die here in the wilderness."
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.920]   And so Matthew, in some way, he also present Jesus.
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.860]   Jesus was being tempted after 40 days and 40 nights
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.600]   of like fasting and praying.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.400]   He was being tempted at the end.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:53.400]   And yet in contrast to the people of Israel,
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:57.700]   Jesus, he was able to resist the temptation every time.
[00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:02.160]   And so, and then after the wilderness wandering,
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:04.540]   we also find in Exodus,
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:08.640]   there is also the narrative about God gave the law,
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.280]   the Old Testament, the Torah at Mount Sinai
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:13.000]   to the people of Israel.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:14.560]   And similarly in the Book of Matthew,
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:16.040]   here we find that Jesus preached
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.000]   about the kingdom of heaven on a mountain as well.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.280]   So there's kind of like the parallel
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:24.360]   of giving the Old Testament Torah from a mountain
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.320]   and Jesus preaching about this kingdom of heaven
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.960]   from a mountain as well.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.160]   So one thing to take note is that the Sermon on the Mount
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.400]   that Jesus gave, this is not a new set of Torah
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.020]   or new set of law that is supposed to replace
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.340]   the Old Testament law.
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.200]   But Jesus is actually bringing new light
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.940]   into this Old Testament law in light of his own coming.
[00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:45.560]   And his teaching is to become the ethical standards
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:48.800]   of righteousness for all the followers in this kingdom.
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:53.800]   So now we find out about the who and the where
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.040]   for this entire narrative and the following,
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.080]   we will find out about the what.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:01.120]   So Jesus begins his sermon by telling the audience
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.080]   what a good and blessed life in his kingdom look like.
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.840]   So all these sayings begins with the word blessed.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.960]   And blessed can just mean,
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.240]   simply just means having a good life
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.160]   or just having a happy life.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:15.340]   But right here in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:16.760]   in the Beatitudes specifically,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.320]   there's probably a nuance of someone
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.540]   that have God's favor upon them.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:24.640]   So verse three, he say,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.940]   blessed are the poor in spirit.
[00:16:27.940 --> 00:16:30.140]   If you have never heard of the Beatitudes before,
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:32.320]   or if you've never read this part of Matthew before,
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:35.120]   you might be like, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second, Jesus.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.940]   Who are the blessed one?
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.900]   The poor in spirit?
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:44.180]   I feel like this is a very surprising things
[00:16:44.180 --> 00:16:45.460]   if we listen to it in our,
[00:16:45.520 --> 00:16:49.320]   like in the current day and age that we live in, right?
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.860]   If we are to write our own Beatitudes,
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:55.360]   we will probably say, blessed are those who are wealthy,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:58.380]   or blessed are those who have everything that they need.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:03.320]   But for the first century Jewish audience of Jesus,
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:07.240]   living under the rule of the Roman Empire,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.300]   this actually speaks directly to them,
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:10.760]   because this group of people,
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.480]   they're basically a group of outcasts
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.600]   and nobody in the society.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:16.280]   And yet it is to these people,
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.160]   Jesus mentioned that they are the blessed one.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.420]   And so what does it mean to be poor in spirits?
[00:17:22.420 --> 00:17:25.320]   Right here, it refers to a kind of humility
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:28.060]   that understands our own powerlessness.
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:32.160]   And in turn, this leads us to completely depend on the Lord.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.880]   And it is to these people,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:38.320]   Jesus has promised that for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:41.080]   So I'm gonna get a little nerdy right here.
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:42.680]   If you look at the verb that I highlight
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.600]   on the second part of the Beatitudes,
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:47.440]   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.720]   And then the following is, for they will be comforted,
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:51.780]   they will inherit the earth.
[00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:56.080]   So we see the Beatitudes begin with this divine promise
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.600]   that is in the present tense,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.720]   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:02.200]   And it also, later in verse 10,
[00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.140]   it ends with the same promise,
[00:18:04.140 --> 00:18:06.520]   for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.720]   And then everything in between
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.400]   is actually in the future tense.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.200]   So even right here, the Greek grammar
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.320]   is trying to present this kingdom of God,
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:16.360]   this kingdom of heaven, as something that is already,
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.740]   that we can already experience in the here and now.
[00:18:19.740 --> 00:18:22.080]   But also not yet, that some part of it
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:24.740]   we can only experience when Christ comes again.
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:27.520]   So in other words, as believers,
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.880]   we are part of God's kingdom now,
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:32.080]   but the fullness of life in this kingdom
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.560]   can only be experienced in the future.
[00:18:34.560 --> 00:18:37.800]   And then Jesus continues,
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:41.800]   blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.000]   This is probably also surprising, right?
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.120]   Why are the mourning,
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:47.320]   why are the people that are sad or mourning,
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.580]   they are the blessed one?
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:51.920]   But right here, when Jesus talks about mourning,
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:53.560]   there's probably two different kind of causes
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:55.440]   that leads to this kind of mourning.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.400]   The first is probably familiar with,
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:59.840]   that the first one is probably something
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:01.420]   that we're all familiar with.
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:04.480]   We're mourning because of suffering or hardships,
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.840]   or just things or life that are difficult.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.440]   Things that are difficult in our life
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:11.560]   that causes us to mourn.
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.120]   But then there's a second kind of mourning
[00:19:13.120 --> 00:19:14.960]   that Jesus talks about here.
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.360]   This is the kind of mourning
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.860]   because of an awareness of our own sin.
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.200]   And we see this a lot in the Old Testament actually,
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.160]   when we will read that people will put on sackcloth
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.260]   and like put ashes on their head
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:30.760]   as a tangible expression of their mourning
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.620]   and also repentance from sin.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:36.000]   So right here, Jesus basically promised that
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.560]   when we turn to God in the attitude of mourning
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:41.240]   and repentance because of our own sin,
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:45.220]   God himself, he will forgive us and he will comfort us.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:48.440]   And then verse five continues.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.240]   Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.080]   And so similar to the first Beatitudes in verse three,
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:57.680]   the meek are those who have an awareness
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.340]   of their own circumstances.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.960]   And instead of thinking of themselves more highly
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.220]   than they should be,
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:06.080]   they understand that ultimately their strength
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.960]   and their power comes from the Lord and the Lord alone.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.360]   And besides the meek or the gentle,
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.280]   they are not just gentle towards themselves,
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:17.120]   but they're also gentle towards others as well.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.720]   And when they see that there are some injustice
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:21.360]   or oppressions around them,
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.600]   they will want to bring the justice
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.120]   and the righteousness of God into those situation.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.480]   And these are the people that God promised
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.520]   they will inherit the earth.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:34.620]   And to inherit something basically means
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:36.340]   you assume some sort of authority
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:38.140]   or control over them, right?
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:41.560]   So to inherit the earth here means that the meek,
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.640]   one day when Christ comes again,
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.860]   these are the people that will rule in the new heaven
[00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:49.940]   and new earth alongside Christ.
[00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:52.780]   And this is the promise that God gave to those
[00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:55.620]   who are the meek or the gentle.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.380]   And so this leads us to the next Beatitudes.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:02.060]   Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.980]   for they will be filled.
[00:21:03.980 --> 00:21:05.360]   And I'm sure we all have experienced
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:07.560]   some sort of hunger and thirst before, right?
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:08.980]   Maybe some of you sitting right here,
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:10.560]   you're already getting a little hungry
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:12.880]   and thinking about what will the lunch
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:14.140]   or the snacks be later.
[00:21:14.140 --> 00:21:17.700]   But how often do we actually hunger and thirst
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.600]   for godly thing?
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.820]   How often do we actually hunger and thirst for righteousness?
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.420]   Here Jesus say, blessed are those who hunger
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:28.420]   and thirst for righteousness.
[00:21:28.420 --> 00:21:30.140]   And to these people, Jesus promised
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:33.020]   that they will be satisfied, that they will be filled.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:37.060]   So one of the first four Beatitudes that we just look at,
[00:21:37.060 --> 00:21:40.940]   it focused on, in some ways, a kind of attitude or mindset
[00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:44.900]   for those who completely depend on the Lord in their life.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:47.100]   This next tree that we will look at,
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:49.580]   we'll actually focus on the actions of those
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:53.160]   who live for God as a result of the dependence on him.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:58.300]   So verse seven, blessed are the merciful,
[00:21:58.300 --> 00:21:59.820]   for they will be shown mercy.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.820]   And this is, again, pretty straightforward.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.780]   When we show mercy to others' people,
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:07.840]   we will receive mercy from God as well.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:11.580]   But the questions that, as I was preparing this,
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:15.340]   that I feel like God raised in my heart is this.
[00:22:15.340 --> 00:22:18.860]   Is our day-to-day life a good representation of the grace
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:22.020]   and the mercy that we have received from the Lord?
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:24.440]   I feel like, for me personally, this is,
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.900]   I don't think I can fully answer that question
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:30.660]   just because I feel like I have received a lot of grace
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.100]   and mercy from God, especially in this season.
[00:22:33.100 --> 00:22:35.960]   But if I honestly take a look at my life,
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.860]   a lot of times my life doesn't exemplifies that
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.840]   as someone that is merciful.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.180]   And then verse eight, blessed are the pure in heart,
[00:22:46.180 --> 00:22:47.820]   for they will see God.
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:50.400]   And so the pure in heart are basically those who love God
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.500]   with all their heart, with all their mind,
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:55.440]   with all their strength, and with all their soul.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.920]   And these people are basically the one that put Jesus
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.600]   as the center of their life,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:03.920]   put Jesus as the priority in everything that they do.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.640]   And Jesus say, these are the people that will see God
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:09.240]   in the new heaven and new earth.
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:14.520]   And then verse nine, blessed are the peacemaker,
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.960]   for they will be called children of God.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:19.760]   And when it comes to peacemaker here,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.920]   there's, again, two different kind of aspect
[00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.960]   to this peace that Jesus talks about.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.560]   To make peace, there's the aspect of peace with God,
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.480]   which is kind of like the vertical relationship
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:34.660]   between us and God, and also peace between people.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:39.300]   Basically means when we come together as people,
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:43.160]   are we able to maintain peace in our community,
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:47.200]   in our family, or in our country as a whole?
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:50.580]   Like, are we people that are actively pursuing peace
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:51.760]   in those situation?
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.480]   And these people, God promised that they will be called
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.080]   children of God.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:00.320]   And in the Old Testament, to become part of God's family,
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:01.560]   or to become children of God,
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:03.760]   you actually have to physically come
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.760]   from the line of Abraham.
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.780]   But in the New Testament, through Jesus Christ,
[00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:10.720]   we are able to reconcile to God
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:13.360]   and become part of his new covenant family,
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:15.680]   through Christ at the cross.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:19.320]   And as a result of experiencing this peace from God,
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:22.480]   the peacemaker then becomes agent of God's peace
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.080]   in the broken world around them.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.440]   And Paul highlight this in 2 Corinthians,
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:30.580]   that in some ways, we as God's people,
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.100]   we are being reconciled to God,
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:36.480]   so that we can continue to become reconciler
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:37.360]   in our own life.
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:40.580]   So this is 2 Corinthians 5, 18 to 19.
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:43.720]   All this is from God, who reconcile us to himself,
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:48.040]   through Christ, and gave us the ministry of reconciliation.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:51.720]   That God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ,
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:54.520]   not counting people's sin against them.
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.240]   And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:01.440]   So, if you have been following along,
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.240]   you can notice that there's a certain flow
[00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:05.240]   to these beatitudes, right?
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.280]   This part of the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.000]   So we begin by focusing on the attitude,
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.820]   or the mindset of those people that depend on the Lord.
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.760]   And as we live in submission to the Lord,
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:21.560]   this should, in some ways, lead to a certain actions
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:23.160]   in our day-to-day life, right?
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:26.200]   Like bringing peace to the brokenness around us,
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.460]   or showing mercy to the people around us.
[00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.800]   And lastly, as we live for God,
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.360]   and become his agent of grace and peace in this broken world,
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.820]   Jesus also warned us that the world,
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.560]   we should expect a certain kind of reaction from the world.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.560]   And in some ways, Jesus warned us that
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:48.040]   the world will actually be a hostile place for us.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.440]   And we find this in Jesus' last film moments
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.200]   with his disciples during the Last Supper,
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:54.960]   when he basically say this to them.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:58.560]   "If the world hates you, the disciples,
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.200]   "keep in mind that it hated me, Jesus first.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.220]   "If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:08.940]   "As it is, you do not belong to the world,
[00:26:08.940 --> 00:26:11.860]   "but I have chosen you out of the world.
[00:26:11.860 --> 00:26:13.960]   "And that is why the world hates you."
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.280]   So, when we try to live this counter-cultural life
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.880]   that represents our kingdom's citizenships
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.160]   in God's upside-down kingdom,
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:26.580]   the world will not be a comfortable place for us.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:27.780]   And this is the reality.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:31.500]   But the good news is that Jesus promised,
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.320]   right here in verse 10,
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.280]   "Blessed are those who are persecuted
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:38.280]   "because of righteousness,
[00:26:38.280 --> 00:26:41.440]   "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.560]   So, if you remember,
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.880]   the Beatitudes opened with the same divine promise.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.340]   "Blessed are the poor in spirit,
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.360]   "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:52.080]   And right here, it ends with, again, the same promise.
[00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:53.900]   "Blessed are those who are persecuted
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.520]   "because of righteousness,
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:58.760]   "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.600]   And so, this divine promise
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   that the kingdom of heaven basically belongs to us
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.500]   is actually presently available
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.160]   to all people who follow Jesus.
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.600]   So, let's sit with that for a moment.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.080]   What this means is that we can actually get a glimpse
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.860]   of life in the heaven, in the here and now,
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.260]   while we're still on earth.
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:24.340]   I think this is a privilege that we should not take lightly.
[00:27:24.340 --> 00:27:28.640]   And so, the next two verses then continues on
[00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:30.200]   to elaborate on this,
[00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:32.280]   but then it makes it even more personal.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.080]   So, we can see the switch from the third-person pronoun,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:37.840]   blessed are those, to a second-person pronoun,
[00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:39.380]   blessed are you.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:43.540]   So, Jesus say, "Blessed are you when people insult you,
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.760]   "persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:48.980]   "against you because of me.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:50.980]   "Rejoice and be glad,
[00:27:50.980 --> 00:27:53.720]   "because great is your reward in heaven.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:54.560]   "For in the same way,
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.120]   "they persecuted prophets who were before you."
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:01.480]   So, we just finished with the Beatitudes,
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.280]   with all the sayings that Jesus has taught.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.200]   And Jesus has shown us what privilege and blessing it is
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:12.720]   to become a citizen of his upside-down kingdom.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:15.580]   He then moved on to provide two metaphors,
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:18.400]   being the salt of the earth and the light of the world,
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.920]   to basically show us how citizens of his kingdom
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:25.760]   are supposed to be living on a mission for God.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.440]   And just as any earthly citizenships that we have,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:32.920]   our kingdom citizenships come with a certain privilege
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.800]   as well as responsibility.
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:37.000]   And this is a both-ends situation.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:38.800]   We can't just enjoy the privilege
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:40.600]   of being part of God's family,
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.380]   of being part of God's kingdom,
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.320]   without actually carrying any responsibility with it.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:49.080]   So, in other words, we are actually blessed by God
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.640]   so that we can continue to be a blessing
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.200]   to the world around us.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.540]   So, Jesus continues,
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:58.000]   "You are the salt of the earth,
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.640]   "but if the salt loses its saltiness,
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:02.800]   "how can it be made salty again?
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.800]   "It is no longer good for anything
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:07.640]   "except to be thrown out and trampled underfoot.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.840]   "You are the light of the world.
[00:29:09.840 --> 00:29:12.700]   "A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.
[00:29:12.700 --> 00:29:16.660]   "Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl.
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.680]   "Instead, they put it on its stand
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:21.900]   "and it gives light to everyone in the house.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:24.460]   "In the same way, let your light shine before others
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:26.300]   "that they may see your good deeds
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.580]   "and glorify your Father in heaven."
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:32.540]   So, right here, Jesus basically telling his disciples,
[00:29:32.540 --> 00:29:35.620]   "As salt and light, God has sent us on a mission
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:38.420]   "to show the world who Jesus is,
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.280]   "through the way we live our lives.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:44.160]   "And just like the salt that loses its saltiness,
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:46.760]   "if we have no positive impact in the world
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.500]   "or in the community around us,
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.260]   "we're basically of no use to God's kingdom.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:55.520]   "And on the other hand, as the light of the world,
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.780]   "our lives should actively point people to Jesus
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:00.400]   "through the way we live our life
[00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:03.000]   "and through the works that we have done."
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   And so, using these two metaphors,
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.640]   Jesus is trying to get this point across.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.000]   "As a citizen of God's kingdom,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:13.020]   "we must make a difference in the world.
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:15.160]   "And who we are and whose we are
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:18.180]   "should impact how we live our day-to-day life."
[00:30:18.180 --> 00:30:24.860]   So, we've come to the end to this whole introduction
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:27.060]   from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount, right?
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.780]   And the passage that we just looked through,
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:30.940]   this first 16 verse, in some ways,
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.100]   it is very straightforward, right?
[00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:37.060]   There's no sort of hidden meaning behind it
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:40.540]   or any part that is confusing or hard to understand.
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:41.700]   But I think the biggest challenge
[00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:44.580]   that comes with this passage
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.500]   is to be able to live it out, actually,
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:47.800]   in our day-to-day life.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:51.220]   If we take a look at our own lives now,
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.960]   can we say that our lives fully exemplify
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:57.100]   these kingdom qualities or these kingdom characteristics?
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:00.220]   You know, one of the things that I like to do
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:02.180]   during my free time is to go on a run.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:03.580]   And usually, on Saturday morning,
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:05.380]   I will go for a longer run.
[00:31:05.380 --> 00:31:07.340]   And so, these past two weeks,
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.900]   I've just been spending a lot of time
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.980]   just preparing this sermon,
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.760]   reading through Matthew, Chapter 5.
[00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:16.460]   And on one of my runs,
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.460]   so I was out there on Archer,
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:21.380]   and I came to the stoplight between Archer and Halstead.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.940]   So, when the light turns green,
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:27.260]   when I was about ready to cross,
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:29.140]   'cause the pedestrian is green as well,
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.180]   so when I was about to cross the road,
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:33.340]   there's this one car basically just ignore
[00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:35.660]   the pedestrian light,
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:38.260]   and he just make a left turn right in front,
[00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:39.860]   right when I step on the road,
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:41.780]   he just turn right in front of me.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.540]   And at that moment, I was pretty frustrated.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:45.140]   I was like, "What are you doing?
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:46.840]   "You almost ran over me."
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.200]   And in my mind, I was thinking,
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:53.200]   "I am on the right here because I follow the rules.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:55.300]   "The pedestrian light just turned green,
[00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:58.400]   "and you are a car you're supposed to give
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:00.780]   "the pedestrian the right of way, right?"
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.800]   So, at that moment, I was like,
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:03.540]   "Man, I am justified in my anger,
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:06.840]   "but this guy just doesn't follow the rule."
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.620]   So, as a reaction to it, I was like,
[00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:10.740]   I just do this as he drove past me,
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:13.580]   and then I stare at his car for a little bit.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:16.240]   And right when I cross to the other side of the road,
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.420]   one of the Beatitudes just pop out in my mind.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.740]   "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth."
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:25.040]   And right at that moment, I was like,
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.300]   "Oh, man, Lord, I am about to preach this sermon
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:31.580]   "in less than two weeks, and yet what I just did
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.840]   "is something that doesn't represent
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:36.080]   "what God's people should look like."
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.980]   And for the rest of my run, I was basically like praying,
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:41.480]   like asking for forgiveness, and kind of like
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:44.120]   asking the Lord to change me, to change my life,
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.840]   so that I can live in a way
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:48.160]   that truly represent His kingdom.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.560]   So, I'm sharing this not, yeah,
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.660]   just as a way of like being honest of like,
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:58.400]   these standards of righteousness that Jesus gave us
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.500]   is not easy, but this is actually an invitation
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:05.240]   to a way of life that will lead to flourishing
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.120]   and blessings, even though they might seem
[00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.040]   counter-cultural at times.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:10.800]   We saw kind of like Jesus teach about,
[00:33:10.800 --> 00:33:12.480]   "Turn the other cheek when people hit you,"
[00:33:12.480 --> 00:33:14.840]   or like, "Walk the extra mile when people ask you
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.360]   "to walk like a mile with them."
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:21.300]   So, these are the ways that as God's people,
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:24.600]   as followers of Jesus, this is how we should live our life,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.880]   because we are part of God's upside-down kingdom.
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:31.120]   So, what I want to leave you all with is this question,
[00:33:31.120 --> 00:33:35.440]   is some of these questions to reflect on for this week.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.960]   So, do we live our day-to-day life in a way
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.320]   that actively brings glory to God?
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   And to do it better, what are some of the things
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:45.520]   that we need to stop doing,
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:48.040]   and what are the things that we need to,
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.000]   oh, I put two stars there,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:52.360]   but what are some of the things that we need to stop doing,
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:54.820]   and what are some of the things that we need to start doing,
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:58.860]   so that our lives can be more of a better representation
[00:33:58.860 --> 00:34:02.120]   of who we are as kingdom, as people,
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.320]   as citizens of God's kingdom?
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:06.580]   So, I hope you can take some time this week
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.800]   just to pray about it, and reflect on your own life,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:13.080]   and see what God speaks to you.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.780]   So, let's pray.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:23.800]   Heavenly Father, we thank you that you show us
[00:34:23.800 --> 00:34:27.960]   the perfect examples of what it looked like
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.700]   to be a citizen in your kingdom through Jesus.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:34.200]   We thank you that through Jesus,
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.560]   we are able to be part of your kingdom.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.880]   And I just pray for us right here in this room
[00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.400]   that your Holy Spirit will be with us
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:46.000]   as we continue to live our day-to-day life.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.360]   So, I ask that your Spirit will point out to us
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:51.680]   the areas in our life that doesn't represent who you are.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:55.960]   I ask that your Holy Spirit will also be with us
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.440]   to give us the strength, to give us the ability
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.240]   to live in a way that truly exemplifies
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:06.320]   the God that we represent here on Earth.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.920]   So, I just ask that you will remind us
[00:35:08.920 --> 00:35:11.560]   that we are part of your kingdom,
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:13.300]   and it is such a privilege and honor
[00:35:13.300 --> 00:35:15.120]   to be part of your kingdoms.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.600]   And as your people, you have given us the mission
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.100]   to continue to bring your light
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:23.720]   to the darkness in the world around us.
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:25.200]   So, I just ask that your Holy Spirit
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.880]   will give us the power, give us the ability
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:31.480]   to live in a way that brings glory to you,
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:34.040]   that brings glory to your name.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   So, pray this in your Son's name, amen.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:40.680]   Okay, so Mark is not here today,
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.320]   so I will be dismissing you all.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.840]   But right before that, I just want to encourage you,
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:47.320]   we have some light refreshment outside.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:50.240]   So, don't just leave right after the service.
[00:35:50.240 --> 00:35:53.120]   Stay back, talk to people, catch up with some people,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:55.600]   fellowship, enjoy some good food.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:58.880]   Okay, go in peace, you be your love.
