[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   - So we have our pastor, Pastor Mark,
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.920]   who's gonna give our sermon today.
[00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.760]   - Thanks, Annie, thank you.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:09.800]   Well, we continue to ponder on this important question,
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.080]   how to build, how to grow a healthy church.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.580]   Again, we were at studying the book of 1 Corinthians.
[00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:23.220]   We were at chapter 12,
[00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.220]   and last week we studied the love poem of chapter 13.
[00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.260]   So today, let us turn to 1 Corinthians 14, all right?
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.680]   So these three chapters are the Trinity chapters.
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.200]   Three chapters together, 12, 13, and 14,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.980]   addressing the use of spiritual gifts.
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.620]   And actually, there was a bigger picture in mind.
[00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.900]   Paul is talking about church as a human body,
[00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.900]   as an analogy, that we are all different parts
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.780]   of this whole body, building up the body of Christ.
[00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.660]   And then 13, as you remember, the famous love poem,
[00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.480]   love is patient, love is kind,
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.480]   to help us to get a right orientation
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.980]   of how to use our talents and our gifts
[00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.100]   to build up the church.
[00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.340]   And now we are at chapter 14.
[00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.000]   And let me begin by reading the passage.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.300]   And there are two points in this chapter, chapter 14.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.260]   First is the importance of sound biblical teaching
[00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.700]   for growing a healthy church.
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.000]   That's the first point.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.180]   The second point is the value,
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.360]   the value of sound biblical teaching.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.180]   As I have reminded you, what a church should look like
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.560]   and what a church should be,
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.340]   is not our preferences or our opinions.
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.620]   It is not our suggestions that matter.
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.260]   The end of the day is the word of God,
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:02.100]   the final authority of God's revelation, the Bible.
[00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.860]   We come back to the Bible, we turn to the scripture
[00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.380]   and see what God has to say about our church,
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.120]   about church in general.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.740]   So 14, verse one,
[00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.660]   Paul is dealing with the use of spiritual gifts,
[00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.700]   especially the gift of speaking in tongues,
[00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.460]   speaking in unknown language.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.820]   14, one, pay attention.
[00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.820]   Paul says, "Let love be your highest goal,
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.100]   "but you should also desire the special abilities
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.980]   "or spiritual gifts the Spirit,
[00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.060]   "the Holy Spirit gives to all of us,
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.920]   "especially the ability to prophesy.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.520]   "For if you have the ability to speak in tongues,
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.080]   "you will be talking only to God,
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   "since people won't be able to understand you.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.060]   "You will be speaking by the power of the Spirit,
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.480]   "but it will all be mysterious.
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.040]   "But one who prophesies,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.800]   "who has the spiritual gifts of prophesying,
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.400]   "strengthens others, encourages others,
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.860]   "and comforts others."
[00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.740]   So Paul is making a contrast
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.980]   between the gift of speaking,
[00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.120]   well, how does the NLT translate it?
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.780]   Speaking in tongues, right?
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.300]   Or speaking in unknown language.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.740]   He's contrasting one set of spiritual gifts,
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.460]   speaking in tongues or in unknown language.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.740]   And then the other one is prophesying,
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.100]   speaking prophecy, you know, prophesying.
[00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.760]   So from this passage,
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.020]   we understand not all spiritual gifts are equal.
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.780]   Yes, the Holy Spirit will grant us different abilities
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.560]   or talents in the church,
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.020]   different members or different brother and sister,
[00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.700]   they have this set of gifts,
[00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.820]   or he has this set of abilities or talents,
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.600]   but not all spiritual gifts are of same importance.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.020]   Why?
[00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.560]   Now, some of the spiritual gifts are obviously stronger,
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.460]   according to Paul.
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.740]   Why does Paul say that?
[00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.340]   Because the Corinthian Christians,
[00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.460]   they were desiring, they want,
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.080]   or they're yearning for some sort of spectacular gifts.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.720]   You know, speaking in tongues,
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.320]   or speaking in unknown language, right,
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.960]   mysterious language, seems to them,
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.440]   the Corinthian Christians,
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.120]   would be something they wanna strive for,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.640]   they wanna pray for, and they want that kind of gifts.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.640]   And that sort of gifts probably look more spiritual to them,
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.400]   or look more supernatural to them,
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.400]   more spectacular to them.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.760]   But, you know, as Paul has emphasized
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.560]   throughout these chapters,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.600]   the Word of God is the standard.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.100]   When we return to the scripture
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.840]   and see what the Bible has to say about spiritual gifts,
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.960]   even though we are not part of that charismatic tradition.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   So what is Paul saying?
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.600]   Paul is saying, he has nothing against speaking in tongue.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.760]   He has nothing against that sort of spiritual gifts.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.860]   Some people will speak in tongue
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.920]   because the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit,
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:26.400]   God has granted them this sort of abilities.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.700]   But Paul seems to be doing something here.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:34.460]   He deprioritize, you know,
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.400]   try to put some of the gifts,
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.880]   especially speaking in tongue, to a lower priority.
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:43.840]   He elevate some of the gifts
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.840]   the Christians in Corinth were not seeking,
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.160]   the gift of prophecy.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:50.100]   Now, what does it mean?
[00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:51.300]   Okay, let's continue.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.600]   Verse five, he says,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.520]   "I wish you could all speak in tongues,
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.980]   "but even more, I wish you could all prophesy,
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:05.980]   "for prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues.
[00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.720]   "Unless someone is here in the public service,
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.000]   "when someone is speaking in tongues,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.320]   "someone interprets what you're saying,
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.240]   "so that the whole church will be strengthened."
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.660]   Now, as you can tell,
[00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:24.260]   he is definitely not against speaking in tongue in general.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.360]   But he said there was a greater gift,
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.200]   greater spiritual talent that has to be used
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.180]   when the church gathers, and that is the gift of prophecy.
[00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:36.020]   Now, what is prophecy?
[00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.440]   If you remember, I told you before,
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.540]   prophecy is not weather forecast, right?
[00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:44.040]   It was snowing outside, right?
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:47.080]   Right, it was snowing outside.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:50.120]   Prophecy, in general, in the Bible,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:52.960]   has nothing to do with weather forecast,
[00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:56.600]   whether it was snow at 3 p.m. today, 3.30 p.m. today,
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:59.200]   whether the forecast is correct or not.
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.000]   It has nothing to do with it.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.700]   Prophecy, in the Bible, is not so much prediction.
[00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.540]   It's about preaching.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:12.140]   It's about speaking the word of God
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.320]   according to the final standard of Scripture.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.080]   Authoritative preaching, you can translate that.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:23.420]   Prophecy is stronger according to Paul,
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:26.200]   because it trains your mind.
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:29.700]   You know, when the questions in Corinth,
[00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:31.940]   when they gather, you can imagine,
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.940]   like, say, we are the church in Corinth.
[00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:41.400]   Most of the people, they were looking forward
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.360]   to speak in tongue.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.360]   Somehow, this Holy Spirit touches them
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.040]   and give them the spiritual ability
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.240]   to speak in mysterious language
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:50.940]   so that they can draw closer to God.
[00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.560]   But Paul is saying, by exercising those gifts,
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.940]   speaking in tongue, you are drawing closer to God
[00:07:57.940 --> 00:07:59.760]   only by yourself.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.400]   And that's why that sort of gift, speaking in tongue,
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.360]   is lower in priority.
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.080]   What is higher in priority is that when the church gathers,
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   preaching, biblical teaching, has the higher priority.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:16.480]   When you come to church,
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.080]   when you come to a worship gathering,
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:24.080]   Paul says you need to seek for the gift
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:25.460]   of biblical teaching,
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.960]   the gift of sound doctrine,
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.560]   the gift of training our mind.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:36.340]   Because some of the people, when they are preaching,
[00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:38.120]   when they're explaining the word of God,
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:40.720]   they're expounding on the word of God,
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:43.200]   everyone else would understand, right?
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:46.560]   See, for example here, I'm using a language
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:48.940]   that everybody can understand, right?
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:54.240]   Otherwise, your mind will not be trained,
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.340]   and you will not be able to understand it.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:02.320]   I am speaking a common language everyone can understand.
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.120]   If you cannot understand, there is a radio to translate.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.600]   That's why we take this so seriously.
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:12.080]   We prepare the script, we prepare the sermon,
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:15.320]   and we prepare some teaching,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   drawn from the Holy Scripture.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:22.720]   Because when the church gather together,
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:27.460]   Paul is saying we need to know
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:30.520]   and understand the will of God.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.460]   It trains your mind, doesn't it?
[00:09:32.460 --> 00:09:34.960]   Now, a question for you.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.600]   Do you think your mind, your thinking,
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.000]   matters to God?
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.220]   You think having an intellectual mind,
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.280]   a sound, rational mind, right thinking,
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:54.960]   about the teaching of God, about the world,
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:57.520]   about the Bible, about our lives,
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.960]   you think those things matter to God?
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:03.080]   They matter to God, right?
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.480]   They matter to God.
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:09.480]   The ability to discern, the ability to think critically,
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.440]   the ability to examine things rationally,
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:18.440]   these things matter to God.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.800]   They matter to God.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.880]   So much that Paul is saying there's importance,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.760]   utmost importance.
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:27.960]   When the church gathers together,
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.760]   we need to understand the teaching of the Bible.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:35.760]   That's why he elevate one set of gifts over the other.
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.680]   Speaking of tongues, that's nice, Paul says.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:43.100]   But this is for your own private fellowship with God.
[00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.120]   Because nobody understand what you're saying.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.180]   When the church gathers, everyone has to understand
[00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.840]   what we are talking about, what we are thinking about.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:53.740]   So the ability to discern and ability to use our mind
[00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.380]   correctly, to think about things critically,
[00:10:57.380 --> 00:10:59.340]   these things matter to God.
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:05.580]   These are not the monopoly of some of the scholars,
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.980]   some of the intellectualists among us, right?
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.360]   There are some PhD students here.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.940]   What they're talking about, we don't understand, right?
[00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.540]   What they're doing, no clue, right?
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:23.740]   But let me say this, right thinking,
[00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:27.260]   right thinking, in order to think critically
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.260]   and to discern things, truth and error,
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:35.580]   these are important things to God.
[00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:36.880]   These are very important.
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.380]   So not only biblical teaching,
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.420]   some biblical teaching is important.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:45.420]   Secondly, my point is, it is of value, all right?
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:51.560]   Everyone should watch this documentary on Netflix.
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.540]   It's a horrible, horrible thing to watch.
[00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.580]   I haven't watched it yet, all right?
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.220]   It's called "In the Name of God, Holy Betrayal."
[00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:03.060]   Now it's a very, it's a big hit these days
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:08.060]   because it was released March 3rd, only a few days ago.
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:12.120]   It was released on Netflix.
[00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   It's a documentary series exposing the biggest cult
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.540]   in Korea, the Big Four.
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:24.180]   Now, as I said, I don't have time to watch it yet,
[00:12:24.180 --> 00:12:25.840]   but I will watch it.
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:28.300]   Have you ever watched it?
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:29.220]   Anyone?
[00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:30.540]   No?
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:31.540]   You're scared to watch it
[00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:33.580]   or you just don't have time to watch it?
[00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:39.100]   You should watch it, you should watch it.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:44.100]   Because this documentary series has many episodes.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:50.080]   It exposed the cult leaders in Korea.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:53.520]   It's very interesting, it's very intriguing
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.360]   that all these cult leaders,
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.680]   they were able to attract thousands
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:00.840]   and thousands of followers.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:03.260]   And according to this documentary series,
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:08.200]   this cult leaders in Korea, or even all over the world,
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:10.800]   because they plant churches, different groups,
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.880]   all over the world,
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:16.520]   they attract thousands and thousands of college students.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:18.800]   Can you believe that?
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.520]   I mean, listen, let me tell you one of the quote
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:23.720]   from this series.
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.720]   One of the cult leaders used to say to his followers,
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:33.020]   and I quote, "Do you know who I am?
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.300]   "I bet you don't.
[00:13:35.300 --> 00:13:37.760]   "Well, I am the Messiah.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.200]   "You don't need to search for God.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.840]   "If you can't see God, look at me."
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.480]   These are some of the things that the cult leaders
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.840]   used to say to his followers.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.240]   Thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of followers.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.120]   "Look at me, I am God."
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:01.440]   It's very interesting to me because
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:07.400]   I just cannot understand why this sort of teaching
[00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:11.920]   would attract such a following,
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.840]   even among college students.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:21.120]   Now, college students are supposed to be not so dumb,
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:23.080]   'cause they got into colleges.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:28.260]   They must have some intellectual ability to discern
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:31.540]   in order to get themselves into campuses.
[00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:35.800]   It's just very intriguing to me.
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.320]   Many, many of the followers of this cult
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.880]   in Korea and around the world,
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.680]   they would follow wrong teachings,
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:48.020]   obviously false teachings.
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:54.480]   And I encourage you to watch this documentary
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:59.680]   to think with me, to ponder with me.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.840]   What is going on?
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.680]   What is going on?
[00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.680]   Remember what Jesus said.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:09.040]   He said, "Love the Lord with all your heart
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:11.480]   "and all your mind."
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.600]   You got to use your mind when you follow Christ.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.720]   God expects us to use our mind.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.160]   And our mind with the right thinking,
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.120]   to think critically, to discern,
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.800]   is pleasing to Him.
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.460]   It's pleasing to God.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:30.880]   To discern and to understand what is going on,
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.120]   what is true and what is not.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.760]   Christians, with all your mind,
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.040]   should be able to grow in this sense,
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.520]   to think logically, to think rationally,
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:48.200]   should make decisions wisely and critically.
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:51.920]   This is all expected in our Christian discipleship.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.080]   Because our faith is not blind faith.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:00.360]   Our faith is reasonable faith.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.620]   It can be justified.
[00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:05.220]   It's the right thinking that matters to God.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:12.400]   Now, as I read some of the basic information
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.080]   before I watched the documentary series,
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:22.480]   I quote some of the obviously wrong false teachings
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.660]   from all these cult leaders.
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:31.700]   As I said, I find it very, very troubling.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.840]   Students, you know, college students
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.520]   would fall into those traps, right?
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.320]   Because if you think about it,
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:45.080]   if you have the mind to really study
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:47.560]   and to discern, to think critically,
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.120]   you quickly will come to some of the scriptures
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:52.440]   obviously stated in the Bible
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:57.560]   that you can quickly tell
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:02.300]   these leaders are not teaching sound doctrine.
[00:17:02.300 --> 00:17:07.240]   For example, Matthew 24,
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.960]   when Jesus was talking about the last days,
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:13.720]   he told his disciples, "In the last days,
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.360]   "don't let anyone mislead you,
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:19.360]   "for many will come in my name,
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:21.440]   "claiming I am the Messiah,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.960]   "and they will deceive many."
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:26.740]   See, if you use your mind and use your brain
[00:17:26.740 --> 00:17:30.400]   to just flip some of the pages in the Bible,
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.180]   you quickly can tell who is telling the truth
[00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.540]   and who is not.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.600]   How could this educate people
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:42.000]   by this kind of lies, right?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.080]   I just cannot understand.
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:44.580]   I mean, do you have an answer?
[00:17:44.580 --> 00:17:48.000]   I don't have an answer yet.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.840]   Now, for many people who observe
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.820]   this terrible things and horrible things happening
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:01.280]   in people who use the name of God to deceive people,
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:05.500]   some of the people who are observers,
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:06.980]   kind of outsiders,
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.540]   they probably will conclude that,
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:13.900]   okay, all right, they will just abandon faith altogether.
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:16.180]   They will just abandon the Bible altogether
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:18.540]   or religion altogether in general.
[00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:21.300]   Because, see, some of the cult leaders
[00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:23.620]   using the name of God, the name of religion,
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.320]   to deceive many people and do horrible things, right?
[00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:31.180]   They will conclude that this is no use.
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.500]   I will just abandon God.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:35.500]   I will just abandon the Bible altogether.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:37.740]   But again, if you think about it,
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:42.740]   such conclusion is actually irrational, right?
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.960]   Because somebody misused the name of God
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.880]   doesn't mean God is useless, right?
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.680]   If you think clearly, I think the best way
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:04.040]   in observation of all these terrible things happening,
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:08.740]   the best way is not abandonment, but discernment.
[00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:14.360]   It's not abandonment, it is discernment.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:18.200]   God is reminding you and challenging you to discern,
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:22.580]   to grow in your ability to think critically.
[00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:28.580]   Now, returning to chapter 14 of 1 Corinthians,
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:33.460]   you notice there is a key term being mentioned,
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.860]   being repeated over and over and over again
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.620]   in the entire chapter of 14.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:43.240]   Let me give you an example, 14.12.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:48.980]   Paul is speaking about the gift of preaching,
[00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.820]   sound doctrine, and the gift of speaking in tongue, right?
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:57.620]   He elevated one over the other and put speaking in tongue
[00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:00.900]   to the least of the list of gifts.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.580]   The gift of preaching is much better.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:09.380]   Verse 12, he said, "The same is true for you guys.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:13.380]   "Since you are so eager to have the special abilities,
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.960]   "the spirit gifts, seek those that will strengthen
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.980]   "the whole church."
[00:20:18.980 --> 00:20:22.300]   He's talking about some of the talents,
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.300]   some of the gifts that has to be elevated
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:28.820]   because those gifts will strengthen the whole church.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:33.520]   The word strengthen or the verb strengthen
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:36.380]   repeats again and again, over and over again
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.300]   in the entire chapter, because Paul understands
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.720]   when we get together, we need to strengthen
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:43.240]   and build up the church.
[00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:47.100]   Now, strengthening the word, many times in this chapter,
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.140]   literally, it can mean building up,
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:53.600]   building things together.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.680]   It's used all over the Bible, especially in New Testament,
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.240]   about the temple, the temple in Jerusalem.
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:04.160]   Brick and mortar, people put things together.
[00:21:04.160 --> 00:21:06.200]   Building up, strengthening.
[00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:09.600]   Talking about palace, the royal palace,
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:13.480]   palaces of the king, houses that people live in,
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:14.820]   physical buildings.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:18.680]   He's using this word to describe when we get together,
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.080]   we need to use our presence and our talents
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.540]   and our resources to build up the church,
[00:21:24.540 --> 00:21:27.780]   to build like the temple, put bricks together.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.260]   When we come together to have fellowship,
[00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.600]   when we come together to worship together,
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.740]   to serve together, we are putting bricks on one another
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:39.460]   and build up the temple so that God can be
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.980]   in presence with us.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:43.540]   That is our goal.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.820]   And that's why there's value in understanding
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:48.340]   the better gifts.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:50.740]   The better gifts are those that will build up
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:52.040]   and strengthen the church.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:58.040]   You probably know what contractors do, contractors.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.860]   Have you ever done any renovation in your house?
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.380]   Repair jobs, right?
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:07.380]   Those are really, really tough jobs, right?
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:12.380]   I, in the past few years, because I got some major
[00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:17.180]   renovation in my house, I have to hire somebody
[00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:19.680]   to do the hot job, right?
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.420]   So I really respect those guys.
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.180]   You know, they got their hands dirty
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:29.180]   and they got the blueprint and they build things for me.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.900]   Now, as you understand, as contractors,
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.260]   the building process is not an end in itself,
[00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:42.800]   but they always have the end goal in mind.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.980]   What contractors do is to build things
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:51.500]   so that when the final project is done,
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.660]   the people who live in that space,
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:23:00.140]   who use that space, will be benefited, right?
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.400]   They got the blueprint, they got the process,
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:06.940]   they got all the tools, and they know what the end goal is.
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.320]   The end goal is to build a beautiful building
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:13.180]   and finish the whole project so that whoever use it,
[00:23:13.180 --> 00:23:17.920]   the users, the people who live in it, they will enjoy it.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:21.040]   That is the whole point of building the church.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.920]   So Paul is encouraging us to use your gifts
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.680]   to build the church.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.720]   Now, to summarize what the gifts are,
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:33.800]   I have a quick way to summarize it.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:34.760]   It's three Ts.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:41.080]   Your time, and your treasure, and your talents.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:45.840]   Remember these three words, all right?
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.740]   The first one is time.
[00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.120]   What does it mean?
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.000]   When we gather, it takes time, right?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.920]   There's no gathering of Christians,
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.540]   there's no worship gathering that would not take time.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:02.240]   You set aside a time, you allot this time slot,
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:05.560]   I'm gonna worship God with the people of God, right?
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:09.340]   I'm gonna show up and be present, bodily present, right?
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:14.440]   Time, your treasure, right?
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.900]   Giving generously to the ministry of God, right?
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:20.120]   To train up the people
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:22.340]   so that his people will follow his way.
[00:24:22.340 --> 00:24:25.620]   Your talents, right?
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.680]   Now, I don't have to repeat all those stuff, right?
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:30.280]   Because we already talk about,
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:32.780]   we are gifted in different ways, right?
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:35.160]   Some of those are musically gifted,
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.840]   some of those who are gifted in some other ways.
[00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:39.840]   We are all using the gifts, right?
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.980]   Time, treasure, and talents to build up the church, right?
[00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:46.660]   Urban voice, our church.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:51.200]   Let's build it so that God will get the glory.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.440]   God will get the glory.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.280]   I have some confidential pictures I wanna show you.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.560]   As I prepared a sermon, I found some of the old pictures.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:04.240]   As you know, Urban Voice UV,
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.680]   we launched our church as a church plan
[00:25:07.680 --> 00:25:12.140]   with just maybe eight or nine families together.
[00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.380]   It was back in 2016.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:19.380]   So we were officially launched on the Easter Sunday, 2016.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:21.120]   So as I prepared a sermon,
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:24.420]   I found some of the old pictures, all right?
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:28.620]   So the old pictures were all taken
[00:25:28.620 --> 00:25:32.240]   when we first move in to this place.
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.780]   When we first move in here, it had nothing.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:39.220]   It's just an empty box.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.300]   Who built it?
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:44.460]   People who have talents,
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:48.200]   people who are committed to build the church together.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.540]   And I wanna show you this picture, it's about six or seven.
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:56.540]   And I want you to, well, who were with us
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.620]   in the very first Sunday, 2016 Easter Sunday?
[00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:01.100]   Who were here?
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:03.180]   Yeah, there are only a few, right?
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:05.580]   So praise God, these people,
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.880]   they were not here in the very first day,
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.140]   but they gradually, and God sent them here,
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:14.620]   and what a blessing to have all of you.
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.700]   But some of these pictures, as I show you,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.540]   you have been coming to this church
[00:26:21.540 --> 00:26:23.660]   to attend the worship service,
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.980]   to participate in our ministries.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.340]   Thank God for that.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:30.100]   You should know our environment a little bit,
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.200]   right, our facility.
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.980]   So as I show you these old pictures,
[00:26:33.980 --> 00:26:38.120]   you tell me, where was this picture taken?
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:43.220]   Where, okay, exactly where this picture was taken?
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:44.060]   You ready?
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:49.980]   Where was this picture taken?
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.260]   Where?
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:56.820]   Where was the camera?
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:59.480]   Where was the camera?
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.060]   Right, it was around here, right?
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:05.100]   So we took a picture all the way there.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:07.580]   Now it's changed a lot because we at this room,
[00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.340]   you know, this studio room, before COVID,
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.580]   before the pandemic, the room was not there,
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:16.580]   part of the building process, right?
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.560]   Next one.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.260]   Where was this taken?
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:29.460]   That's right, right here, right here.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:32.140]   Taken this direction, right?
[00:27:32.140 --> 00:27:36.020]   It's amazing to see how the builders, you know,
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.500]   build the church together, or build all this stuff, right?
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:42.620]   This thing is hollow.
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:45.500]   There were holes in it, right?
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:46.980]   They built a frame, you know,
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:48.820]   I was there almost every single day,
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:50.860]   and I took some pictures, you know,
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:55.860]   just to document what God has been doing in our midst.
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.840]   So this is the stage.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:28:00.420]   How about this one?
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:06.220]   Where was this taken?
[00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:10.860]   Yeah, it's the cafe area, right?
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:15.860]   Back then we had only this crappy, you know, cabinet, right?
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:21.380]   And this worker was doing the drywall,
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:26.340]   and before we put the wood panels on.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.580]   God built this church.
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:32.500]   How about this one?
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.700]   Where was this taken?
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:38.120]   Any guess?
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.340]   It's outside, it's actually the same angle,
[00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.600]   the cafe before the wall, before the drywall was put up.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.980]   Right, so this wall right there.
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:53.860]   It's outside, the picture was taken outside, right?
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.740]   It's amazing, it's amazing.
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:58.060]   Every day I come here, you know,
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:02.100]   there's a process, more has been done, right?
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.500]   How about this one?
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.620]   Any guess?
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:05.720]   Where was this taken?
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:08.580]   Where was this picture taken?
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:10.600]   To what direction?
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:14.440]   Ah, that's tough, right?
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.560]   That's actually in the cafe area.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.480]   If you stand outside the nursery door,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.980]   you take a picture this way,
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.680]   not all the way to the end of the cafe,
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.440]   there's a dining table there, right?
[00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:28.080]   There's a bookcase there, right?
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.200]   Remember?
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:30.500]   Do you remember?
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:33.200]   Okay, all you pay attention to is the food, right?
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:36.160]   The food and the drinks.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:40.860]   Seriously, this is taken from the end to the other end
[00:29:40.860 --> 00:29:42.280]   in the cafe area.
[00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.940]   How about this one?
[00:29:43.940 --> 00:29:44.760]   This is tough.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:48.080]   It took me a long time to figure out where was this taken.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.300]   I didn't even remember.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:56.360]   It was actually taken from where James is.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.100]   Yeah, it's right there, it's this corner.
[00:29:59.100 --> 00:29:59.940]   Can you tell?
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.180]   It's this corner, that's the back door.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.840]   I want to show you this picture because,
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:10.800]   just like what Paul says,
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.960]   the church needs to be built up, you know, brick by brick,
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.280]   dry wall by dry wall.
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:20.660]   But Paul is not simply talking about hardware.
[00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:25.660]   He's talking about the people, the group, the church,
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.520]   the community getting together.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.260]   All these pictures, I add this verse in there, 1412.
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.180]   In the same way, it is true for you guys.
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:40.060]   Since you are so eager to have your special abilities,
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:43.420]   the spirit gifts, seek those that will strengthen,
[00:30:43.420 --> 00:30:46.180]   will build up the whole church.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.900]   A stronger church is the foundation,
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.060]   and the foundation is our mind.
[00:30:53.060 --> 00:30:55.820]   Our mind is oriented to the Word of God,
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.420]   a better understanding of faith.
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.080]   Disciples should be thinkers.
[00:31:02.740 --> 00:31:06.220]   You should be able to discern, to think,
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:09.440]   to debate, to question.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:16.460]   A good worship service is not one
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.280]   that would make you tear up.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:22.200]   All right?
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:24.460]   Although I was worshiping and James was leading,
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:29.460]   it was such a great time we can praise our God, right?
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.460]   Offer our worship to Him.
[00:31:33.460 --> 00:31:37.440]   But a good service, a good worship, a good church
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.360]   is not one that makes you tear up,
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.860]   but one that challenges you to think deeply,
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.800]   to think more critically, to think better.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:55.820]   Think in terms of God's Word.
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:57.160]   Think along the line
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:00.340]   with the biblical teaching of the Bible.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.600]   Let's all pray together,
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   and let's continue to live in the truth of God,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:12.440]   and the truth is we live in His love.
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.320]   Let's all pray.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:24.040]   Father, we give you thanks because you are the one
[00:32:24.040 --> 00:32:27.120]   who built this church.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:30.040]   And thank you for the fact that the Holy Spirit
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:31.040]   is the builder.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:35.720]   The Holy Spirit gives us in many different ways.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:41.680]   So as we come before you, as we conclude our service,
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.480]   we ask that you would bring us into your presence again,
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:49.960]   and know that we are being saved by your grace,
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:54.360]   by your love, and your love would transform us
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:57.840]   to change our perspective, change our orientation,
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:00.440]   so that our lives, our gifts, our time, our treasure,
[00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:03.600]   and our talents will bring honor to you,
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:06.200]   to build up the church, to build up this community,
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   so that your name will be lifted high.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:12.000]   Thank you, and we praise you.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:12.840]   Christ, we pray.
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.840]   (upbeat music)
