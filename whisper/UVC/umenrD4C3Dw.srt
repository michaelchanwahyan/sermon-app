1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,840
 - Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,200
 Yeah, thank you Veronica for the clear announcement

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,380
 with different languages.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:09,580
 Just like the song that we have just sang,

5
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,340
 from every tribe and every nation, right?

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:15,380
 You know, that is Christ's mind.

7
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,260
 You know, Christ is going to redeem every people

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,620
 and every tribe and every language to worship him, right?

9
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,260
 He is the Lord of all of us, okay?

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,740
 So very good to see you, okay?

11
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:29,580
 Very good to see you.

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:33,500
 (speaking in foreign language)

13
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,220
 Salaam, brother.

14
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,220
 Yeah, all right.

15
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,380
 So I'm speaking three different languages.

16
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,620
 Yeah, that's all I can do.

17
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,020
 (laughing)

18
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,180
 Yeah, but that is the way to worship God

19
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:46,840
 because we use different languages,

20
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:51,840
 we use different dialects to express our praises to God,

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,540
 right?

22
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:56,060
 And our God is worthy of our praise.

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,260
 And we continue our series on back to basics.

24
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,340
 And there are basics in our Christian life,

25
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,820
 basics in our Christian walk, and we have to master.

26
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:06,620
 We have to understand, right?

27
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:11,260
 So often we don't find it enjoyable in our Christian walk

28
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,660
 or in our Christian journey, we have troubles

29
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,620
 because we have forgotten the basics.

30
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:20,560
 And these are basics that we need to focus on.

31
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,100
 And that's why in this series,

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:25,900
 we're going to go back to some of the basic understanding,

33
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,700
 basic knowledge, basic teaching of the Bible.

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,500
 And I've introduced something new to the congregation.

35
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,860
 It is the verse of the week, right?

36
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:38,220
 Remember this verse last week?

37
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,420
 Remember this?

38
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:40,260
 Verse of the week.

39
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:42,260
 And let's recite together, all right?

40
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,900
 I, that's part of your homework is to memorize it, right?

41
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,020
 Have you?

42
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,820
 I'm sure you have.

43
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:50,540
 Verse of the week, let's recite it.

44
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,720
 You must love the Lord your God with all your heart,

45
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,300
 all your soul, and all your mind.

46
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,780
 And this is the first and greatest commandment, right?

47
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,460
 That's what Jesus said to us.

48
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,140
 This is the first and greatest commandment

49
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:07,180
 of all the commandments in the Old Testament, in the Bible.

50
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,740
 There are many details, there are many different

51
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:14,980
 commandments and statues you can find in the Bible.

52
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:16,800
 But this is the most important thing.

53
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,980
 This is the ultimate summary, right?

54
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,680
 The ultimate summary of what God desire us to do

55
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:27,400
 is to love Him, to be loyal to Him, to follow Him

56
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,600
 with all our heart and soul and our mind.

57
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,480
 And last week, we were talking about the importance

58
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,120
 of the Word of God in our Christian walk, right?

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,840
 Our Christian walk, we cannot do so

60
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,680
 without the Word of God, without a correct understanding,

61
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,480
 without a solid teaching of sound doctrine.

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:49,400
 And that's why God has given us the scripture.

63
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,440
 And this is the verse of the week for this week,

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,720
 for this current week.

65
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,360
 And it's taken from the chapters that we are studying on.

66
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,560
 It's 2 Timothy 3, the last two verses.

67
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,000
 16 and 17, last two verses.

68
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,600
 Let's recite it together.

69
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,800
 All scripture is breathed out by God

70
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,520
 and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction,

71
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,520
 for training in righteousness,

72
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,320
 that the man of God may be complete,

73
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,960
 equipped for every good work.

74
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,860
 2 Timothy 3, 16 to 17.

75
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:28,000
 All right, so we got to have this verse,

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,440
 or these verses memorized for this week, okay?

77
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,680
 So whenever you are doing this or doing your work

78
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,680
 or there is some break time in your mind,

79
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,560
 try to recite this.

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:44,560
 I give you the Bible reference, 2 Timothy 3,

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,440
 and you can find it and recite it.

82
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:52,120
 All scripture is the breath of God, you know?

83
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,760
 And we're gonna study this chapter, chapter three.

84
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,760
 And remember last time I said this long chapter

85
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,840
 of 17 verses can be divided into two parts.

86
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,600
 And the first part is verses one to nine.

87
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,160
 Second part is 10 to 17.

88
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,600
 And the first part from verses one to nine

89
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,520
 is the dangers of neglecting God's word.

90
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,360
 God's own word, if we neglect or we ignore,

91
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,080
 there are dangers, right?

92
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,320
 Remember Paul is trying to warn Timothy.

93
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,480
 And again, Paul is the mentor pastor of Timothy.

94
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,360
 Timothy is his disciple.

95
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
 Timothy is kind of his mentee.

96
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:36,360
 And Timothy is being in charge of the churches in Ephesus.

97
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,760
 And Paul is writing this letter in very personal tone.

98
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,720
 That's why we call it pastoral letters, right?

99
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,480
 First and second Timothy in the book of Titus.

100
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,440
 He's writing to his mentees.

101
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,720
 Timothy is one of them.

102
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,520
 And trying to teach them, trying to encourage him

103
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:56,720
 to persevere in shepherding the church of God.

104
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,840
 There were many opposition, there were false teachers,

105
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,040
 there were many dangers in the church,

106
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,600
 in the small churches in Ephesus.

107
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,400
 And the first nine verses, it says there were dangers

108
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,280
 warning Timothy that this is the last days.

109
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:15,840
 Remember what I said about last day in New Testament term?

110
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,200
 The last day is the period between the first coming

111
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:23,220
 of Christ and the second coming of Christ,

112
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,680
 the final coming of Christ,

113
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,800
 which is still lying in the future, right?

114
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,040
 First coming of Christ, we know what it is.

115
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:34,760
 Incarnation of Christ, Jesus came in human form,

116
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,680
 fully God and fully man.

117
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,480
 And he died for us, died for our sins.

118
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,240
 And on the cross, he was crucified.

119
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,760
 And on the third day, he rose again

120
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,920
 and he was ascended to heaven.

121
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,840
 And he's king in heaven.

122
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,520
 And that is the first coming.

123
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,240
 And between first and second coming, it is the last days,

124
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,920
 the last period of human history

125
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,920
 according to biblical timeline.

126
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:00,320
 And Paul is saying to Timothy, this is a dangerous time

127
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,280
 because there are many difficulties

128
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,800
 and people are drawn to falsehood, right?

129
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:13,040
 I remember a few years ago when we had the pandemic,

130
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:18,320
 when the pandemic first hit us, right?

131
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:24,280
 Remember on social media, there's so much misinformation,

132
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,520
 right?

133
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,320
 There's so much conspiracy theories

134
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,320
 or just feeding our uncertainty, feeding our fear.

135
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,280
 And sometimes people are being hijacked

136
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,460
 by fear and uncertainty.

137
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,160
 And because the time was difficult, right?

138
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,760
 And we were in fear.

139
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,080
 And whatever information feed into our brain, our mind,

140
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,720
 especially sensational materials,

141
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,720
 they become like wildfire in the social media.

142
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,440
 And I just wonder, shaking my head at times,

143
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,800
 why people would come to believe in falsehood, right?

144
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,080
 Something is clearly wrong, right?

145
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,080
 And they just never double check, right?

146
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,080
 And, you know, scammers, right?

147
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,640
 It's all over the place, right?

148
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,480
 Yeah.

149
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,040
 I don't know how many scam calls you get during the week.

150
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,120
 How many calls you get during the week?

151
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,960
 Or text messages?

152
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,280
 I can't count, you know?

153
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,120
 I can't count.

154
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,440
 You know, every day I get something like,

155
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

156
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,440
 (laughing)

157
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,280
 Something like that.

158
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,680
 In Chinese sometimes, sometimes in English, right?

159
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,160
 Hi, you know, I'm your old friend, you know.

160
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,640
 I know some of your friend.

161
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,320
 Or I even claim that they know my dad, you know?

162
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,120
 My dad passed away many years ago.

163
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,560
 (laughing)

164
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,160
 But, you know, there are people who believe in scams, right?

165
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:02,160
 Not too long ago, I received a phone call from a young girl.

166
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,920
 I received a phone call from a young girl.

167
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:09,480
 And she was in the mid-twenties.

168
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,760
 And she called me because she was in trouble.

169
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:16,800
 She received a call from IRS, you know,

170
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,240
 our tax department, right?

171
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,280
 US tax department.

172
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,920
 It's very scary.

173
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:22,280
 Called her and said,

174
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,920
 "Hey, you did not file your taxes, right?

175
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,040
 "For so many years, right?

176
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,440
 "You've been working, you did not file your taxes.

177
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,100
 "And now you have to pay back, all right?

178
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,700
 "And you have to pay back like $5,000.

179
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:37,680
 "But this is how you, you know, deal with IRS, right?"

180
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,800
 There's a scammer told her,

181
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,920
 "Okay, you go to the Apple store, all right?

182
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:47,920
 "You go to Apple store and buy Apple gift cards

183
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,740
 "of 5,000 worth, all right?

184
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,420
 "And you're gonna give me the gift card number

185
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,920
 "and the code or whatever identification.

186
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:00,500
 "And you give it to me, you know, through email online.

187
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,680
 "And then, you know, we're gonna cancel out your taxes.

188
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,520
 "All right?"

189
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,840
 And she believed it.

190
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:12,320
 She went to Apple store and got all the gift cards

191
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,660
 and 5,000 worth and gave all the numbers away.

192
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:19,680
 It was crazy.

193
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,940
 And that's why she called me.

194
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:24,900
 She said, "My goodness, I'm in trouble.

195
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:29,280
 "Now I realize, you know, it was a scam, right?"

196
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,060
 So miserable, right?

197
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,740
 There's nothing I can do, right?

198
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,820
 There's nothing you can do, right?

199
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,140
 But it just blow my mind, you know,

200
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:44,140
 how she could have believed something like that, right?

201
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,420
 You know why?

202
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:47,700
 It's not because she was stupid, right?

203
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,760
 She's very smart.

204
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:54,740
 It was because she was in fear, right?

205
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,000
 Indeed, she did not file taxes.

206
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,280
 Indeed, for a couple of years, she did not,

207
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,840
 she forgot or she just ignore it, right?

208
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:08,020
 And she knew that she owed some money to IRS, right?

209
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,080
 And that's how the scammers got to her, right?

210
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:16,300
 Because she was in a state of uncertainty and fear

211
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,520
 and all sorts of misleading content

212
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,800
 that she would believe, right?

213
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,560
 And this is the last stage, right?

214
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,720
 And we continue to read this passage.

215
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,720
 We find that Paul is trying to urge Timothy

216
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,780
 to learn the truth and learn the word of God.

217
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,980
 And that's why the second part, he says,

218
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,920
 there's so much benefit of learning the word of God,

219
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,220
 learning the truth, trying to discern, right?

220
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,380
 And we go through this part of this passage already

221
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,920
 last week from verses 10 to 15.

222
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,720
 And now we come to this two verses,

223
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,720
 the verse of the week, verse of this week.

224
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,520
 And I tell you, in the entire Bible,

225
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:04,440
 these two verses, 2 Timothy 3, 16 to 17,

226
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:09,300
 are some of the most important verses in the Bible.

227
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:15,440
 These two verses are some of the most important verses

228
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,820
 in scripture.

229
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,820
 And let's unpack it and we'll see why.

230
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:23,680
 It says, "All scripture is the breath of God."

231
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:24,520
 God breathed.

232
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,960
 God breathed.

233
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:31,960
 And it's useful for teaching, rebuking,

234
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:35,200
 correcting, and training in righteousness,

235
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,360
 so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped

236
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,920
 for every good work.

237
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,920
 Now, these verses are very, very valuable, very important.

238
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,000
 And why?

239
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,600
 Now, this is the last paragraph of chapter three.

240
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,040
 And Paul is trying to encourage Timothy,

241
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,760
 yeah, learn from your mentors, right?

242
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,640
 Remember, Paul is one of his mentors.

243
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,480
 And who else?

244
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:09,480
 His mother and Timothy's grandmother, right?

245
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,720
 Eunice and Lois.

246
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,880
 Learn from them, because since you were a child,

247
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:19,240
 you were learning scripture from these people, right?

248
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,800
 And here in verse 16, he says,

249
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:25,000
 "All scripture is the breath of God."

250
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,120
 Well, let's unpack it.

251
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,120
 Our first, the key word here is the breath of God.

252
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,280
 God breathed out.

253
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,920
 He spoke forth His word.

254
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,400
 And God is the speaking God.

255
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:44,040
 God spoke and God is speaking today.

256
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,200
 And God will be speaking tomorrow.

257
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,040
 And God is the God who speaks.

258
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,880
 The idols don't speak.

259
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,320
 They may have mouth, they may have lips,

260
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,560
 but they do not speak.

261
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
 Now, you don't have to be thoroughly learned in the Bible

262
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,840
 and you get the point, right?

263
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,440
 Because the first page of the Bible,

264
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,520
 when you turn to the Bible, the very first page,

265
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,080
 the very first chapter, very first passage,

266
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,080
 is Genesis one, right?

267
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,900
 In the beginning, God created the heaven and earth, right?

268
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,400
 And then there were some other details,

269
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,040
 the spirit of God upon the water.

270
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,800
 And what did God do?

271
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,400
 What was the first thing God did?

272
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,360
 He said, right?

273
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,320
 And God said, what did He say?

274
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,080
 Let there be light, right?

275
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,800
 Let there be light.

276
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,680
 And then there was light.

277
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,800
 So you got that from the first passage of the Bible,

278
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 that God has the attribute of speaking.

279
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,200
 God is someone who reveals.

280
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,640
 God is someone who tells you what to do.

281
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:48,720
 God is someone who can speak.

282
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,920
 And here it says all scripture is the breath of God.

283
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,160
 It's the very breath of God.

284
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,200
 It tells you that God himself

285
00:13:56,200 --> 00:14:00,560
 is the ultimate author of the Bible.

286
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:03,000
 You have your Bible on your phone app

287
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,640
 or you have a physical print Bible,

288
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,860
 but here it declares that all scripture,

289
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,360
 the Bible is actually written by God.

290
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,480
 Of course, it's written by God through people, right?

291
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:20,840
 Through human authors, like Paul himself, right?

292
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:23,680
 Like Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke.

293
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,320
 And Mark, the Gospel of Mark.

294
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,240
 And some of the letters,

295
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,600
 or Moses wrote some of the books, right?

296
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,800
 But the ultimate author is God himself.

297
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,720
 And it tells you the authority of scripture,

298
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
 the standard of scripture.

299
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,560
 You know, we are an evangelical church,

300
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:46,360
 and we are in the great tradition of reformation.

301
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,360
 More than 500 years ago, 1517.

302
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,200
 1517.

303
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:58,200
 That was the year that launched the movement of reformation.

304
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,200
 And the guy who launched it,

305
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:06,200
 one of the guys who reformed the faith at that time

306
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,400
 was Martin Luther, right?

307
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,360
 Not Martin Luther King, Jr., okay?

308
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,900
 That's a different guy, right?

309
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,240
 Martin Luther, 1517.

310
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,880
 Martin Luther, okay?

311
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,320
 He's a church reformer,

312
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,320
 because he saw the Catholic church was broken,

313
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,560
 and they were not coming under scripture.

314
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,560
 So the entire movement of reformation is to call people,

315
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:35,440
 call the churches to return to the word of God.

316
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:39,360
 And the scripture is the final authority

317
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,400
 of everything that we believe

318
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,720
 and how we practice the Christian faith.

319
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,680
 We always have to return to the word,

320
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
 return to scripture.

321
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,440
 And Paul is saying all scripture is the standard,

322
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,120
 because God has written it,

323
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,360
 and he has divine authority.

324
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:59,360
 It says all scripture, all scripture, singular, singular.

325
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:07,440
 Now, in the time of Paul, they only had the Old Testament.

326
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,960
 Do you get my point?

327
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:12,680
 The New Testament was still in the making, right?

328
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,240
 Some of the letters are being written.

329
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:18,160
 By this time when Paul wrote 2 Timothy,

330
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,820
 some of the letters from the Old New Testament

331
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:25,160
 or even the gospels were already being circulated,

332
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,800
 circulated in different churches.

333
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,280
 But the entire New Testament, New Testament canon,

334
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,200
 all 27 books are still in the making.

335
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,160
 And the Christians in Paul's days in the first century,

336
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,960
 they only had the Old Testament,

337
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,000
 which was originally written in Hebrew.

338
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,920
 And a couple of hundred years before Jesus,

339
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,080
 it was translated into Greek.

340
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:51,560
 And the apostle Paul or the early churches,

341
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,960
 they were using the Old Testament only,

342
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:58,400
 either in Hebrew or in the translated version Greek,

343
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,200
 we call it Septuagint.

344
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,320
 They only had the Old Testament.

345
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,080
 Now, listen up.

346
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:09,080
 All scripture, Paul is saying all of the Old Testament,

347
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,400
 right?

348
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,000
 All of the Old Testament, whether it's Hebrew or translated,

349
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 they are as one, the Word of God, right?

350
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,960
 The whole Old Testament is already the very Word of God.

351
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,800
 Right?

352
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:30,880
 Now, you think about it, this is pretty interesting,

353
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
 pretty inspiring.

354
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,480
 Just the Old Testament, right?

355
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,680
 Just the Old Testament.

356
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,680
 Yeah, maybe somehow your house got caught on fire, right?

357
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:42,000
 And your Bible is being burned, right?

358
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,080
 Let's say the New Testament, all 27 books

359
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,840
 are being burned away, right?

360
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,640
 They've been consumed by fire.

361
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,920
 You got out of the fire and you got the Old Testament, right?

362
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,960
 You still have the Word of God, right?

363
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:58,360
 The first 39 books.

364
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,320
 Paul is saying all the Old Testament

365
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,480
 is already the very Word of God.

366
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,400
 And think about it, this is very interesting.

367
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,960
 For us, we have more than the Old Testament, right?

368
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,080
 Because Jesus came and all the books of New Testament

369
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:16,280
 are being written about Him coming, right?

370
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,720
 And all 27 books are being added to the,

371
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,960
 what we call canon, what we call the full revelation

372
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,480
 of God in scripture.

373
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,680
 And now we have Old Testament and the New Testament.

374
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,760
 We have the Old Testament's 39 books

375
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,000
 and we have the New Testament 27 books.

376
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:39,360
 How perfect we are, right?

377
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,920
 We have more than what Paul had, right?

378
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,360
 What Timothy had.

379
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,000
 And we know the Word of God,

380
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 we know the will of God so much more.

381
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,320
 And we can comprehend the Word of God

382
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:55,360
 or the mind of God, even with more content, right?

383
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,400
 We are so blessed to have so much

384
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,880
 that God has revealed to all of us,

385
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,720
 the Old and the New Testament.

386
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,800
 And Paul is saying all scripture is the breath of God

387
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:09,280
 and it's useful, it's profitable, right?

388
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,000
 Useful for teaching, for rebuilding, correcting

389
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,320
 and training in righteousness

390
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,320
 so that we can be fully equipped for every good work.

391
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,200
 Let's unpack this.

392
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,400
 I still like the New Living Translation, NLT.

393
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,480
 And I give you here and at the bottom of the screen

394
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,560
 is the contemporary Chinese translation.

395
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:39,080
 I think these more contemporary language

396
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,520
 would have us better understand

397
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,360
 the usefulness of scripture.

398
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:48,120
 There are four phrases.

399
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,360
 Paul is saying, if you go to scripture,

400
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:53,520
 you read the Bible, first thing,

401
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,360
 the Bible will teach you what is true, right?

402
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

403
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,760
 Right?

404
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,320
 Teach you what is true.

405
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,960
 And secondly, is to make you realize

406
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,320
 what is wrong in your life, right?

407
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,040
 I tell you one of the secrets, I think,

408
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,560
 that we don't like to read Bible.

409
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,120
 You know why?

410
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,400
 Because of this second purpose.

411
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,840
 We don't like to be confronted, right?

412
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:23,000
 We always want to be comforted, right?

413
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,760
 But you know, you go to scripture,

414
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,040
 so often the scripture confronts us, you know?

415
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,520
 There are behaviors, there are mindset we have to change.

416
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,400
 Right?

417
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,400
 And when it comes to changing and repenting,

418
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,120
 we just don't like it, right?

419
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,600
 That's why sometimes we ditch the Bible, right?

420
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,080
 We just don't like to read it.

421
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,400
 Or we like to read it because we just want to read it

422
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,240
 selectively, right?

423
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,520
 We're just cherry picking all the time, right?

424
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,920
 Just like to read whatever we like or sound good to us.

425
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,080
 However, there are many, many passages in the Bible

426
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,440
 that confronts us, show us that we have sins

427
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
 to repent from.

428
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,160
 We have shortcomings.

429
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:08,840
 We need to ask God to give us grace.

430
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:11,360
 And that is the value of scripture, right?

431
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,080
 To tell us, yeah, there's something wrong with us, right?

432
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,720
 And that's why we need grace.

433
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,760
 And that's why we need Jesus Christ,

434
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,360
 to make us realize this,

435
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,160
 so that our life cannot be the same.

436
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:24,680
 We can be changed and we can be changed

437
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,360
 by the grace of God, right?

438
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:30,080
 Only if we allow God and the Spirit to work in our lives.

439
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,320
 And that's the second purpose.

440
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:33,560
 The third purpose is to correct us.

441
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,280
 It's not just showing you what is wrong in your life,

442
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:41,280
 but it's to tell you when, to correct you,

443
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,480
 to show you the way, the right way,

444
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,360
 when you are wrong, right?

445
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,200
 Yeah.

446
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:52,000
 I've been driving for almost a year,

447
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:54,080
 over 30 years, yeah.

448
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,640
 Over 30 years, yeah.

449
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,480
 I consider myself a pretty experienced driver, right?

450
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,480
 Don't you think?

451
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,880
 And I also have some experience in teaching new drivers,

452
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,240
 right?

453
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,560
 You know, my sons and daughters, right?

454
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:17,480
 I'm trying to teach them how to drive, right?

455
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:22,000
 And it's such a pain to teach them.

456
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,480
 It's so painful to teach a new driver,

457
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,560
 especially a young driver, right?

458
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,960
 I have to show them what is right, right?

459
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,560
 I also have to, and that is pretty easy, okay?

460
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,240
 You have to turn right.

461
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,640
 You have to turn left.

462
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,760
 You have to make a full stop here, okay?

463
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,480
 They said, "Dad, you don't always do a full stop."

464
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:46,600
 I said, "Don't worry about me, okay?

465
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,360
 You have to do it, okay?

466
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,120
 Because you're a new student, right?"

467
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,200
 But that's pretty easy.

468
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,680
 The first thing is pretty easy.

469
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,640
 The second thing is pretty hard, right?

470
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,120
 To help her or him to realize

471
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,160
 there's something wrong in his or her driving, right?

472
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,160
 There's some habit you have not developed, right?

473
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,440
 Like checking your blind spot, right?

474
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,520
 Even today, I'm sitting in my son's car.

475
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,960
 I still have to remind him, right?

476
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
 Every turn you're gonna make,

477
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,880
 you have to always check the blind spot, right?

478
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,560
 Yeah, if you go to my cars, a few cars, a few old cars,

479
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:25,720
 I always have the, I always buy the blind spot mirrors.

480
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,000
 You know what that is?

481
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,760
 I stick it on the side of the side mirror, right?

482
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,400
 Because I've been using it for decades, right?

483
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,600
 And every single car that I own, or before, or now,

484
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,000
 I always have the blind spot mirror, right?

485
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,480
 So I have to remind the new driver,

486
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,480
 "Come on, you have to check your blind spot.

487
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,520
 That is the most important thing," right?

488
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,880
 Yeah, and sometimes they get angry.

489
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,680
 They get angry at me, you know?

490
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,520
 I'm so kind, right?

491
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:57,520
 I just want them to drive well, you know?

492
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:02,680
 But that is the human nature, right?

493
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,160
 We don't like to be pointed out

494
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,960
 there's something wrong in our lives, right?

495
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,040
 But that's what scripture does.

496
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:12,080
 Not only showing us what is wrong in your life,

497
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:15,360
 but to correct you, to tell you what is the right way,

498
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,080
 the better way, right, to live.

499
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,000
 And then lastly, is to teach us what is right.

500
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,400
 The original term for the fourth purpose,

501
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,820
 teaching us to do what is right,

502
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,820
 is actually, a better translation may be discipline.

503
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,760
 You know?

504
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,160
 You know what discipline is?

505
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,640
 Habit, right?

506
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,880
 Remember, beginning of the year,

507
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,680
 I have a series on the book of Proverbs,

508
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,640
 and the series is called Atomic Wisdom, right?

509
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,120
 Atomic habit, it means small, tiny habits

510
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,840
 that we have to build in our life

511
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,840
 so that we can be godly, we can be trained and equipped

512
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,480
 to walk in the way of God, right?

513
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,560
 And there are tiny atomic habit we have to develop.

514
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:10,080
 Ask questions, you know?

515
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,360
 Now, meeting together is one of them.

516
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,840
 Reading the Bible is one of them.

517
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,100
 And praying, we're gonna talk about it later,

518
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:20,440
 some of the habits or disciplines

519
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,840
 that we have to develop, right?

520
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:26,840
 And every one of us know what discipline looks like, right?

521
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,520
 In the beginning, it was painful, right?

522
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,160
 But as you go on, as you persevere, as you continue,

523
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:37,800
 you find it is helpful for you, right?

524
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,640
 Right?

525
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,960
 But those of the people who do workouts

526
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,600
 from time to time or regularly,

527
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,400
 you know what I meant, right?

528
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,040
 You know what I meant, right?

529
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,400
 When I first do, try to do workout,

530
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,880
 did I tell you?

531
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,180
 I do plank, right?

532
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,400
 I do plank, I started with, it was a couple years ago.

533
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,120
 You know, I find that, you know, I'm getting old

534
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,740
 and I need to do some more exercises, right?

535
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,220
 And, you know, being a pastor,

536
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,000
 sometimes we just sit there and in front of the screen,

537
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,360
 we have to prepare messages

538
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,600
 and we have to answer phone calls and email and all that.

539
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,920
 And sometimes we just get lower back pain, right?

540
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,920
 And I started with plank for only 45 seconds.

541
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,920
 Dude, it was painful, right?

542
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,100
 And now I can do seven minutes, right?

543
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,600
 Can you do seven minute plank?

544
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,680
 It's pretty good, right?

545
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,880
 For someone like me, right?

546
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,160
 Over 50.

547
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:37,880
 But, you know, you build up your body, right?

548
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:41,280
 And you become stronger and stronger and stronger, right?

549
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,960
 Until today, if I don't do plank,

550
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,240
 I feel like there's something wrong

551
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,160
 and something missing, right?

552
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,980
 So to get up, I have to do plank again, right?

553
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,520
 And push up and all that stuff.

554
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,480
 That's what I'm saying, discipline.

555
00:26:55,480 --> 00:27:00,480
 NLT has it, teaching us to do what is right.

556
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,440
 Peiyang, xingyi.

557
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,160
 Peiyang, cultivate, right?

558
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,600
 It's a habitual pattern, right?

559
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:15,000
 And we all know the Olympic games

560
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,880
 are gonna start soon, right?

561
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,520
 July 26th, right?

562
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,520
 Olympic games.

563
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,960
 I don't know if you watch some of the preparation

564
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:27,720
 and some of the qualifying games on TVs.

565
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,640
 It's pretty interesting to watch.

566
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,300
 And pretty exciting and inspiring to watch.

567
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,900
 But the athletes, why are they doing what they do, right?

568
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,420
 How could they do something like that, right?

569
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:45,140
 Because they have gone through tough training, right?

570
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,260
 It's not something that you can do overnight.

571
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:53,220
 They do it day after day, hour after hour,

572
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,500
 minute after minute.

573
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:59,500
 Then that's why they have the ability to do it, right?

574
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:04,800
 Christians, we need to read scripture

575
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:08,380
 and we have to understand scripture, right?

576
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:13,980
 I'm thankful we have at least the men's breakfast, right?

577
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,100
 And we're going through scripture verse by verse

578
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,100
 or chapter by chapter.

579
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,360
 I hope this will continue to develop.

580
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,540
 They'll develop into a more solid,

581
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,460
 like a Sunday school class, right?

582
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,660
 And a Bible study, so that we can have

583
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,540
 a better understanding of the word of God, right?

584
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:35,900
 And we're gonna close by this verse of the week.

585
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,740
 Oh, by the way, yeah, I said the old scripture,

586
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,960
 2 Timothy was the worst of the week, right?

587
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,460
 This should be the one.

588
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:43,300
 Sorry about that.

589
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:45,140
 Yeah, I'm dating myself.

590
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:48,220
 This is the verse you have to memorize

591
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,980
 for this coming week, all right?

592
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,840
 Verse of the week, all right?

593
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,780
 Matthew chapter five, verse 14.

594
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:57,220
 "You are the light of the world,

595
00:28:57,220 --> 00:29:01,640
 "like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden."

596
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,000
 The light of the world.

597
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,120
 This is the verse you have to memorize this week, all right?

598
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,640
 Why did I pick this verse?

599
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:15,640
 You know, in Jewish tradition, Jewish rabbinic literature,

600
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:19,780
 they discuss what is light, what is light.

601
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:24,560
 And to them, what is light?

602
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,480
 The Torah is the light.

603
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:30,100
 It's the light for life.

604
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,520
 The Torah, it meant the scripture, right?

605
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:39,000
 For the Jews, it was the Old Testament, right?

606
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,240
 The Hebrew Bible.

607
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,740
 For us, it's the entire Bible.

608
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:47,460
 And in their discussion among the rabbis,

609
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,200
 the Torah is the light of the world.

610
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,560
 The Torah is the light of the world

611
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,480
 because the Torah will give life to people.

612
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,800
 The Torah will give grace to people,

613
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,800
 will point people to the right way of wisdom.

614
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,740
 And here, Jesus said something really interesting.

615
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:07,080
 He was saying to his disciples, right?

616
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,900
 It's part of the Sermon on the Mount, right?

617
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,380
 Yeah.

618
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,380
 Pastor Chi has been preaching on it.

619
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:17,240
 He was talking to his disciples.

620
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:20,900
 "You guys are the light of the world."

621
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:23,300
 Wait a minute, what does it mean?

622
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,100
 That means you are the Bibles.

623
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,100
 You are the Torahs.

624
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,200
 You are the lives who will show people

625
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,060
 the beauty of the Word of God, right?

626
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:37,460
 If you listen to me and obey me, Jesus said,

627
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,760
 you are the light of the world, right?

628
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:43,400
 You know most people don't read the Bible, right?

629
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,240
 You know most people don't understand the Bible

630
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,120
 and where to start, right?

631
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,460
 But you guys are different, right?

632
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,520
 When they see you, when they see your life,

633
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,860
 they just see the beauty of God's Torah,

634
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:01,180
 God's law, God's very Word, right?

635
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:04,260
 Because you're living out the Word of God.

636
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,460
 You are the light of the world,

637
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,840
 like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden.

638
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,860
 You cannot hide.

639
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:13,980
 If you profess the name of Jesus Christ,

640
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:16,480
 you believe in the name of Jesus,

641
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:19,460
 you cannot hide, you cannot hide in the dark.

642
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,880
 And you are the light, right?

643
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,380
 And as we conclude, I want us to take this challenge.

644
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:33,620
 To take this challenge is to read and meditate scripture,

645
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:36,860
 right, to read and meditate the scripture.

646
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:39,460
 You are the Bible in some sense.

647
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:41,260
 You are the Word of God.

648
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,500
 And you know, in our time, in our age,

649
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:48,180
 I think this is the most challenging thing that we all face.

650
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:51,300
 It's not so much of preaching the gospel

651
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,840
 or telling other people what they should believe.

652
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:58,080
 That is not the most challenging thing.

653
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,860
 It's that the most, the biggest challenge for us

654
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,980
 is that, is how to give people a good, convincing,

655
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,980
 positive impression of what the Christian is like.

656
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:15,580
 You can tell people about the gospel,

657
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,140
 but at the end, you need to leave a good,

658
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,880
 positive impression.

659
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,460
 Whether the person believes or not, right?

660
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,900
 Whether the person is convinced

661
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,460
 about the gospel of Jesus Christ or not.

662
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:27,380
 That is not the question.

663
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,780
 That is not something we can do, right?

664
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:31,320
 Only the spirit can do, right?

665
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:36,180
 But what we are urged to do is to give people

666
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:41,180
 the positive, convincing impression

667
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:44,720
 of what believing in Christ is like, right?

668
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,700
 Can we do that?

669
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:50,920
 To our family members, to our children,

670
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,840
 to our spouse, to our neighbors, right?

671
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:57,160
 Can we do that, right?

672
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,680
 By what we say and how we behave, right?

673
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,800
 How we interact with other people.

674
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,920
 Let them see a good impression.

675
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,960
 Let them see the convincing impression, right?

676
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,140
 You are the light of the world.

677
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:13,980
 Let's close.

678
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,900
 (smacks lips)

679
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,480
 Father, we all come before you.

680
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,780
 We confess that we're broken, we are weak.

681
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:28,800
 Sometimes we do ignore the word of God.

682
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:32,820
 But the word of God is right in front of us.

683
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,520
 But we neglect it.

684
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:39,460
 We'd rather watch videos, we'd rather scroll our phones,

685
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:42,980
 and being distracted by all these worldly desires.

686
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,960
 We come before you to confess our sin.

687
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,840
 So cleanse us and forgive us.

688
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:54,960
 Let us focus, once again, the light that you have given us

689
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,960
 that will shine into our lives,

690
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,640
 all the darkened corners of our heart.

691
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,780
 And we need your word.

692
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:08,320
 And may we continue this habit

693
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,280
 to read and to meditate your word.

694
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,660
 For your word is good.

695
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:18,920
 Your word is precious and perfect.

696
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:23,140
 Give us the understanding, give us the wisdom,

697
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,440
 so that we can understand scripture,

698
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:26,820
 understand the very word.

699
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:30,140
 In scripture, we find you.

700
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,760
 In scripture, we find you being with you.

701
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,880
 And thank you for being our good and faithful God.

702
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,400
 May we take your word more seriously.

703
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,020
 May we read your word more diligently.

704
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:46,560
 So that we are full of your message,

705
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,080
 full of your word, so that we can be the light

706
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,080
 to this darkened world.

707
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,520
 Send us out this week.

708
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:59,920
 So we go to our neighborhood, go to our families,

709
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:03,380
 to interact with other people, Christians or not,

710
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:07,480
 that our lives will be the light.

711
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:10,620
 Our lives will be your word.

712
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:13,200
 And we will be your representatives.

713
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,200
 Send us out and use us, and help us to dig into your word

714
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,280
 and to help us to understand your very word.

715
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,080
 Thank you for being our God who speaks,

716
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,920
 and you still speak.

717
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:27,620
 Speak to us through your spirit, through scripture.

718
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:34,200
 Grant us an obedient heart to listen and to obey

719
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,120
 in Christ and pray.

720
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,720
 All right, guys, hope to see you next week,

721
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,820
 and we'll continue to serve our God

722
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,900
 and to understand the word, all right?

723
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:43,740
 God bless.
