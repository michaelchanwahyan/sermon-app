1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
 Family, it's good to be with you again.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,600
 And as we've been having this conversation over the past few weeks and talking about

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:13,200
 all the stuff that's going on in our world, I've been trying to point you to some voices

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,360
 in the church and some voices in the African American community that can speak to these

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:19,360
 issues really well.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:24,200
 And so today I wanted to sit down with a couple of my really good friends.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,840
 And this is Wade Norman and Eric Cummings.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,560
 And they're good friends of mine and they're men who love Jesus and men who are serving

9
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,600
 Jesus with their lives.

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,320
 But they're also black men who've grown up in Chicago and been here their whole lives.

11
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:44,400
 And so these things that are happening right now in the news that we're all thinking about

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:51,400
 and discussing and trying to understand how to respond to, these events are realities

13
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,960
 of their experience that they've dealt with for a long time.

14
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:59,520
 And so I really want you to be able to hear their voice and hear their hearts and hear

15
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,360
 what God has done in their lives and how God has taught them and hear how God wants to

16
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,000
 teach us right now and the things that God would have to say to us.

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,960
 So guys, to start, why don't you just share.

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,480
 I know these moments feel different for everybody.

19
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:22,960
 And for you guys, these moments are a part of your experience and have been.

20
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,080
 And so if you could just share what that feels like a little bit, some of the emotions they

21
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,000
 have to navigate, some of the pain that's involved, some of what that is.

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 You.

23
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,520
 Yeah, you go.

24
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:47,040
 Yeah, for me, it's like, it was a constant reminder of, in the Christian sense, this

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,080
 place is not my home.

26
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:56,000
 But then also like historically, knowing like, you know, the scars of racism in this country,

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,700
 it's like, you know, this country wasn't necessarily built for me or.

28
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,840
 And so it's, you know, it's like stuff like this happens.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
 And it's like, there's a part of you that's like really shocked or like, you know, in

30
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,760
 tears about it, but then it's also like not surprised, like you almost get numb to it

31
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,000
 to some degree when it's like, you've been kind of living that way.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 But yeah, a lot of it is a lot of it is really complicated now, I think, with so much like

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,880
 I was saying to somebody like, we're at a time now where like, everybody's voice can

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,880
 be elevated.

35
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:38,040
 You know, social media has made this platform where now people can speak and share about

36
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,600
 injustices or things or issues that are happening.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,840
 But what is created is like, yeah, everybody has maybe the equal opportunity to share or

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:51,040
 say things about something.

39
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:59,720
 But it's not necessarily equally valued or like equally worthy of listening to.

40
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:04,200
 And so it's like this, yeah, this hard part where like social media has done really well

41
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:09,400
 at like, making us like, more aware of these things.

42
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:14,560
 But it's like, at the same time, it's also made it kind of easier to almost ignore it

43
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,040
 if you want to.

44
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,560
 So it's yeah, so it's hard.

45
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,920
 It's a lot of different emotions.

46
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,760
 But what I find also just being an African American man is expressing emotion is very

47
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,080
 difficult anyway.

48
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,000
 Like it's one of those things that can, you know, that's kind of shunned within our own

49
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 community.

50
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,440
 We have to be strong for our families, we have to be strong for, you know, our wives,

51
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,440
 our kids.

52
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,320
 But then strong for those who, you know, we don't know if they have ill intent toward

53
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,320
 us.

54
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,840
 You have to, you know, you can't really show weakness.

55
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:53,720
 And so that part is very hard because allowing, you know, stuff to build up, you know, in

56
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:56,680
 a lot of ways it can poison you if you don't have an outlet.

57
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:00,400
 And thankfully, you know, I found Jesus.

58
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,560
 And so like, I feel like even if I can't express an emotion around a bunch of people, I can

59
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:13,040
 always express it to God, you know, and know that He hears me, you know, that He finds

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,560
 my voice valuable.

61
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:22,080
 But I can't imagine, you know, my brothers who don't know Christ, you know, I mean, it's

62
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,640
 like torture in a lot of ways.

63
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:31,360
 And like just to piggyback off of what Wade was saying, the key word he said that really

64
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:35,200
 resonated with me was "no."

65
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,520
 So I mean, we've been through this so many times.

66
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,200
 I know it's been the times where it's like, I say, you know what, that's another killing.

67
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,240
 I'm like, it's like you said, we're so used to it.

68
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,960
 It's like we see it on social media and you just go pass it.

69
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:56,680
 But this one with George Floyd, I can say personally, this one hit me extra hard because

70
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,760
 a few months before, somebody, I just want to say I was, somebody called the police on

71
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,840
 me and they're like, once you experience it, it's like you can start putting your feet,

72
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,520
 putting yourself in their shoes.

73
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,400
 And it's like, wow.

74
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,840
 And you're going through, you're trying to fight off that numbness.

75
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,080
 You're fighting off anger, you're fighting off fear, you're scared.

76
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:23,920
 And you got all of these emotions you're trying to figure out, but still try to go to work.

77
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
 Yeah.

78
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,760
 And it's like, you're still trying to do a nine to five and still keep it professional.

79
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:33,360
 And it's like, it's hard because it's like, you want to grieve.

80
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:37,680
 Like you were saying before, like as black boys, we was told, like, you're not supposed

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
 to show your, your emotion.

82
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,680
 You're not supposed to cry.

83
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,000
 But it's like, what are you supposed to, like, how am I supposed to like share these emotions?

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,200
 How am I supposed to feel?

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,240
 So it's like, I'm learning how to share my emotions more, but at the same time, it's

86
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,240
 like, I don't want to show too much.

87
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,000
 Like, it's like a double edged sword.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,880
 Like you show too much emotion, you're that angry black man.

89
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
 Or you're an angry black person.

90
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,120
 If you do show it on other sides, like, oh, you're too soft.

91
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,720
 And so it's like, we're struggling to figure out what the mean, like, what should we do

92
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:13,120
 to like show how we feel about everything.

93
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,920
 So it's the first part is always numb.

94
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:23,280
 It's like, when I remember the first day when George Floyd died, I looked at the video for

95
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,400
 like 10 seconds and I said, I don't want to look at this today.

96
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,080
 But then it kept on coming back up and I was like, okay, let me sit down and like watch

97
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,080
 this video.

98
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,320
 And then all the emotions started coming in.

99
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:40,480
 So it's like, you go through it every day, but it's like just to see it again and again,

100
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,480
 it's like it hurts.

101
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:46,000
 So, because you think it could have been me.

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Yeah.

103
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 So.

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,480
 One of the things we've been talking about a lot of different things and responding.

105
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,880
 And one of the things we talked about was in Romans 12 and the verse that says that

106
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,880
 we're to weep or those who weep.

107
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,520
 And so that's one of the things we've been focusing on grieving because we know that

108
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,360
 that is this process.

109
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,680
 It's grief for the African American community.

110
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,680
 It's grief.

111
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,680
 It's mourning, it's weeping.

112
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,640
 And we've talked about how it's not just grief over this incident.

113
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:23,360
 Obviously, it's the whole history of injustice, particularly in our country.

114
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
 It's grief over that.

115
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,360
 Yeah.

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,360
 And one of the things that we've talked about in that is how believers and people in the

117
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,960
 church who are outside the African American community, how they can respond in a right

118
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
 and genuine way.

119
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,000
 We see obviously a lot of different responses in the world right now, but how can we do

120
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:49,360
 that well and do it genuinely and do it in a way that's truly supportive and loving.

121
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:56,040
 And so that's something I would love to hear you guys thoughts on how other believers can

122
00:07:56,040 --> 00:08:02,320
 support you guys and your community and where you're going through.

123
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:11,400
 The first step, I will say, is to become a listener, to actually come and listen to someone

124
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,960
 share how they can help.

125
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,040
 Because we don't need people to come in to be a savior for us.

126
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,040
 That's having a problem now.

127
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:24,240
 But we need you to come in and listen and hear how people are feeling through this.

128
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,720
 And over the last few weeks, I've actually had people come to me and do that.

129
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,160
 And it's like, wow, like you actually want to sit down and listen and see, like, I know

130
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,320
 that we live in a broken world.

131
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,960
 I had one person actually come out and tell me that he said that I've been racist and

132
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:46,260
 it's because the way I've been raised and what can I do or how can I help?

133
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:51,880
 So even I had to even encourage him at that moment, like you saying this and acknowledging

134
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,240
 that you have sinned or this sin is still in your life.

135
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,120
 It's like you're ready to make a change.

136
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,360
 But also when you make this change, you have to be able to listen to someone else.

137
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:09,200
 So it's all you have to be able to humble yourself to listen to your brother and want

138
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
 to learn and actually, yeah, just shut up.

139
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,840
 That's the thing, just shut up when you're talking.

140
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,320
 Because sometimes what I've noticed, like people want to share and it's like you're

141
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,400
 still fighting on not listening.

142
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:31,560
 And it's like one challenge I did, like an exercise with somebody, like when you are

143
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,680
 the exercise is you, somebody say one thing and you have to start a hand, you have to

144
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:41,560
 start your sentence with that last letter of that last sentence.

145
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,520
 And they didn't understand why I was doing it.

146
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,240
 And then after a while, we kept on doing it and they noticed like, okay, like what was

147
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,240
 that for?

148
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:55,120
 And I was like, you had to listen to everything I said to see how you're going to start your

149
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,120
 thing.

150
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:02,560
 So you have to be able to sit and listen to everything the person is sharing, not just

151
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,200
 the one point you want to talk about, but they share a lot of points they want to talk

152
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,200
 about.

153
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,920
 So it's a learning process and it's going to be hard.

154
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,280
 That's the thing, it's going to be hard.

155
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,680
 It's not going to change overnight.

156
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,440
 Like you do it for one day, it's not going to be the same the second day.

157
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,040
 It might change with whoever you talk with.

158
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:29,760
 So it's the first two steps is acknowledging where you're wrong or where you're saying

159
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,760
 it is.

160
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:34,960
 And then the second part is being humble enough to sit down and listen to your brother, to

161
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,280
 your African American brothers, actually share how they feel about the situation.

162
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,280
 Yeah.

163
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:41,280
 That's awesome.

164
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:48,480
 Yeah, no, I think you guys are on the right track of what the Romans 12 of like grieving

165
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,960
 alongside your brothers.

166
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:57,120
 I think, yeah, if I would add anything to listening to be lamenting alongside.

167
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:04,760
 And really to go into what Eric's saying is like creating an environment of empathy and

168
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:13,400
 transparency where your African American friends do feel like they can express themselves without

169
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:20,280
 repercussions or feeling blindsided or like letting their guard down.

170
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:27,200
 I mean, honestly, that's one of the biggest things we need, a place to be who we are.

171
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,280
 And it's, yeah, we have to put on so many faces when we step out into the world.

172
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:40,200
 I was watching this one pastor talk about even like because of the Ahmaud Arbery thing,

173
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:47,760
 he was like, "In my mind, when I go outside, I've already played the mental game of what

174
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:55,040
 can I wear when I go on this run so that people know that's what I'm doing and there's no

175
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:59,560
 issue at all or there's no mistake that he's out there running, guys.

176
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,160
 He's not robbing anybody.

177
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,840
 He's not trying to do anything."

178
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:08,160
 And it made me remember like something I did or something I still do actually.

179
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,200
 And I never really associated with race necessarily.

180
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,960
 I just associated with, oh, it's just a common courtesy to do this.

181
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:21,640
 So when I go into a store, well, one, I never go into a store that I'm not willing to buy

182
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,320
 anything in.

183
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:27,600
 And so the next thing is if I go into a store and if I'm going to be in there longer than

184
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,480
 10 or 15 minutes, I have to buy something in there.

185
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,400
 So whether it's a soda, stick of gum, otherwise there's this attitude of like, "I don't want

186
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,760
 people to think I'm in here shoplifting.

187
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,240
 I want people to know I'm in this store just browsing, looking for something, didn't find

188
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,440
 it, but I'm not trying to get over on anybody."

189
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:50,920
 And it's, yeah, I don't know.

190
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,760
 Hearing that pastor made me think there's so many areas where the African-American has

191
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,320
 to do that and put on this face of like professionalism sometimes, or maybe you do have to be the

192
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:06,960
 angry black guy because you're in a situation that calls for that.

193
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,240
 But it's almost always a mask of who you are.

194
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,760
 It's never, you never, you honestly, unless you maybe go to counseling or have opportunities

195
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:21,640
 to talk with people that have been through the process and have given you opportunities

196
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:25,000
 and made that safe environment to express yourself.

197
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,520
 I know there's some African-American men that never had that chance, and it plays out in

198
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:38,640
 different ways, whether that's domestic abuse or heavy alcoholism, or it's gambling, all

199
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,960
 these other sins are really deep.

200
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,160
 But in a lot of ways, they're surfacy to what some of the issue is.

201
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,760
 It's just like, "I can't be a man.

202
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,400
 I can't be myself."

203
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,880
 And so, yeah, so lamenting is definitely one.

204
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:56,760
 And then trying to create, yeah, creating a space.

205
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,600
 And I think, yeah, the way you create that space is with empathy and transparency.

206
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,160
 People that are transparent, that is one of the most contagious things, I think, especially

207
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,920
 for believers.

208
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:14,760
 Every Bible study that I love going to is because men were honest and transparent about

209
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,400
 the real issues that we deal with as believers.

210
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:22,280
 So I think, yeah, I think those are good ways to do it.

211
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,280
 - That's good.

212
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,120
 One of the things that hit me as you guys were speaking about that is how some of those

213
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:35,120
 things you're describing are like basic gospel values, basic values that should be in the

214
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,400
 church, that Koinonia type of fellowship.

215
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:44,120
 And I think, I mean, that directs us to the hope of the gospel, obviously, but it also

216
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:48,120
 directs us to the failure of the church to nurture those things.

217
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:53,560
 It's sad that we haven't done a better job of building those spaces and building them

218
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,560
 for everybody.

219
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:03,200
 And that points an error of our own failing in the church, and that's really sad.

220
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:10,400
 So I'm also interested to hear from you guys as we go forward how believers, and again,

221
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:15,400
 especially believers who are outside the African-American community, can really continue to be involved

222
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,040
 and engaged and supportive.

223
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:22,600
 Because obviously there's a lot of attention right now, and there's a lot of response,

224
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:23,600
 and that's good.

225
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,760
 There's a lot of positive response, which is really good, but it's easy for those things

226
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:33,160
 to just be a moment and to just be kind of an event, and then they fade away.

227
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:38,120
 And in a few weeks or a few months, people forget about them and then go on.

228
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:42,000
 And then the realities don't change.

229
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,560
 And in the church, we want to continue, by God's grace, to be living out the gospel and

230
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,920
 seeking God's justice and doing those things.

231
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,600
 So I'm interested to hear from you guys what are some ways that people can continue to

232
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,720
 be involved and to respond.

233
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,520
 That's actually my biggest fear.

234
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,520
 That people...

235
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,520
 Oh, what?

236
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,520
 Like everybody's protesting.

237
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:06,520
 Yeah, what's next?

238
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,640
 And it's like, okay, what are you going to do next?

239
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:14,400
 Everybody's on the protest, but when a protesting dies down, like you said, what's your next

240
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,400
 move?

241
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:19,960
 I was just on a Bible study when we was talking about this.

242
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:22,560
 It starts with talking about community.

243
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,400
 What was that guy named?

244
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,400
 Bon Hopper.

245
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:28,400
 Oh, Dietrich Bon Hopper.

246
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,400
 Dietrich Bon Hopper.

247
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,400
 He was talking about...

248
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,360
 It was a quote saying, "If you have a dream for your community, you'll die, but if everybody

249
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,520
 else is in it, if you have a community, you'll thrive."

250
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:41,840
 So we were talking about community.

251
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:48,840
 You need to create that community of not just people that look like you, but people that

252
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:53,960
 doesn't look like you, with different races, different age groups, so you'll be able to

253
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,320
 grow and learn from that.

254
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,640
 And so I think they were college students.

255
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,440
 Best thing about college students, they're able to...

256
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,160
 There's different events on your campuses.

257
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,600
 Go to those different events and start able...

258
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,640
 I won't say put yourself out there, but take a chance to start talking to other people

259
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:17,080
 that doesn't look like you.

260
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,640
 You're going to fail at first.

261
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,200
 It's basically like that, because you're stepping out your comfort zone, you're coming into

262
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,000
 somebody's comfort zone.

263
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:30,120
 Everybody's uncomfortable, but after a while, they see that you're not doing it because

264
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,320
 of what's going on, and it's really coming from your heart.

265
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,440
 People can tell the difference.

266
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,120
 Once they see the difference, like, "Okay, I'm going to let down my guard just a little

267
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:43,040
 bit, but I'm going to still keep my distance.

268
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,280
 I'm going to still keep it up."

269
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,280
 But it's not a...

270
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:50,040
 Like I said before, it's not an overnight change.

271
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:56,640
 If you're serious about being the change, nobody said it's going to start overnight.

272
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,120
 It's long suffering.

273
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,120
 That means suffering long.

274
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:06,320
 But going through the changes, going through the hurt, and through the journey.

275
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
 I was talking to somebody last night, like, we always want to get to the end of the journey,

276
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,360
 but the whole experience and the journey is what creates you, or what makes who you are.

277
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:20,120
 So when you're working towards that, it's going to be hard.

278
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,720
 But I mean, if you walk with God and you faith, He's going to provide for you.

279
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,840
 But if it's just for hidden knowledge or pride, it's just going to die.

280
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,840
 It's not going to work.

281
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,160
 Like, it's a true heart change.

282
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,160
 So I hope I answered that question.

283
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,600
 I think you answered it well.

284
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,840
 Yeah, that's good.

285
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,520
 It made me think of something else that might be helpful is one of the big things, I think,

286
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:55,680
 in our country and why a lot of racism or just prejudice in general is able to continue

287
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,320
 like generally is because we love categories, right?

288
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,120
 We love grouping.

289
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,720
 You think about the news, right?

290
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,600
 They had the looters, the rioters, the peaceful protesters.

291
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,560
 It was all these different categories.

292
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,880
 And honestly, the African-American experience is pretty used to that.

293
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:19,520
 We are used to carrying the weight of our race all the time.

294
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,880
 And so one of the most helpful things is to treat each black friend you have as an individual.

295
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,480
 You know, like even me and Eric, we are very similar, but we're also really different,

296
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
 like distinct.

297
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:40,360
 And it made me think of this one training I went to, and it was like, "Which black are

298
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,360
 you?"

299
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,960
 And it's like, so even within black, there's categories.

300
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:48,040
 And this may be helpful for you, but there's the ABC.

301
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,740
 So the A black is assimilated.

302
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,280
 On the streets, we will call you a sellout.

303
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:00,400
 This is the person that is basically joined with the majority culture.

304
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,440
 Most of their friends are probably white.

305
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:06,200
 Most of the stuff they like is like pop culture type things.

306
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,420
 Then you have the B black, which is like bicultural.

307
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:12,520
 So this is the person that's pretty much able to walk in both worlds.

308
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:20,880
 They recognize that they're black and are able to be black around blacks, but they also

309
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:27,040
 are able to kind of turn on, "What does it mean when I'm around people that aren't black?"

310
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:32,280
 And then there's the C black, which is like contextualized or culturally black.

311
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,440
 So if you were like, "Oh, how do I spot this person out?"

312
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:38,920
 This is the person that has the Malcolm X shirt on.

313
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:44,080
 This is the person that is never going to probably come to a church that's mostly white.

314
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:50,080
 This is the person that's at all of the events that Eric was mentioning on college campus.

315
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
 If it's a black event, they're probably there.

316
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:57,800
 They probably have peace signs and things like that.

317
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:03,200
 And they are very aware of their race and are very active and vocal.

318
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:11,680
 And so one thing that could be helpful is discovering who are the ones around you, because

319
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,960
 all of us interact with these things differently on an individual basis, but even in those

320
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:21,280
 groups we interact differently.

321
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,480
 All this is general, so none of this obviously can stick on anybody.

322
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:30,360
 Let's just say, for example, with all the stuff that's been happening, the assimilated

323
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,920
 might, let's say all of us say the exact same phrase.

324
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:37,360
 We say, "Man, we watch the news and we say, 'This is messed up.'"

325
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,680
 I, by culture, say, "This is messed up."

326
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,400
 And assimilated blacks say, "This is messed up."

327
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,080
 And then let's just act like Eric is a C black culture.

328
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,400
 And he say, "This is messed up."

329
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,680
 Well, we all said the same phrase, but what did we mean when we said it?

330
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:53,360
 I say, "Man, this is messed up.

331
00:21:53,360 --> 00:22:00,000
 I can't believe the media is showing all these people looting and rioting and stuff."

332
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,880
 And then the assimilated black says, "Wait, what do you mean?"

333
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,480
 "No, I'm talking about the way they're treating us police officers, blah, blah, blah."

334
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,400
 And then the culture black is like, "I just can't believe they didn't riot all these other

335
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,280
 places or do all these other places."

336
00:22:14,280 --> 00:22:20,400
 Now, once again, that is general, but yeah, even within the black community, we're all

337
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,540
 coming at this from different angles, depending on how we were raised.

338
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,840
 And then what our connections is to our own race.

339
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:35,480
 Some of us, honestly, the bicultural, we have an identity crisis, to be honest.

340
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:40,080
 We can walk in both worlds, but we feel like we belong to neither.

341
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,840
 We're not black enough for the contextualized friends.

342
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,600
 We're not white enough for our assimilated friends.

343
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,040
 And each group probably feels some type of animosity toward others.

344
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,040
 It's an everyday struggle.

345
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,040
 It's a battle.

346
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
 It is.

347
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,040
 It's a battle.

348
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
 It is.

349
00:22:56,040 --> 00:23:05,120
 I remember being at day camp and almost having to prove my blackness to somebody that came.

350
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,600
 They thought I lived in Beverly.

351
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,120
 It was something about that.

352
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,840
 They thought I listened to...

353
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:13,880
 I did listen to this Hillsong, but I was like...

354
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,640
 I mean, there's a lot of people that listen to Hillsong.

355
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,640
 I like Hillsong.

356
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,520
 They make good music.

357
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,520
 But it is funny.

358
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,400
 It is like this, "Oh, you have to prove, 'Oh, no, I'm black.

359
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,400
 I'm black.'"

360
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,400
 Or whatever.

361
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:32,360
 But one of the things Eric said that made me think when you said community that is missing

362
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:38,040
 in all of this is, yeah, we want to run to solutions.

363
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,240
 And a pastor was talking about this.

364
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,200
 He said, "Don't be so quick to run to a solution that you forget to run to relationships."

365
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,640
 He was like, "Because solutions can be a quick fix, and you forget about it."

366
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,600
 We get to 2030, and 2020 is 10 years past, and it's not on our mind anymore.

367
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,400
 He said, "At the core of it all, do you care about people?"

368
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,080
 And it just made me think people is the problem with all of this.

369
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,960
 If we're honest, you remove people, and there's none of these things.

370
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,960
 There's none of these issues.

371
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,560
 But you put people who are sinful, have a sinful condition in a situation with each

372
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,520
 other, and sin is bound to happen.

373
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:30,360
 And one of the things is not only people, but opportunities for power.

374
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:36,160
 And so power is this thing where it only means something when people are involved.

375
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:39,520
 You can't be powerful by yourself.

376
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:47,520
 One of my favorite conversations is when he's having his disciples, he's like, "In the world,

377
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,320
 these people in high leadership, they lord it over each other.

378
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,760
 They lord it over those that are lower than them."

379
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,800
 He said, "But that won't be the way with you."

380
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,760
 He's like, "Actually, you are going to go to the bottom."

381
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,840
 He's like, "Everybody is racing to this top, and lording it over each other."

382
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,080
 He's like, "You are going to race to the bottom."

383
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 He says, "If you want to be great, you got to serve everybody."

384
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:19,520
 And what we see in this country, obviously the reversal of what Christ said, if you want

385
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,520
 to be great, this is who you have to step on, basically.

386
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:27,720
 And it's people who were created and made in the image of God.

387
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:37,520
 So yeah, I think the other thing too is to try to think what you would do if it was your

388
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,560
 people.

389
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,520
 That's one of the biggest things that has always gotten me.

390
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,720
 What if this was my brother that was killed?

391
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,220
 What if this happened to my sister?

392
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:55,680
 I think sometimes when you empathize in that way, you don't even need to ask a person what

393
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,680
 to do.

394
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,880
 You just do it.

395
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:05,200
 And that's when you learn that, yeah, we may be a different color, but we all want the

396
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:09,040
 same thing.

397
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:15,720
 Another helpful thing is to understand just because things may be equal doesn't mean they're

398
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,520
 necessarily equitable.

399
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:22,920
 That's another thing that I've been learning recently is things can be equal, but still

400
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,920
 inequitable.

401
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:28,640
 Let's say we're all looking over this fence and I'm short.

402
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,640
 I'm five, seven and a half.

403
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,640
 Sam is pretty tall, six, two, six, three.

404
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:38,520
 Eric might be a little shorter than me.

405
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:42,520
 So maybe there's two crates here.

406
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:49,800
 And the equal thing is if we all just had a crate, but I still can't see over the thing.

407
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,800
 But it's equal.

408
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,800
 We're all equal.

409
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,440
 It's like the equitable thing would be maybe Sam doesn't get a crate because he can see

410
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,440
 over the fence.

411
00:26:56,440 --> 00:27:00,760
 Eric might get two crates and I get one crate.

412
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:05,080
 So a lot of it is thinking about it in that way too.

413
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,520
 Not just, "Oh, let's make it equal for everybody," because it's not necessarily the most helpful

414
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,520
 at times.

415
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,360
 Sometimes it's like, "No, this needs to be equitable."

416
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:20,280
 But it's a lot of really awesome hopeful things that I've seen, like Eric just in the past

417
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:25,040
 few weeks, that is very different from this situation than situations that we've been

418
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,040
 used to.

419
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:29,040
 It's a lot more people doing something.

420
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,640
 I feel like this is a very action-packed time to be a Christian because all eyes are on

421
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
 you right now.

422
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,200
 What will you do?

423
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,520
 What will you say?

424
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,080
 Because people are going to remember it.

425
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,560
 That's beautiful, guys.

426
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:46,320
 I appreciate you sharing your hearts.

427
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,720
 I know that's not easy a lot of times.

428
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:54,120
 Everyone can be honest about anything in our lives, but especially about things like this

429
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,720
 that are really part of the core of who you are.

430
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,320
 So I just want to thank you guys for that.

431
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,280
 I really appreciate you guys.

432
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:06,080
 I'm honored by your friendship.

433
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:09,600
 I appreciate what both of you had to say about relationship.

434
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:14,480
 I know that's been a big part of, for me, understanding more of God's heart and the

435
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:19,920
 gospel and what it means in relationship to all the peoples of the world.

436
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:24,560
 It's having relationships with different people, and that's been really important.

437
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:38,680
 I'm just always amazed at Jesus' love for us and the fact that, like you were saying,

438
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,040
 it comes back to people.

439
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:41,040
 That's what Jesus cares about.

440
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,200
 He cares about hearts and lives, and that's what's important to Him.

441
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:53,640
 He's not really in any way attached to our politics or to our philosophies or our ideas.

442
00:28:53,640 --> 00:29:01,840
 He cares about hearts and lives, and that's a part, something we can't and should not

443
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,480
 miss in the church.

444
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:08,400
 I hope you enjoyed the conversation that we had today, and I just want to thank Wade and

445
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:15,320
 Eric again for coming and having that conversation with us and opening their hearts and being

446
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:21,400
 so honest and giving us the perspective of their life experience.

447
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:24,960
 That's so good for us, and I hope it was encouraging to you.

448
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,320
 I hope it was thought-provoking.

449
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,360
 I hope it helped you to see some things that maybe you hadn't seen before.

450
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,560
 I really am grateful to both of them for sitting down and doing that with us.

451
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,000
 I really appreciate both of them.

452
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 As I said at the beginning, I'm honored by their friendship.

453
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:47,800
 They're men who love Jesus and who are giving their lives to serve in Jesus and to serve

454
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:48,800
 in His church.

455
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,720
 They're also great friends of mine.

456
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,880
 That was actually the noises that you could hear in the video.

457
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,440
 That was the Z's making a lot of noise because Wade and his wife have young children, and

458
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,360
 they're great friends with Jessmyn and I's kids.

459
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:05,400
 Our kids were playing together and having a great time, and so the Z's were making a

460
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,400
 lot of noise.

461
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,960
 You could hear that on the video.

462
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:16,300
 But I want to point us to this heart of unity that Jesus has for His church as we close

463
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,680
 it out today.

464
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,640
 I want us to consider that.

465
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,360
 Unity is hard work in the church.

466
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,080
 It's always been hard work, but it's something that Jesus wants for us, and it's something

467
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:31,200
 that is available for us if we're willing to pursue it.

468
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:37,480
 Pursuing it means sitting down with people who have different experiences than us, who

469
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,520
 have different perspectives than us, and listening, and really listening and hearing, not just

470
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:49,360
 being in the same room while they're talking, but actually really listening and hearing

471
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,840
 their heart, and practicing some empathy and saying, "I want to try as much as possible

472
00:30:54,840 --> 00:31:00,120
 to think about what life might look like from that perspective, and to understand what my

473
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:05,040
 brother or my sister has gone through and what that feels like for them."

474
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:10,640
 To allow that to happen, even if it's difficult, even if it's uncomfortable, even if it reveals

475
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:16,200
 something about my own heart that I don't really want to see, we need to do that.

476
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,560
 We need to do that in order to pursue unity.

477
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:24,100
 We need to allow ourselves to lay down some of our own preferences and some of the things

478
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,660
 that we enjoy and some of the things that we're familiar with in order to understand

479
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:35,720
 or to accommodate the feelings or the preferences or the familiarity of a brother or sister

480
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,720
 in Christ.

481
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:41,160
 That's one of the things that we have to do to work towards unity in the church, to

482
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,920
 pursue unity.

483
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:46,520
 It's not easy, but God can do that work in us and through us.

484
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:50,240
 We talked last week about how God in these moments wants to do the hard work of heart

485
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,800
 change in our lives, and that's one of the hard things that God wants to do right now.

486
00:31:55,800 --> 00:32:00,080
 One of the works of heart change that He wants to do in our lives is helping us to understand

487
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,000
 one another, helping us to hold more loosely to some of our preferences and to some of

488
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:11,360
 the ways that we're used to doing things and to some of our cultural affinities and be

489
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,840
 willing to take on more of God's kingdom cultural affinities.

490
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,880
 That's really important for us to remember.

491
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,120
 If we are living according to the values of the kingdom, if we're living according to

492
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:30,100
 the values of heaven, then all of us are going to be a little bit uncomfortable, no matter

493
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,960
 what cultural background or what our life experience is.

494
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,760
 God's going to ask all of us to lay some things down in order to love one another well, and

495
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,840
 that's what we need to be seeking and pursuing in this moment in the church as we continue

496
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,160
 to respond in all the ways we've been talking about over the past few weeks.

497
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,200
 We want to pursue unity, and that comes through really caring for one another, really hearing

498
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:59,140
 one another, really loving each other well, and choosing to give up some of those things

499
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,000
 that maybe are important to us in order to love someone else well.

500
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,760
 I'm going to close out just by reading a few verses from John 17.

501
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,960
 This is a prayer that Jesus prayed for the church.

502
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,280
 I'm going to start in verse 20.

503
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,040
 This is John chapter 17, verse 20.

504
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:19,120
 I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their

505
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,960
 word that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that they

506
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,440
 also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.

507
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:35,000
 The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as we

508
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:41,560
 are one, I in them, and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world

509
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:47,600
 may know that you sent me and loved them, even as you loved me.

510
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,560
 That's a beautiful, powerful passage.

511
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:54,120
 It's a prayer that Jesus was praying for us, for the church.

512
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:02,680
 And in that prayer, Jesus tied the manifestation of God's glory to our unity.

513
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:08,400
 He tied those things together, that God's glory and God's power would be revealed in

514
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:12,000
 people from all different backgrounds being unified in the church.

515
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:16,880
 And he tied our testimony in the church to our unity, that the world around us, people

516
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:22,160
 who are outside the church who don't know Jesus, would know the supernatural power of

517
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:27,280
 the gospel and the reality of Jesus because of the unity in the church.

518
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:31,320
 So it's really important for us to walk in it and to live it out.

519
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:35,760
 It's really important for us to seek it and pursue it in moments like this, even though

520
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,800
 it might be challenging, even though it might feel difficult or frightening to us, or we

521
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,880
 don't understand, or we say, "Hey, what does that mean for me?

522
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,440
 What do I have to lay down?"

523
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:53,000
 We need to pursue and seek after and hunger for unity and for love for one another.

524
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,000
 Let's pray.

525
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:57,880
 God, I do pray that your church would be one.

526
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:01,760
 I pray that we would listen to one another, that we would love one another well.

527
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,880
 I pray that you would do the hard work of heart change in our hearts and in our lives

528
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:14,480
 to help us to really care for one another and to help us to be unified in pursuing the

529
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,080
 values of the kingdom, to be unified in pursuing the heart change in our own lives, but then

530
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:25,040
 the transformation of our families, our neighborhoods, our communities, our cities, and even our

531
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,720
 nations that comes as we respond to the work of Jesus in our heart, as we respond to the

532
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:33,720
 healing that only He can bring to our hearts.

533
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,240
 God, I pray that it would happen.

534
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:38,880
 I pray that we would be healed and that we would love one another and that we would be

535
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,880
 one.

536
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,680
 In Jesus' name, amen.

537
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:51,680
