1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 Good morning and welcome. I'm so excited that you're joining us this morning on this beautiful Easter Sunday for the Urban Voice English Service.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 So glad that you're here and I hope that you've enjoyed this week. It really has been beautiful.

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 There's been some very beautiful days. There were a few cool days, but there were some really nice days here in Chicago.

4
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 I love this time of year, the spring when the days are getting longer and the grass is beginning to turn green

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 and there's even some flowers beginning to bloom. Such a beautiful time of year and so hopeful for us.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
 It reminds us of the renewal and the new life that God brings. So this is just a really beautiful time of year.

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:47,000
 I hope you're getting outside and enjoying it. I've been trying to get out and enjoy it and garden and hike and walk with my wife and my kids.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 I love being outdoors, so I've been doing that.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 This is a special week, obviously. That's why I'm dressed up a little bit. If you've tuned into the U.V. English Service before,

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 you know I don't normally dress up like this. It took me a while to tie this bow tie. I'm really not good at that at all.

11
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But I'm dressed up because it's a special week. It's Easter and this is really a special day in our faith

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 and a special time to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus and the hope that lies in that resurrection.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 I hope that as you've gone through this week, what we sometimes call Passion Week or Holy Week,

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 you've had a lot of time to reflect on Jesus and on His life and on His death and His death on the cross and what it meant for you.

15
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 I hope you've had a lot of time to connect with God, getting in the Word and spending time in prayer, spending time in worship,

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,000
 and maybe spending some extra time just reflecting on the cross and the story of the cross and what it means.

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 The redemption, the forgiveness, the grace that is communicated in that story. I hope this has been an encouraging week for you.

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 One of the things I love about Holy Week is it's kind of a microcosm of our faith.

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 It starts with Palm Sunday and excitement and anticipation and hopefulness and then it progresses through some really difficult times.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 Good Friday when Jesus is condemned to die and hung on the cross and He dies.

21
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:25,000
 There's a sense of hope deferred and of discouragement there.

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 Then it ends with Easter Sunday and the renewal of God's hope of redemption.

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 I think that's just a beautiful picture for us because it gives us a very real picture of our world.

24
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 The world we live in is broken. We can't pretend that everything is fine and that everything is okay and that everything is great.

25
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 We can't. We can't pretend that way in our faith. We need to be honest about the brokenness and the suffering of the world.

26
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,000
 But we can't get stuck in depression over how broken things are.

27
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 We have to have the hope of Jesus and that's what Easter is about.

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,000
 It gives us the hope that God has come to rescue us, that God is going to make things right.

29
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 That's really what we're going to focus on today.

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 We're going to focus on how the resurrection answers so many of the questions that we have in our hearts.

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:21,000
 It answers those heart cries, those deep longings and those heart-wrenching questions that we have.

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
 Jesus answered those things in the resurrection.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 He answered them in an affirmative way and He answered them in a beautiful and loving way.

34
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 We're going to look at that today.

35
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Let's turn together and look at Luke 24, the first 12 verses.

36
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
 This is the story of the resurrection.

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 It says, "But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.

38
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
 And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb.

39
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 But when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.

40
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 While they were perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.

41
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
 And as they were frightened and bowed their faces to the ground, the men said to them,

42
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 'Why do you seek the living among the dead? He is not here, but has risen.

43
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Remember how He told you while He was still in Galilee that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and on the third day rise.'

44
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 And they remembered His words.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,000
 And returning from the tomb, they told all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.

46
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 Now it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the other women with them who told these things to the apostles.

47
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 But those words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.

48
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 But Peter rose and ran to the tomb, stooping and looking in.

49
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 He saw the linen cloths by themselves, and he went home marveling at what had happened."

50
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 This is just the very beginning of the story of the resurrection.

51
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 There's so much more that's here, but we're just going to focus on this section today.

52
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 And it gives us a snapshot of what happened on the morning of the first Easter.

53
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And it begins to answer some of those questions that we have in our hearts.

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 The first thing I want us to consider this morning is that the resurrection is real.

55
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 It's real. It really happened.

56
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And I understand that it's an amazing story to hear and to consider.

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 And that a lot of us, when we hear it, we might feel skeptical.

58
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,000
 We might say, "Okay, wait a second. I don't know. Could this really happen?"

59
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Especially if you're not someone who's in the church, you might look at this story and say,

60
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 "Okay, this just seems too fantastic to even be true,

61
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 that someone could be raised from the dead when they've been in the tomb for three days."

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 And there's a lot of good evidence for the resurrection.

63
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 But I just want to focus on a few things today because we don't have a lot of time.

64
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 We could spend weeks and weeks talking about the evidence.

65
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 But I just want to focus on a few things to help remind us that there's a lot of good reason

66
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 to believe that this really happened and that the resurrection is real.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 It's not just a story. It's not just a fable.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 It's not just a myth or some story with a moral meaning.

69
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 It's actually something that really happened.

70
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 Now, we know that Jesus is one of the most, probably the most, well-documented figure in antiquity.

71
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
 There are so many sources about Jesus and his life that speak about him.

72
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,000
 And not just from Christianity, the Gospels, those sources.

73
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
 There's a lot of other contemporary historical sources from people who are not Christians

74
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 and who were just historians who wrote about Jesus and his life and his death.

75
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 And the fact that he was crucified, he died on a cross,

76
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 and his followers said that he rose from the dead.

77
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 So this is not really disputed by any historian, the fact that Jesus lived,

78
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 the fact that he was crucified on a cross, and the fact that people said he rose from the dead.

79
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 Pretty much everybody is in agreement about that.

80
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 But obviously there are people who say, "We don't think Jesus actually physically rose from the dead.

81
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
 That just seems like too much."

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 But here's three big things for us to consider this morning

83
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
 that help us see that this is something that really happened.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 First of all, there's the empty tomb.

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 Jesus' body was not there.

86
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 And that seems like something simple in the beginning, but it's an inescapable fact.

87
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 When we look in the book of Matthew, in chapter 28, verses 11 to 15,

88
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,000
 when the guards, who the priests had assigned to guard the tomb, come back to the priests,

89
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 the Jewish chief priests and the Jewish elders, and say,

90
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 "Hey, something crazy happened. There was this earthquake, and the body is gone."

91
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,000
 The chief priests say, "Well, we don't want this word to get out, so here's what we're going to do.

92
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 We're going to pay you guys some money to just tell people that the disciples came at night and stole the body."

93
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Now, these people, the priests and elders, were actually enemies of Jesus.

94
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 They did not like Jesus at all.

95
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,000
 If there was any way that they could produce his body and say,

96
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 "Hey, look, it's a hoax. It didn't happen. Here's the body here," they would have done so.

97
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 But even they, even though they did not like Jesus, could not escape the fact that the tomb was empty.

98
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 His body was gone.

99
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 So they had to invent a story to try to explain it.

100
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And that's an inescapable reality of history.

101
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 The tomb is empty. Jesus' body is gone.

102
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 No one has ever been able to say, "Hey, we found Jesus' body buried in this place, and we've confirmed it."

103
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 Or, "Hey, we found Jesus living in this other place as an old man, and we've confirmed that."

104
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 No one has ever been able to prove that.

105
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 No one has ever been able to say that the tomb is empty.

106
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 Jesus really lived on the earth. He really died on the cross.

107
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 And the tomb is empty. His body is not there.

108
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 He really rose again.

109
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 And the next thing I want us to consider is the eyewitnesses that were eyewitnesses to this.

110
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 Now, we can see here in Luke, in the passage that we read,

111
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 that even the eyewitnesses themselves were initially skeptics.

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 They were not sitting around trying to invent a story of how Jesus was rising from the dead.

113
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
 They were skeptical themselves.

114
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 They had forgotten that Jesus talked about being resurrected from the dead.

115
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 That's why the angels have to remind them of that in verse 7 of Luke 24, that Jesus had prophesied this.

116
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
 The angels remind them of that because they had forgotten.

117
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 They weren't expecting it.

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And they were carrying on as if Jesus' death was a final moment, as if it was all over.

119
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 How do we know that? We see that in their actions.

120
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 The women, who are the first witnesses to Jesus' resurrection.

121
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 And by the way, that's a whole other sermon in and of itself.

122
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 It's such a beautiful thing that the first witnesses to the resurrection of Jesus were women.

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 Because in the first century, in their culture, these women were not really empowered in any way.

124
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Actually, their testimony was not admissible in a court of law.

125
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 And so, if you were going to try to find witnesses to support something happening,

126
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 and to try to make a good case that this happened,

127
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:09,000
 you would not gather a group of women and say, "These are the witnesses."

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But Jesus, His resurrection was first revealed to the women because of God's love

129
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 and God's view of women in the kingdom of God.

130
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And that's a really powerful thing in and of itself.

131
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 But these women are the first ones who come.

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,000
 They have come to anoint the body.

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 They have come to put these burial spices and sweet-smelling things on the body.

134
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,000
 They're not coming because they're expecting for Him to be risen.

135
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 They're coming because they're convinced that He is dead.

136
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 And they're going to carry out some kind of last service to Jesus by caring for His body.

137
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 They're expecting Him to be dead in every way.

138
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 We also see that with the disciples, the eleven who are left.

139
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 Where are they? They're hiding out in locked rooms.

140
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 We see this in the Gospels, that when Jesus begins to appear to them,

141
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 they're hiding in locked rooms because they're afraid.

142
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 They're convinced that it's all over, that Jesus is dead,

143
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 that everything that they were moving towards and believing in is now done,

144
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 and that they're probably next, that the authorities are coming for them next.

145
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 And so, they're hiding in locked rooms.

146
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
 They're not anticipating this.

147
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 The disciples themselves are so skeptical that here in Luke's account,

148
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 chapter 24, it tells us that when the women, in verse 10,

149
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 come to the disciples, to the eleven, and tell them what they've seen at the tomb,

150
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 that the disciples, it seems to them like an idle tale, and they don't believe the women.

151
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 They say, "No, that's just too much. That's crazy. I can't believe it."

152
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Even the disciples themselves are skeptical.

153
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 They say, "This can't actually happen."

154
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And they had seen the miracles of Jesus,

155
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 and they had heard Jesus prophesy that He was going to rise again,

156
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 but they couldn't believe it. They couldn't accept it.

157
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
 So, obviously, it's okay to be skeptical.

158
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 It's okay to say, "Okay, this seems like something really big and amazing and impossible."

159
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Yes, it is impossible, but God has the power to do the impossible,

160
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 and that's what He's demonstrating here.

161
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Another thing that's important to understand about these eyewitnesses,

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 the women and the apostles themselves,

163
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 was they suffered for this story.

164
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 This was not a story that they told to get rich.

165
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 This was not a story that they told to benefit themselves in some way.

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 As they told the story of the risen Christ, and as they went out to share the gospel,

167
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:39,000
 they were persecuted for it, and every one of them was tortured and eventually killed

168
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 in terrible and brutal and violent ways for this story.

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And obviously, if you're telling a lie to other people,

170
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,000
 you might keep the lie up as long as it's benefiting you,

171
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 as long as it protects your reputation, or as long as it enriches you in some way.

172
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 But when it starts to hurt you, and when it starts to destroy your life,

173
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 you have no reason to continue to tell that lie anymore.

174
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,000
 And you have no reason to tell that lie until your dying moment,

175
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 and to believe in it with all of your heart,

176
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 so much so that you're willing to be martyred for that.

177
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 That just doesn't make any sense at all.

178
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And so we have to look at the lives and the testimonies of these eyewitnesses

179
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 and say that they were believing in something real and powerful.

180
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 They didn't allow themselves to be tortured and killed and martyred in violent and brutal ways

181
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 for some type of fantasy or some type of idea they had concocted in their head.

182
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 This was real, and they knew it, and that's why they had the power of God in their lives

183
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 to spread the gospel and to do miracles and to do all the things the Book of Acts talks about.

184
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 And it's why they believed it and believed it enough that they never recanted,

185
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 even when they were tortured, even when they were forced by authorities,

186
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 and the Romans and the Jewish authorities and all these different people

187
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 who just said, "Stop preaching, stop telling this story, just say it didn't happen,"

188
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 and they wouldn't, and they went to their deaths believing this because it was real.

189
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,000
 And by the way, the Book of Acts talks about the fact that Jesus appeared to over 500 people

190
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 after he had resurrected, before he went into heaven.

191
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 So this was not just a small group of people that got together and shared this story.

192
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It was hundreds of people who witnessed Jesus after the crucifixion,

193
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 who witnessed his resurrected body.

194
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 They were eyewitnesses.

195
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 And the last thing I want us to consider is just the presence of the church itself.

196
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 You know, if you concoct a big con and then you get found out,

197
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 you lose all credibility and no one will ever listen to you again.

198
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 Think about someone like Bernie Madoff who conned people out of their money,

199
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 and for a while he was trusted and everybody thought he was great

200
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 and that he was this financial wizard.

201
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
 But when it came out that he was lying to people and losing people's money,

202
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 then he was put into prison, and obviously no one would trust him with their money now.

203
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 So if this was some type of fabricated story that the disciples made up

204
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
 and it was a lie that they spread, then it could have been easily refuted,

205
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 and they would have lost all credibility,

206
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 and no one would have believed in the message of the gospel or the church,

207
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 and this movement never would have gotten off the ground.

208
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 Because everyone would have said, "Oh, we've heard it before. It was a big con.

209
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 It was fake. It was just a story that someone made up, and we can clearly refute it.

210
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:42,000
 That person has no credibility, and they should go to jail."

211
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 But that's not the case, right?

212
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 The church grew explosively and has continued to grow

213
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
 and has continued to weather storms of persecution and tribulation

214
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 and trials and trouble for the last 2,000 years.

215
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 And that tells us that the strength of the early church

216
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 and the continuing strength of the church today around the world

217
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,000
 and the growth of the church around the world

218
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
 is not because of something that was simply made up.

219
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
 It's because of something real.

220
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 Now, it is an amazing claim.

221
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 Other religions say, "Hey, our leader had a vision or a dream or something like this,

222
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 and that's how we came to know this enlightened truth."

223
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 Jesus says, "Hey, I rose from the dead,

224
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,000
 and I am the way, the truth, and the life, and through me."

225
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 That's how you know the truth.

226
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 That is an enormous claim,

227
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 but there's very good reason to believe that it's real.

228
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 I'm not trying to tell you that I'm going to convince you of it.

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 If you're a skeptic and you say, "I'm still not certain," that's okay.

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
 I'm not here to argue today,

231
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,000
 but I do want you to understand there are very good reasons to believe that this is real

232
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 and that it really happened

233
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 and that the power of God was at work in the life of Jesus

234
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 in raising him up from the dead

235
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 and in the church that began after Jesus left the earth.

236
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 I want to talk about how the resurrection answers some of the questions that we have in our life.

237
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 First, I want us to see that the resurrection certifies the message of the gospel.

238
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 The gospel says that there's one way to heaven.

239
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 Jesus says that he is the way, the truth, and the life,

240
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 and that no one gets to the Father except through him.

241
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Again, that's a pretty big claim.

242
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 Jesus talks about how we come to him through grace and forgiveness,

243
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 that it's not through doing good works.

244
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
 It's not through trying to be good enough.

245
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 It's not something that we earn our way into favor with God or earn our way into heaven,

246
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 but that it's through God's grace and love and forgiveness.

247
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 It's by grace and through faith, through our belief in Jesus' love and work on our behalf

248
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,000
 that we come into the kingdom of God.

249
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 Those are huge claims.

250
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
 Without the resurrection, we'd have a lot of reasons to say, "I'm not really sure if that's true.

251
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 That sounds too good to believe.

252
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,000
 That sounds too good to be true, that I could be forgiven for all the mistakes I've made,

253
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 for everything I've done wrong, and it could just be forgiven and wiped clean."

254
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 That sounds too good to be true, but the resurrection certifies that the message of the gospel is true.

255
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 It assures us and it says, "Yes, the gospel is real.

256
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Yes, Jesus is the Son of God.

257
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 Yes, Jesus is the way to heaven.

258
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 Yes, Jesus is the way to the Father.

259
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Jesus is the way to relationship with God."

260
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,000
 Yes, that comes through by grace and through faith, and you don't have to earn it,

261
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 and you don't have to work hard, and you don't have to perform.

262
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 It's not about that.

263
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 It's about Jesus cleansing you, forgiving you, and changing your life.

264
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 That message is certified and stamped as real by the resurrection itself.

265
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 That answers a lot of the questions we have about our own worth and our identity,

266
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:06,000
 and are we good enough, and do we have to be good enough, and how do we earn it.

267
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,000
 All those questions are answered because the resurrection says, "No, you don't have to earn it.

268
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Yes, God loves you.

269
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 Yes, you can be accepted.

270
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 Yes, you can be forgiven.

271
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Yes, you can come into the kingdom of God because of what Jesus did."

272
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:28,000
 The next thing I want us to see, and this is powerful for us to consider in the world that we live in right now,

273
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 is that the resurrection authenticates the future promises of God.

274
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,000
 The resurrection authenticates the future promises of God.

275
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 In the book of Isaiah chapter 40, verses 3 to 5, it says this,

276
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 "A voice cries in the wilderness, 'Prepare the way of the Lord.

277
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Make straight in the desert a highway for our God.

278
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 Every valley shall be lifted up, and every mountain and hill shall be made low.

279
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 The uneven ground shall become level, and the rough places a plain.

280
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed,

281
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,000
 and all flesh shall see it together, for the mouth of the Lord has spoken."

282
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 That's a beautiful promise.

283
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 When we look at our world and we see so much injustice, so much suffering, so much pain,

284
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 and so many unlevel places, so many crooked paths,

285
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 God has promised that one day in the future, He's going to make every crooked path straight.

286
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 He's going to fill in every valley.

287
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And that's metaphorical language that's saying that God is going to fix every injustice.

288
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 God is going to right every wrong.

289
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 God is going to balance out the scales of justice once and for all.

290
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 That is a beautiful promise.

291
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 In Revelation chapter 21, verses 1 through 6, it says this,

292
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 "Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth.

293
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 For the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.

294
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 And I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,

295
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.

296
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with men.

297
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 He will dwell with them, and they will be His people, and God Himself will be with them as their God.

298
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more.

299
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 Neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.'

300
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 And he who was seated on the throne said, 'Behold, I am making all things new.'

301
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 Also he said, 'Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.'

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 And he said to me, 'It is done.

303
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end,

304
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
 to the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.'"

305
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Man, what a promise.

306
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 What a promise.

307
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 There will be a time in the future when God will make everything new.

308
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 God will dry every tear.

309
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 There will be no more pain, no more disease, no more COVID, no more cancer,

310
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 no more suffering, no more grief, no more injustice, no more racism, no more poverty.

311
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 It will all be gone.

312
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 And that God will dwell with us.

313
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 That's the most beautiful part of the promise.

314
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 We were created for relationship to God, and our sin has broken that relationship,

315
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 and out of that brokenness comes all of the terrible and evil things that we see in the world

316
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 that we do to ourselves and do to one another.

317
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 But this promise is that God is going to restore that relationship,

318
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 and He's going to dwell with us.

319
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 We're going to be together like we were created to be.

320
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 What a beautiful promise.

321
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Now, without the resurrection, we could say,

322
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 "That's some beautiful language. That's some poetic stuff, and that sounds great.

323
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 Yeah, I really want that to be true, but I'm not sure that it actually is."

324
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 But the resurrection authenticates the future promises of God.

325
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And it says, "Yes, look at the power of God at work in Christ,

326
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,000
 and the power of God at work on the cross as Jesus dies for all of humanity

327
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 and offers forgiveness and grace to everyone,

328
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 and the power of God at work to raise Jesus from the dead,

329
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
 to defeat sin and to defeat death once for all."

330
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
 God has the power to do that,

331
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 and that authenticates the fact that God has the power to make all things new.

332
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 That when Jesus says He is the beginning and the end,

333
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 that He's the first and the last,

334
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 and that He can make all things new,

335
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:30,000
 that it's true, that it's real, that it's actually going to happen.

336
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
 The resurrection authenticates that.

337
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And you might say, "Well, that's great.

338
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,000
 I mean, the promise of heaven is beautiful. It is beautiful."

339
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
 You might say, "But is that enough?"

340
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
 That's something that the Church has grappled with through the ages,

341
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,000
 and people have at times accused the Church of being too focused on heaven

342
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 and not enough on this world.

343
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 And that's a legitimate criticism.

344
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 People can say, "Well, Christians shouldn't just sit around and say,

345
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 'Hey, one day it's going to be great. One day it's all going to be fixed.

346
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
 One day it's going to be better in heaven,

347
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 and we'll just wait until we get there, and in the meantime,

348
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 we'll just live in this world of suffering and brokenness

349
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 and all the terrible things that happen.'"

350
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 What about right here, right now?

351
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 And that's a very valid question that we have.

352
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:21,000
 And I want us to see that the resurrection

353
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,000
 doesn't just authenticate the future promises of God,

354
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 but it also validates the present imperative of living kingdom values.

355
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 The resurrection validates the present imperative of living kingdom values.

356
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
 We've been talking about kingdom values for a while now

357
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 as we study the Sermon on the Mount.

358
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:44,000
 And Jesus has been teaching us in that sermon

359
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 how important it is that we live out the values of the kingdom.

360
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
 He's taught us that ultimately our lives are supposed to be

361
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 so saturated with the values of the kingdom that it's like a sponge.

362
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 Whenever you squeeze a sponge, whatever that sponge is saturated with

363
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
 is what's going to come out.

364
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,000
 And our lives are supposed to be so full and saturated

365
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
 with the values of the kingdom that when we're squeezed,

366
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:10,000
 that the values of the kingdom come out into the lives of the people around us,

367
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 into the world around us.

368
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 Love, joy, peace--those are the things that are supposed to come out.

369
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:20,000
 And we look at our world and we say, "What about poverty?

370
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 Does Jesus care about that?"

371
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 And the resurrection says, "Yes, Jesus cares about poverty.

372
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 Jesus cares about the suffering of people in our present reality."

373
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 "What about racism? What about injustice?

374
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 Does Jesus care about those things?"

375
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
 "Yes, Jesus cares about those things."

376
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 "Jesus cares about human suffering."

377
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:44,000
 "What about oppression and people who live in places

378
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 where they're oppressed by evil governments or by armies

379
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 or people who come in and invade them and attack them

380
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 and all these terrible things that happen in our world?"

381
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 The resurrection says, "Yes, Jesus cares about that."

382
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 That's why He came. That's why He was here--

383
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,000
 to bring healing into our lives and to bring healing into those things.

384
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 We talked about that last week--that Jesus cares about the brokenness

385
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 of the systems and structures in our world, and He wants to heal them.

386
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 And He wants to bring healing into our hearts.

387
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 Jesus came to heal the world one heart at a time.

388
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And as He heals us, and as our lives get saturated with the values of the kingdom

389
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 and start to flow out into the world around us,

390
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 that a lot of the brokenness, the systems and structures,

391
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 and all those terrible things begin to change as well.

392
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 That's what Jesus wants for us.

393
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,000
 He wants us to be healed, and He wants us to be an instrument of healing in the world.

394
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
 Jesus does care about those things.

395
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 And that brings us to say, "But is Jesus enough?

396
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 Is Jesus enough to heal our world?"

397
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,000
 We say, "All right, Jesus, I hear what you're saying about peace and love and forgiveness.

398
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 That's good stuff. But you don't know how mean these streets are.

399
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:00,000
 You don't know how tough it is out here. You don't know how bad it is where I live."

400
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 And Jesus says, "Yeah, I do. I came. I lived it. I walked it.

401
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 I was killed by powerful forces that wanted me out of the way.

402
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 And they're the people who hung me on the cross because I was a threat to their power.

403
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,000
 But I defeated their power, not through force and coercion and greater power.

404
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 Even though Jesus had greater power, He defeated the powerful through love.

405
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 And that's what Jesus is showing us in the cross and in the resurrection.

406
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 And that brings us to another question that we have.

407
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 We may say, "Okay, is Jesus enough? Is the love of God enough?"

408
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:46,000
 The answer is yes. The resurrection tells us yes.

409
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:52,000
 But then we say, "But God, is it worth it? Is it worth it to live out the values of the kingdom?"

410
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 We've been talking about these for a while, like I said.

411
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 And they are tough to live out.

412
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,000
 Humility, deep humility that causes us to see our own poverty of spirit,

413
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 our own brokenness, treat others with meekness, mourn over sin and brokenness in our world.

414
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
 That's tough to live out. Is it worth it?

415
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 Being a peacemaker in a world that's full of violence and vengeance and hatred,

416
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 it is tough to be a peacemaker.

417
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 Is it worth it to try to be a peacemaker when everybody else is throwing rocks at you?

418
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 Is it worth it? That's a valid question.

419
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 Forgiving others, is it worth it to forgive someone else when they've wronged you?

420
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 Is it worth it to let them off the hook, to let go of that anger and frustration that you feel towards them?

421
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 Jesus called us to forgiveness. That's a kingdom value. But is it worth it?

422
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
 What about seeking purity of heart?

423
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 What about loving our enemies?

424
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 I was right here in the Sermon on the Mount. Man, that is tough.

425
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,000
 What about trying to honor God in all the practical ways of our life that Jesus has talked about,

426
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 our finances He talked about here in the Sermon on the Mount?

427
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
 How we're supposed to lay up treasures in heaven, not on earth.

428
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 We're supposed to be heavenly minded with what's valuable to us,

429
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 instead of being earthly minded and trying to just make money and stack it up.

430
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 What about honoring God with our relationships and with our sexuality?

431
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
 Those things are really difficult.

432
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 Is it worth it to try to obey God and try to live out the values of the kingdom?

433
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 The resurrection says yes. The resurrection validates the present imperative of living the values of the kingdom.

434
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 The resurrection validates that yes, the sacrifices that we make to obey God

435
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 and to seek His kingdom first and to honor Him in our lives are worth it.

436
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 You know, when we think about these questions and we say,

437
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
 "Man, I have so many questions about following God."

438
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 Think about the disciples and the questions they had.

439
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 They had just spent three years of their life devoted to Jesus and to following Him.

440
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 They quit their jobs, they left their families, and they spent every moment with Jesus.

441
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 And then they had seen Him crucified on the cross.

442
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 And it felt like everything that they believed in,

443
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 everything that they had built their world around, was gone and had come crashing down.

444
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
 No wonder they were depressed.

445
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
 No wonder they were hiding out in a locked room.

446
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 That's what I would have been doing. I wouldn't have wanted to move in that situation.

447
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 But then what happened? The resurrection happened.

448
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 And suddenly it answered every question they had.

449
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 They must have had so many questions.

450
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,000
 "Why, God? Why did this happen?"

451
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 "Why did you even call us in the first place that this was going to happen?"

452
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 "Why did you let this happen?"

453
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 "Why did you let the Romans and the Jewish leaders kill you?"

454
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
 "It was so unjust. It was so wrong. Why?"

455
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
 But the resurrection answered every question.

456
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,000
 And it validated all the things that Jesus had taught them.

457
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,000
 And suddenly they saw that this stuff is real.

458
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,000
 And Jesus was telling us the truth the whole time.

459
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 And that's why they went out and lived so powerfully.

460
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:14,000
 And through them and through the early church,

461
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 the world was literally turned upside down, as the book of Acts says.

462
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 Because the teachings and the truth and all of the things that Jesus had taught them

463
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,000
 were validated by the power of the resurrection.

464
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
 When they saw that, they knew it's all true.

465
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 It's all true. And they went out and lived like it's all true.

466
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 And that is so important for us to see in our world.

467
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:46,000
 In our world that's built on strength and brute force and power,

468
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,000
 Jesus came and conquered with His love.

469
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 And He conquered with forgiveness. And He conquered with grace.

470
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
 And He conquered with redemption.

471
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,000
 And He conquered sin and death once and for all.

472
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,000
 Where does that leave us?

473
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 If you're someone who's watching today and you say,

474
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,000
 "Okay, well, I hear what you're saying and it sounds really good,

475
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 but I don't know. I don't have any relationship with Jesus.

476
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 The kingdom of God, that's not really something that I understand or that I'm a part of."

477
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 The scripture is really clear that you can come into the kingdom at any moment.

478
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 That you don't have to do anything other than believe in Jesus and put your trust in Him.

479
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 You couldn't earn it anyway. I couldn't earn it. None of us could earn it.

480
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:32,000
 All of us are sinners. All of us have made mistakes and fallen short and messed up.

481
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 All of us have broken our relationship with God that we were created for because of our mistakes.

482
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 But God loved us so much, He said, "I want to restore the relationship."

483
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 He sent His Son to earth. His Son, Jesus, who didn't sin, who lived the perfect life

484
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 and at the end of His life laid His life down in our place as a sacrifice for us.

485
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 Took the wrath of God that we deserved on Him for our mistakes and our sin

486
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 and our terrible, evil stuff that we do.

487
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Jesus took it all on Him. Suffered the penalty, paid the cost

488
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:10,000
 so that we could be forgiven and we could be made free.

489
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
 And all we have to do to experience that is believe it and say,

490
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:20,000
 "God, I believe that Jesus was the Son of God. I believe that He died for me.

491
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
 I believe that He offers forgiveness that can wash away all of my sins and I want it and I'm asking for it."

492
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:32,000
 If you trust and believe that, then you come into the kingdom of God.

493
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
 You come into the family of God.

494
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 Romans 10, verses 9 and 10 says this,

495
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
 "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead,

496
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified,

497
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 and with the mouth one confesses and is saved."

498
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:50,000
 If you've never done that, if you've never believed in your heart,

499
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 if you've never confessed with your mouth that Jesus is the Lord,

500
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
 that He has forgiven your sins and paid the penalty for you,

501
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 you can do that right now. You can do that today.

502
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 You can enter the kingdom of God.

503
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 But a lot of you are probably people who have already entered the kingdom of God,

504
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
 but maybe you still have those questions.

505
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 You still have those things, those hurts, those pains of life.

506
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
 And you say, "God, I don't know if I really want to follow You in this area.

507
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:22,000
 I don't know if I really trust You with this part of my life or this part of my heart or this part of my experience."

508
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And to all of us who are in that place, I would say that Jesus is calling us to surrender to the values of the kingdom

509
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
 and to really seek to live them out as if they are true because they are.

510
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 And the resurrection validates that.

511
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,000
 Remember Matthew 6, verse 33, right here in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus says,

512
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 "Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."

513
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,000
 It's a nice sounding statement, but what if it were actually true?

514
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 How would that affect the way you live your life?

515
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
 And the resurrection says it is true.

516
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 You can seek God's kingdom and surrender everything to Him.

517
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,000
 You can seek to have your life saturated with the values of the kingdom.

518
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 And even though it may lead to sacrifice at times, it may lead to persecution at times,

519
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:14,000
 it may lead to difficulty at times, it will also lead to joy.

520
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 It will also lead to amazing transformation in your heart and life.

521
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,000
 And it will be worth it. It will be worth it in this life, and it will be worth it one day in heaven.

522
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 It will be completely worth it.

523
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,000
 And the resurrection validates that.

524
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 So I want us to see that today, that the resurrection answers those questions that we have.

525
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 It answers them affirmatively.

526
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:42,000
 It says, "Yes, God loves you. Yes, God cares. Yes, God has a future for you."

527
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 And it's beautiful and wonderful, and God's going to dry every tear.

528
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,000
 But yes, God also cares about the present, and He wants good and blessing for you.

529
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:54,000
 And He wants you to know Him and walk with Him and experience relationship with Him.

530
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 And He wants you to experience healing in your heart and in your emotions and in your past and throughout your life.

531
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 And He wants you to experience transformation that allows you to be an instrument of healing in the world around you.

532
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 And the resurrection validates and affirms and authenticates all of that.

533
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 So we have a message of hope and of joy today when we consider the resurrection.

534
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 Let's pray.

535
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 God, thank You that Jesus is risen.

536
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 Thank You that He came and gave His life for us on the cross, but that was not the end of the story.

537
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 That He defeated sin and death once and for all, and that now He reigns on high in heaven.

538
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
 God, thank You for the power of the resurrection.

539
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 May the power of it be real to us.

540
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:50,000
 May we believe it and may it validate and authenticate all of those values of the kingdom that You have been pouring into our hearts.

541
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,000
 And may we begin to live like those things are actually true.

542
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
 May we begin to live them out.

543
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 May we become agents of healing in our world.

544
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,500
 In Jesus name, amen.

545
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:11,500
