[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840]   Hey family, it's great to be with you again. I hope that you had a good week
[00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.300]   I hope that you're encouraged and experiencing God's blessing in your life this week
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.720]   I'm praying for you. And as always I want to encourage you to reach out to us
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:17.300]   You can send us an email at info urban voice church comm we'd love to hear from you
[00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.440]   Any comments or questions you might have or any way that we can pray for you and this week?
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:29.040]   We're back in Matthew chapter 7 looking at this section where Jesus is talking about judgment
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.640]   And we're talking about how important it is to not have a judgmental attitude
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.520]   That's what we're really going to focus on this week how to avoid being
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.200]   Judgmental and Jesus is giving us a lot of truth in these verses about how to avoid being judgmental
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.880]   So let's look at these verses together. We're gonna start in verse 1 and read down
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.100]   To verse 5 this is Matthew chapter 7
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:57.920]   It says this judge not that you be not judged for with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged and with the measure you use
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.720]   It will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye?
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.760]   But do not notice the log that is in your own eye or how can you say to your brother?
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.560]   Let me take the speck out of your eye when there is a log in your own eye you hypocrite
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.040]   First take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.080]   Now last week we kind of did an intro we started to talk about what?
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.420]   Judgment is and what biblical discernment is and we talked about the fact that judgment is really
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.160]   comparing something to a standard and for us as believers
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:41.160]   That standard is God's truth that we we know from God's Word and so for us to exercise discernment
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.120]   To make judgments about things we compare them to God's truth and to God's Word
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.800]   And we also talked about the fact that that's something that is important to our lives in a lot of ways
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.480]   We talked about the fact that judgment has a very negative connotation
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.040]   and
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:02.040]   That's okay. It has a negative connotation for good reason it has a negative connotation because
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.400]   People and often people in the church have been very judgmental of others
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.400]   And so that has caused people to have this reaction to it and to say that's something bad
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.320]   But even though it has a negative connotation
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.040]   We it's still something that we have to do we have to exercise discernment
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.360]   We have to exercise judgment in order to function in order to live life in order to make decisions in order to have
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.980]   Relationships with other people and in order to know what's right and wrong and what's healthy for us, and what's not healthy
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.080]   So we talked about that last week all of those things and this week what I want us to start to do is to start
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.680]   To see how we can avoid having a judgmental attitude. That's really I believe what Jesus is saying in this verse in verse 1
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.480]   He's not saying that we shouldn't judge
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.520]   He's saying that we should not have a judgmental attitude
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.840]   And he's laying out a lot of ways that we need to avoid having a judgmental attitude, so I want us to begin to
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.960]   Examine that today
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.360]   The first thing I want us to see about a judgmental attitude. That's unhealthy is that a judgmental attitude is
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:14.200]   Graceless it doesn't see God's grace in my life or God's grace in the life of others a judgmental attitude is
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.160]   Graceless you know verse 2 Jesus says for with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged and with the measure you use
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.280]   It will be measured to you
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.880]   Now what is Jesus saying in that verse is he's saying that you know however you judge someone else is how God is going to
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.800]   Judge you if you judge harshly God will judge you harshly
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:40.480]   I don't think that's really what Jesus is saying because we know biblically that God judges us all according to the same
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:46.280]   Standard his standard of justice and righteousness and that by the way none of us could ever measure up to it
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.680]   That's only because of Jesus that any of us can be accepted in God's sight God is not a biased judge
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.240]   He judges us all by the same standard
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:00.680]   So I don't think this this verse is saying that God's standard will change depending upon how we treat others
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.600]   I think this verse is actually really similar to Matthew 5 14
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:13.120]   Where Jesus is talking about forgiveness and in that verse Jesus is not saying that if we don't forgive others God will refuse to forgive us
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.080]   But what Jesus is saying is that in light of how much God has forgiven us
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:26.640]   That we should be able to forgive others, and I think Jesus is saying something very similar here in Matthew 7 - he's saying look
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.160]   Look at the measure that God has judged you with
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.720]   Look at the mercy and grace that God has poured out into your life
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:44.000]   Look at your own need and how much you fell short of God's standard and how much you messed up and how much
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.080]   you sinned and how broken you were and
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.960]   That's the type of judgment that you need to pronounce on someone else
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   You need to be full of grace when you look at someone else's life
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.880]   And I think that's a huge way that we can begin to avoid being
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:10.440]   Judgmental in our life and avoid having a judgmental attitude is by practicing awareness of God's grace in our life
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.680]   We should not ignore the activity of God's grace in our heart and in our life
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.080]   And we should extend grace to others
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:25.080]   Because when we examine our life and say God has forgiven me of so much God has covered
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.440]   So much of my mistakes God has healed so much of my brokenness
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:36.120]   God has restored so much of the stuff that I did foolishly or I wasted or I did something completely
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.600]   I was headed in the wrong direction completely and God
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.840]   Turned me around and restored me and he fixed it or I did something unkind to someone else and I I harmed a relationship
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:51.400]   And God restored it and healed it and God brought forgiveness and all this stuff when we start to see
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.200]   God's grace and mercy and how deeply it was poured into our heart and our life
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:03.800]   Then we can begin to extend grace to others and I think that's what Jesus is saying in verse 2 here
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.280]   He's saying that we need to be aware of God's grace and extend that to someone else
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:15.760]   And so that's one of the big ways we can avoid being judgmental is by practicing awareness of God's grace
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:23.360]   The next thing I want us to see about a judgmental attitude is that a judgmental attitude is arrogant. It's proud and
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.520]   The way that we can really avoid that type of attitude is by practicing
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.320]   poverty of spirit we talked about poverty of spirits the first beatitude in Matthew chapter 5 and
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.880]   We talked about what it really is. It's an awareness of our spiritual bankruptcy before God
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.360]   It's an awareness of our need and when we are aware of our spiritual bankruptcy before God it gives us a deep
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.920]   humility and
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.760]   Humility is so important humility is probably one of the most defining
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:03.080]   characteristics of a true Christian a true believer a true subject of the kingdom of heaven is that
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:11.080]   That person should be humble and that person should live with a deep humility a deep awareness of their own need for God
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.080]   And if we are full of humility
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.640]   We will not be having a judgmental attitude towards others
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.600]   Even when we begin to see something in someone else's life that is unhealthy
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:29.040]   We will respond to it with a spirit of love and we will respond to it honestly with the spirit of brokenness
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.720]   when we see someone else who is who is
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.920]   Struggling or who has some need in their life. We should never have a spirit of saying. Oh, I'm better than that person
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.520]   Yeah, they're having a problem. I would never have that problem
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:45.760]   If our heart is the heart of Jesus our heart says I am so
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.360]   broken and sad over this need in their life and how hurting they are and how
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.840]   They've made this mistake and how it's damaged their life and and I'm I'm broken up and and I'm in tears over it
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:02.560]   Not an attitude that says yeah, I knew it. I knew they were gonna mess up or look at me compared to them
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.640]   I'm so much better. That is a judgmental and proud and arrogant attitude
[00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:12.040]   And Jesus is calling us to an attitude of humility that when we make discernments
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:14.920]   we should do that with a deep humility and
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:22.500]   even if we're in a position where we are able to discern something and judge something that someone else cannot see and God allows us to
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:27.880]   See some of his truth in a way that someone else doesn't we still are gonna communicate that
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:32.720]   From a place of humility and love and care for someone else, you know
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.840]   another thing about a judgmental attitude is that it's focused on the brokenness of others or the problems of others and
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:46.960]   one of the ways that we can avoid that is by practicing seeing our own brokenness first and
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.120]   Jesus makes it so clear for us here in this passage in verses 3 to 5
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:55.720]   He says this why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye?
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.160]   But do not notice the log that is in your own eye or how can you say to your brother?
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.360]   Let me take the speck out of your eye when there is the log in your own eye
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:12.760]   You hypocrite first take the log out of your own eye and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye
[00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:20.160]   Jesus uses this metaphor for us. That's so engaging and beautiful, but it's it's humorous and
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.080]   He does that on purpose. He says look this is what you look like
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:31.040]   When you go out with a proud self-righteous attitude and you don't see your own brokenness
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:34.480]   You don't see your own need and you start trying to help someone else
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:38.320]   You look like somebody who has a giant
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:44.280]   Splinter a log size splinter in your eye and you're looking at someone else saying hey
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.160]   there's a little speck of dirt in your eye, let me brush it out for you and
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:54.560]   Everybody in the room is looking right at you and going. Hey, do you not see there's a log in your eye?
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.520]   Do you not get this and that's what Jesus is describing for us?
[00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:07.920]   He's saying stop looking at the brokenness of other people first stop seeing their problems first and stop thinking
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.560]   Oh, this is all them and I'm here to fix it because I'm such a great person
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:18.240]   Jesus is saying no, that is not a kingdom value. The attitude is wrong. It's proud and arrogant
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:22.160]   Jesus is saying see your own need first
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.020]   You know one of the things that I've seen in my life
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:27.760]   Maybe you've seen this in your life
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.200]   Is it sometimes the the things that irritate us the most about other people?
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:37.480]   Or the situations that irritate us the most or the personality types that irritate us the most
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.600]   One of the reasons they irritate us so much is
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.360]   That that's who we are
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:49.000]   sometimes the people that we clash with the most are the people that are most like us and
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:53.240]   There's something about seeing our own sin and our own
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.640]   weakness and our own
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.720]   Idiosyncrasies
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.560]   Reflected in someone else that just drives us crazy and we want to call it out and we want to say hey stop being arrogant
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:12.120]   Because we're arrogant and we want to say hey stop being unkind because we're unkind
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   And we want to say hey stop being unjust because we're unjust we want to say hey stop favoring other people
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.040]   Because we are favoring other people
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.480]   You know a lot of times that is a big red flag to us
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.160]   When we find ourselves being really irritated at someone else
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.800]   It's a big red flag that that
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.440]   Same issue is probably something in our life and we should use it as a red flag to say wait
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:42.000]   I need to go back and examine my heart. Why is this bugging me so much?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.680]   Why is it bugging me so much that I see this person at work who's?
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:50.680]   Unsuccessful and and I don't feel like they deserve it and it's just making me so mad
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.520]   Maybe it's because
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.920]   I've taken some shortcuts and I've done some things to try to
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:02.160]   Put myself in a position that I didn't deserve and so when I see someone else behaving in that way
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.800]   Then it just makes me angry. Why is it that when I see someone else being manipulative?
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:10.840]   It makes me so upset and I say they've got to stop being so manipulative
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:17.280]   Maybe it's because I'm manipulative in some of my relationships. And so I know how to recognize it in someone else
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   And so when I see it in them, I know exactly what's going on
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:24.680]   And that's why I'm so frustrated and angry and I I lash out at them so much
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:30.680]   oftentimes the brokenness of someone else is reflecting our own brokenness and
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:37.480]   We want to try to go fix their brokenness and Jesus is saying no you examine your heart first
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.040]   You let God deal with your brokenness first. You let God deal with your sin first
[00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:50.440]   You take your need to God and then after God heals you and restores you and helps you
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:56.620]   You'll actually be able to help someone else because first of all now you can actually see clearly. I love the
[00:12:56.620 --> 00:13:03.880]   Illustration Jesus gives us here of stuff in your eye because obviously if something's in your eye, you can't see clearly
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.480]   so how are you gonna help someone else when you're half blind because there's stuff in your eye and
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.560]   That really helps us to apply what Jesus is saying here first
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:19.360]   We've got to let God deal with our brokenness and our sin and then after that maybe we can go help someone else
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:21.800]   Because we can see clearly
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:29.440]   But also now we have a testimony if God has worked on your brokenness and helped you to to be healed and to be restored
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.880]   Now you can see clearly
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:37.440]   What how you can help someone else, but you also have a testimony to share with someone else and you can say yeah
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.480]   You know what?
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.560]   I'm just as broken as you are and I used to struggle with that exact same thing
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:45.560]   And this is how Jesus brought healing and restoration of my life
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.360]   And this is how Jesus helped me and you have an attitude of grace and humility
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:56.080]   And true concern for that person and what's going on in their life and you actually have a testimony something
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:14:00.880]   That's helpful that you can share with them instead of just saying hey, you're wrong and I don't like it
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.880]   I don't like what you're doing, right?
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:06.160]   That's a judgmental attitude and Jesus is
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.720]   Calling us to examine our own hearts first and we have got to practice that in the church
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:15.360]   We've got to look at our own need first before we try to fix
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:22.160]   Everybody else around us and another thing that we see about a judgmental attitude is a judgmental attitude is
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:29.680]   Misjudging this is huge. This is so important for us to understand as humans
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:32.400]   We look on the outward appearance
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:41.040]   That's what we see and that's all we can see and we misjudge a lot of things based on the outward appearance
[00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.680]   And we've got to stop doing that, you know in first Samuel 16 7
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:50.240]   this is when the Prophet Samuel has gone to anoint the next king of Israel and
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.000]   God tells him to go that he's gonna be one of the sons of Jesse
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.040]   And so it's Jesse's son start coming out and the Prophet Samuel's looking at Jesse's sons
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:03.240]   And he sees this guy named Eliab who apparently was you know
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:07.640]   big and strong and handsome and everything that Samuel thought a king should be and
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:14.160]   Samuel says oh, this is probably the guy I should go ahead and anoint him because you know, this is King material right here
[00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:16.560]   and in verse 7
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:18.240]   God says this
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:23.840]   But the Lord said to Samuel do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:27.680]   Because I have rejected him for the Lord sees not as man sees
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.720]   Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:41.400]   God is the only one who can see our hearts and see our thoughts and see our intentions and see our motivations
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.840]   God can see that the Bible is clear about that Genesis 6 5 says the Lord saw
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:51.920]   The wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every intention of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.640]   that verse is before God's judgment in the days of Noah and
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:16:04.800]   That verse tells us that God can see our thoughts and God can see our intention and God knows if it's evil
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:08.240]   Or if it's wicked God knows what's in our heart. He knows what's in our head
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:11.660]   He knows what's on the inside of us. The Bible is clear about that
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:17.280]   But here's the thing we as humans do not and that's one of our biggest
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:24.080]   Problems in judging other people. That's one of the ways that we get ourselves into the most trouble is
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:28.920]   We begin to think that we are able to judge someone else's intent
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:37.680]   Someone else's motivation someone else's thoughts why they did something and answer all these questions that we cannot answer
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:42.320]   When Jesus talks about exercising right judgment
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:50.800]   The only thing we can do as humans is compare someone else's actions to God's standard and say was their action
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.040]   Right, was it healthy we can do that
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.720]   Okay, but we do not have any grounds to
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:03.040]   Say why they did it or to judge their intents or their motivations or their thoughts
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.800]   I don't believe you can find any place in scripture to support
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:13.760]   The view that we as humans are able to judge the intents and thoughts and motivations of others
[00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:18.960]   Only God can do that and yet we try to do that all the time
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:25.440]   We judge intent all the time. You hear us as humans saying. Oh, well, he thought this. Oh, well, she thought that oh
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.440]   he did this because and
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:33.160]   Then we list a motivation or we list an emotion or we list a thought or we list an intention
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:35.400]   we have no idea if they did that because
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:40.520]   We say oh well this happened because this person felt this way. We don't know how they feel
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.080]   We say this happened because they were afraid
[00:17:43.080 --> 00:17:48.920]   Well, maybe so but we also it could have also been because they were excited. We have no idea
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:53.120]   What is going on inside the heart of another person?
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:59.600]   We can discern and make judgment decisions based on someone's actions. We can look at someone else's life and say
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:05.440]   We can compare it to the standard of God's truth and say okay that action was not healthy
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.680]   God has said that that's not a healthy action for us to undertake
[00:18:08.680 --> 00:18:13.860]   God has said that if we undertake that action it's gonna harm us. It's gonna harm the people around us
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.720]   We can look at someone's action and know if it was healthy or not
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:24.240]   But we do not know what's in their heart and we have got to stop doing that
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:29.460]   that's such an unhealthy thing for us to do and I would say a great way for us to
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:34.720]   Avoid that type of judgmental attitude is to to practice banning ourselves
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:39.240]   from judging intent and motivation and thoughts
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:45.320]   When you find yourself observing someone else's actions observing someone else's behavior
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:52.320]   Whether it's in life you you actually see someone do something that's wrong or are unhealthy or unkind to someone else
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.840]   Or maybe it's you know on social media or something whenever you
[00:18:56.840 --> 00:19:00.560]   Observe someone in some way and you start to think oh
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:07.160]   They were thinking this. Oh, they said that because oh they did that because oh, I know why that happened
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.520]   They intended to do this
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:08.800]   Oh
[00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:15.160]   They were being manipulative and they said this to make me think that when you start to go through those mental
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.880]   Gymnastics and you start to tell yourself that you know
[00:19:17.880 --> 00:19:22.960]   What people are thinking or what they intended or what their motivations were or what their thoughts were?
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:30.600]   You need to say wait, I I can't do that. I don't actually know. I don't know why they said that
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:34.240]   I don't know why they did that. I don't know why they reacted that way
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:40.480]   Sometimes we just assume well this person reacted negatively to me because they they don't like me
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:44.220]   maybe they reacted negatively to to me because
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:49.720]   They were having a terrible day and there was all these things that happened in their day that I didn't observe and had no idea
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.840]   About or maybe they totally misunderstood what I said
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:59.960]   Maybe they thought I said something that that I didn't even say I remember a long time ago when I was in college
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:04.080]   I had a bad ear infection and I happened to be
[00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.680]   leading this Bible study and there was quite a few young people there was like high school students and
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:15.680]   I was leading and we were in a room and I was having people go around and introduce
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.640]   Themselves and we were sitting in a big circle. There were some adults in the circle as well
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:22.680]   and so the young people were introducing themselves and
[00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:27.040]   answering some icebreaker questions and we got like halfway around the circle and
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.680]   One of the young people said kind of quietly
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.880]   Why don't you let the adults introduce themselves because there were some adults in the circle and I thought
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.480]   that this young person said
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:45.400]   there's some people outside who need your help and so I got up and
[00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:50.240]   Walked out of the room left the circle walked out the door and went outside
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.720]   I was outside looking around for a while couldn't find anybody then I came back into the room
[00:20:55.720 --> 00:21:00.400]   Everybody was staring at me like I was an alien and I said, yeah, there's no one out there
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.400]   I couldn't find anybody and
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:06.600]   Everybody started laughing and people are like, what are you talking about?
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.000]   And so I was like, I don't know and then they explained to me that this young person had said
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.320]   Why don't you let the adults introduce themselves? I
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:17.320]   undertook a really strange action
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:23.000]   Because I totally misunderstood what this person had said and that happens in life all the time
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.760]   things happen because of
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.880]   misunderstandings things happen because of
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:35.480]   fear or frustration or hurt things people do things because of something they've gone through in the past in a
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:41.720]   Situation our relationship reminds them of that past hurt and they respond in a way that might be uncharacteristic
[00:21:41.720 --> 00:21:46.320]   We have got to stop always thinking that we know
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:51.520]   Why people are doing things or we know what they intend or we know what their thoughts are
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:54.200]   We know what motivates them because we don't
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.520]   God does and Jesus calls us to right judgment
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.440]   It's not that we can't ever look at someone's action and say that that's that's wrong or that's unhealthier
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.360]   That's not good for them
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:10.280]   We can and we actually have to do that if we love people in our lives. There are moments where we have to say
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:16.280]   That action is unhealthy. It's harming them. It's harming the people around them and I care about them
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.680]   So I'm gonna be honest about that. We have to do that in life
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:27.120]   But even in those moments we do not know what their thoughts and intents are and we shouldn't act like we do
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.520]   We've got to learn
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.600]   To ban ourselves from doing that when we find ourselves doing that we have to say hey
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.200]   I need to stop because I don't know what they're thinking. I don't know why they did that
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:43.520]   I I don't have that type of wisdom only God knows that and so I'm gonna focus on helping them to
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:47.240]   Respond to God and to make right decisions. I'm gonna focus on loving them
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.880]   I'm gonna focus on caring for them, but I'm not gonna attribute thoughts and intents and motivations to them because I don't know what they are
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.000]   Unless those are expressed to me in some way
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:03.120]   I have no idea what is in someone's heart and we've got to live by that to avoid a judgmental attitude
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.800]   Now there's a lot more aspects of avoiding a judgmental attitude that we're going to talk about next week
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.200]   But those are some big ones for us to practice this week
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:15.760]   We need to practice awareness of God's grace and extend that to others
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.480]   We need to practice poverty of spirit and humility so that we're not arrogant and proud
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.840]   We need to practice seeing our own brokenness first like Jesus taught us and we need to practice banning ourselves
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:28.760]   from judging
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:35.000]   Intent and motivation and thoughts and things like that that we just don't know and that we're not able to know
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.440]   We don't have the ability to know those things
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:45.000]   So let's work on these things this week in our life as we encounter them as we exercise judgment and make discernments
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   All of us have to do it all the time every day throughout the week. And so as we do that this week
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   Let's really start
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:58.920]   allowing Jesus to work on our heart so that we will not have a judgmental attitude so that we'll be kind and loving and caring and
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:06.040]   Operate from a place of love as we interact with other people and even when we see some someone doing something unhealthy
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:12.560]   That's something that God has told us is not a behavior for us to engage in we can have a spirit of love and kindness
[00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:19.640]   as we as we interact with that and as we encourage our friends and our loved ones and the people around us towards
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:26.680]   Right behaviors. We need to have a spirit of love and care for others at all times and a spirit of humility a
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:31.800]   Spirit of seeing our own need for God a spirit of grace. Let's pray
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:38.280]   God, I just pray that you would give us an awareness of your grace and how much you've extended grace to us and
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:45.240]   That we would live from that place of knowing how much mercy and grace you poured into our lives and we would extend it to others
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:48.360]   God, I pray you'd give us poverty of spirit
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:52.920]   Help us to see our own need for you and help us to have meekness that comes out of that
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:57.480]   because we see our need for you or we're able to operate from a place of humility and
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:25:00.740]   And to see our own brokenness first God
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:06.840]   I pray you'd help us to see our brokenness before we look at the brokenness of others help us to examine our own heart first
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:11.720]   God and God help us not to misjudge others because we only see the outward appearance
[00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:17.800]   Help us not to think we know what's going on in the heart when we don't and help us to be honest about that
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:18.520]   God
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:25.840]   help us to love and care for the people around us and help us to even when we need to exercise discernment and judgment and
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:27.320]   even when we need to
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:34.040]   To help someone else to move towards you and to move towards right relationship to you God help us to do that
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.400]   In a way that comes
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:42.600]   From love and in something that is rooted in your love and your love for us and your love for others God help us to always
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:50.580]   Operate from a place of love God and even as we exercise discernment God help us to grow in this right now this week
[00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:52.280]   help us to grow in
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.560]   avoiding a judgmental attitude and having
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:59.360]   Discernment and right judgment that honors you God in Jesus name. Amen
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
