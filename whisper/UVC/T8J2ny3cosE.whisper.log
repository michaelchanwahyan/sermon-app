[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Good morning, UB. I hope you guys are extra awake today with the additional hour of sleep
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   yesterday night. So, some of you may know, I recently just moved back into the city to
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   report, and this is actually the first time that I moved into pretty much like a fully
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   unfurnished apartment. And one of the things, one of the lists that I make for my apartment
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   is called things that would be nice to have but not necessarily needed. And under the
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   list are things like a new desk chair, an external monitor for my laptop, a couch, and
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   a couple of area rugs because my entire floor is like pretty much like bathroom tile. And
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   it gets really cold, especially heading into the fall and the winter as well. And so, if
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   you haven't guessed it yet, that list is pretty much some of the things that I think would,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   in some ways, increase the quality of my life a little better as I live in this apartment,
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   right? So, most of us are constantly finding different ways that we think can upgrade the
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   quality of our life, whether it is getting the newest iPhone, getting the latest technology,
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   or buying a new car, or doing some home projects to renovate your house, make it a little better
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   to live in, or even to smaller things like buying a new rice cooker that cooks better
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   rice. So, this is because deep down in us, there is always a deep desire to live a good,
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   a quality, and a meaningful life, right? So, in fact, there's actually an entire field
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   of study that is being dedicated to this goal of helping people live a good life. And that
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   field is called positive psychology. And a lot of universities actually in the US now,
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   they actually started offering this class in the field of positive psychology as well.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   So, this is according to University of Pennsylvania for the Center of Positive Psychology. This
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   is how they define what positive psychology is. So, positive psychology is the scientific
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   study of factors that enable individuals and communities to thrive. The field is founded
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   on the belief that people want to live meaningful and fulfilling lives, to cultivate what is
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   best within themselves, and to enhance your experience of love, work, and play. And this
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   quest of searching for the good life is not just a new and recent endeavor. But, in fact,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   all throughout history, if we take a look at the ancient Greek and the Rome, we actually
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   find many different philosophical schools that actually try to take on this quest of
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   what is a good life. So, for example, for the Epicureans, a good life is one that is
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   in pursuit of pleasure and the absence of pain. For Aristotle, a good life is a pursuit
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   of virtues and development of good personal character. And for Stoics, it is living in
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   harmony with the nature and with the cosmos, with the world around us. So, as we can see,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   the questions of what must we do to experience a good life or what is a good life, this is
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   actually an age-old question that different people throughout different generations have
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   tried to give an account for. But now I want to turn the questions to all of you here.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Who are you putting your trust in that you think will lead to a true and blessed life?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And if it is not a who, what are you putting your hope in that you think will lead you
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   to happiness in this life? So, let's pray together before we dive into our passage today.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Heavenly Father, thank you for your new mercies every morning, and we thank you that we are
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   able to come together as a body of Christ this morning to worship you. And I just ask
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   that during this time, your Spirit will be with us as we open up your Word and receive
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   from what you have to say for us this morning. I also just ask that your Spirit will be with
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   me as I speak from your Word. I just ask that your name will be glorified through our worship
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   this morning. I pray this in your Son's name, Amen.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Okay, so I'm going to do things a little differently this morning. So, if you have your Bible,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   whether it is on your phone or a physical Bible, I want to welcome you to pull out the
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   passage together. So, we'll be looking at Matthew 5, verse 17 to 20 this morning. So,
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   if you have your Bible, I would encourage you to pull it out, and we're going to go
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   through it together as well. So, I'm going to be reading from the NIV version. So, Matthew
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   5, verse 17. "Do not think that I have come to abolish the law or the prophets. I have
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   not come to abolish them, but to fulfill them. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen will by any means disappear
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   from the law until everything is accomplished. Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   least of these commands and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   of heaven. But whoever practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   kingdom of heaven. For I tell you that unless your righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   and the teachers of the law, you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven." So, this
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   is the word of God. So, when I preached here last time, back in June, I began a series
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount. And our passage today is actually situated right at the main
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   body of this Sermon on the Mount. So, again, I want to just give a quick review of the
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   structure of this Sermon on the Mount as a whole. So, this Sermon on the Mount begins
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   on Matthew 5 and it ends on Matthew 7. And last time, we looked at the introductory narrative
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   framework, pretty much setting up the scenes for where this entire teaching is happening.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   We saw that Jesus went up on the mountainside and then he began to teach his disciples.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   But we also see that there's some crowd present among them as well. And then we look
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   at the introduction as well last time, basically the Beatitudes and also the call to be the
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   salt and the light to the world around us. And so, in my last sermon, I also highlight
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   that this Sermon on the Mount as a whole, it serves as the guiding principle on how
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   we ought to live our life in the kingdom of heaven. This is not a set of impossible rules
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   that we cannot, like we can never follow, but this is actually an invitation from Jesus
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   to a way of living that will lead to true blessing and flourishing. And we also look
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   at how Jesus defined what a true and blessed life is through the Beatitudes. And according
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   to Jesus, a true and blessed life is a counterculture one. It is one that is being poor in spirit,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   mourning for sins and the brokenness around us. It is one that is being identified as
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   humble and meek and so on. So, today we're going to look at how we can experience this
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   truly blessed life through our passage today. And this is the big idea that I will be focusing
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   on today. Because the truly blessed life can only be experienced through Jesus, we need
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   to follow him and live in conformity with him. Again, because the truly blessed life
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   can only be experienced through Jesus, we need to follow him and live in conformity
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   with him. So, why the truly blessed life can only be experienced through Jesus alone but
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   not through other worldly things? In some ways, this is sort of like an exclusive claim,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   right? By saying that Jesus is the only way that we can experience this kind of life.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   So, for my sermon today, I'm going to give you two reasons on why the truly blessed life
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   can only be experienced through Jesus, and then I'm going to give us an implication
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   of what it means for us as followers of Christ. So, I hope you follow along. I'm going to
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   give you two reasons and one implication. So, reason number one on why the truly blessed
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   life can only be experienced through Jesus is because he is the only one that can fulfill
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   the righteous requirement of God on our behalf. So, let's look with me again in verse 17.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   So, Jesus began this section by saying, "Do not think that I've come to abolish the law
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   or the prophets." So, what is the law or the prophets? The law represents God's standard
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   of righteousness and holiness. Or, in other words, it basically refers to what it means
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   to live rightly before God. And the prophets, on the other hand, they help point to the
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   heart of the law, that it is not just about an outward appearance of obedience to this
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   law, but more importantly, it is about the attitude of one's heart. And collectively,
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   the laws and the prophets, they refer to the Old Testament scripture in this entirety.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   And by declaring that he has not come to abolish the law and the prophets, Jesus sets the tone
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   right away at the beginning of his ministry by clearing away all the potential accusations
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   and misunderstanding that people might have about Jesus, that he is somewhat anti-law
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   or anti-the Old Testament. And then Jesus further clarifies that, "I have not come to
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   abolish them, but to fulfill them." Okay, can you guys repeat after me? Not to abolish,
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   but to fulfill. Okay, one more time. I think you guys can do better. Not to abolish,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   but to fulfill. Okay, thank you. So, what does it mean that Jesus fulfilled the law
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   and prophets and not to abolish them? So, if you think of all the different laws that
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   we have, whether it is in your house, at school, at work, or in our society, behind each of
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   the law, there is a purpose, right? So, let's take the examples of speed limit in a school
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   zone. So, the purpose behind the speed limit at a school zone is not to limit how fast
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   you can drive, even though that is kind of like the consequence of it. But the true purpose
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   behind a speed limit at a school zone is to protect the students so that driver doesn't
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   just drive like 80 miles per hour and like run over school students. However, we can
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   be following the law, but totally miss the purpose behind the law, right? So, if you
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   have been with us this past couple of months, you might recall one of the announcements
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   that we make on both of our English and Cantonese services. Hey, if you see some kids running
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   around all the expensive car outside of our buildings, make sure to kind of like tell
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   them to like go somewhere else and play, right? So, one time after the Cantonese service,
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   I was just like walking towards the bathroom and then I saw some kids chasing around the
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   car. So, I just walk over and tell them, hey kids, like don't run around and play around
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   here. If you want to play, you can like go to the hallway and like do whatever you want
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   over there. But one of the kids, he basically just looked at me and replied, well, I'm not
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   going to run around the car then. I'm just going to walk slowly around the car. So, did
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   you guys see the problem here? Did you guys see the disconnect right here? The true intent
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   of me telling them not to run around the car is so that they don't accidentally like scratch
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   or like bump into the expensive car because we have to be like responsible to like pay
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   for the damage. But by the kids kind of like responding by, okay, I'm not going to run
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   around the car, but I'm still going to play around it by just like walking slowly, that
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   pretty much just defeat the purpose of the law, right? That I want them to like not bump
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   into the car or like accidentally like scratch those expensive car. So, in the same way,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   Jesus will fuse the law by revealing to us what the true intent and purpose is behind
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   the law in the Old Testament through his teaching. And in that way, we can understand what Jesus
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   actually means or like what those law actually means. And on the other hand, Jesus will fuse
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   the prophets in the sense that Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of all the Old Testament
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   prophecies made by the prophets about the one, the Messiah, who will come and deliver
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   God's people and bring about a new relationship between God and his people. So, when Jesus
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   say that he fuses the law and prophet, it means that the Old Testament in its entirety
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   ultimately points to Jesus. And Jesus is also the official interpreter of the Old Testament.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   And this Old Testament law, in light of Jesus coming, they now has a deeper meaning. And
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   in my following sermons, I will take a look at some of the examples. If you would just
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   want to take a look, if you have your Bible, just look at like verse 21 and the section
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   that follows. You will see that Jesus actually used this formula a lot. You have heard that
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   it was said, and then he will quote an Old Testament law. And then Jesus will say, but
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   I tell you this, and then Jesus would give his own interpretation. So, in that way, Jesus
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   bring kind of like a deeper meaning to this Old Testament law. So, why the truly blessed
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   life can only be experienced through Jesus? We look at the first reason that he is the
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   only one that can fulfill the righteous requirement of God on our behalf. And as a result of that,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   if we believe in him, Christ's righteousness will become our own and we will be made right
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   with God. And on this, Paul highlight that. This is from Romans 10 verse 4. Christ is
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   the combination of the law so that there may be righteousness for everyone who believes.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   And now we're going to look at the second reason. The second reason that the truly blessed
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   life can only be experienced through Jesus is because Jesus and his word is the only
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   and ultimate authority that will endure forever and lead to the truly blessed life. So, verse
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   18, for truly I tell you. So, notice the wording that Jesus used here. For truly I tell you
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   or for I tell you the truth. So, right away, Jesus is preparing his disciples for a very
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   important truth regarding the word of God that he's about to say to them. And then he
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   continues. For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter,
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the law until everything
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   is accomplished. And so, to give a little context here, the Old Testament is written
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   mostly in Hebrew and a little bit in Aramaic. And when Jesus says not the smallest letter,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   he is referring to the Hebrew letter, Yot, which is pretty much like an apostrophe. And
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   when he refers to the least stroke of a pen, he's referring to a stroke that in the Hebrew
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   alphabets that is used to differentiate a few of the different characters. But what
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Jesus is doing here, he's pretty much using an argument from lesser to greater. And so
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   he said, if he has even the smallest part of the Bible will not be abolished, what about
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   the law or the prophets? And so once again, Jesus is saying to his disciples that he has
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   not come to abolish the law and the prophets, but quite the opposite. He intends to bring
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   the law to his desired goal. That is a true transformation of our heart to the extent
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   that even the smallest details in the Old Testament will be fully accomplished in his
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   life and in his teaching. And on top of that, he say, until heaven and earth disappear or
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   until everything is accomplished, what Jesus is saying here is that as long as our present
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   world continue to exist, the word of God will continue to be valid and claims in authority
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   over our lives. Until every single passage in the Old Testament is being fulfilled in
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   him. So let's step back for a moment. When we hear something like this, that Jesus and
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   his words claims his authority over our lives. How does that make you feel? I think for me,
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   it actually feels a little uneasy because one of the popular anthems that our current
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   generation is singing is, you can be whoever you want to be, or I can be whoever I want
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   to be. I don't have to submit to anything, and I get to decide how I want to live my
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   life as long as it makes me happy. And on a surface level, this sounds kind of appealing,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   right? It seems like there's a lot of freedom to do whatever you want to do as long as it
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   doesn't hurt other people. However, if we actually take a look at the history of Israel
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   in the Old Testament, it is not hard for us to actually recognize the consistent threat
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   that when people are left to their own to decide what is good and evil in their own
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   sight, 10 out of 10 times, it would always lead to downfall and destruction. And if you
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   still need more convincing, all you need to do is just to look at the society around us
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   and the world around us, and I'm sure you can figure out pretty quickly of what evil
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   humanity is capable of when we're being left to our own device. And so, what is the
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   alternative here? If we get to decide how we want to live is not the solution, what
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   is the alternative here? I would argue it is to live in full submission to Jesus and
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   His Word, again, because the Word of God is the only and ultimate authority that will
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   lead to a truly blessed life. And just as a parent who knows a lot more than their children
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   about what is good and safe for them and then sets certain rules and boundaries to protect
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   their children, Jesus, who is all-knowing, knows infinitely more than us as humans on
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   what leads to a flourishing life. And so, these rules and laws are put in place not
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   to restrict our freedom, but it is put in place out of love to protect us. So, instead
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   of seeing this law as restrictive, it is actually a means of grace from God. Instead
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   of letting humanity walk down the path of self-destruction, these rules that is from
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   the Word of God function as a guide to lead us to a truly blessed life. So, we look at
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.000]   two reasons on why the truly blessed life can only be experienced through Jesus. What
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   is the implication for us as followers of Christ? To answer that, let us look at verse
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   19 together. So, verse 19. "Therefore, anyone who sets aside one of the least of these commands
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   and teaches others accordingly will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   practices and teaches these commands will be called great in the kingdom of heaven."
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   So, how should we live differently in light of this truth that Jesus is the only one that
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   can lead us to a truly blessed life? So, this is what I would say. As Christ followers,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   we need to live in conformity to Jesus and His commands. So, when Jesus say to practice
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   these commands, it means to not just submit to these commands, but also to live out, to
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   live out the commands as redefined by Jesus. Again, this is not just an outward conformity
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   to the law, but it comes from a sincere heart that is being transformed by the power of
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   the gospel. And in the following verse, Jesus further clarifies the importance of keeping
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   these commands and teaching others as well. So, He say, "For I tell you that unless your
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   righteousness surpasses that of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, you will certainly
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   not enter the kingdom of heaven." When it comes to the Torah, the Pharisees and the
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   teachers of the laws, they are kind of like the cream of the crop. And the Pharisees particularly,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   they're actually being known for the strict observance of the Jewish law. They don't just
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   like follow the laws that God has given in the Old Testament, but they themselves come
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   up with extra multiple laws just so that they can be extra careful. So, what Jesus is saying
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   here is that, in verse 20, is that, "According to our human standard of righteousness, the
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   only way a person can enter into the kingdom of heaven is for their righteousness to surpass
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   those of the Pharisees and the teachers of the law." And so, let me put it into some
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   perspective for us right here. So, since I moved back into the city, I got into the hobby
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   or sports of bouldering or rock climbing. And I actually have a few opportunities to
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   bring our youth students from Summit to climb in the past few months as well. And we actually
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   just went over yesterday as well. And so, in climbing, the difficulty of the boulder
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   problem is usually being great on the V scale, with V0 being the easiest grade, which is
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   pretty much like climbing a ladder. And currently, V17 being the most difficult grade that, yeah,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   in the world pretty much, like someone has successfully climbed. And usually, when we
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   bring our kids to climb, they will climb in around the V0 to V2 range, and maybe occasionally
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   a V3. And in order to encourage them sometimes to try a little harder, some of my counselors
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   will tell these kids, "Hey, if you're able to climb this problem, I will buy you a free
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   boba." And so, you guys have to understand that for this middle schooler and high schooler,
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   getting a free boba is like the best gift that they could ever receive or that they
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   could ever think of. So, every time we put those words out, "Hey, if you can climb this,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   you get a free boba," they will just get extra motivated and try really hard to get all the
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   way to the top. But imagine if we tell them this, "Hey, I will buy you a free boba if
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   you're able to climb this V17 problem," which, to put it into context, there are less than
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   10 climbers in the world that have successfully climbed a V17. So, if we tell this to the
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   kids, what do you think their reaction would be? They'll probably be like, "That is just
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   impossible. What do you want us to do right here?" So, in the same way, trying to earn
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   our own way into the kingdom of heaven with our own human effort, that is by having a
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   righteousness that surpasses or exceeds the Pharisees and the teachers of the law, is
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   almost as impossible as just me telling these kids to climb a V17 if they want to get a
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   free boba. But the good news is this, that the righteousness that we need to enter into
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   the kingdom of heaven, it does not come from ourselves. It doesn't depend on who we are,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   what ethnicity we are, what socioeconomic status we are, or what ability we have, or
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   what effort we put into it. The righteousness that we need to enter into the kingdom of
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   heaven comes from Jesus alone because he has fulfilled the law and the prophets. In other
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   words, the entire Old Testament scripture is found in fulfillment in the person of Jesus
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   through his life and his teachings. So, I've seen one of the preachers did this exercise
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   once before. He pretty much went through all the book in the Old Testament and tried to
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   show us how Jesus fulfilled each of these Old Testament scriptures. So, I did my own
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   similar exercise here, but I'm not going to go through every single book in the Old Testament.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   I just pick out a few to kind of try to show us what it means that the Old Testament scripture
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   ultimately being fulfilled in the life and teaching of Jesus. So, ready? Here we go.
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   In Genesis, Jesus is the promised offspring from the woman who will crush the serpent's
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   head. In the book of Exodus, Jesus is the Passover lamb whose blood save us from death.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   And also, Jesus is the tabernacle that dwells among us as his people. In the book of Leviticus,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   Jesus is the ultimate offering that deals with our sins once and for all. And Jesus
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   is also the high priest that become the mediator between God, a holy God, and a sinful people.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   In the book of Numbers, Jesus is the bronze serpent in which those who look to him will
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   be saved. In the book of Deuteronomy, Jesus is the greater prophet that Moses has promised.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And in the book of Proverbs, which we have looked into the past two weeks with Pastor Mark,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   Jesus is the wisdom personified. In the book of Isaiah, Jesus is Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   He is the suffering servant who was despised and rejected, pierced for our transgressions
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   and crushed for our iniquities. And by his wounds, we are healed. In the book of Jeremiah,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   Jesus is the new covenant that the Lord promised. In the book of Ezekiel, Jesus is the one who
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   will give us a new heart and a new spirit in order to do the will of God. And in the book of Daniel,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Jesus is the one like the son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. And I can go on and on,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   but hopefully you get the point that because Jesus has fulfilled the law and prophets to
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   enter into the kingdom of heaven and experience a truly blessed life, it doesn't depend on
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   our own righteousness, but the righteousness of Jesus alone. And all we need to do is to
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   follow him and live in conformity with him. So I want to come back to this verse in Romans 10,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   verse four again. Christ is the combination of the law so that there may be righteousness
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   for everyone who believes. So we don't usually use the word combination in our day-to-day
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   conversation, right? But the word combination here refers to the Greek telos, which pretty
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   much means the end or the goal. So when Paul say Christ is the combination of the law,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   what he is referring to is that the angle of the law is to lead us to Christ by revealing
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   to us our need for greater righteousness that can only come through Jesus. Again,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   because our own righteousness can never be enough to save us. So are you still trying to
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   earn your own righteousness? Once again, I want to start, I want to end with the same
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   questions that I start this sermon with. Who or what are you putting your trust in that
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   you think will lead you to a true and blessed life? Are you still searching for a way that
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   will lead to a truly blessed life, but with the intent to do it on your own strength?
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   Here's the invitation from Jesus. Come, follow me. So in a few moments, we're going to take
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   the communion together as a church and as the body of Christ in response to our message
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   today. And my hope is that this will be a time for us to slow down, to reflect on the
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   message that we have just received, and also to remember his sacrifice for us at the cross.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And 2 Corinthians 5 21, it says, "For God made Christ who would have never sinned to
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   be the offering for our sin, in order that we could be made right with God through Christ."
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   So in communion, the bread symbolizes the body of Christ broken for us in order that
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   we could be made right with God through Christ. And the cup, it represents the blood of Christ
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   poured out for us in order that we could be made right with God through Christ.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And so for those of you who are new here at UV, we have two tables set up with our communion
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   elements, one here at the front and one at the back. And before we take the communion
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   as the body of Christ, I'm going to put up a couple of reflection questions from my sermon
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   this morning up on the screen. And yeah, Phoebe, are you able to go back to my slides?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Okay, yeah. So I'm going to put these questions up. And what I want you to do is just to,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   yeah, take some time to sit before the Lord and reflect on these questions.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   Who and/or what are you putting your trust in that you think will lead to a true and blessed life?
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And in what ways are you trying to earn your own righteousness instead of trusting and submitting to Jesus?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   And during this time, I will have Lucy play a song in the background. This song is called
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   "Manifold," and it is actually written by a good friend of mine, Pastor Jordan Brown.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   And the idea of this song came from Ephesians 3, 10 to 11. And this is basically a song,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   this song is a call for the church to be the manifold wisdom of God to the world around us
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   and to be the presence of God's kingdom here on earth. So, when Lucy is playing in the background,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   whenever you are ready during the song, you can come up and grab the element,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   and then you can go back to your own seat and take some time to reflect on those questions.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   And whenever you're ready, take the bread and the cup at your own time.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   And after that, feel free to join us in singing this song together.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   And one last thing before we enter into communion, I want to speak to those in the room
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   who might not identify themselves as followers of Jesus yet.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   First and foremost, we really appreciate you being here, and I just want to say thank you for
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   coming here and joining us in our worship this morning. But we ask that you not partake in the communion
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   because taking the bread and the cup is a public declaration of one's beliefs in the work that Jesus has done on your behalf.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   So, if you're not ready to commit your life to Christ yet, I would encourage you instead to use this time
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   to really reflect and consider what the good news of Jesus, of the gospel is,
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   what Jesus has done on your behalf, and his desire for you to experience the truly blessed life.
