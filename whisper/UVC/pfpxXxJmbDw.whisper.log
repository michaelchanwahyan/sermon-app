[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [Music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   All right. Thank you very much.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   Well, good morning from Chicago, everyone.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   For those who are listening from wherever you are,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   I hear some of you are in Hong Kong.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   I hear from some of you guys are in Canada, different places.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And those who are in the audience, good morning and good evening.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   My name is Tommy Lee, and I get a chance.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I run multiple organizations, but one of the things I am very proud of is
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   I am the president and founder of Resource Global.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And one of the things I get a chance to do at Resource Global is
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   we work with young Christian marketplace leaders in different global cities.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And so as a result of that, I get a chance to go to Jakarta, Indonesia,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   when pre-pandemic, in Kuala Lumpur, in Singapore, as well as Austin, Texas, Chicago.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And I was recently just in Nairobi, Kenya.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   So I literally just came back from there last week,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   and I had a chance to really be able to see what God was doing in Nairobi, Kenya.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And it is phenomenal how different global cities are continuously grown.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   I'd love to share a little bit more in the future in terms of what Nairobi is,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   but the one thing I will probably see, there is a lot of growth
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   in countries like Africa as well as Asia.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   But the one thing that it is, is what does it mean that as the countries continue to grow,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   how do marketplace leaders, how does the local church continue
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   to really be able to proclaim what God is doing in those cities
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   and interact with those cities.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   So, man, it has been just a joy and journey.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And with my role, I get a chance to travel a lot.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   And it's not always easy.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   A couple of weeks ago, it's my fourth straight week traveling, right?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   It's my fourth straight week traveling. I'm tired.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   A couple of weeks ago, I was in Grand Rapids.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Tomorrow, I jump on a plane, I go to Los Angeles.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   Just got back from Nairobi, and it has not been always very easy
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   when you're jumping on planes all the time.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   But in the midst of all these things, I get a chance to meet wonderful people.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Let me just show you one person, all right?
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Here's this one person I want to talk about.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   And they are going to put that right there.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   His name is Ray Bakke.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   I'm not sure if you guys have ever heard of the name Ray Bakke.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Ray is someone--it ties in with our sermon today--
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   what I would call as God's anointed, God's professor, global professor.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   A couple of weeks ago, maybe about four or five weeks ago,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I get an email from Ray's assistant saying that,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   "Tommy, Ray has made a turn for the worse.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Ray has pancreatic cancer. Ray is dying."
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   As a result of that, he asked if you had time to go see him
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   in Bellingham, Washington for one final meeting.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Well, here's the thing.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   If someone tells you that they would like to see you for the final time,
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   you do everything you can to go out there.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I have gotten to know Ray for many, many years.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   He is a global professor that has ministered and taught many students
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   all over the years, traveled to Hong Kong.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Some of you are sitting there watching from Hong Kong.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   You may have been familiar with Ray and his travels and his teachings.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   But the one thing Ray has always taught me as a professor is,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   "Tommy, you have to learn to what?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Respect and honor the culture that you're in.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   You have to learn to 'exegete to community.'"
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   What does he mean by that?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Too often--and I say this as an American standing here--
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   too often as an American, when I travel to your city in Hong Kong
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   or in Canada, all of that stuff, as Americans, I feel like I have all the answers.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   As Americans, I feel like you have to learn from me.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   As Americans, I'm your primary funder. I'm the leader.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   You learn from me.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Whereas some of you who are sitting in Hong Kong or Vancouver
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   or wherever you are in the world are sitting there,
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   "Wait a minute. That's not right.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   You fail to understand our culture.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   You fail to understand--you bring your American ideas
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   and you expect all of us to learn."
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   That was the one thing Ray has always taught me.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   He says, "Tommy, when you go to different global cities,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   you are a learner of that city.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   You are a student of that city.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   God has been at work in that city way before you ever got there,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   way before any Americans ever got there.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   He has a plan for that city.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   And so when you go to that city, listen and hear.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Ask questions. Honor the people there. Honor the culture there.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Always be respectful of the culture.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Hear what God is doing and always be asking yourself,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   "How can God be working in your life?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   How is God working in the city and how can you be part of it?"
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   That's what Ray taught me, and I will always remember that from Ray.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Ray is what I call God's anointed,
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   and it's a position that all of us are in today.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   And this is a topic we're going to talk about actually
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   for the next three times I'm with you,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   and I'm going to be with you every single month,
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   this September, October, November,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   and we're going to talk about a three-part series on the life of David.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Today we're going to talk about a story that all of you are familiar with,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   the story of the battle of David and Goliath,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   which I would say if you're young or old,
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   you're probably familiar with this story.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   It is a story, I would say, probably aside from the crucifixion
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   to the birth of Jesus, it's a story that we're all familiar with.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   The story, the battle of David and Goliath,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   good versus evil, underdog versus the giant.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   But it's more than just a battle between little man versus giant.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But it talks about how God's anointed, God uses his anointed
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   to continue to call him out and use him,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   begin to prepare him for the biggest stage of being the king of Israel.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   And so we're going to talk about part one of that
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and lessons that emerge, principles that we're going to talk about
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   that emerges of being God's anointed.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   We're going to talk about part one.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   We're going to talk about the next time I show up,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   we're going to talk about part two as we finish up the rest of the story.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And then part three is one of my favorite ones is what happens
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   in the aftermath of a giant's killing.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   Because you think that after the giant's killing, story ended, happy ending.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   But it's far more than that.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   And God is in the midst of preparing a king.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   God's anointed with David.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   It's a story of you as well, too, because God has a plan for you.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   God chooses and wants you.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   We all have the potential to be anointed by God to do something great.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   We all have the potential to be anointed by God to make a difference
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   and impact this world because he is in the midst of writing your story.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   He is in the midst of writing a chapter in your story,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   a story that is so unique that my story is so different from your story,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   that all of our stories are very, very unique.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And so as a result, within that journey, what is that story?
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   How is God calling you?
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   How is God making a difference in your life?
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   And that's what we're going to look at today.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   As always, I will probably say is as you're getting to know me,
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   you will find that I will need a lot of water in the midst of it.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   And so I always will tell people, please be patient with me during that period of time.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I think I told you in the last time I had a sermon, I spoke to you guys.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Cancer really affected my body.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Three years ago, I was diagnosed with cancer.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And in the midst of that cancer, right in my sinus,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   it pretty much destroyed all my tears, most of my hearing.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   That's why a lot of times if you're here, I speak very loudly
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   because a lot of times I can't really hear.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   But more so, it really took away most of my saliva and most of my taste buds.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And so as a result, it is a part of that journey that God has written.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   And so a lot of times I will ask you for a little grace as we continue on as well too.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   Hey, let's take our story over to 1 Samuel 9 as we begin.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   1 Samuel 9, and we're going to begin our story with that.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And we're going to go over to 17 eventually, but I'm going to start with 1 Samuel 9.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   And the story begins in verses 1 to 2.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   "That there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son of Abel, son of Zerah, son of Bekroth, son of Ephiah, a Benjamite."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Very, very important. Remember who that is.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   He is from the tribe of Benjamin. He is a Benjamite.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Always remember that. We're going to get back to this.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   "A man of wealth. And he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   From his shoulders upward, he was taller than any of the people."
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   So the story begins with the selection of Saul as the leader.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   He is a Benjamite. Very key. Comes from a very influential, very, very wealthy family.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   He comes from a family of means.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   He is the tallest. He is the most handsome. He is the most athletic and natural because of his outward appearance.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Coming from a very, very lucrative family, very well-to-do family, he is chosen king of Israel.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   And the story goes, and we don't have time to go through all this, you know what happens with Saul.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Through a series of mistakes, that ego starts getting in the way.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   The character flaws begin to show within Saul.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And God deems him as no longer the right fit as a leader.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   As a result, he is looking for a replacement.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   There is a prophet Samuel. He says, "Samuel, I have disqualified Saul.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   Even though he is elected by the people, even though all of his outward appearance, it checks the boxes.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   I have disqualified him as king of Israel.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And so I need you to go find the next king.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And I want you to go to Bethlehem to go do it."
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   And so Samuel goes over to Bethlehem, and he is now called to the son of Jesse, the Bethlemite.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And there Jesse comes in.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And he arrives and he says to Jesse, "Bring all your sons in. I want to talk with them. I want to see them."
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And the story goes, he brings in three of his sons.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   And the first one to show up is Eliab.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Well, Eliab is the oldest of all of the sons.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Eliab is the strongest, the tallest of all the sons.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   And here's what 1 Samuel 16 tells us.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   "But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look on his outer appearance, on the height of his stature,
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   because I have rejected him.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   For the Lord sees not what a man sees.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.'"
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   So he goes through all the sons, not him, not him, not him.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   And he says to Jesse, "Jesse, do you have any more sons?"
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Jesse remembers, "Oh, there's young David."
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   We all know the story. There's young David.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   He's out in the sheep. He's tending the sheep.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   "Hey, call David in."
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   David walks in.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   "There Samuel anoints him with who watching is, his brother, including Eliab."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   That's also very important. Note that as well, too.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   We don't know exactly how he anoints him, but he anoints him.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Maybe he whispers to David, "You're going to be the next king."
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And there the story ends.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   First thing, first principle that emerges out of God's anointing.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   God always looks at the condition of the heart.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   God does not look at outer appearances.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   God does not care how wealthy you are.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   God does not care how good-looking you are.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   God does not care how rich you are.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   God does not care how successful you are.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   God does not care how well you are, speaking-wise, your talents, whatever it is.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   God does not look at the physical appearance.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   But he always looks at the condition of your heart.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   God is looking to use men and women wherever you are, whatever part of the world that you are.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   God is looking for men and women with hearts of humility.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   God is willing to look at individuals with hearts of generosity, others first, integrity.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Men and women who are willing to stand up, who are willing to give up their lives to serve the Lord.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   God is looking always, always with the heart, and the condition of the heart versus the outer appearance.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Why? Why not outer appearance?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Because, simply, he's created you.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Number one, he's created you.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   He's given you all your strengths.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   He's given you and placed you and given you the riches of your life.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   He's given you the talents that you have.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   He's given you the position you are, how wealthy you are, whatever it is.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   God has given you all that, so that's number one.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Number two, if you base your skills, and God looks at your skills, there's something you can brag about.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   There's something you can say, "Look at what I can do."
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   And that's not it.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Ephesians tells us, "For it is by grace you have been saved, not by yourselves."
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Why? So you can't boast.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   God looks at the heart of the individual.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   And never about your skills, never about your strengths, never about the things that you have, all of these different things.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Let me give you a couple of stories and illustrations of what I mean by this.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   There's a pastor that I get a chance, so if you don't know me, I mean, instead of running five different organizations, I get a chance to run five different organizations, right?
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   So instead of one, I run five different organizations.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   But one of the jobs I get a chance to do is I get to work with different ministry leaders on conferences that are held throughout the world.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   And in the midst of all that, I get a chance to interact with pastors, speakers that have books, radio, that have great podcasts, that have a pretty well-known, and that's either good and sometimes bad.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   I've met different people, I say this, who have written books that I said, "Wow, I can't believe I met this person.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   I want to meet with them and realize, oh, wow, they're not exactly what I thought they was."
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   So one situation comes in.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   I had this conference I was overseeing.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   And this pastor comes in, and he's very well-known.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   He has a large social media following.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   He has book deals. He's always on the speaking circuit.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   He had to do, for this particular conference, he had to do one workshop, and he had to do one 10-minute devotion.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   That's all he had to do.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   And so as a result of that, he then charges $5,000 in expenses for his time.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   He traveled first class.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   He won a large honorarium.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   He didn't like the hotel that we put him in because he thought it was not nice.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   He checked himself to a $500 hotel.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   He started eating expensive meals, and suddenly his assistant sends me his receipt.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   And for one day and a half, I'm looking at the expenses, $5,000.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And so naturally, I don't have the budget for this because I wasn't authorized.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   So I go back to his assistant and says, "I can't do this.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   We're going to have to reject it."
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   Again, very talented.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Huge book writer. Huge following. Everything like that.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Calls me up one day, and it's a Sunday now.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   I'm in Houston. I'm at an event.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Calls me up and says, "Oh, why is this guy calling me? Coming from church?"
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   He says, "Tommy, let me just say this to you.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   You have disrespected me.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   Highly disrespected me because you're questioning my integrity and questioning my finances."
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   I said, "Yeah, you're right. I'm questioning your finances."
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   He says, "Here's why you're doing this.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Because your life stinks.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   You probably live a miserable life.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Your kids probably hate you.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Your wife probably hates you.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   You probably have no friends.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   And that's why you're disrespecting me.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   So I want you to do something like this.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   I want you not only to pay my reimbursement,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   but I need you to go on social media and apologize for disrespecting me,
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   or I will make your miserable life more miserable than it is right now."
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   God honors the heart.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   It doesn't matter what skills you have.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   It doesn't matter what you do or not able to do.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   God honors the heart.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Second story that I have.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   I know an elder of a church.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Very strong, very, very involved.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Involved in finance, all of that stuff.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Very dedicated to all of this stuff.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   But inwardly, he and his wife have problems all the time.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Why?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   He can't control his anger.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Because behind closed doors--hey, he knows what to do on a Sunday, right?
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   He knows what to do at churches on a Sunday.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   He knows what to say.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   He's there on Sundays.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   He's there helping out with finances.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   He's on the elder board.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   But his wife says to me, "Behind closed doors."
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   He yells and screams to the point sometimes the neighbors are ready to call the police.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   He cannot control his anger.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   He belittles.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He's never happy.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   God sees this.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   We think no one has seen all these things.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   But God sees it.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Because God is always after men and women whose heart belong to him,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   whose heart are full of integrity,
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   whose heart is devoted to him.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   God always looks at the heart.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   Never, never on the outer appearances.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   One last thing I just said to you.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   I just came back from Nairobi.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   When you go to Nairobi, you see roads galore.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   You see overpasses.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   You see new buildings being built, everything.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   It's a brand-new city.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   But then when you talk with the people there, the city is poor
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   because it's ruined by corruption.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Because you have people who are what they say are Sunday Christians
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   who all go to church.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Eighty-five percent of the population in Nairobi says they're Christians.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   They all go to church on Sundays.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   The president, the politicians all go to church on Sundays.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Monday through Friday, they do whatever they want.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   And so as much as the money, which by the way, a lot of the money
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   and all the changes in Nairobi is funded by who?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   The Chinese.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And as a result of the Chinese, they poured in all of this money.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   And the politicians in Nairobi who are supposedly Christians
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   are benefiting from all this, but that money is not going to all the city.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   And so you have people who are poor.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   You have people in slums.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   You have people who are struggling.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   But only a few people are getting wealthy.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   God's anointed for all of us.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   God chooses to anoint you.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   You have the potential, wherever you are, to sit in there,
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   to be anointed by God to do something great.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   You really do.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   What is the state of your heart?
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Where is your heart?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Is God working your heart?
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   I don't care how talented you are.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I don't care how wealthy you are.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   I don't care how educated you are.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   I don't care how well you speak.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   God cares about that heart.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Let's go on.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   The story goes.
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   And the story goes to verse 7, chapter 17.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   And it goes to verse 1.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And we're reading from the ESV.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   And now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Go into 17.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   And they were gathered, or Soca.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   Now the story goes that he's anointed David.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   And now there's a battle which belongs to Judah.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   And a camp between Soca and Ezekiah in Ephesus, the Mim.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And Saul and the men of Israel.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   Now Saul was the king now of Israel.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   We're gathered.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And they camped in the valley of Elah and drew up a line of battle
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   against the Philistines.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   And the Philistines stood on the mountain on one side.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   And Israel stood on the mountain on the other side with a valley between them.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   And there came out from the camp of the Philistines a champion named Goliath the Gath,
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   whose height was six cubits, or over nine feet tall in his span.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Let me give you a little background on this in order to understand fully this story.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Take a look at this, right?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Let me give you a background on this.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   Here's-- and if you guys get a chance, over there, there is a PowerPoint over there.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Well, the PowerPoints over here that I have is-- thank you very much.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Look at the two descriptions.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I gave-- the left-hand column is the Philistines.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   The Philistines were coastal people.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   They were sophisticated cultural people.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   That was the Philistines.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   The Philistines had learned how to use iron to make weapons and tools.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   They were a master of iron.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   They had a monopoly of iron.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   But contrast that to the Israelites.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   The Israelites were primitive people.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   They were composed of shepherds and farmers.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   They had no experience in working with iron at that time.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   The Israelites were so, in some sense, appeared so inferior to the Philistines
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   that they lived in the mountains because the fertile valleys were dominated by the more powerful Philistines.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And, at the same time, here's something important to remember.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   Remember what the Philistines are key at.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   They were great blacksmiths.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   They were great at iron.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Let me give you a point.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   1 Samuel 13, 19, all right?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Here's the way it reads.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Not a blacksmith could be found in the entire whole land of Israel
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   because the Philistines had said, "Otherwise, the Hebrews will make swords or spears."
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   So all Israel went down to the Philistines to have their plow shares,
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   maddox, axes, and sickles sharpened.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   The price were two-thirds of a shekel for sharpening plow horses and maddox
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   and a third of a shekel for sharpening forks and axes and repointing goats.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   So on the day of battle, not a soldier with Saul and Jonathan had a spear or sword in their hands.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Only Saul and his son Jonathan had them.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   What is the picture that's being painted?
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Understand the context is very key.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Philistines came from Gath, had all of the supply of swords and iron.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   They were masters at that.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Israelites were the primitive people who lived in the non-fertile valleys in the mountains.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   They were farmers. They were shepherds.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   The only one who had weapons was Saul, and Jonathan had the swords.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Because why? The Philistines had a monopoly on everything.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   So now you're asking, as we read into it,
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   so why in the world are the Philistines invading the Israelites?
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Are they just doing it for fun, or what's wrong with it?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Let me show you a series of three pictures, alright?
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   Here's a series of three pictures right here.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   If you guys could see all these things, here's the first picture.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   You see the Israelite camp, and you see the Valley of Elah.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   If you go to Israel right now, the Valley of Elah is still there right now.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   The Israelite camp is where the mountains are, and you see the Philistine camp.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   Let me actually give you a closer picture as well, too.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   You see right there, Gath is to the west of the Philistines, right?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   You see the Israelite camp, again the Valley of Elah, and also the Philistine camp.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Let me actually then now go to a third map, and now you'll understand why this battle was taking place.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Take a look at this.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Right in the middle, you see where Ezekiel and Soca was?
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   That's where your Philistines and the Valley of Elah and all of that are.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   You see Gath right there.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   What do you see?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   The Israelite is right there in the mountain, and where does it lead?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   It becomes a gateway to what?
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   Look up north.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   You see Bethlehem, you see Jerusalem, you see all of Bethel, all of these different places, Shiloh.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   It is the gateway to the Jordanian Valley.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   It is a key strategic point.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   The Assyrian Empire at that point in time, many of the empires went through this gateway to make their trades.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   What does the Philistines know?
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   That as much as they have the fertile valley, if they can control that gateway, it opens up the trade routes for them to control the gate routes.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   It's like the tax collector Matthew, right?
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   So they need to control that gateway.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   And who's standing in the way?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   The Israelites.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   So as a result, let's bring in everyone and get rid of the Israelites.
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And you know what?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   We're such a powerful army.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   We're not even going to waste our time.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   Let's not waste our soldiers.
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Let's not have anyone get hurt.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   Let's send in a big guy, Goliath.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Let's have him battle their biggest one because it probably doesn't stand a chance.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And whoever wins, if we win, we'll leave.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   Which we probably are guaranteed that we won't win.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   If we lose, we leave.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   If we win, you're out.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   And so Goliath shows up, and boy does he show up.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   For 40 days, he comes in and out with the same challenge.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Bring your best soldier.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   Bring your best hero and let him battle me and let's see who wins that out.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   All for this particular valley.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   And now we go to 14 to 18.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   David, in verse 14, was the youngest.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   The three eldest followed Saul, but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   And for 40 days, the Philistines came forward and took his stand morning and evening for 40 days in verse 14 and now 16.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   And Jesse said to David his son, "Take for your brothers an epath of his parched grain in these ten loaves
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   and carry them quickly to the camp to your brothers.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Also take these ten cheeses to the commander of their thousands.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   See if your brothers are well and bring what?
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Some token from them."
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   Which, you're going to actually, that plays an important role for them.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   "Bring some token for them."
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   If point number one is that God chooses to look at the heart of the individual,
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   when God anoints an individual, he looks at the heart of the individual and never the outer appearance,
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   then number two, you never know when God comes calling.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   You never know when God comes calling.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   You never know when God is ready to call you.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   You never know when that chapter in your book turns.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   You never know what adventure he has.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   You never know what plans he has for your life.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And so we approach our life with open hands.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   We approach our life with great anticipation.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   We approach our life sitting there each and every single day saying,
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   "Lord, what is it that you want me to do?
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   How can I continue to serve you each and every single day?"
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   Because you never know when God comes calling.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   You never know when he has a plan for you.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   So you live with an anticipation because why?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   And we always talk about this because you are a steward of what God has given you
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   because your life is not yours, but you are a steward of what God has given you.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   And when we are stewards, we are always anticipating to serve him in every aspect of our life.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   It is a story of Nicodemus when he is called by God and he interacts with Jesus.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   He never knew that through that interaction in John chapter 3,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   when God says, "For God so loved the world," it will open his life.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   Or it becomes the whole idea of Nehemiah.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   We read about Nehemiah at 60-something years old as the cupbearer of the king.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Nehemiah is called to rebuild the walls.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   He is 60-something years old.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   God calls him to rebuild the walls.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   He has had a lucrative job as cupbearer of the king.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Now he is called to rebuild the walls.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   But what is the key is he hears one day that Jesus is coming to Jericho.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   He wants to see Jesus in the midst of it.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   Jesus invites himself to his house.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And Jesus says, "I want you to do something. I want you to stay as a tax collector.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   But I want you to make a difference in your city."
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   In contrast to Matthew where he says, "Matthew, pick up your everything as a tax collector.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Follow after me.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   Peter, James, and John, move away from being fishermen.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   Follow after me."
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   You never know when God comes calling.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   You never know when he is calling you to do something big.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   So you live your life with anticipation.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   You live your life with open hands.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   You live your life constantly praying, "Lord, what do you call me to do?"
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   But more so, very important too,
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   you are faithful to where he has placed you at.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   That wherever he placed you at, whether it's a stay-at-home mom,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   whether it's in a job that you cannot stand,
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   whether it's a dead-end job,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   whether it's in whatever situation that you're in,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   you're faithful to where he has placed you at.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   But you're always anticipating.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   You're always looking.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   You're always praying.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   You're always looking, asking that God may make sense and close and open doors for your life.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Here's the one thing for those who are sitting there,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   especially those who are in their mid-20s to mid-30s,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   because I get a chance to talk with you guys quite a lot.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   If you're sitting there in your mid-20s and 30s,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   a lot of times you're always wondering what God is wanting you to do.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   You're always anticipating.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   You're always saying, "God, what do you want me to do?
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   I want to know what God wants me to do."
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   But you're not content.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   Be content with where you are.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Learn why God is--and we'll talk a little bit about that later.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Be faithful to where God has placed you,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   but always be looking.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   If number one is God works in those who are anointed
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   by finding those individuals
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   and looking at identifying where the heart is,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   then number two, you never know when God is going to work.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   You never know when God's calling, so you're anticipating.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Number three--and we're going to work at the final thing,
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   and then we're going to move on.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   Story goes, in '28, Iliab--we remember Iliab, right?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Iliab was the oldest son of Jesse.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   He was the oldest brother of David.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   Now, Iliab, his eldest brother, heard when he spoke to the men,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   and Iliab's anger was kindled against David,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   and he says, "Why have you come down?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   And with whom have you left those sheep in the wilderness?
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   I know your presumption and the evils of your heart,
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   for you have come down to see the battle."
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   And David said, "What have I done now?
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Was it not but a word?"
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Point number three--the anointed leader will be criticized by others.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   The anointed leader will not be free of criticism.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   The anointed leader needs to learn to have thick skin
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   and learn that he or she can never make people happy, everyone happy,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   and you are sometimes prone to criticism,
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   and you are not free of criticism.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   You're going to have to learn that.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   Too often, a lot of times, we like to be liked, right?
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Especially for those who are Asian sitting here, we like to be liked.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   We don't like conflict.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   I don't like, for me personally, when people criticize me.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   My defenses get up.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   I sit there questioning all of these different things.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   I like peace.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   I don't like to deal with conflict.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   We don't like when people don't like us.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   But sometimes, as God's anointed,
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   you're going to have to make decisions that will never make people happy.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   You may make decisions that people would disagree with,
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   that are critical with.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   People may not like you because they're jealous of you.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   People may not like you because they just don't like you.
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   God's anointed will not be free of criticism,
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   and you're going to have to learn to have thick skin.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   You're going to have to learn not to take it personally.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   But as God's anointed, you are making decisions
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   that glorify and honor the Lord in all that you do,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   and that's a very fact.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   You're going to have to deal with criticism.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Just like, for instance, Iliab over here doesn't like David.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Why? We don't know.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Does he have an intent against David?
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   Does he not like the fact that David was anointed by Samuel and he wasn't?
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   We don't know. I would guess probably so.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And so he's critical.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Look at what he says to him.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   This little flock that you have,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   these few sheep in the wilderness,
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   he's very critical of him.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   You're not going to make people happy.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   And so as a result, how do we learn to have thick skin?
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   How do we learn not to make things personal
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   but to continue to go forth with what God has called us to do?
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   If number one is the fact that God's anointed,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   God looks at the heart of the individual
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   and never the outer appearance,
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   then number two is that you never know when God comes calling.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   And you live with open arms, you live with open hands,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   you live with anticipation, asking that God is working.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   But number three, you've got to learn to be thick-skinned.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   You've got to learn not to be taking things personally.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   You've got to learn that sometimes people will be critical.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   Out of jealousy, out of fact they disagree with your decisions,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   whatever it is, but you're going to have to learn through all that stuff.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   God's anointed means that you are a steward of what God has given you.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And for David, he had to learn these lessons before he became king.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   And so as a result of that,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   now next time I come back we're going to talk about part three.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   There's a second half of the battle against Goliath.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   And then we're going to talk about the aftermath of the days.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   But for you, look, here's the one thing I would say to you for those who are listening.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   Wherever you are in the world as you sit there,
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   always know that God has a plan for you.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   Always know that he chooses to want to anoint you to do something bigger
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   than you can't even imagine for the gospel.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   Now you're going to have to figure out as we wrap up what that calling is.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   But that means you've got to be asking and living in anticipation
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   of what that practically means in your life.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   But you're going to have to do business with your heart.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Because no matter what your skills are outwardly,
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   it's the heart that really matters.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   So as we sit here, do we want to be used by God? Yeah, we do.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Do we want to be doing great for God in everything that we do? Yeah.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   I think all of us will say yes.
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   But what does it say to your heart?
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   Are you anticipating for God to work in your life?
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   Are you learning to not take things personally?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   Because God's anointing will not be free of criticism.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   How well are you doing in those three areas?
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Let's come back next month and talk about the rest.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Let's pray.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   Father, thank you for how you work with us each and every single day.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   Thank you for the words that you give us as we look at the life of David
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   and how you anoint God, how you anointed David
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   and you bring him on the journey.
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   And we pray that as we face our own calling,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   the journey that you have given to us,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   that we learn from the lessons of David.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   May you use us in ways that we can't even desire
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   to make a difference for you and for the gospel and the glory of God.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Thank you for the story of David.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   We lift these things up to you and give off our heart.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   We pray for anticipation, and we pray for thick skin
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   to continue to honor you.
