[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   Today, we're going to begin our series on faith and time.
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.280]   Think about it, your Christian faith, your walk in Christ,
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.460]   has so much to do with how you use your time,
[00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.880]   how you mark your calendar, right?
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.800]   How you, you know, check the clock.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.200]   Faith and time, they go together.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.760]   Sometimes, we think that Christian faith is all about,
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.420]   you know, our verbal confession, what we say.
[00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.360]   Do you believe in Christ?
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.840]   Yes, I do.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:39.100]   Are you a Christian?
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:39.940]   Yes, I am.
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.960]   Verbal confirmation.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.100]   Sometimes, we stay on this level.
[00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.720]   Hopefully, this will match what our heart says, right?
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.580]   Otherwise, it means nothing to all of us
[00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.520]   and means nothing to you.
[00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.160]   But, you know, think deeply about faith.
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.340]   Ask yourself whether your faith is biblical or not.
[00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.080]   Because, you know, you can invent
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.960]   your own version of Christianity, right?
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.120]   There's so many examples in the Bible,
[00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.900]   or, you know, outside of the Bible, in church history.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.940]   People would create their own faith,
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.280]   create their own version of Christian faith.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.240]   And they end up, you know,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.280]   deviating from the teaching of Christ.
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.040]   That's why in Christianity, in biblical faith,
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.380]   it's the faith of book.
[00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.980]   You know, have you ever wondered?
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.380]   There's so many religions out there.
[00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.540]   They don't care much about, there's one book
[00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.000]   defining what they do and what they think
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.500]   and what they believe.
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.200]   So many religions in the world,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.460]   so many worldviews in the world,
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.580]   even a religious worldview,
[00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.740]   they don't really have some sort of standard, right?
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.920]   It's pretty much anything goes.
[00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.220]   You like to define your faith,
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.360]   you like to set a standard for your faith,
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.200]   you know, it's all up to you.
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.240]   It's like going to Whole Foods, right?
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.060]   You go to Whole Foods and you pick and choose, right?
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.760]   Whatever you want, or whatever you feel like.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.220]   Now, this kind of Whole Foods, you know, faith,
[00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.620]   has nothing to do with biblical faith.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.260]   It has nothing to do with the Bible.
[00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.600]   So think deeply about it.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.960]   Even you profess to be a Christian,
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.460]   even you were baptized, right?
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.600]   Couple weeks ago, we just returned from Israel
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.240]   and some of my team members,
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.480]   they were baptized in the River Jordan.
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.340]   You talk about holy water, it's right there.
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.840]   You know, everyone wants to, you know,
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.140]   get baptized there, right?
[00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.840]   There's something special about it.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.260]   Even you do that, it really doesn't mean,
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.000]   or not necessarily mean that you follow Christ.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.540]   Think deeper in your faith, you know, think deeper.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.360]   Because it's dangerous to come to the Bible,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.700]   come to God, as if we go to Whole Foods,
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.920]   to pick and choose, you know, according to our own choices.
[00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.360]   That's why we need to think deeply
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.720]   about what faith really means.
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.480]   Faith and time, I want you to think about in this series.
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.140]   Faith and your time.
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.720]   What does it mean to follow Christ
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.780]   when it comes to how you use your time
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.480]   and how you see time?
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.320]   So this series is on faith and time.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.780]   And we'd like to pick some of the passages,
[00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.640]   some of the content from the Bible
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.800]   that talks about biblical faith and time and festivals.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.020]   There are certain markers in the Bible,
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.700]   especially in the Old Testament and New Testament as well.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.420]   During the week, during the month, during the whole year,
[00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.580]   there are special markers, there are special dates
[00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:05.800]   during the year, during the month, during the week,
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.140]   that marks the grace of God,
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.760]   that tells the people of God, "You have to worship me.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:14.380]   "You have to remember something
[00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:16.820]   "about your Christian journey.
[00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.880]   "You have to think about and to be reminded
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.780]   "your experiences of God."
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.620]   So think about dates, some of the dates
[00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.660]   that appear in the Bible that has to do
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.420]   with walking in the faith of God.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:37.800]   And think about time, we are beings in time.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.880]   We are all controlled by time.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.300]   We are all managing our time.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:47.180]   Think of birthday, all right?
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.660]   How many of you, whose birthday
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.540]   are in the month of September?
[00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:53.920]   Very important month, right?
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:54.960]   Very important month.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.040]   (laughs)
[00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.280]   'Cause my birthday is in September, right?
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.540]   How many of you birthdays in, well, what's the date now?
[00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.440]   October, yes, October.
[00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.200]   October, all right, all right, all right.
[00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.340]   We got some hands here.
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.000]   So birthday, you know, it's a marker
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.220]   in your journey of life, right?
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.740]   You mark something important.
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.560]   You have done one year, right?
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.200]   You have gone through one year.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.360]   And what you look for the next year, right?
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.740]   So in birthday, sometimes we have birthday cake.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.540]   Do you know the origin, origin of birthday cake?
[00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.680]   Where did it come from?
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.580]   We all have birthday cake on our birthday, right?
[00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.060]   Where does it come from?
[00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.320]   Definitely not in times of Jesus.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.200]   Definitely not in the Bible.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.980]   Well, if you chase the history of birthday cake,
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.620]   it actually comes from the Middle Ages,
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:48.420]   when some of the people in Germany,
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.920]   they like to make cakes for their kids
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.680]   when they celebrate birthday.
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.760]   And then, you know, slowly and gradually,
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.700]   that tradition builds up, right?
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.340]   In the very beginning of the history of birthday cake,
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:04.880]   birthday cake was not very sweet.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.560]   But as it imported to America, you know,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.220]   we add more sugar, right?
[00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:13.460]   So that's why we have birthday cakes,
[00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.940]   very sweet birthday cake today.
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.940]   Think about other times in the year.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:21.640]   Today is October.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.460]   November.
[00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.280]   Thanksgiving, right?
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.260]   What do we do in Thanksgiving?
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.500]   Hot pot, right?
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.660]   Hot pot. (laughs)
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.640]   Hot pot, right?
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.560]   Not turkey.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.680]   What is Thanksgiving all about?
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.320]   It's kind of like a national cultural story, right?
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.380]   How the pilgrims came in their first harvest,
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.240]   and then they celebrate the very first time
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.100]   God has provided for them, you know.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:51.640]   That's a kind of a cultural memory,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.360]   or cultural identity, right?
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:56.500]   All Americans, all Americans,
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.880]   Asian Americans, all kinds of Americans included,
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:04.480]   we all share that kind of identity, that kind of story.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.300]   Christmas, right?
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.080]   December 25th, 24th,
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.280]   sign night.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:13.180]   It's markers of memory,
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.960]   to remember something that God has done, right?
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.480]   What else?
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:23.060]   Important days during the year.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.160]   Easter, Good Friday, right?
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.780]   You gotta remember that, right?
[00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.440]   Because those are the dates
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.440]   that reminds you the cross of Jesus,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.360]   what he has done.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:42.580]   So think about time and your faith.
[00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:45.080]   You don't wanna forget, right?
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:48.020]   For those who are married,
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:52.640]   you better remember the day of your anniversary, right?
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.140]   Sometimes I don't.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.440]   (laughs)
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.280]   Forgot, yeah, I forgot, I confess.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.060]   Sometimes I even forget my own birthday.
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.000]   So, I'm not very date-driven, you know?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.960]   Sometimes I'm too busy.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.540]   But, you know, it's all because of that.
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:13.700]   We're going through our daily life in busyness,
[00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.400]   you know, being distracted,
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.280]   and sometimes life becomes, you know, chaotic.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.000]   That's why there are fixed dates in the calendar
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.540]   to remind you in your faith journey.
[00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.960]   So, the Bible has a lot of different dates
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:31.980]   that reminds the people of God
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.360]   and what following Christ or what following God
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.860]   is all about.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.440]   Deuteronomy 16, 16.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.900]   It says three times a year, three times.
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.340]   What are the three times?
[00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.120]   Three times a year, all of you, represented by men,
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.960]   must appear before the Lord, your God,
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:52.760]   at the place he would choose.
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.800]   You know, eventually it's Jerusalem, the temple.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.080]   At the Feast of Unleavened Bread.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.000]   First time.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:04.180]   The Feast of Weeks, second time.
[00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:07.940]   And then the Feast of Tabernacles.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:12.860]   No one should appear before the Lord empty-handed.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.780]   You gotta bring something.
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:17.580]   Your offering, your sacrifices, your attitude,
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:21.840]   your whole being, each of you must bring a gift
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.600]   in proportion to the way your God has blessed you.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.780]   So there are poor people, there are rich people,
[00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:32.940]   they come three times a year to the temple to worship.
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:34.680]   Right?
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.620]   Now, of course, every single week, you know, on Shabbat,
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.740]   they will worship.
[00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:42.580]   That is one of the most important marker of their calendar,
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:45.080]   a weekly reminder, the Shabbat.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.540]   And then three times a year,
[00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.040]   there are three great festivals,
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.700]   three great dates that they must remember.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.460]   It's kinda sound like our Good Friday,
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:59.540]   our Easter, and our Christmas.
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:03.080]   Three times a year, they must come before the Lord
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.580]   to praise him, to worship him.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.920]   The first one is Feast of Unleavened Bread.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.500]   That equals to Passover.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:16.140]   Passover, one day, and then seven days afterward,
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.860]   they celebrate for seven days and eating unleavened bread.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.440]   Passover.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.740]   We'll talk about that more later.
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:28.300]   The Feast of Weeks, that is seven weeks after Passover.
[00:10:28.300 --> 00:10:32.460]   The 50th day after Passover is another day of harvest.
[00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:38.260]   They celebrate the harvest of barley and wheat,
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:40.720]   and wheat and all that.
[00:10:40.720 --> 00:10:43.200]   In New Testament term, it's Pentecost.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.360]   Pentecost means 50, right?
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:49.020]   So it's the 50th day after Passover.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:51.540]   That's the second time they must come
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.700]   before the Lord in the temple.
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:56.740]   The third time is Feast of Tabernacles.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.580]   Tabernacles falls on the fall, the early fall.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.360]   If you check the morning calendar, if you Google,
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.440]   Feast of Tabernacle, 2022, or Sukkot,
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.180]   S-U-K-K-O-T, Sukkot, 2022.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.780]   It falls on, what's today?
[00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:19.960]   October--
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:20.780]   - [Audience Member] Second.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.620]   - Second, right?
[00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:22.580]   Second, right?
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:23.640]   Sorry, yeah, second.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:27.620]   The next week, actually, is Sukkot in Israel.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.460]   Sukkot.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.060]   It's the fall festival.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:34.660]   So three times a year, they must bring something,
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:38.660]   some gift to this important worship opportunity.
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.640]   What do they do?
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:45.300]   Let me talk about the Sukkot starting today.
[00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:48.020]   Let's talk about the third festival,
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:51.600]   because it falls right on next week, right?
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.260]   Early October.
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:55.680]   Leviticus 23, 33.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:12:00.700]   The Lord said to Moses,
[00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.220]   "Say to the people of God, Israelites,
[00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:04.080]   "on the 15th day of the seventh month
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.700]   "of the Lord's Feast of Tabernacles begins,
[00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:08.780]   "it lasts for seven days.
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:14.660]   "Live in the Sukkot, in our booths, Tabernacles,
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.400]   "for seven days.
[00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.920]   "All native-born Israelites are to live in the booths
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.520]   "so your children and your children's children,
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.620]   "your descendants, will know that I had
[00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:27.040]   "the Israelites live in booths
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.200]   "when I brought them out of Egypt,
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.840]   "through the wilderness, when they live in the desert,
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.680]   "when they live in the wilderness.
[00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:37.320]   "I brought them out of Egypt.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.220]   "I am Yahweh, your God.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:41.220]   "I am the Lord."
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:45.380]   Now, as I said, it falls on October 9th to 16th this year.
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.860]   And I told you last time, my wife and I,
[00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:51.960]   some years ago, we went to Israel
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   for our two weeks vacation,
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:59.120]   and didn't know what festival fall in that two weeks.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:04.760]   So the first week, it was the Yom Kippur,
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.480]   the Day of Atonement, when they confess their sins,
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:09.560]   so they shut down all the whole country, right?
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:10.600]   I told you that.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.860]   And then the following week,
[00:13:11.860 --> 00:13:16.020]   it's a totally different mood, you know, on the streets,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.960]   because it was the week of tabernacles, sukkot.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:24.560]   It was a high holiday in Israel.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:28.660]   It actually is probably one of the most important festivals
[00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.120]   that they celebrate.
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:35.280]   And so we did experience one of their sukkots that year.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   They call it sukkot.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:43.440]   In Hebrew, that's the word for tabernacle, the tent.
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.060]   So during sukkot, we walk around the city,
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.820]   and I find it really, really interesting.
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:55.160]   Just like a non-Chinese walks into Chinatown, right?
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:14:01.580]   Walks into the community of most of the Chinese people.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.000]   They probably would be amazed
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.980]   by how we celebrate some of the dates, right?
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.760]   How we go about our daily lives, right?
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.160]   I used to have a Caucasian professor.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:18.540]   He told me the first time he went to Chinatown
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:20.120]   when he was a kid.
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:23.220]   So he went to Chinatown, and he looked at one of the stores.
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:25.720]   And the storefront, there's a water tank,
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.420]   and there's some fish in there.
[00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:29.800]   So as a kid, he find it really amazing
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:34.000]   that the fish, live fish, is on display on the street, right?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.960]   He walk into the store, and he find it so sad,
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:39.480]   because people are killing the fish.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.000]   So he was amazed.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.120]   As a white person, he had never experienced
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.720]   something like that.
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.640]   So kind of a same feeling that I had in sukkot.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:54.900]   Finding the Jews, they were building different kinds
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:14:58.480]   of tents on the streets and in the balcony.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:05.040]   So this is some of the pictures I took during sukkot.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.120]   They built this kind of tent they call sukkah.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:12.840]   So how do you build a sukkah?
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:16.120]   You need four by eight, some of the four by eight,
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.880]   and then you nail them together.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.800]   And then on top of it, you put some branches
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.720]   or you put some plants to cover it.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:29.760]   It's not very permanent, right?
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.360]   It's not very strong.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:35.280]   Actually, if the weather goes bad, it may fall.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:42.320]   So on the street, they build all kinds of sukkah.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:45.840]   On the balcony, they build some sukkah.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.200]   So this is what they do, because that's what the Torah says.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.840]   You have to celebrate in the sukkah,
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:54.840]   in the tent, for seven days.
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:55.680]   So what do they do?
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:15:57.920]   They build some tents outside.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:01.600]   It has to be outside, not inside your house.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.360]   So they will dine under the tent.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:06.960]   They will talk under the tent.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.640]   They will drink under the tent.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.520]   Now, it's very interesting, right?
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:14.560]   So we went to Western Wall.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.080]   That is the day before Sukkot.
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.480]   So I saw some workers.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.640]   They cut some of the branches from the palm tree,
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.920]   and then they were building sukkah.
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:30.040]   Very interesting.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.720]   Building sukkah on Western Wall,
[00:16:32.720 --> 00:16:35.040]   you know, on the Western Wall Plaza.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:38.080]   The Western Wall is actually an open-air synagogue,
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:40.880]   so people are meeting there.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:42.640]   So they're building all these kind of things,
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.640]   and it looks like a hut,
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:48.480]   and it's very flimsy.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.640]   But during seven days, they will eat and drink
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:54.060]   and even sleep in the sukkah.
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.760]   How many of you like camping trip?
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.840]   You know, go out to camping, maybe in Michigan
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:02.420]   or in some other national park.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.160]   How many of you enjoy camping?
[00:17:06.160 --> 00:17:07.280]   How many enjoy camping?
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.120]   You do?
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:10.360]   Okay, then we'll have one hand only.
[00:17:10.360 --> 00:17:11.360]   Okay, okay, another.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:12.480]   Okay, all right.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:15.360]   So you don't like outdoor activities?
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.200]   Why not?
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:19.920]   Mosquitoes, right?
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:23.360]   Yeah, and then bugs in, you know, bathroom, right?
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:26.960]   All right, so you guys are too spoiled.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.960]   Urbanites.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:29.760]   Too spoiled urbanites.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:31.240]   I used to like camping, too.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:32.360]   I used to like camping.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.360]   But as I get older and older, I find myself,
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.040]   I can't do this anymore.
[00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:41.720]   But you know, when you go camping, you know,
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:44.120]   it's kind of like living in a sukkah, right?
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.160]   You sleep in there, you eat in there,
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:49.200]   you play games inside the tent.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.720]   It's kind of fun, right?
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.320]   When you were young, right?
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:54.400]   (laughs)
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.800]   This is what they do for seven days.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.080]   And if you're not handy, this can be a challenge to you.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.320]   How many of you are really handy here?
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.800]   You know, nails, woodworking, and all that.
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.200]   How many of you are really handy?
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:10.040]   Or me, okay.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:10.960]   (audience laughs)
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.200]   But when you think about sukkah,
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.120]   it really doesn't require you to be handy.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.600]   Because in the Jewish literature,
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:26.520]   when they talk about building a sukkah,
[00:18:28.720 --> 00:18:33.720]   they actually dictate that you build a flimsy sukkah,
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:36.360]   temporary sukkah.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:38.800]   It's okay if it falls.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:45.280]   Because sukkah does not mean to stand forever.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:49.560]   They are to be taken down.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:52.240]   They are temporary dwelling place.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:54.240]   Why?
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:19:00.400]   In fact, there's a story in one of the Jewish literatures
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.880]   that talks about two Jewish rabbis.
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:05.280]   They were debating how strong
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.600]   or how permanent a sukkah should be.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.040]   And the story goes, two rabbis were traveling during sukkah.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:14.800]   So they were not home.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.360]   They were on a ship.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:20.720]   They were on a, you know,
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.600]   on the Mediterranean Sea.
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:25.560]   During sukkah.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.520]   And they find that, okay, it's time in the year
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.720]   to celebrate sukkah.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.400]   So they need to build something, a sukkah, on the ship.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.560]   One of the rabbis,
[00:19:35.560 --> 00:19:40.680]   he chose to build his sukkah on the deck of the ship.
[00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:46.640]   And then after he built it,
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.320]   during that night, wind came and blew down the sukkah.
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:54.000]   And then the two rabbis were debating,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.080]   "See, how could you build such a flimsy sukkah?"
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.920]   Right?
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:00.520]   The wind came and then it fell.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.800]   And the rabbi who built the sukkah on the deck,
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.800]   he said, "I built the sukkah the way it's supposed to be.
[00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:14.400]   "That's what our law says.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.680]   "It has to be fragile.
[00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:17.960]   "It has to be flimsy."
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.160]   The Jewish literature, it's very funny.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:25.160]   You know, talk about sukkah so much,
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:28.480]   you have to build three walls at least.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:32.960]   And then you have to build your roof with branches only.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.960]   You know, all sorts of details,
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:38.640]   or building code for the sukkah.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:39.880]   Now, why did they do that?
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:44.240]   Because sukkah, the tent, the tabernacle,
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:48.560]   is a symbol of life.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.360]   Life is transitional.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.160]   Life is like a shadow.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:21:00.760]   Here today, but will be gone tomorrow.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:04.200]   That's what sukkah is all about.
[00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:09.840]   Because when the Israelites, when they came out of Egypt,
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:11.880]   they spent 40 years in the wilderness.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:16.280]   There were no permanent houses in the wilderness.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.680]   There's no stone building in the wilderness.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:25.040]   All they live in was temporary tents, right?
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.600]   And life is always transitional, right?
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.440]   Don't you think so?
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:32.760]   Sukkot is a reminder every year
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:37.360]   for the people of God to remind them
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.000]   how short their life is, how transitional our life is.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.160]   Don't you think so?
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.000]   Life is short.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.840]   Time flies.
[00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.840]   I went to a wedding not too long ago.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.560]   I met some of the students I used to be counselor with.
[00:21:54.560 --> 00:21:57.920]   You know, now they grew up.
[00:21:57.920 --> 00:22:01.000]   They got married, right?
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.240]   And I met some of the friends,
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.080]   you know, some of the students that I used to be with.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:07.480]   Now they grew up, right?
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.800]   They're working, or they have their own career.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:12.600]   Now, I met different people,
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:14.080]   "Oh, long time no see," right?
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:16.600]   "Wow, long time no see, long time no see."
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.880]   You know, that's one of the tunes
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:19.880]   that I play the whole night, right?
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.800]   "Oh, long time no see, long time no see."
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.360]   It becomes automatic, right?
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:26.640]   Yeah, whoever you see, "Oh, long time no see," right?
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.600]   Because I haven't seen them for a long time,
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.560]   especially in the past three years because of the pandemic.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:38.200]   I haven't seen those friends for a long, long time, right?
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:42.080]   So, and the other tune that we play, or I play,
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:46.280]   most of the time during the night, during the banquet,
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.920]   was that, "Wow, your kid is so big now.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:54.880]   "Wow, you," talking to the kids,
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:55.880]   "Wow, you're so tall.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.660]   "When I saw you last time, you were like, you know,
[00:22:58.660 --> 00:23:01.000]   "a tiny, tiny being, right?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.600]   "Now you're so big," right?
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.880]   Then they, and then we update each other,
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:09.280]   and then I told them, you know,
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.600]   my son and my daughters are in college,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:14.480]   and they say, "Wow, dang, I cannot believe that
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:16.920]   "because, you know, in my mind,
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.120]   "your kids are just kids," right?
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:22.080]   I said, "They're not kids, they're adults now.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:27.080]   "They drive, they drink, they're adults."
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:32.560]   Life is fleeting, life is so short.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:36.120]   That is one of the things we hear over and over again.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:37.000]   Time flies.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.040]   Sukkot, it's a reminder
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:43.500]   that your life is not permanent.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.920]   Don't make it permanent.
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:49.080]   There's no need to make it permanent.
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.280]   But, you know, it's very interesting.
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:55.700]   Sometimes we spend most of our effort
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.340]   to make life permanent.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:00.560]   Try to make it permanent.
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.240]   Try to make it look like it lasts forever.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:08.300]   Sukkot tells you, "Don't pretend.
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:09.380]   "You can't do that.
[00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:13.400]   "Life is not permanent, it's transitional."
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:16.000]   And how much we invest in our lives,
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:21.400]   how much effort, how much thinking
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.520]   have we invest into just planning our life,
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.640]   building our life, it seems like our Sukkot
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:30.200]   would last forever.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.240]   But no, it won't.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:34.120]   Life is always transitional.
[00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:38.200]   You know, one of the scriptures
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:43.240]   the Jewish people would read during Sukkot
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.800]   in the synagogues is the book of Ecclesiastes.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.800]   Ecclesiastes.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.760]   If you haven't read this book,
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.120]   the book of Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament,
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.080]   you should read it.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:24:58.520]   It talks about life under the sun.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.520]   It's meaningless.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.720]   Because of death.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.840]   Because of death.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:07.680]   And one day, we're gonna die, right?
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.880]   And the whole book of Ecclesiastes is to remind us
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.800]   where should we find meaning in our lives.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.240]   Let me close with this last scripture.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:26.240]   The Lord said to Moses, "On the 15th day of seven months,
[00:25:26.240 --> 00:25:30.720]   "the Feast of Sukkot lasts for seven days.
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:35.720]   "You live in Sukkah for seven days, all of you,
[00:25:36.540 --> 00:25:39.540]   "so that your children and your children's children
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.200]   "will know that you used to live in Sukkah,
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.420]   "in wilderness for 40 years.
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:47.880]   "I rescue you.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.100]   "I provide for you.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.100]   "I guide your way.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.740]   "Your short life is under the hand of God."
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:00.120]   Well, a reminder for us, life is transitional.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:03.780]   And how much effort should we invest
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:05.940]   into something really eternal, right?
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:07.880]   Something really eternal.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:11.820]   C.S. Lewis says something like,
[00:26:11.820 --> 00:26:17.260]   do not, something like do not,
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:20.460]   do not stress out for things that are not eternal.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:26.420]   Do not be so stressed out about things that don't last.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:30.900]   Change our attitude.
[00:26:30.900 --> 00:26:35.180]   You know, adjust our orientation.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:36.940]   What is life all about?
[00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.740]   Especially we have the life of Christ.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:44.740]   How should we invest our time in this short, short life?
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:47.800]   Invest into something that will last.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.900]   Now, what will last in the Bible?
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.100]   Let me tell you this, okay?
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:54.020]   What will last in the Bible?
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:55.740]   I can think of three things
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.400]   that will last forever in the Bible.
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:00.060]   First, God himself.
[00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:03.740]   God himself is everlasting.
[00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:05.780]   All right?
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:11.740]   Second, is the soul, human soul.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:19.620]   Human life will last forever, eternal life, right?
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.780]   Three, the gospel.
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.540]   Last forever.
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.060]   Worth our effort, worth our investment.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:32.120]   Let's all pray together.
[00:27:33.220 --> 00:27:35.900]   Father, we give you thanks for the reminder
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:37.380]   that we are in Christ,
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.600]   that we have eternal life and eternal hope.
[00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:45.300]   And thank you for your grace.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.420]   Thank you for the gift of eternal life.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.300]   Remind us once and again, again and again,
[00:27:52.300 --> 00:27:54.060]   that this life is short.
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:58.500]   This life will not last.
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.440]   Yes, we are all like Israelites living in tents
[00:28:04.440 --> 00:28:06.360]   in the wilderness.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:12.160]   When wind came, everything would be gone.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.360]   Yes, life is transitional,
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.620]   but help us to anchor our life in eternity.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:22.200]   Help us to fix our eyes
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.320]   in something that will last,
[00:28:27.320 --> 00:28:28.520]   to preach your gospel,
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.140]   to build up your kingdom, to serve you.
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.600]   Thank you for being our eternal God.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.900]   In Christ's name, we pray.
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:40.600]   Well, thank you very much and we'll see you next week
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:43.880]   and we'll continue to talk about faith and time.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.720]   God bless.
