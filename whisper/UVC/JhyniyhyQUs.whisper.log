[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.680]   Thank you, James, and thank you, Jason, as well, for leading us in worship.
[00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.180]   I'm excited to be here and grateful to be here with you all, and always really enjoy
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.840]   being at UV, so glad that I get to be with you today.
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.300]   And as Jason was reminding us, we are headed into the holidays, and the first kind of American
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.400]   holiday we have this time of year is Thanksgiving, which is a great holiday.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.720]   My daughter and I, as we were driving here, we were talking about the things we enjoy
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.720]   about Thanksgiving.
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:38.600]   And there's lots of obvious things, like the food, and spending time with family, those
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.900]   things are great.
[00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.720]   But it really is a good time for us to think about being grateful, and practicing giving
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.600]   thanks and practicing gratitude.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.320]   So that's what we're going to talk about today.
[00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.240]   I thought since we're headed towards this time anyway, we should talk a little bit about
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:02.760]   what it means to be grateful and to cultivate gratitude in our hearts.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.360]   And gratitude is really an important thing for us.
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.640]   It's a God-honoring value that Scripture commands in a lot of different places.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.520]   The Scripture tells us to practice gratitude.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.840]   First Thessalonians 5.18 says it real plainly, real clearly.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.860]   It says, "Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus
[00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.860]   for you."
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.500]   Can't get much more clear than that.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.560]   Give thanks for everything in all circumstances.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.200]   But even if that wasn't enough, just the command of Scripture, we know that practicing gratitude
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.440]   has a lot of obvious benefits in our lives.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.560]   There's a lot of scientific studies have been done to show the benefits of gratitude.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:51.320]   It improves our physical health, our psychological health, it strengthens our relationships,
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.960]   it helps us to be more resilient as people, it gives us a better view of ourselves, and
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.200]   it even helps us to sleep better.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.280]   So there's all these reasons that we should be learning to be more grateful people.
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.600]   And yet, it's not necessarily something that is easy for us.
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.720]   A lot of us struggle to practice gratitude.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.720]   I know I do.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.240]   It's not something that we just naturally do.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.120]   And I think the reason for that goes back to who we are as human beings.
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   The fact that we're fallen, we're broken, we're flawed, and we live in this broken world.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.760]   And so there are things in our world that disappoint us.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.080]   And we disappoint ourselves.
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.840]   And things in life don't go how we want them to go.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.540]   And because we're broken and flawed human beings, we're inherently selfish.
[00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.360]   We kind of know how we want life to go, and we want it to be focused on us and good for
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.520]   us.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.640]   And when that doesn't happen, we are frustrated, or we're disappointed, or we're hurt, or we're
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.840]   confused, and it's hard for us to be grateful.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.800]   That's one of the reasons that gratitude just doesn't naturally come out of us most of the
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.020]   time.
[00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.320]   And some people may, their personality, their gifting, maybe they're just more grateful
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.320]   than others.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.180]   So if you're one of those people, that's beautiful, and that's fantastic.
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.640]   But for others, you may say, "Well, it's not easy for me, and I don't find myself being
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.840]   grateful very much.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:21.040]   I don't even find myself saying thank you or things like that."
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.120]   I think for all of us, we can learn to be more grateful.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.880]   Even if you're already a grateful person, there are more ways you could practice gratitude.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.760]   But if you're someone who struggles with that, then certainly you could grow in that.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:39.440]   And the point is that because it's not natural to us, we have to cultivate it.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.120]   That's why we're talking about it today and saying cultivating gratitude, because it's
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.020]   not something that's just going to naturally spring up in our life.
[00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.360]   We have to cultivate it, just like you cultivate plants.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.560]   You have to plant the seeds, you have to water and care for the plant and protect it from
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.980]   things that would damage it so that it will grow and bring fruit.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.440]   And that's how gratitude is.
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.960]   We have to plant the seeds, we have to frequently water the plant and allow it to grow in our
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.160]   life and bring fruit of thanksgiving and gratefulness in our life.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.800]   So we're going to look today at Psalm 100.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.040]   It gives us a really beautiful template for thinking about gratitude.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:24.840]   If you'd like to look at Psalm 100 in your Bible or your phone app, we're going to read
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.360]   through the entire Psalm, but don't be scared, it's only five verses.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.640]   Some Psalms, if we were going to read through the whole thing, I would just read the Psalm
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.160]   and then we'd go home.
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:37.160]   But this one's short, so we can take it.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.440]   This is Psalm 100, it says, "Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.500]   Serve the Lord with gladness.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.820]   Come into his presence with singing, 'Know that the Lord, he is God.
[00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.200]   It is he who made us and we are his.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.320]   We are his people and the sheep of his pasture.
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.040]   Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.040]   Give thanks to him, bless his name.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:10.800]   For the Lord is good, his steadfast love endures forever and his faithfulness to all generations."
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   Now, hopefully, just reading that Psalm encourages us a little bit and fills us with a little
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.760]   bit of gratitude.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:28.640]   But this Psalm has some really practical clues in it that help us think about how to cultivate
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.480]   gratitude in our own lives, how to grow gratitude in our lives.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:40.280]   The first thing I want us to see is that we cultivate gratitude as we praise God for the
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.280]   wonders of his creation.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.240]   We cultivate gratitude in our lives as we praise God for the wonders of his creation.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.720]   You can see this in verse one.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:58.000]   It talks about how the whole earth is making a joyful noise to the Lord.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.160]   God's power and creativity, his wisdom, his care, his beauty, those things are displayed
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.400]   in nature and in the things that he has made.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.880]   Verse three reminds us that he's the one who made us.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:16.840]   He's the one who made our world.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.440]   So that reminds us that we should experience some gratitude as we look at this amazing
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.600]   world that God has made and as we look at our own lives and the amazing things that
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.280]   God has done in our lives.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:37.120]   Verse five reminds us of God's goodness displayed in his love for his people and throughout
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.120]   the generations of human history.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:44.680]   And those are important things to think about.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.520]   If we're having trouble being grateful, we say, "I really struggle with gratitude because
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.440]   I feel disappointed or I feel hurt or I feel confused about things in the world."
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:07:01.040]   A great place to start is looking at the wonders of the world that God has made.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:06.000]   Psalm 19 says that the heavens declare the glory of God and the sky above proclaims his
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.560]   handiwork day to day, pours out speech, and night to night reveals knowledge.
[00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:14.280]   There's no speech nor are there words whose voice is not heard.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.400]   It's the first three verses of Psalm 19.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.760]   And that passage reminds us that no matter where you are on the earth, no matter what
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:30.000]   your language or cultural background is, you can look at God's creation and experience
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:39.280]   the wonder of it and you can also understand that God is big and powerful and good and
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:45.360]   full of beauty and full of wisdom just by looking at God's creation.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.880]   And that's a healthy thing for us to do.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:54.160]   Honestly, I believe that if we can't acknowledge the goodness of God in creation, then we're
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.800]   really practicing ingratitude.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:59.680]   We're really being ungrateful.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:06.020]   If you think about someone giving a special and unique and valuable gift to someone else,
[00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:14.480]   if someone receives that gift and feels no gratefulness for it whatsoever, then they're
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.680]   practicing ingratitude, right?
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:23.160]   And God in the world that he has made has given us this amazing gift of beauty and of
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.520]   wonder and we need to acknowledge it.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:29.200]   We need to acknowledge him.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:38.160]   Romans 1 talks about this when it talks about how God has made plain himself in nature.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:43.320]   Verse 21 in Romans chapter 1 says this, "For although they knew God, they did not honor
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.040]   him as God or give thanks to him."
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:50.160]   It's talking about people who looked at what God had made, they could see the reality of
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:58.280]   God through what he had made, but they chose not to acknowledge him or give thanks.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:01.600]   And that's ungratefulness.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:03.440]   And that's obviously not where we want to be.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.400]   That's not what we want to live out and practice.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.960]   We have to guard our hearts against this.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.000]   And one of the ways that we guard our hearts against that is just by making sure that we're
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.800]   aware of how amazing God's world is and how beautiful it is and all the things that God
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   has made.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:25.840]   So there's different ways we can do this, obviously, but I kind of put it into categories
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.800]   as I was thinking about it.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.880]   These are different ways that I see some of the wonder of God's creation.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.720]   First of all, we see the aesthetic beauty of God's creation, right?
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.720]   And most of us are probably very familiar with that.
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.240]   That's when we look at something and we say, "That is beautiful."
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.000]   Maybe it's a sunset.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.680]   Maybe it is where you go to the lakefront and we're looking out at the water.
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:53.200]   Maybe you get out of the city and spend some time in the mountains or you're in the forest
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.320]   and you just say, "Wow, this is beautiful."
[00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:02.500]   And when you experience that, the aesthetic beauty of what God has made, you should feel
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.220]   a sense of gratitude and say, "I'm grateful to God.
[00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:07.400]   Look at what he has done.
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:14.160]   This is just amazing and beautiful and totally gratuitous."
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:16.680]   That's one of the things I love about nature.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:19.360]   God didn't have to make it that beautiful.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.040]   God didn't have to make it that...
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.200]   I mean, it just does things to our heart and soul when we connect with it, when we see
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:27.920]   it, when we experience it.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:28.920]   God didn't have to do that.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:32.760]   He didn't have to use as many colors as he did.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:37.280]   And yet he did that to display himself and to display his creativity and his wisdom and
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.800]   his power and his love for us.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.820]   And so our heart should see that and respond and say, "God, I praise you.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.460]   This is amazing.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:52.060]   What a beautiful sight that I'm seeing or what a beautiful day it is."
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.060]   And Jason's right.
[00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:56.320]   We get a lot of winter in Chicago.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:59.960]   But even that has its own beauty, right?
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   Today is a nice day.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.520]   It's cool and crisp out there, but it's still beautiful.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:07.880]   The snowy days are beautiful in their own way.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.760]   Then it gets kind of dirty after that.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:14.920]   But we can enjoy God's beauty through nature.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:19.520]   Even just looking out our window into the yard, we can enjoy that.
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:27.560]   The other way that I really try to reflect on God's goodness in creation is kind of maybe
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:33.000]   more from a scientific perspective, the scientific beauty that we see in creation.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.440]   What I mean by that is if you start to think about the intricacy and the complexity of
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:45.200]   the world that God has made, if you learn a lot about the biology of our own bodies,
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:50.160]   you start to say, "Wow, this is really an amazingly intricate and complex thing that
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.280]   God has done in us."
[00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:59.360]   Or if you learn a lot about the universe and the cosmology of the universe kind of on a
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.200]   macro scale, it's amazing.
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.200]   It's mind-blowing.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:10.040]   It's more than we can wrap our heads around, the power of God that's displayed in that.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.920]   And those things, again, should cause us to say, "Wow, I'm grateful to God.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:19.360]   I praise God because you didn't have to do this.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.440]   You didn't have to show off like this.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.640]   You didn't have to make it this great, and yet you did.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.040]   And it's worthy of our praise.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.960]   Our gratitude belongs to the Lord."
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:40.320]   Then the other category that's really big for me is we can really be in awe of the human
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.720]   beauty of creation.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.120]   And I think that's significant.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:51.280]   And I don't just mean human physical beauty, although God created that too.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:59.080]   But I mean all the things that it means to be a human being that God made about us that
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:01.040]   we get to experience.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:07.600]   The fact that we get to have friendships, we get to enjoy laughing together over something
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:16.120]   that's funny, we get to taste food together and enjoy that experience, we get to listen
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:25.040]   to music, and we get to have love and relationships where we can't really, as human beings, we
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:33.040]   can't really describe, even from kind of a scientific perspective, we can't really describe
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:40.400]   why love is such a big deal to us, why we feel the way we do about a family member or
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   a close friend.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:48.360]   Again, God didn't have to put that much beauty into us.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.680]   He didn't have to give us those things, but he did.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:58.920]   He gave us these friendships that we can't even really fully express and relationships
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:07.280]   with people that love us and that we love in ways that we were not even able to describe.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:11.680]   God made something really beautiful when he made humans, and the Bible's clear about that.
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:18.800]   When God makes everything in the book of Genesis, humans, us, that was the masterpiece.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:23.440]   It was the last thing and the best thing that God made.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:24.880]   And we should be grateful for that.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:31.680]   As we look around and we see people and we see the way that they love one another, we
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.280]   see the beautiful things that happen through relationships in our lives, we see the things
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:40.280]   that other people create and that other people do.
[00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:48.640]   We can be grateful to God for that wonder of his creation, the human element.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:53.280]   It's something that we can be in awe of and we should be.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:58.320]   The reality is, as we look at the wonder of what God has created, we start to sense our
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:03.400]   own smallness and it fills us with gratitude.
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.400]   Hopefully we've all experienced that on some level.
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:10.640]   If we haven't, then we're not looking, we're spending too much time looking at the sidewalk
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:12.240]   or something like that.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.080]   But all of us should be looking at the world God has made and saying, "Wow, I'm grateful
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:23.160]   to see this and it gives me a sense of how small I am and my place in God's world and
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:26.080]   I'm grateful that I get to be here."
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:29.080]   That doesn't mean that there's not challenging things there are, and that doesn't mean there's
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:34.120]   not things that we see that are hurtful.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.000]   There certainly are, but there are also things that we can see, even in difficult times in
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.680]   life that cause us to be grateful, that cause us to be grateful that we get to be in God's
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:45.680]   world.
[00:15:45.680 --> 00:15:52.600]   I remember one time when I was in college, I went to college in Hawaii and I was snorkeling
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.840]   on the big island of Hawaii, this place called Kealakakua Bay.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:02.760]   I was pretty far out, it was a beautiful reef, probably about 20 feet deep, the water.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.720]   And then the drop off was over there where it just dropped off, it got down to maybe
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.160]   30, 40 and then just dropped off into the dark blue water.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:15.120]   If you've ever snorkeled in a place like that above the reef, the drop off is just really
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.380]   dark and you just can't see what's down there.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:20.560]   So I was having a great time looking at all the fish and the reef and it was colorful
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.520]   and amazing.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:27.520]   And I looked over to my left, I was kind of going this way, the beach was over here, drop
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.520]   off's over here.
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:34.920]   I look over, I see something moving over by the drop off, it's kind of silver.
[00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:41.560]   So I stop and observe for a minute and it's this big, it's coming up towards the reef
[00:16:41.560 --> 00:16:43.840]   so I can see it better and better as it's coming toward me.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:52.200]   It's this big tiger shark, probably 18 to 20 feet long, huge shark.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.960]   And the weirdest thing was what I remember feeling so distinctly in that moment.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:17:00.440]   I had my fins on and I felt like, you know, when you have fins on you feel like you can
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:02.560]   move pretty good in the water.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:08.400]   And I was just watching this thing cruising up and it didn't even look like it was moving
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:13.440]   its tail hardly and it was still moving like five times faster than me.
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:20.160]   And it wasn't even trying, it looked like it was drifting and it was moving so fast.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:27.120]   And I just had this overwhelming feeling of being so vulnerable and out of my element
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:33.000]   because I felt how slow and incapable I was of going anywhere and I could see this giant
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.680]   shark like, it was easy for him to cruise through that water.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.760]   And obviously I went into the beach and got out of the water.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:47.680]   But it was one of those moments where I really felt my own smallness.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:53.840]   And when we look at God's creation enough, we'll start to feel that and say, "Wow, I
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.800]   can feel my own smallness and it makes me so grateful that I get to be a part of this
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:05.720]   world that God has made and I get to experience it and I'm grateful for what he's done."
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:13.520]   Next thing we see here in Psalm 100 is the gratitude that we can have for God and the
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.620]   beauty of redemption.
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:22.040]   We cultivate gratitude as we praise God for the beauty of his redemption.
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:29.240]   In verses three, four, and five of this Psalm, we're reminded that God is good and loving.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:34.000]   It tells us in verse three that he's the one who made us, we belong to him, we're his,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.640]   we're his people, we're the sheep of his pasture.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:42.800]   In verse five tells us that the Lord is good, his steadfast love endures forever, his faithfulness
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.960]   to all generations.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.760]   God is full of care for his people.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.400]   He's full of love and grace and mercy.
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:58.840]   God has done something in redeeming us that we, is beyond our capacity to describe and
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:06.160]   honestly beyond our capacity to really comprehend or even fully understand what we have received
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.920]   from God.
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:15.440]   But if we will begin to think about it and consider it and reflect on it, our hearts
[00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:20.580]   will begin to be full of gratefulness.
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:26.020]   Think about some of the things that it means for you, you personally, to be redeemed by
[00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:28.180]   Christ.
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:32.680]   God has forgiven your sin.
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:41.960]   He's covered your mistakes, those things in your past that you wish you could erase.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:44.180]   God has covered those things.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:47.760]   You may still have to deal with some of the consequences of them, but you have no guilt
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:49.480]   or shame from them.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.160]   God has erased them.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:56.760]   Ephesians one, verses seven and eight says this, "In him we have redemption through his
[00:19:56.760 --> 00:20:01.560]   blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses according to the riches of his grace, which he lavished
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.200]   upon us in all wisdom and insight."
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:09.040]   That's your story if you have a relationship with Jesus.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:19.600]   All those things are forgiven through his grace and he has lavished his love on you.
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.360]   God has healed our hurts and scars.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:26.600]   We know that because we live in this broken world, all of us are harmed by different things.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:27.600]   We have traumas.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.720]   We have all of these scars in our life.
[00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:36.760]   Through Christ, God can and does heal those things.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:43.480]   God is at work helping us to be made whole, to restore us, to reconcile us to other people,
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:46.800]   to bring us back to health in our relationships.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:51.160]   That's a beautiful thing that we can be grateful for.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.240]   God's rescued us from sin and death.
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:56.120]   We don't have to be afraid of death.
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:58.360]   We don't have to be afraid of sin.
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.480]   Jesus defeated those things.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:05.120]   God's promised us a beautiful future.
[00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:12.960]   First Peter one says this, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ according
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.600]   to his great mercy.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:20.000]   He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:25.560]   from the dead to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.560]   you."
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:30.000]   That's your story through redemption.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:37.880]   You have a living hope that cannot be touched by anything in this world.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.320]   It will not be destroyed or diminished in any way.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.840]   It's kept in heaven for you.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.840]   That's your story because of redemption.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.040]   God's given us a new start in life.
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:56.400]   That's one of my favorite parts of the gospel that we can be made into a new creation in
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.160]   Christ.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:03.280]   We know that 2 Corinthians 5:17 talks about that, "Therefore if anyone is in Christ, he's
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:04.280]   a new creation.
[00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:08.560]   The old has passed away, behold the new has come."
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.720]   That's something to be grateful for.
[00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:12.800]   That's something to praise God for, something to give thanks for.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.520]   We can be something new.
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:18.760]   God gives us peace and joy and hope.
[00:22:18.760 --> 00:22:20.560]   Romans 15, 13, I love this verse.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:27.360]   It says, "May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing so that by
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:32.700]   the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope."
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:37.640]   Those are some amazing promises, amazing promises.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:48.040]   Type of stuff that we could jump and shout and yell on the street because of how powerful
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   and beautiful that is.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.160]   The type of stuff that we should certainly be grateful for.
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:59.360]   They come to us because of redemption, because of what Jesus has done in our lives.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.280]   That's something that should, as we look at it, as we think about it, as we reflect on
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:07.200]   it, it should fill our hearts with gratitude.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.960]   It's a way we can cultivate gratitude in our lives is looking at the redemption that God
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.960]   has given us.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:17.600]   We need to focus on the beauty of what He has done for us.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.640]   Sometimes when we think about scripture, we think about redemption in this grand narrative
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.920]   and God saving all people.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:25.760]   That is true.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.320]   That's the beautiful grand narrative of redemption.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.720]   Redemption also has a personal narrative that God saved you.
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:38.520]   God's at work in your life and He's healing you from your hurt and from your past and
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:46.160]   He's making you a new creation and He's making you more like Jesus.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.200]   So when you start to think about this and be grateful for it, don't just be grateful
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.080]   that God is saving people around the world.
[00:23:53.080 --> 00:23:55.980]   Yeah, be grateful for that.
[00:23:55.980 --> 00:24:00.080]   But bring it home to your own heart and say, "I'm grateful that God saved me.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:03.040]   I'm grateful that I'm not who I was.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.760]   I'm grateful that even though I'm not yet who I want to be, that God is moving me towards
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.840]   that and He's doing something beautiful in my life."
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:18.000]   And you can be personally grateful for redemption.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:23.380]   When I think of this, one of the illustrations I think of is like a really skillfully crafted
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:27.720]   work of art, if you think about something like that.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.280]   Especially like if you think of a paint on canvas type of work of art.
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:36.560]   If you go down to the Art Institute, they have this giant, some of the Renaissance art
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:43.000]   are like huge, like 20 feet wide and 10 feet tall, huge, huge.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.280]   You think about how long it would take to make a work of art like that, all the layers
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   of paint that have to go on there, the type of vision that the artist has to have when
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:59.400]   they start to even know what they want to get onto the canvas, but then also the dedication
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:03.520]   they have to get it on there day after day for years they have to work on something like
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:05.600]   that.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:11.240]   And you also have to know that even the most precise artist is going to make some mistakes
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.700]   and they're going to get some lines that are a little bit off.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:19.040]   And so then they've got to go back and touch that up a little bit with another layer of
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.040]   paint.
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:29.360]   It's an amazing accomplishment to bring something like that to completion, a work of art like
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:30.360]   that.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:37.160]   And yet that's what God is doing in our lives.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:43.920]   God has this vision for your life that's not just a one week vision, it's, there's a Christian
[00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:47.040]   song from when I was in high school, I've always remembered this lyric, it says, "I
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:50.840]   have a plan for you, it will only take a lifetime to see through."
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:55.600]   That's God's vision, it's for your whole life.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.840]   God sees the whole thing, he knows what he's doing in your life.
[00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:09.640]   He's putting on layer after layer of paint to craft you into who he wants you to be.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.360]   And the whole time there's mistakes being made, right?
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.080]   Not by God, but by me.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.640]   God doesn't make mistakes, but I do.
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.800]   I get outside the lines all the time.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:26.960]   And God in his providence and his sovereignty and his grace and mercy and love, he finds
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:35.720]   ways to craft even my mistakes into something beautiful and something that's gonna be for
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:39.240]   my good and for his glory.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:46.240]   But here's the crazy part, God's not just doing that for me, he's doing it for everyone
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:50.360]   in the world who has a relationship with Jesus.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.760]   He's doing it for all these people at the same time.
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:26:58.000]   What an amazing thing it is.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:01.240]   And when you stand in front of one of those giant works of art, for me, I'm always kind
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:08.880]   of in awe and I think, "Wow, whoever made this, like I said, I give glory to them for
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:09.880]   what they have done."
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:16.520]   And so when we look at God's work in redemption, we should stand back and say, "Wow, this is
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   amazing.
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:24.080]   I can't even believe God is able to redeem all the mess in my heart, much less everybody
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:27.840]   else's heart, and then bring us together in all these different ways and then fix all
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.280]   of our mistakes even when we keep making them."
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:37.160]   And it brings glory to God because of what he's doing in redemption.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.680]   So that's a great place to cultivate gratitude.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.760]   Say, "I'm gonna grow gratitude in my life by thinking about what God's done for me,
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:45.760]   what he's doing in our world."
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:53.200]   And then the last big way I want us to think about cultivating gratitude is as we praise
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:58.680]   God for the majesty of who he is.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.480]   You know, the first two, praising God and cultivating gratitude as we look at the wonders
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.960]   of his creation, as we look at the beauty of redemption, those things kind of have to
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.480]   do with God's work in our world.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.520]   But here's the crazy thing.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.680]   Scripture is really clear about this.
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:22.280]   God is worthy of praise even if he never did any of that, just because of who he is.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:26.720]   And we can cultivate gratitude in that way as well, just because of who God is.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:35.160]   Verse 3 here of Psalm 100 says, "Know that the Lord, he is God."
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:41.600]   Obviously there's other statements in that Psalm, but that statement is enough by itself.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.680]   Know that the Lord, he is God.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:51.360]   Even if there's nothing else, God is worthy of our praise because of who he is.
[00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.400]   Our gratitude belongs to him.
[00:28:54.400 --> 00:29:02.480]   Jehovah, the word in verse 3 there, the Hebrew word for God, means the self-existent one
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.640]   or the eternal one or the existing one.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:12.840]   That's the picture that we have of God in Scripture.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:16.440]   Completely apart from the wonder of creation and the beauty of redemption, God is still
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.160]   worthy of our praise.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:22.920]   And so when we contemplate who he is and reflect on who he is, our hearts should be full of
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:24.160]   gratitude.
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:27.400]   Think about some of the attributes of God that Scripture revealed.
[00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:34.440]   God's power, which is unlimited.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.440]   God's goodness.
[00:29:35.440 --> 00:29:41.400]   It always blows my mind when I think about how powerful God is and yet he is also good.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:49.360]   If God was powerful and not good, he would be completely terrifying.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:53.880]   God is not just powerful, he's also good and he loves us.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:59.320]   His wisdom and knowledge, Romans 11.33 says, "Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.280]   knowledge of God, how unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways."
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:08.360]   God's wisdom and knowledge is completely beyond our comprehension.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:14.720]   God's holiness, his love for us, Psalms 100 talks about it, verse 5, "The Lord is good,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.600]   his steadfast love endures forever."
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:25.320]   God's love for us, his grace, his mercy, God's justice, God's sovereignty, God's immutability.
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:29.160]   That just means the fact that God doesn't change.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:34.240]   He's so right that he never needs to change because he's not wrong and he's not going
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.240]   to be wrong.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.880]   He never changes because he doesn't need to change.
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:43.680]   The eternal nature of God, he's always existed, his omnipresence, he's in every place, his
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.680]   transcendence, his infinitude, which is crazy because when you think about the attributes
[00:30:47.680 --> 00:30:51.840]   of God and all the things that make up who God is, he's just, he's loving, he's all these
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.640]   things, you have to also remember that not only is he those things but he is those things
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.800]   in infinity and he is the very definition of those things.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:04.460]   We only know love because God is love.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.000]   We only know justice because God is justice.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.680]   We only know mercy and grace because God is mercy and grace.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:18.540]   God's perfection, not only is he those things in infinitude but he is also those things
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:20.820]   in perfection.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:23.560]   He is perfectly loving.
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.740]   He is perfectly just.
[00:31:24.740 --> 00:31:26.600]   He is perfectly holy.
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:29.440]   He is perfectly good.
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:38.920]   When we think about that stuff, we should say, "Wow, I want to praise God for who he
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.920]   is.
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:42.320]   I want to be grateful for who he is."
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:46.080]   And God is all these things completely by himself.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:51.720]   He self-exists and is completely self-sufficient.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:57.440]   Back to this three, verses 13 and 14, this is when Moses and God are having this conversation.
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:01.720]   God's come to Moses, said, "Hey, I want you to go to the people and go to Egypt and lead
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.880]   the people out of Egypt and I'm going to give you what to say."
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:08.720]   Moses is not wanting to do it so he's talking back.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.360]   "Then Moses said to God, 'If I come to the people of Israel and say to them, 'The God
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.120]   of your fathers has sent me to you,' and they asked me, 'What is his name?
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.840]   What shall I say to them?'"
[00:32:16.840 --> 00:32:23.080]   Verse 14, "God said to Moses, 'I am who I am.'
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.360]   And he said, 'Say this to the people of Israel, 'I am has sent you.'"
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:37.080]   Now, it's not quite as powerful in English as it is in Hebrew, but verse 14, God is really
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.640]   letting Moses know in no uncertain terms.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.520]   He's saying, "You want to know what my name is?
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.640]   You want to know who I am?
[00:32:43.640 --> 00:32:46.640]   You want to know who to announce?
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:55.120]   Announce the eternal, existent one, the one who has always existed and always will exist
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:04.880]   and who needs no one else and is totally self-sufficient and is without any degree of diminishment
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   or need."
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:10.720]   That's what God's saying to Moses in that verse.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.080]   "I am the existent one.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.920]   I'm the one who has always been, always will be.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.920]   I need nothing.
[00:33:16.920 --> 00:33:19.000]   Everything else came from me."
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   That's the God that we serve.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.720]   That's the God of the Bible.
[00:33:24.720 --> 00:33:31.840]   And he's worthy of our praise and our thanksgiving and gratitude just because that's who he is.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.320]   If you've ever been in a situation where you kind of experienced something that was really
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:42.520]   transcendent, gratitude was probably a part of that situation.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:50.840]   I know in times of my life when I've experienced something transcendent, gratitude just comes
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.280]   from nowhere.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:59.440]   One time when I was a youth pastor many years ago, I was in a service at a camp.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.560]   The presence of the Lord was really present.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:06.640]   We got done.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.240]   We did worship at the end.
[00:34:08.240 --> 00:34:10.480]   It was time to go.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.800]   I told everybody to be dismissed, to go back to the cabins because we were supposed to
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:16.320]   go to bed.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.280]   And no one would leave the room because of God's presence.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:21.720]   And so everybody stayed.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:27.080]   So we started doing worship again and we just kept the service going and ended up being
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.600]   there much, much longer.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.640]   And God was just working in powerful ways.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:32.800]   Kids got saved that night, came to know Jesus.
[00:34:32.800 --> 00:34:34.320]   It was really a transcendent thing.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.680]   It wasn't anything that I was doing or anybody else was doing.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.320]   God was at work.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:47.920]   And I was full of an overwhelming sense of gratitude just to be there, to be present.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:52.920]   It's not a lot of transcendent experiences in my life.
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.920]   But another one that I can think of that's really powerful to me, every time one of our
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:05.080]   children has been born, I'm there with my wife and I see one of our children born, been
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:07.360]   there for all five of them.
[00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:15.440]   And I'm reflecting on just the promise and the potential of a human life and what it
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:20.480]   means that this new life is taking their first breath in the world.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:25.480]   And I get to see it, get to see them take their first breath and then announce themselves
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:28.760]   with screaming and crying.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:34.020]   And it's always like just a beautiful moment.
[00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:37.160]   And there's just emotion that I don't have to manufacture.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.640]   It just is overwhelming.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   But there's also overwhelming gratitude.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:51.720]   Because I'm so grateful for that moment, for that life, for what God is doing.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:56.560]   And when we spend some time in God's presence and experience Him and start to see how transcendent
[00:35:56.560 --> 00:35:58.760]   He is, that's what happens.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:01.400]   We don't have to try to make ourselves feel grateful.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.520]   It just comes out.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:09.080]   We're overwhelmed with gratitude for who God is.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:15.200]   So I want to encourage us to seek to cultivate gratitude in our lives, to take our eyes as
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:21.840]   much as we can off of ourselves and put them on God and what He is doing.
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.400]   And there's a lot more ways that you can practice it, but I would encourage you, if you don't
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:30.240]   know where to start, start with these three things that we talked about today.
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:36.640]   Cultivate gratitude by praising God for the wonder of His creation.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:43.200]   Cultivate gratitude by thanking God for the beauty of His redemption in your life.
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:48.320]   And cultivate gratitude just because God is.
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:50.760]   And He is so amazing and so transcendent.
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:57.520]   I'm going to close just by reading this psalm one more time and letting its words fill our
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.520]   hearts.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:02.160]   "Make a joyful noise to the Lord all the earth.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:03.360]   Serve the Lord with gladness.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:05.440]   Come into His presence with singing.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.560]   Know that the Lord, He is God.
[00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:10.840]   It is He who made us and we are His.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.080]   We are His people and the sheep of His pasture.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:17.200]   Enter His gates with thanksgiving and His courts with praise.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:18.400]   Give thanks to Him.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.520]   Bless His name for the Lord is good.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:25.600]   His steadfast love endures forever and His faithfulness to all generations."
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:27.080]   Let's pray.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:35.400]   God, we just want to thank You for who You are.
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:36.600]   We can't even describe it.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:42.240]   We can't even express who You are, God.
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:51.120]   We are so small in Your presence and yet, as the word says, by Your mercy we're not
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.120]   consumed.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.400]   You still love us.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:38:00.600]   And You choose to come and be involved in our lives.
[00:38:00.600 --> 00:38:05.840]   And God, we thank You for redemption.
[00:38:05.840 --> 00:38:09.960]   That even though we were broken, fallen sinners living in a broken, fallen world, You wrapped
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:17.080]   Yourself in our flesh and You loved us enough to come into our world and to begin to heal
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.640]   us one heart at a time and to reconcile us with You and to bring us into right relationship
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.640]   with our Creator.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:25.920]   God, we thank You for that.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.640]   We thank You for this beautiful world that You have given us and allow us to live in.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:36.060]   And God, I pray for myself and for all of us, especially over the next few weeks as
[00:38:36.060 --> 00:38:40.560]   we have this time of thanksgiving, that You would help us to cultivate gratitude to begin
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:45.040]   to see how good You are in our lives.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:49.240]   And even in the most difficult moments, You are still at work.
