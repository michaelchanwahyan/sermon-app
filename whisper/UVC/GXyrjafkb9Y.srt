1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Several years ago, a suicide occurred among a population that we had resettled through World Relief.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
 We were determined to unravel what happened, so what did happen?

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 A senior man, greatly respected in the community, took his own life.

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 We gathered the grieving community together to see how we could help, and a young man said,

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 "If this man's death surprises you, then you must not know us very well."

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Pretty damning statement to hear from someone, really, who has just gone through such pain.

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 So we asked him what we didn't know, and he went on to really say that suicide was very common for their people and why.

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 The source of their sad situation was a battle of peoples.

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 Their people alongside another people, until they became too numerous and they were perceived as a threat.

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 So they were deported and they were stripped of their citizenship.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:05,000
 They became a stateless people, having no place to call home, and this led them to have one of the highest suicide rates of any people.

12
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Let's just say they had lost hope.

13
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 Today we live in a world that seems to lack hope.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 People are at odds with one another, nations continue to war with other nations, encroaching on their rights and freedoms.

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
 When added to this, a pandemic has ravished our world.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 I can see why there is such fatalism in our world today.

17
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 Like the quandary of the stateless people that I mentioned earlier, is there any place that we can turn to in order to really find hope?

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:45,000
 David wrote the first two chapters of the book of Psalms as a prelude and a framework for the book to help us find direction in life.

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Psalms are really songs that God's people wrote for us to sing, whether an anthem or a dirge,

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 to pray back to God what's happening around us to help us sort out things in our life.

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 Interestingly, with every trial and temptation that Jesus faced,

22
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 he confronted them with the Bible and the Psalms in particular with his crucifixion.

23
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 The Psalms are a complete musical repertoire, if you will, of themes and echoes, poetry and rhythms, parallels and contrasts,

24
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 all to help us personally deal with life and also as a people to deal with life.

25
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 The main point of this second Psalm is this, we're all in, but really what side are we on?

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,000
 You see, beyond what we see physically, there is a spiritual war that rages against us behind the scenes,

27
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:47,000
 evil perpetrated by earthly leaders of countries and industries that cause harm to people who are themselves mere footmen,

28
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 slaves, understudies for spiritual powers and principalities that are in the unseen world.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 So who are these warring parties?

30
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 Well, the Bible says that every person who heeds God's instructions is on his side and on the side of his anointed in the scripture.

31
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 In this worldwide struggle that we're in, they are the blessed, and really they've been given access to true happiness.

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 But to fully appreciate their blessed state, they must trust in God's anointed and find delight in his instructions.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 Conversely, there are those who are perishing, those who live wickedly and rebel against the Lord,

34
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 muddling through life in daily skirmishes for control of what's here and there.

35
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
 Psalm chapter 2 assures us of the outcome of this battle, though, and shows us how to fight it successfully.

36
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 We need to understand this cosmic battle in order to better find our way forward here on earth.

37
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 At their core, both parties are really defined by their perspectives and the authorities that are in their life.

38
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:59,000
 At the beginning of this chapter, we really see the perishing only having a horizontal perspective on life.

39
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 The nations, or pantata ethne, is the term there, really means the peoples.

40
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 The peoples are in rebellion. And who are they in rebellion against?

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
 Ultimately, God, though they don't fully recognize him or acknowledge him,

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 and their rebellion causes them anger, a sense of futility, and frustration in life.

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 They are plodding along, not seeing little to any fruit from their labors,

44
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:35,000
 and they want to see themselves as masters of their own destiny, but they are stuck in the quagmire of this world.

45
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 The blessed, on the other hand, bring a vertical perspective to life.

46
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Pictured here in this psalm, God is in heaven. He's in heaven laughing, he's scorning,

47
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 and he's rebuking the rebellion that he sees, because he knows who is truly in charge.

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 He is placed on the supreme throne of this earth, his anointed one. And who is he?

49
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 Well, in verses 7 and 8, we see that Jesus is that king, and we, the church, are his bride,

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 having access to that power and that authority. Jesus proclaims the message that God gave him of good news.

51
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 He is indeed God's son, and as it says there, he's equal to him.

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,000
 And God gives him authority over all of the nations and the peoples of this earth.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 God wants to give the whole earth to him as his possession,

54
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,000
 but the Lord also wants to give the nations to his bride, the church.

55
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 At the end of time, the prophecy of Revelation chapter 2 quotes this psalm, saying,

56
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 "At the end of time, to all who are victorious, who obey me, obey the Lord to the end,

57
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 to them I will give authority over all nations, and they will rule the nations with an iron rod

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 and smash them like clay pots."

59
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 The critical tool to receive this blessing, though, is found at the beginning of verse 8.

60
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,000
 He says, "Only ask." Prayer is key.

61
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 We must ask God for all that we need to see victories in life, whether they be big or small.

62
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 Because the Bible says God makes all things work together for good,

63
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 to those who love him and are called according to his purposes.

64
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 So how should we respond in light of this incredible knowledge that we see here in Psalm chapter 2,

65
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
 and what should we lead others to do to act on it?

66
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 He really speaks of four things here.

67
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 He talks about us acting wisely in the days that we're in, to serve him reverently,

68
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 to rejoice with trembling, and to submit to God's Son in all things.

69
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 And why is this so? Because our actions are consequential.

70
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
 Rebellion brings about God's anger and destruction,

71
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 and that without notice, no matter who you are or what you're doing.

72
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 But there is joy, and there's peace for those who take their refuge in the Lord.

73
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 They find everlasting life, 24/7 protection, and abundance instead of scarcity.

74
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,000
 So back to the stateless people story that I mentioned at the beginning of my time with you.

75
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 We said that they had lost hope, and a young man from the community provided a glimmer of hope in our meeting with them.

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 He mentioned how hopeful all the people were who had helped them as they were resettled here,

77
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 and they all happened to be Christians.

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 He wondered if they might help him find hope and help his people find hope.

79
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 So what did we do?

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,000
 We extended a Macedonian call for help, and we found a person of peace who spoke their language

81
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:46,000
 and was willing to offer this same hope in God's anointed,

82
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 like those who had helped them before when they were first arriving.

83
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 They learned that hope is found in God and his appointed ruler, the true ruler of the world,

84
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 and that true ruler of the world is King Jesus.

85
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 This understanding of Jesus led these stateless people to form churches in their homes

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 and eventually to launch public worship here in the Chicagoland area.

87
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 With their first baptisms just a couple of years back,

88
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
 a first generation of Christians was born among that population

89
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 when very few, if any, in their country had experienced belief in Christ in the past.

90
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 And among those who were first baptized included an 82-year-old witch doctor

91
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 who committed his life to Christ.

92
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 Today, there is an active movement of Christian community among this population,

93
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,000
 touching now three generations in a very short period of time.

94
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 I received this note recently from one of our youth workers working with their kids.

95
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 She said this, "Hey, not sure if you're all going to see this story,

96
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
 but I wanted to share it with you, Keith.

97
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 I just wanted to share a Little Friday encouragement.

98
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 This one is about the children from this community, and they are now high school kids.

99
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 It touches my soul. I hope it will touch yours.

100
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I had a Nepali woman tell me this week that in the last week, the last year or two,

101
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
 that she and her two boys had decided on the Jesus.

102
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
 It used to be the Hindu, and now it was the Jesus.

103
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 She said, "Since my boys listened to the Jesus, they no fight no more.

104
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 They no argue. They talk. They listen. They help.

105
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 I asked them why they now act so good.

106
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 They tell me, 'Mom, this Jesus is very, very good.

107
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 He no like the fighting. He only likes the helping.'

108
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:44,000
 The Jesus is now spreading among the youth in this community in a very big way.

109
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
 They band together, worship together, sing and pray,

110
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 and when they're done, they help each other with their homework.

111
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 There's so many things that COVID has torn apart in our communities, including among this one,

112
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 but this is something this year that has really served to make things better.

113
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 For you see, they, their parents, and their grandparents had gained a vertical perspective on life,

114
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 and it made all the difference for them in finding hope.

115
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Do you know Christ's command to make disciples really flows from this psalm in chapter 2?

116
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 And fulfilling the great commission to go and make disciples of all nations

117
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
 honors God's promise to Abraham to bless all the nations on earth through him.

118
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 How about you?

119
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
 Are you living in the horizontal spaces, fretting about life, causing you anger,

120
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 maybe a sense of futility or despair?

121
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 Maybe you're even plotting with others, hoping for a better days ahead.

122
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 Are you ready to look up instead of looking around you?

123
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 God is large and he's in charge, and he's given his son to rule so that we might come to trust him.

124
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 He wants us to go to a place of peace and his shalom, where all things are right under his rulership.

125
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 In his presence is fullness of joy, and all who take refuge in him will see beyond what is around them to what is over them.

126
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 The Bible says a great cloud of witnesses went before us,

127
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 and we also find in Scripture a mighty army of angels surrounds us at God's beckoning call.

128
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 I invite you to gain a new perspective on life today and find God's peace for your weary souls.

129
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:34,000
 So let me just ask you a couple of questions here as we wrap up.

130
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,000
 Are you ready to let go and let God fight your battles for you?

131
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 Are you willing to live life with victory and hope in his kingdom?

132
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:51,000
 Would you raise your white flag now and surrender your life to him,

133
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 confessing your need for Jesus to reign in your life?

134
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 These, I believe, help us to find hope in these days.

135
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 Please look up instead of just looking with what's around you.

136
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 God has so much more for you if you'll only look up.

137
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Let me pray with you.

138
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,000
 Father in heaven, thank you so much for these that are gathered here today and these that are watching.

139
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 I pray, Lord God, that your words would speak with power here.

140
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 Thank you, God, for the dozens of intercessors that I know are praying right now for what I'm sharing here today.

141
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 I pray, God, that you would help those who hear it to see what you are saying to them

142
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 and to take action to surrender and to look to you

143
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 and not to fret about what they see happening with the nations around them.

144
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 Help them to see what's above and to see what's beyond this world

145
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 and to trust in it, to trust in its ruler, the true ruler that God has put over all things, King Jesus.

146
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 And we pray this now in the name of Jesus. Amen.

147
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:03,000
