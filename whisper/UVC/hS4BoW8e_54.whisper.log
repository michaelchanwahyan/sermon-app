[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500]  Help me
[00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:13.380]  Sound good
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:14.420]  All right
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.920]  All right
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:15.720]  Thank you very much
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.260]  Mark thank you very much
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.680]  for inviting me back again
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.840]  You know
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.300]  It's been a couple of weeks
[00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.600]  since I was last here
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.920]  And I will probably say
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.180]  After I spoke to you guys
[00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.800]  I have been literally
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.140]  been on the road
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.640]  for the last couple of weeks
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.800]  I think I've been more
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.500]  in hotel rooms
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.500]  and traveling on planes
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000]  than I actually have been at home
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.420]  And so it is good to be back here
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.080]  at least for the next week
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.640]  that I'm off to Seattle this week
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.180]  that I'm back in Texas
[00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.960]  and Los Angeles
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.220]  for the next couple of weeks
[00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.300]  before finally being home again in June
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.640]  We've been starting this series
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.680]  on the book of
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.100]  the first Kings
[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.420]  where we looked at the character Elijah
[00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.560]  Elijah when we first began
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.140]  in first Kings 17 1-7
[00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.560]  We saw that Elijah literally means
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.640]  that our introduction of Elijah was this
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.600]  We know that his name literally means
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.140]  My God is Jehovah
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.140]  DL means My God
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.260]  Jah means Jehovah
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.600]  I is the connecting point
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.720]  My God is Jehovah
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.060]  We knew that Elijah is a Tishbite
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.680]  from Tishbe in Gilead
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.800]  What does that mean
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.560]  Merely that
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.480]  they have no idea where he lives
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.140]  It's somewhere in Gilead
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.020]  and he lives in obscurity
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.440]  And so this guy who comes from a rural town
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.020]  who's kind of rough on the edges
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.640]  as you will see
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.060]  whose name literally means
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.020]  My God is Jehovah
[00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.340]  comes over to King Ahab
[00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340]  And King Ahab is the king of the northern kingdom
[00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.340]  If you guys remember the back story
[00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:56.800]  There is a northern kingdom
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800]  during that period of time
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.720]  and a southern kingdom
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.140]  The southern kingdom is where
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.020]  Jerusalem, Nehemiah, Ezra
[00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.800]  All of those guys take place
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.520]  Elijah takes place in the northern kingdom
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.760]  And in the history of the northern kingdom
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.720]  there are 19 kings who rule
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.560]  And none of them are good
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.800]  All of them are bad
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.520]  King Ahab is the worst of all of the kings
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.940]  And then there's Queen Jezebel, his wife
[00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.020]  who a lot of times
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.020]  when you look at scripture
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.260]  Queens are rarely ever mentioned
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.340]  Here's a king and here's a queen
[00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.100]  But Jezebel is mentioned
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.260]  You know why
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.180]  Because Jezebel will turn out to be the worst
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.560]  of all of the kings
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.380]  including Ahab, including the 18 kings
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.180]  She's this bad
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.220]  Well, Elijah suddenly gets
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.880]  a meeting with the king
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.980]  How a guy from Tishbe
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.420]  gets a meeting with the king
[00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.020]  who comes out of obscurity
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.760]  I don't know
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.480]  but he gets a meeting with the king
[00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.340]  And he says that neither dune nor rain
[00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.920]  except by my word
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.560]  And he says this in verse 2
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.760]  As the Lord the God of Israel lives
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.100]  before whom I stand
[00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.220]  That becomes the theme of Elijah's life
[00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.060]  That becomes the theme of this particular passage
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.600]  That's Elijah's motivation
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.300]  before whom I stand
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.460]  That's why he does the things that he does
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.840]  He tells them that there will be
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.800]  neither dune nor rain
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.840]  And just like that
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.340]  right in the middle of the action
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.760]  God takes him away to Cherith
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.340]  And now he lives in Cherith
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.600]  He doesn't just stay there
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.840]  He lives there
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.420]  And he's fed by ravens
[00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:35.420]  And he's staying there
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.140]  until the brook suddenly dries up
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.460]  And suddenly in the last time that was here
[00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.720]  which will eventually lead us
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.880]  to what we're talking about today
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.220]  The word of the Lord came to him
[00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.100]  and says arise go to Zarephath
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.800]  So you've been to Cherith
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.220]  And now you're going to Zarephath
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.800]  which belongs to Sidon
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.080]  and dwell there
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.460]  Behold I've commanded
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.460]  a widow there to feed you
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:00.680]  All right so God you want me to
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.260]  When I go against Ahab
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.180]  You want me to go to Cherith
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:06.720]  I went to Cherith
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.340]  It's nice
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.800]  I know you're protecting me
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.840]  Ravens fed me
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.040]  Brook fed me
[00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.640]  So now I'm happy
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.040]  Now you want me to go to Zarephath
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.340]  Zarephath literally is a hundred miles
[00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:20.920]  You want me to walk a hundred miles
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.840]  Do you not realize
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.880]  that Ahab is coming after me
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.640]  Do you not realize my life is in danger
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.720]  Yes
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.500]  And by the way
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.340]  which I never told you this
[00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.920]  Because I found out
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.840]  Right before
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.500]  Right after I came and spoke
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.140]  Zarephath is the birth town
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.680]  In the hometown of Queen Jezebel
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.420]  So you want me to walk a hundred miles
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.140]  Be exposed to danger
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:49.140]  And you want me to go to Jezebel's hometown
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.420]  Yes
[00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:51.340]  And someone's going to be there
[00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.340]  to take care of you
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.540]  Great
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:54.800]  He walks a hundred miles
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.180]  He risks the danger
[00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.800]  And there he has seen a widow
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:02.880]  Who when he meets in verse 12 says
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.220]  As the Lord your God lives
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:05.220]  Here's what she says to him
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:06.720]  He meets a widow
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.540]  As the Lord your God lives
[00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.960]  She's not even of the faith
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.720]  She doesn't even belong in the faith
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.680]  Your God
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.040]  I have nothing baked
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.340]  I only have a small handful of flour
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:20.720]  And a little oil
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.720]  And a jug
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.300]  So I have a little baked
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.300]  I have a little flour
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.500]  I have a little oil
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.840]  Really
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.580]  And now I am gathering a couple of sticks
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.840]  That I may go and prepare it
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:32.800]  For myself and my son
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.040]  That we may eat it and die
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.920]  Lord
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.920]  That's what you're sending me to
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.460]  You made me walk a hundred miles
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.420]  To the birthplace of the Queen Jezebel
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.260]  Who is the worst of everyone
[00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.640]  To meet a widow
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.180]  Who has no flour
[00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:51.920]  Little oil
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.760]  And she thinks she's about to die
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.680]  Yes
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:56.840]  And as you remembered
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:57.760]  For those who are here
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.760]  For those who are not here
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.720]  Quickly we talked about three things
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.640]  Three things that you need to know
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.220]  And two things that you need to overcome
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.380]  Number one
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.460]  The Lord sees you
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.960]  The Lord sees Elijah
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.060]  The Lord knows where Elijah is
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.520]  He knows that he's been in Tishb
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.460]  He knows that he went to see Ahab
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.220]  He knows that he was a chariotee
[00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:21.140]  He knows that he's in Zarephath
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.520]  The Lord sees you
[00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.640]  Number two
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.920]  The Lord knows where you need to go
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:30.680]  The Lord knows where you need to go
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:33.640]  You need to go to Zarephath
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.880]  You just need to go
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.420]  It reminds us of Joshua chapter three, right?
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:40.640]  It's after forty years in the wilderness
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:42.220]  To roam around the wilderness
[00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.920]  One day the Lord says to Joshua
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:47.420]  Tell everyone to pack up
[00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:48.260]  After forty years
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.880]  Pack up
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.560]  We're going to cross the Jordan River
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.380]  But follow me
[00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.880]  I love this verse
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:59.180]  Follow the ark of the covenant
[00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.920]  Because you have never been there before
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.180]  And you don't know where to go
[00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:07.100]  Follow the ark of the covenant
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.060]  Because you don't know where to go
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:14.140]  Because you have never, ever been there before
[00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:17.340]  Not only does the Lord see you
[00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:21.260]  The Lord knows where you need to go
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.220]  But the Lord knows what you need
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:29.880]  Now it may not be what we think we need
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:35.060]  It may not be our expectations of what we need
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:37.760]  But the Lord knows what we need
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:40.720]  He encounters a widow
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:44.100]  Doesn't have a lot but just enough
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.100]  He encounters a widow
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.180]  And there's two things
[00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:48.060]  That you need to overcome
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:49.060]  You're going to have to overcome
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:52.480]  First impressions or expectations
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.300]  That when we think that
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.520]  When we follow the Lord
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:55.760]  There's all these expectations
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.720]  Of what God should provide for us
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:58.760]  If we're faithful
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.060]  If we're faithful to you
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.800]  Here's what I expect out of you
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.640]  And we have these expectations
[00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:05.180]  And when these expectations
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:06.680]  Don't come through
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.480]  We get a little frustrated
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:12.680]  We get a little annoyed at God
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.600]  And we soon lose trust in God
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.060]  So you have to overcome
[00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.020]  These first impressions
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.600]  This widow and these expectations
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:24.140]  And trust that God
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.600]  Will open those doors as you see fit
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:28.480]  Mark mentioned that
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.720]  Some of you guys are graduating
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.980]  I was just talking with Rachel
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:33.420]  As she's graduating as well too
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.220]  All your life from first grade to second grade
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.520]  From third to fourth
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.880]  From seventh to eighth
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:40.880]  From eighth to freshman year
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.520]  Then from that point you go to college
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:44.180]  You know where you need to go
[00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:46.680]  Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.720]  Upon the graduation from college
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.140]  It will be the first time
[00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:52.840]  College graduates look at their life and say
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.420]  There are five roads I could take
[00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:58.800]  There are multiple job offers
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:02.000]  There are master programs that I could take
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.420]  I don't know where to go
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.260]  And we think that if we take one passage
[00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:10.600]  If we think that's what God is calling us to do
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.000]  Everything will be okay
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:13.840]  And God will provide
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.680]  It may not happen
[00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:16.960]  So you have to overcome
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.100]  First impressions or expectations
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:20.840]  And then you're gonna have to overcome
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.000]  Physical impossibilities
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.300]  He, Elijah, had to overcome
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:28.600]  Physical impossibilities
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.600]  He had to overcome the very fact
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.300]  That this particular widow
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.260]  Didn't have very much
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.680]  But then he says to her
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.420]  Which I love and which a lot of times
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.060]  We actually didn't have enough time to spend on
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.880]  Because so today I want to spend time
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.180]  On this one verse
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.300]  Really unpack it
[00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.300]  And see what it means to me
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:52.640]  He says to her
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.800]  Go and do
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.420]  Go and do
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:57.220]  You're gonna have
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:57.960]  And here's a
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.100]  I'm losing it
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:01.300]  Oh Lord, here we go
[00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:02.420]  Here we go
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:03.880]  Elijah says to her
[00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:05.760]  Do not fear
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.800]  Go and do as you have said
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:10.960]  Even though you have seen
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.560]  All of these impossibilities
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:13.840]  Even though you have seen
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:14.960]  All these expectations
[00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:17.140]  That are out the window
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.600]  He says to the widow
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:21.460]  Go and do
[00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.920]  And that's a calling for us
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.600]  As Christ followers
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.260]  For us to go and do
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.720]  Three things that we're gonna talk about today
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:31.180]  What does it mean for us
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.960]  As we look at this particular phrase
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.460]  For us as Christ followers
[00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.880]  To go and do
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:41.140]  What does it mean for us not to go and do
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:44.680]  What does that mean for us not to go and do
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.800]  What do we do
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.760]  As Christ followers
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:49.880]  Three things we're gonna talk about
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:54.180]  What does it mean for us to go and do
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.680]  Number two, what does it mean not to go and do
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:02.880]  And what does it mean for us to actually do
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.640]  Those three things
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.840]  I told you the last three weeks
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.560]  I have literally been on the road
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.100]  Went to Minnesota for spring break
[00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:11.560]  With the family
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.060]  Went over to Romania
[00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:16.680]  To the city of Bucharest and Cluj
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:17.340]  Then from that point
[00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.640]  I went over to Prague
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.260]  Over the Czech Republic
[00:11:20.260 --> 00:11:22.380]  And I ended up over in Orlando
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:23.840]  With a bunch of our cohort
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.960]  From around the different worlds
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:27.420]  When I went to Romania
[00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:28.720]  I arrived in Bucharest
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.340]  The capital city of Romania
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.640]  On Orthodox Easter
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:35.680]  Where the city was completely empty
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.920]  It was completely deserted
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:40.200]  Why
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:43.040]  Because it is a huge national holiday
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.700]  Did you know in Romania
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.500]  90% of all the people
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:50.700]  Who live in the country of Romania
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:53.160]  Will say they're Christians
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.740]  Out of that 90%, 80% of them
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:59.540]  Are Orthodox Christians
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.500]  Romania as a country
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.960]  Is going through a huge rebuild
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:05.700]  Like when I stepped foot in Romania
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.500]  I've never been to Romania before
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:09.000]  Some of you guys
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  Who have probably studied
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.500]  Eastern European history
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:12.500]  That's the only time
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.500]  I've ever heard about Romania
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:19.500]  It was embedded in communist regime
[00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.500]  All the way to 1989
[00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:25.500]  It was ruled by this general secretary
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:28.500]  By the name of Nikolai Ceaușescu
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:32.500]  And he ruled it with an iron hand
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.500]  And after his overthrow of the regime in 1989
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.500]  Everything started rebuilding
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.500]  But it got to a point
[00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:41.500]  If you know anything about
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:42.500]  What was going on in Romania
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:44.500]  This guy Nikolai Ceaușescu
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.500]  Was so obsessed
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:49.500]  About creating his own kingdom
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.500]  He ignored the basic necessities
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.500]  Of the people there
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.500]  He ignored the health of the country
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.500]  He ignored the needs
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.500]  Until it got to be so much
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.500]  They soon overthrew him
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:03.500]  On one of those days
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.500]  We visited his former palace
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.500]  It is now the parliament
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:08.500]  For where the congress
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.500]  And the senate takes place
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.500]  When you go into this former palace
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:15.500]  It is humongous
[00:13:15.500 --> 00:13:17.500]  We walked around
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:19.500]  It took me 25 minutes
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:22.500]  Just to walk around the outer perimeter
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:24.500]  Because it's Orthodox Easter
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:25.500]  So there's no security guard
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.500]  I'm sitting there
[00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:27.500]  Why is there no security guard
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:28.500]  Around the parliament
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:29.500]  I had no idea
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:30.500]  And so you had to walk all the way
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.500]  And we kept getting lost
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.500]  We finally ended up in this place
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.500]  To take a tour of this place
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.500]  It is so big
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.500]  It is the second biggest
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:39.500]  Government building
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.500]  Next to the pentagon
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.500]  So of all the different
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:43.500]  Government buildings
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:44.500]  Around the world
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.500]  This palace was the second biggest
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.500]  They told us that it takes
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:52.500]  $500,000 a month
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:53.500]  To power this thing up
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.500]  To pay for all the utilities
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.500]  And you know what was ironic
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:59.500]  It was empty
[00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:03.500]  75% of the building
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.500]  Is completely empty
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.500]  It was deserted
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:07.500]  And they said unless
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:09.500]  Congress and Senate meets
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.500]  It's just empty all the time
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.500]  Do you know any groups
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.500]  Who would like to rent this room
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.500]  It just was crazy
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.500]  And here's the one thing
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:17.500]  That's happening in Romania
[00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:18.500]  We went to Bucharest
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.500]  And later on we went to Cluj
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.500]  More on Cluj in a little bit
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.500]  If there's 90% of people in Romania
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.500]  Who says they're Christians
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:27.500]  Why do they have such an issue
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:30.500]  With corruption in Romania
[00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:32.500]  Because a lot of times
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.500]  Back in the days of the communist regime
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.500]  Many people had to trust God
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.500]  For basic necessities
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.500]  They had to trust that God would provide
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.500]  They couldn't trust that
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:44.500]  The government would provide
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.500]  Because the government
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.500]  Was taking all their money
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.500]  So a lot of times
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:49.500]  Many of the older baby boomers
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.500]  Lived in this regime
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.500]  Where their basic needs were not met
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:14:58.500]  When communists fell in 1989
[00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:00.500]  Democracy came
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.500]  You started bringing a whole new generation
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.500]  Who did not live in that regime
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.500]  So now you know what happened
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:11.500]  They started attending church
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:15.500]  But now because of those opportunities
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:19.500]  They didn't need to depend on God anymore
[00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:21.500]  They don't need church anymore
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:22.500]  I'll go on Sundays
[00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.500]  Because that's what is expected
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:25.500]  I've always lived
[00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.500]  I could control my own destiny
[00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:31.500]  And did they have mentors
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.500]  To mentor them as they were growing up
[00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:34.500]  No
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.500]  Because this is the first generation of Christians
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:42.500]  Who now are living in a democratic society
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500]  That is different from their parents
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.500]  Their parents couldn't be the mentors
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.500]  Because they couldn't understand it
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.500]  So suddenly you have all these Christians
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.500]  In Romania trying to figure out
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:57.500]  What it means to integrate their faith
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:15:59.500]  We then went over to Cluj
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.500]  Cluj is the second biggest city in Romania
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.500]  Cluj was filled with entrepreneurs
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.500]  Was filled with university setting
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.500]  People with new ideas
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:11.500]  Wanting to change their city
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.500]  But at the same time
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.500]  Many of the older folks
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:17.500]  There's a huge divide between the church
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:18.500]  And the business leaders
[00:16:18.500 --> 00:16:20.500]  As they're trying to figure out
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.500]  So a lot of times you have these Christians
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.500]  Who are living in Romania
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.500]  Trying to figure out how
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.500]  And what it means to integrate their faith
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.500]  From Romania I went over to Prague
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.500]  And in Prague we gathered
[00:16:31.500 --> 00:16:32.500]  This is my second year there
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.500]  We gathered all the wealthiest
[00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:37.500]  European Christians from all of Europe
[00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:39.500]  Who gathered in one place
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.500]  To talk about collaboration
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.500]  Because the perception is
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.500]  The church is dying in Europe
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:46.500]  But that's not so
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.500]  There's so much rebuilding in Europe going on
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.500]  And all these wealthy people
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.500]  Marketplace leaders are all gathered together
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.500]  To come and say
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:57.500]  How do we pull all of our money together
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.500]  To engage and see and collaborate
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.500]  That's the key thing
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.500]  Collaborate in what was Europe
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:06.500]  So from that point on to Prague and to Europe
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:08.500]  And two more stories
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.500]  And it ties into what we're talking about
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.500]  We then get to Orlando
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:13.500]  And there we gathered
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.500]  All of our young marketplace leaders
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.500]  From Hong Kong, from Indonesia, from Malaysia
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.500]  All of that
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:20.500]  And we have a bunch of different speakers
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.500]  We have one speaker
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:24.500]  Who said that who is on his way
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:26.500]  To minister to business leaders
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.500]  And CEOs in Hong Kong
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:30.500]  He was going to meet with the CEO of
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.500]  The President of Pakistan
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.500]  Oh by the way
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.500]  He was the former president
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.500]  Of a major organization
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.500]  A Christian organization
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:43.500]  A 30 million dollar organization
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.500]  Whose leader and founder
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:48.500]  Fell from grace
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.500]  But fell from grace in a very powerful way
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.500]  Because of sexual sin
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:54.500]  And this individual
[00:17:54.500 --> 00:17:55.500]  Who was the president
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.500]  Of this major organization
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.500]  Shared about how the entire ministry
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.500]  Completely fell and disintegrated
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:06.500]  Because of the sin of one person
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.500]  We heard the pain
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.500]  As he learned how to rebuild his life
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:14.500]  We also heard the story of Larry Smith
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:17.500]  Larry Smith is the CEO of Tokyo Electron
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.500]  He shared his story
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.500]  That when his kids graduated from college
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.500]  He and his wife sold everything they had
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.500]  They sold their mansion
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:29.500]  And they moved to a 300 square foot home
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:31.500]  In a tiny town
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.500]  Full of drug addicts
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.500]  Full of homeless people
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.500]  All of that
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:38.500]  So he could minister to them
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.500]  And learn how to build bridges with them
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:43.500]  Why did I tell you all these different stories
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.500]  Because each one of those individuals
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.500]  Whether you're here or listening today
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.500]  Are doing what God has called them to do
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:55.500]  Has continued to be so molded
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:59.500]  And so focused in their calling
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.500]  They are walking each day to make a choice
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:04.500]  Because they realize they are stewards
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:06.500]  Of what God has given them
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:07.500]  One speaker said this
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.500]  I love what he said
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.500]  I wrote it down
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.500]  That when you and I are born
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:16.500]  You look like your parents
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:19.500]  But when you die
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:22.500]  You look like your decisions
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:23.500]  When you and I are born
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.500]  You look like your parents
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.500]  But when you die
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.500]  You look like your decisions
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:33.500]  What are the decisions
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.500]  That you and I need to make
[00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:39.500]  To continue to serve and honor the Lord
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.500]  In everything that we do
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.500]  What does it mean for us to go and do
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:45.500]  Acts 1A tells us
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:48.500]  But you will receive power
[00:19:48.500 --> 00:19:51.500]  When the Holy Spirit has come upon you
[00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:53.500]  And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:55.500]  And in all Judea and Samaria
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.500]  And to the ends of the earth
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:00.500]  For the longest time when I read this
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.500]  I always thought it was just the Great Commission
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.500]  We always knew it was the Great Commission
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:05.500]  This is where God wants you to be
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:06.500]  Where's your Samaria
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.500]  Where's your Judea
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.500]  Where's your all of these different things
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.500]  Where's the end of the earth
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.500]  I understood it as the Great Commission
[00:20:12.500 --> 00:20:14.500]  We all see it as the Great Commission
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.500]  One pastor one time says to me
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:17.500]  Tommy, have you ever thought
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.500]  That besides this being a Great Commission
[00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.500]  How would your perspective change
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.500]  If you look at Acts 1A
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:30.500]  Not just as a commission
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.500]  But as a declaration
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.500]  Because when you look upon it
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:39.500]  As a declaration also
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.500]  It changes your perspective
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:45.500]  It creates urgency in what you need to do
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.500]  What do I mean
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:49.500]  It says that when you will receive power
[00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.500]  You're definitely going to receive power
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:54.500]  When the Holy Spirit has come upon you
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.500]  You will be my witnesses
[00:20:56.500 --> 00:20:58.500]  It's not a choice
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.500]  You're going to be my witnesses in Jerusalem
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.500]  You're going to be my witnesses in Judea
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.500]  You're going to be my witnesses in Samaria
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.500]  Samaria Jews don't go to Samaria
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:10.500]  You will be my witnesses
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.500]  In places that you don't want to be
[00:21:13.500 --> 00:21:16.500]  And you will be my witnesses
[00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:19.500]  To the end of the earth
[00:21:19.500 --> 00:21:23.500]  When we see it as just a declaration
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.500]  There is no choice
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.500]  There is an urgency for what we must do
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:31.500]  It changes our perspective
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:33.500]  It allows us to look at our life
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:36.500]  And what we're doing right now
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:38.500]  And realize the call of the Great Commission
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:40.500]  This declaration that Jesus is coming
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:44.500]  Means that the Holy Spirit is in each one of us
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.500]  And we are called to make a difference in our work
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:52.500]  In our family, in our community, in our church
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:56.500]  Not only from the outside, but from the inside
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:57.500]  It's how we live
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.500]  It's how we treat people
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:02.500]  It's how we think, all of it
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:03.500]  Because we are witnesses
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.500]  Because the Holy Spirit is upon us
[00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:10.500]  That's what we're supposed to be doing
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:12.500]  It means that we go into places
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:16.500]  Encounter people that aren't Chinese
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.500]  It means that we go to people
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.500]  Encounter people that are different than us
[00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.500]  In their skin color, in their beliefs
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.500]  In their sexual identity
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:29.500]  We engage all those issues
[00:22:29.500 --> 00:22:31.500]  Because we're Christ followers
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.500]  That's what it means to go and do
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.500]  That's what it means to be witnesses
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.500]  In everything that we do
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.500]  To go to places
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:44.500]  That are different than us
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:48.500]  My former boss
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.500]  The president of a major seminary
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:52.500]  Once said to me, "Tai
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:54.500]  All we need to do
[00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.500]  Is to teach people to study the Bible
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:58.500]  That's all you need to do
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.500]  That's it"
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:04.500]  And I once had to say to this guy, "I disagree with you"
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:05.500]  And I'd love to hear your thoughts later on
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.500]  I disagree with you
[00:23:07.500 --> 00:23:11.500]  Helping people studying the Bible is very key
[00:23:11.500 --> 00:23:12.500]  But I said to him, "A lot of times
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.500]  You have to understand this
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:18.500]  When I see you, you are a white Caucasian man
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:20.500]  President of a seminary
[00:23:20.500 --> 00:23:23.500]  Where you earn mid-six-figure salaries
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.500]  When you first started in a church
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:27.500]  You came into a big church
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:30.500]  Also earned six-digit salaries
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.500]  When you left the seminary and went to a church
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:35.500]  Another church hired you
[00:23:35.500 --> 00:23:38.500]  And gave you a big six-digit salary
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.500]  You never had to worry
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.500]  About racial discrimination
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:45.500]  You never had to worry about money
[00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:46.500]  You never had to worry about
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:48.500]  Any of those different things
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.500]  But some of us do
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.500]  Some of us have to deal
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:54.500]  Some of the issues in culture
[00:23:54.500 --> 00:23:55.500]  We're going to have to deal
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:57.500]  With racial discrimination
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.500]  We're going to have to deal with money
[00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:01.500]  And so a lot of times
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.500]  And for all of us
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:03.500]  As Christ followers
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.500]  Dealing with studying the Bible is great
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.500]  It's very great
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:10.500]  But we as Christians
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.500]  Have to learn how to engage the culture
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.500]  We have to learn to address the culture
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.500]  We have to learn to be
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:20.500]  What it means to really be able to be
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:23.500]  Engaging with the Christ-filled mind
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.500]  That's what it means to take the gospel
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.500]  To all the ends of the earth
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.500]  What does it not mean
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.500]  Here's what it does not mean
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:33.500]  It does not mean that you live
[00:24:33.500 --> 00:24:36.500]  Like a nomad like John the Baptist
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:38.500]  And be in need and give up everything
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.500]  Sometimes I think we as Christians
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:41.500]  Say, "I'm not dealing with this
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.500]  "Because it means that I live this poor life
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:45.500]  And it's like, no, it doesn't
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:47.500]  For some people, they've chosen to do it
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:48.500]  But for us as Christ followers
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:52.500]  It does not mean that we give up everything
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:54.500]  Like John the Baptist
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:56.500]  But here's what it does mean
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.500]  It means that you do not get to
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:05.500]  Pick and choose when to follow Jesus
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.500]  It does not mean that you get to
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:12.500]  Pick and choose when to follow Jesus
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.500]  We pick and choose
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:14.500]  When we pick and choose
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.500]  When to follow Jesus
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:21.500]  It doesn't lead to transformation
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:24.500]  That means that every single day
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.500]  When you and I wake up
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.500]  Our mentality is
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.500]  We are a steward of grace
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:34.500]  We are a steward of the grace
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:37.500]  That God has given us
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:40.500]  We are a steward of God's will in our lives
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.500]  And how do we use those talents and strengths
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.500]  To continue to make a difference
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.500]  To live a life that glorifies Him
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:51.500]  In every single way
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:53.500]  Luke 14, 26 tells us
[00:25:53.500 --> 00:25:55.500]  If anyone comes to me
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:59.500]  And does not hate his own father and mother
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.500]  And wife and children
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:02.500]  And brothers and sisters
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.500]  Yes, and even his own life
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.500]  He cannot be my disciple
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.500]  And as an Asian person
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.500]  A lot of times there's a lot of honor and respect
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.500]  That we have toward our family
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.500]  And when we read this, we say
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:20.500]  Whoa, whoa, whoa, you want me to hate my mom and dad
[00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:23.500]  That's not very nice
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.500]  What it means is that your dedication
[00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:29.500]  Your focus, your frame of mind
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:31.500]  Your focus of mind
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:35.500]  Is so strong every single day
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.500]  That when it is compared to your relation
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.500]  With anything else
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.500]  You are hating your mother
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:46.500]  You are hating your father, your wife, your children
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:48.500]  Your own brothers
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:51.500]  That's the focus that we need to have
[00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.500]  We don't need to pick and choose
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:56.500]  We don't even get to pick and choose
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.500]  It's our focus every single day
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.500]  Why?
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:03.500]  Because the Holy Spirit is within us
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:06.500]  And when the Holy Spirit is within us
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:09.500]  We are called to go and do
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.500]  When the Holy Spirit is within us
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:14.500]  We go and do to go to Samaria
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:16.500]  We go and do over in Jerusalem
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.500]  We go and do over in all the ends here
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.500]  That's what we're called to go and do
[00:27:22.500 --> 00:27:26.500]  And that means every single day
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:29.500]  We are light on the city of a hill
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.500]  To make a difference in our own lives
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.500]  In the lives of other people
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.500]  But the problem is in Christianity
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.500]  We've created a Christianity
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:44.500]  And I'm not sure for those who are watching
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.500]  We've created a Christianity
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:48.500]  Where no one wants to be part of us
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.500]  We've created a Christianity
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:52.500]  Where people are sick and tired of us
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:54.500]  We've gotten too cute
[00:27:54.500 --> 00:27:56.500]  Where we sit there and look at pastors
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.500]  These days who love their platforms
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.500]  I was literally on Facebook the other day
[00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.500]  And I came across these ads on
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.500]  How do you help your pastors in church
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:08.500]  Snippet their sermons
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:10.500]  And create instant reels
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.500]  And create their platform
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.500]  We've gotten to a point where we're too cute
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.500]  That we love to be influencers
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.500]  And we want to create these platforms
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.500]  We've gotten too cute
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500]  In the sense that a lot of times
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:22.500]  Here in the US
[00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:25.500]  We've started fighting over dumb things
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.500]  We want to know who's right
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.500]  On the political spectrum
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:31.500]  We want to know who we're supporting
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.500]  And within the church
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.500]  That has completely divided us
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.500]  We want to know that we're right
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:37.500]  And you better believe
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.500]  There's no longer dialogue
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:41.500]  And conversations and arguments
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.500]  All of these things
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.500]  Because everybody wants to be right
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:47.500]  And the rest of the world
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.500]  Has been watching us
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.500]  And they are looking at us and say
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:54.500]  If that's the way the church is
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.500]  If that is the people
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:57.500]  And the leaders that we encounter
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.500]  If that is the hypocrisy that we see
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:02.500]  If that is what we're dealing with
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:04.500]  With pastors who want to create their platform
[00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:05.500]  With people using each other
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.500]  With people misspending money
[00:29:07.500 --> 00:29:08.500]  With people fighting all the time
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:10.500]  Then why in the world
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:13.500]  Do I want to be part of that church
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.500]  Because as Christ followers
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.500]  We do not have a singularity of mind
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.500]  To know that every single day
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.500]  We're going to deal with different people
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:23.500]  And every single day
[00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.500]  Through the power of the Holy Spirit
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.500]  We are called to take his gospel
[00:29:30.500 --> 00:29:32.500]  To every part
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.500]  And to encounter people
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:34.500]  Who are different to us
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.500]  That has different opinions
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:38.500]  And how do you show God
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.500]  In a loving way
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.500]  That's what we do
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.500]  So what do we do
[00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.500]  Couple of things as we wrap up
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:48.500]  Couple of things
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.500]  How has God designed you
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.500]  How has he gifted you
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.500]  What are the skills that he has given you
[00:29:55.500 --> 00:29:58.500]  We're not all called to do the same thing
[00:29:58.500 --> 00:30:00.500]  We're all called to have the same focus
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:03.500]  But we're not called to have to do the same thing
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.500]  Peter was not sent to the nations
[00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:07.500]  Paul was sent to the nations
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:08.500]  But did Peter have to learn
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:09.500]  The importance of what it meant
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:11.500]  To reach out to Gentiles
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:12.500]  He did
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:15.500]  Joseph was called to be a city official
[00:30:15.500 --> 00:30:17.500]  To be the chief of staff
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:18.500]  To really be able to nurture
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:19.500]  During that period of time
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:22.500]  Nehemiah was called to rebuild
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.500]  The walls of Jerusalem
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:25.500]  At a later age
[00:30:25.500 --> 00:30:26.500]  Before that he was called to be
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:29.500]  A faithful cupbearer to the king
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:31.500]  Zacchaeus of all of those guys
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.500]  Was not like Matthew
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.500]  Called to leave his role as a tax collector
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.500]  And follow Jesus
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.500]  And be one of his disciples
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:41.500]  He was called to be a chief tax collector
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:43.500]  And stay at his job
[00:30:43.500 --> 00:30:46.500]  And be faithful at his job
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:48.500]  What do we do
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:50.500]  It comes down to how God has created you
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:52.500]  And designed you to be
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:54.500]  It comes down to how God has gifted you
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:57.500]  And the passions that he has given in your heart
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:59.500]  We're all called to take the gospel
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.500]  To the ends of the earth
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:01.500]  We are not called to pick and choose
[00:31:01.500 --> 00:31:03.500]  When we follow God
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:04.500]  But how that looks like
[00:31:04.500 --> 00:31:06.500]  Is going to be different
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:09.500]  For each person
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.500]  And it's going to involve your time
[00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:14.500]  It's going to involve your outlook
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.500]  It's going to involve your motivation
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.500]  And it's going to involve your money
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:22.500]  It's going to involve all of those things
[00:31:22.500 --> 00:31:25.500]  As we seek to follow God
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.500]  In all that we do
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:28.500]  That's really what we're called
[00:31:28.500 --> 00:31:30.500]  When Elijah says to the widow
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.500]  Go and do
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.500]  God says the same thing for you
[00:31:37.500 --> 00:31:40.500]  Go and do
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.500]  Go and do
[00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:43.500]  Because if our motivation
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.500]  Is the grace of the cross
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:50.500]  What does it mean for you to go and do
[00:31:50.500 --> 00:31:53.500]  What does it mean for you to go and do in your work
[00:31:53.500 --> 00:31:56.500]  What does it mean to go and do in your family
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.500]  What does it mean to go and do
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:32:02.500]  To engage with people who are different than you
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.500]  We're called to go and do
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:08.500]  We're called to engage with people who are different
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.500]  Who think differently
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:13.500]  Who act differently than we are
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.500]  That's what we're called to do
[00:32:15.500 --> 00:32:16.500]  How that looks
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:22.500]  Is going to be different for each person
[00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:26.500]  Father, thank you for the words of Elijah
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.500]  You call us to go and do
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.500]  Where do we go and do
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:34.500]  How do we go and do
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.500]  We know one thing, Lord
[00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:41.500]  We don't get to pick and choose when we go and do
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:44.500]  But may we be aware of open doors
[00:32:44.500 --> 00:32:46.500]  And open opportunities
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:50.500]  May we be aware of how this affects all of our life
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.500]  Both our inner character and our outer lives
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.500]  How it affects our money, our calling
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:57.500]  Our decisions that we make
[00:32:57.500 --> 00:33:00.500]  Our motivation, Lord
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:03.500]  Help us to understand what that go and do means
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.500]  Help us as we reflect upon that phrase
[00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.500]  Wrestle with that word, those words
[00:33:09.500 --> 00:33:12.500]  And help us to see you in the midst of it
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.500]  Christ, we pray, amen
