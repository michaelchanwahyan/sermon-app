[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   - Alright, before we turn to scripture,
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.120]   why don't we spend some time to pray together, alright?
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.620]   Why don't we spend some time to pray?
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.960]   And before we pray, I want to ask you a question,
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.560]   you know, in the presence of God.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.920]   Is there anything, something in your heart,
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.340]   in your mind you have to unload?
[00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.940]   Alright, maybe some worries, maybe some issues,
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.880]   maybe some challenges in your life.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.320]   Maybe some anger, some depression,
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.960]   some of the unhappy feelings.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.960]   God can take it, you know?
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.960]   And this is the best moment we can come before God, alright?
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:40.040]   Let's spend a minute or two, pray to God.
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:50.520]   Father, we do come before you knowing
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.960]   that you are our loving God.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.960]   And you can take all the garbage in our mind and our heart.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:02.120]   No matter what that is, with the worries that we have,
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.720]   the despair that we sense, or the challenges
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.720]   that we are facing, and we are exhausted,
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.040]   we are just drained.
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.840]   We can come before you knowing
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.620]   that we can cast our burdens to you.
[00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.040]   Thank you for being our loving God.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.960]   Thank you for even taking all this emotions,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.960]   even so-called negative emotions.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.040]   You can take it.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.820]   And thank you for being there to listen to us,
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.200]   to being with us.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.080]   Thank you for the fact that you are leading our church,
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.920]   leading our lives, and we come before you to know that,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.520]   to acknowledge that you are our strength.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.600]   Grant us the strength that we need.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.160]   For those who are studying, for those who are coming
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:55.680]   to the end of the semester, with final exams
[00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.520]   and all the assignments, and I pray that you will grant
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.320]   each and every one of us the wisdom, the strength,
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.320]   the discipline to go on, knowing that your grace
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.400]   is always sufficient.
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.960]   For those who are struggling with family matters
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.120]   and the demands from our work,
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.560]   we do know that you are our rock,
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.720]   and we can depend on you, we can rely on you.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.600]   And that's why we come to worship you.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.880]   That's why we come to give thanks to you,
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.920]   to count the blessing that you are still providing for us.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.480]   And thank you very much for being our father,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.120]   being our God.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.280]   And most of all, thank you for the love and salvation
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.720]   that we have in Christ Jesus, that we are your people.
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.280]   We are your sons and daughters.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.980]   Thank you, in Christ name we pray.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.320]   Now we come to our mini series
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.760]   on the pagan kings in the Bible.
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.520]   And last week, we talked about one of the pagan kings,
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.400]   who is Cyrus the Great.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.320]   Cyrus the Great is a Persian king.
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.520]   And today we're going to chapter five
[00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.200]   of the book of Daniel, all right?
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.480]   If you have your phone and you have your Bible,
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   please turn with me to chapter five of Daniel.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.760]   If you can find the book of Daniel,
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.160]   it is in the Old Testament,
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.600]   especially in the prophetical books,
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.560]   one of the prophetical books, all right?
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.120]   So we're gonna talk about this king,
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.760]   it's called Belsasha.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.960]   Let's go back to this timeline.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.960]   I kind of zoom into this timeline we share from last week.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.320]   And we talk about Cyrus.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.320]   You can see Cyrus on here, right in the middle,
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.880]   right at the bottom.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.880]   Cyrus, who became the emperor of the Persian kingdom.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.280]   And at the same time, that was the last,
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.320]   very last period of the Babylonian kingdom,
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.320]   the Babylonian empire from 626 to 539.
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:08.360]   And you see on top, there's a bar.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:10.800]   There were two kings, right?
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.200]   Nebuchadnezzar and Belsasha.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.080]   And I talked to you about how we going to approach
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.240]   studying the figures in the Bible,
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:20.640]   especially the pagan kings.
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.960]   First of all, we have to profile them, right?
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.280]   We have to profile them from scriptures
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.960]   or from sources outside of the Bible.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.360]   And then we come to the Bible,
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.720]   and let's see what the Bible says about pagan kings,
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.840]   about this or this king.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.440]   So in the end of Babylonian empire,
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.520]   there were two kings ruling the empire.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:45.320]   The top one is Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.760]   and the guy below him is his eldest son,
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.240]   his firstborn son, Belsasha,
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.320]   which is mentioned in the book of Daniel chapter five.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:56.480]   And this is a funny story,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.920]   and I want to go through this story with you.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:01.160]   But you need to understand
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.240]   at the end of the Babylonian empire,
[00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.240]   when the power of Babylon is declining
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.760]   and the empire is coming to a crumbling
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.560]   and collapsing, and the last king is Belsasha.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   Belsasha is the co-region of his father, Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:30.080]   And we are coming to the year 539, 539.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.480]   And some of the background here,
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.160]   when Nebuchadnezzar became king, it was year 555.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.400]   And for some reason, he ruled the Babylonian kingdom
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.520]   for a few years, and then he left the capital.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.280]   And then he moved to an oasis in northern Arabia
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.600]   for 10 years.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.880]   And he's kind of a very strange character,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.200]   even for historians,
[00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.400]   is trying to understand why he moved away from the capital.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.840]   And then when he moved away from the capital,
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.760]   he gave his kingship and trusted kingship
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.600]   to his son, Belsasha.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.500]   So that's why we have two kings there.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:13.160]   The top guy, number one, is Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:15.680]   And then the second guy is called Belsasha,
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.360]   his firstborn son.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.920]   And practically, Belsasha in the Bible or in history
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.440]   is the last king of Babylonian empire.
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.220]   So that's when we come to chapter five of Daniel.
[00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.380]   And this is a funny story.
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.280]   So I want to go through some of the content of this story
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.980]   and to think about what the Bible or what God sees
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:42.100]   in this king.
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.940]   Chapter five, verse one.
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.060]   King Belsasha gave a great banquet
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:52.060]   for a thousand of his nobles and drank wine with them.
[00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:55.020]   While Belsasha was drinking his wine,
[00:06:55.020 --> 00:07:00.020]   he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver goblets
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.540]   that Nebuchadnezzar, okay, Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.560]   Nebuchadnezzar's father had taken from the temple
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.040]   in Jerusalem so that the king and his nobles
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:14.860]   and his wives and concubines might drink from them.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:15.760]   What do you think?
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.400]   As a big banquet, I don't know if you've been
[00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:21.680]   to a big banquet before.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.320]   The biggest one I've been to is like 100 tables.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.920]   It's huge in a hotel conference room.
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:32.280]   You know, people are so happy and we just drink
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:35.080]   all we want, open bar and all that.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.360]   It's kind of like this situation here.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.780]   Belsasha, chapter five of Daniel.
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.200]   So he gave a great banquet to thousands of his noble
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:46.820]   and all his cabinet and new government officials
[00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:50.200]   are gathered together, his wives and his concubine
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.160]   and everyone is drinking.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.400]   And then, you know, all of a sudden,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.720]   he gave the order to have the vessels
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.360]   that his so-called father or the founder
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.280]   of the Babylonian empire, Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.120]   Oh my God.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.480]   Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:14.680]   And then he captured the temple of Jerusalem.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:15.680]   You remember that?
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.200]   586 BC.
[00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:19.160]   And then he took some of the vessels,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   gold and silver vessels, or maybe the Ark of the Covenant
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.200]   as well, so all the valuables, all the precious things,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.240]   he captured from the temple and he captured them
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.280]   to his capital, Babylon.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.840]   Now, Belsasha came much later.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.560]   He was having a big banquet and then he was so happy,
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:42.680]   I guess, and then he used some of the vessels
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.640]   from the temple of Jerusalem.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:51.200]   So it's a big banquet and then he used some of the vessels,
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:55.080]   you know, cups and plates and instruments
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:00.040]   from the Jerusalem temple to use them to drink wine.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.200]   You see?
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.560]   To drink wine.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:04.440]   Now, a little bit background here.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.600]   Whenever the Bible talks about banquet,
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.600]   it's not just a wedding banquet.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:13.040]   It's not just a happy party together.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:16.080]   It always has religious and political meaning.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.240]   So when the king gathers his cabinet, right here,
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:23.980]   and he make offerings to all the gods.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:27.960]   So when they get together having food and feast together
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.920]   and then drink together, it has political
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:32.640]   and religious reason.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:36.120]   And the reason being, they want to please the gods.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:40.240]   Please the gods of the kingdom.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.960]   Please all the gods and the purpose is to secure
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.920]   the approval of the gods.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:49.120]   It's to secure their blessing,
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.080]   especially for the coming year.
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:55.480]   So usually this kind of banquet, this kind of feasting
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:57.280]   happens in New Year.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:00.560]   In the New Year, they want to secure the approval
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:02.720]   of the gods for the coming year.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   So that's why they gather the temple vessels,
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.840]   not only from Jerusalem, but from other places.
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.520]   Remember Babylon captured, you know,
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:15.840]   pretty much the whole world back then.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:18.720]   And then they destroy some of the temples
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.960]   and they capture their gold and silver vessels
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:26.560]   and brought them to the capital.
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.960]   So this is the scene that, you know,
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.360]   not only the Jerusalem vessels are being used,
[00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:34.320]   all these other gods' temple vessels
[00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:38.160]   are being brought together for them to drink wine.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:42.440]   And what they do is that they will offer sacrifices
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   and libation to the gods for the purpose of,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:51.480]   you know, pleasing the gods so that the gods will bless you.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.960]   So in short, the purpose is to secure
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:00.240]   the approval of the deities, to please them
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:04.800]   so that they will bless his plan and bless his policies
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.700]   for, especially for the coming year.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:12.680]   So in such a banquet, the king would expect the gods
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.760]   to be happy, you know, to rob us of their plans.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:24.520]   So here, this story, the funny thing is,
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.280]   when the king expected the gods to say something,
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.880]   God did show up.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.000]   God did show up.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.840]   And that's the most surprising thing.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.000]   Verse five and following.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:43.080]   And suddenly, the fingers of a human hand appear
[00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.440]   and roll on the plaster of the wall
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:50.400]   near the lampstand in the royal palace.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.320]   And the king watched the hand as it rolled,
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.760]   his face turned pale and he was so frightened
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   and his knees knocked together and his legs gave way.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.320]   Now that's the funny thing.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.640]   You expect gods to say something
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.880]   and then here the true gods show up, all right?
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:16.880]   So this is a story of the origin of the English idiom,
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.520]   writing on the wall, right?
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.640]   And that's where it come from, writing on the wall.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:26.880]   What he saw was there's a hand writing something on the wall
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:30.680]   and it is pretty interesting and also surprising.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.880]   If you've been to like British Museum
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.600]   or there's a very, very good museum in Chicago,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   you know that?
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.640]   It's called Oriental Museum, University of Chicago.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.560]   Anyone been there?
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:45.440]   No?
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.680]   Oh my God.
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.800]   Oh, you've been there, good.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:49.120]   That's great, that's great.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.680]   Yeah, there's only one person here.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.040]   This is the Oriental Museum in University of Chicago
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.480]   is a world-class museum and it's also free.
[00:12:58.480 --> 00:13:00.520]   You know, it takes free donation.
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:04.280]   Someday maybe we should go there for a field trip, all right?
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.240]   There's tons of things you can see.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:11.080]   If you pay attention to the wall reliefs
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:15.680]   in the Assyrian or Babylonian gallery,
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:19.680]   there's no space on the wall.
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:23.160]   It's not like our side drywall.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:27.280]   There's no spaces on the wall you can put something on it
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.280]   because every single inch of the wall
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.760]   is filled with either the king's figure
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:39.760]   or the god's figures or trees and the lion hunt
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:41.320]   and all that stuff.
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.960]   There's no space in the wall
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.480]   and that is the most surprising things.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:47.920]   There's no space in the wall
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.960]   but all of a sudden a human hand show up
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.360]   and trying to write something on the wall.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:57.040]   Now, this is from Daniel five.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.840]   And then once they saw the writings,
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:05.560]   no one can interpret the writings on the wall.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.600]   And you can imagine scenes like this.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.440]   This is the famous painting by,
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:14.880]   in the 17th century,
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.680]   talking about this story.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.800]   When the king look to the wall,
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.600]   all of a sudden there was some writings showing up.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:29.320]   And they're trying to interpret the meaning
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.520]   or the significance of those writings.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:35.000]   And 518, it says,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.880]   Daniel is being called up
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.480]   because he is the only guy in the court,
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   in the empire, who can interpret like this kind of writings.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.840]   What does it mean?
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:52.560]   So he's being called up to the king
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.280]   and Daniel said,
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:58.920]   O king, the most high God gave your father, Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:03.080]   sovereignty and greatness and glory and splendor.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:08.920]   And he, Daniel also talk about how God had humble his father
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.360]   or great grandfather, Nebuchadnezzar,
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:15.840]   when he was filled with pride.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.200]   That is from the previous chapter, Daniel four.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.960]   And now, writings show up on the wall,
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.560]   writings on the wall.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:25.880]   And Daniel said,
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:29.160]   no, you have forgotten how God has humble
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:31.640]   your great grandfather.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.640]   518.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.200]   And then 22.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.560]   He said, but you, his son,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:42.000]   as his later generation,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.760]   O Belsusha, you have not humbled yourself,
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:47.560]   though you knew all this.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:51.760]   Instead, you have set yourself up against the Lord of heaven.
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.920]   You praise the gods of silver and gold
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:15:58.760]   and of bronze, iron, wood, and stone,
[00:15:58.760 --> 00:16:02.320]   which cannot see or hear or understand.
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:06.200]   But you did not honor the God who holds in his hand
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.680]   your life and all of your ways.
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:18.040]   You have seen how God had humble previous king,
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:19.880]   and now you are filled with pride
[00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:24.160]   because you took the vessels from the Jerusalem temple
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.000]   and you thought that God would approve you
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.480]   or God would be pleased.
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:32.800]   No, Daniel said, God is not pleased.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.760]   524.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   Therefore, God sent a hand that wrote the inscription,
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.800]   and this is the inscription that was written.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:46.680]   Many, many, tickle, passing.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.320]   What do they mean?
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.800]   Of course we don't know, right?
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:57.760]   Many, many, tickle, passing is Aramaic.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:00.960]   Aramaic, it's not Hebrew, it's not Greek.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.240]   Part of the Old Testament is written in Aramaic,
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.200]   and many, many, or many, many means number,
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.400]   counting, one, two, three, four, five.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.560]   And it's repeated twice to stress that
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.200]   God's decision is certain.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:22.520]   It will be fulfilled because God is counting the numbers.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:23.360]   What kind of numbers?
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.880]   We have to interpret it.
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.640]   And then tickle means waiting.
[00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:33.840]   Waiting, like putting things on scale, you know?
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:40.120]   Passing means divided, divided or separation.
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.600]   So the message literally means numbered,
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.960]   numbered, weighted, and divided.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:51.880]   And those words are, as I said, in Aramaic,
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.680]   and Aramaic was the international language of the time.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:59.480]   Remember what year was that?
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:00.600]   539, right?
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.440]   Sixth century BC.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.080]   In the ancient New Year's world,
[00:18:05.080 --> 00:18:10.080]   the international language at that time was Aramaic.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.920]   So the king and the officials were actually able
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.060]   to read Aramaic.
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.400]   Many, many, tickle, passing, they can read it.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:21.200]   What they don't understand, or they need someone
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.260]   like Daniel to interpret, is what it means.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:26.880]   What does it really mean?
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:30.560]   What those words mean or signify?
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:34.080]   So they need some help, and Daniel is trying to help them
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.800]   to give them the interpretation.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.640]   What does it mean?
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.940]   Many, many, tickle, passing?
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:43.080]   Number, number, weighted, and divided.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.040]   And Daniel comes along and he said,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.240]   "This is what these Aramaic words mean.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:52.700]   "Many, God has numbered the days of your reign
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.280]   "and brought it to an end."
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.960]   Tickle, you have been weighed on the scales
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.120]   and found wanting, so you don't match up.
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:11.080]   Paris, or passing, your kingdom is divided
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:14.660]   and will be given to the Medes and Persians.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:19.380]   So these words are actually God's evaluation
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.040]   of Belsash's kingdom.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:25.560]   And God is using these words to pronounce
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.960]   his upcoming judgment on Belsash.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.840]   529, "Then at Belsash's command,
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.480]   "Daniel was clothed in purple,
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:40.520]   "a gold chain was placed around his neck,
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:44.320]   "and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.440]   "in the kingdom."
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.800]   Now, why the third?
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.640]   Why number three?
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:51.120]   Why number three?
[00:19:51.120 --> 00:19:52.680]   Remember the background?
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.680]   The top guy was Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:58.600]   Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:01.440]   The second guy is Belsash, right here.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.280]   And then because Daniel could interpret
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.080]   the significance of the message, or the words,
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:09.900]   he is now being promoted to the third.
[00:20:09.900 --> 00:20:11.280]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:16.280]   Now, before the archeologists find the name Belsash,
[00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.480]   people are doubting about the reliability of scripture.
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:25.240]   They were saying there's no king called Belsash in this world
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.160]   and then all of a sudden, some British guy
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   came to the Middle East some years ago
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:37.160]   and then he was taking in the archeological site
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:41.160]   and then they find some cuneiform tablet,
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.600]   some clay tablet, and then they translate it
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.280]   and then Belsash was being mentioned
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:48.120]   as the eldest son of Nebuchadnezzar.
[00:20:48.120 --> 00:20:51.760]   And now we know why this verse says Belsash
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.240]   is raising Daniel to the position number three
[00:20:56.240 --> 00:20:57.320]   in his kingdom.
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.920]   Because Nebuchadnezzar, Belsash, and then Daniel.
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.480]   Now this is also interesting.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.600]   Not only the reliability of scripture,
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:10.200]   but it also makes perfect, kind of interesting
[00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:15.200]   is that Belsash knows that these are the meanings
[00:21:16.760 --> 00:21:20.360]   of the words I will make, that God is counting down
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.120]   his kingdom, but Belsash did not know
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:29.000]   that his kingdom is coming to an end so quickly.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.360]   You know, faster than he imagined.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:40.560]   In the last verse of this passage, verses 30 and 31,
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:46.480]   that very night, Belsash, king of Babylonians,
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:51.480]   was slain and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.320]   at the age of 62.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.240]   Now Darius the Mede is also another question here,
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.920]   but it should refer to Cyrus the Great.
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.200]   So that night, that night, that very night,
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:11.240]   Cyrus came and Persian kingdom took over Babylon.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:15.720]   And from secular history, we know we can even
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:18.360]   find out what that day is.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:23.360]   It's October 12th, 539 BC, October 12th.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.800]   We can calculate so precisely that we know October 12th,
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:34.720]   the army of Persian kingdom march into the capital city,
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.000]   Babylon, of Babylonian empire,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.900]   and then the empire crumbles and it fell.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:42.120]   It happened overnight.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.860]   Now what are the take-homes from this story,
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.760]   this interesting story from Belshasha?
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:52.240]   First, it says clearly that God is sovereign
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.440]   over all earthly powers.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.160]   All the earthly kingdoms are in God's hands
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.560]   and God's power is transcendent over all of them.
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:10.920]   Any kingdom, in the ancient time, Babylonian kingdom,
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.920]   Persian kingdom, Greek kingdom, the Roman empire,
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.820]   any empire, even today, God's power
[00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.100]   is over all earthly kingdoms.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:26.160]   Maybe United States, Russia, China, EU,
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:33.700]   all the earthly kingdoms, all of these earthly kingdoms
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:39.660]   and treasures come and go, rise and fall of empires.
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:44.260]   And so often we think our kingdoms will last,
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:48.920]   will continue forever, as long as we live.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:52.420]   No, the Bible says, here the Bible uses a story
[00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:56.300]   to tell you the theology or the philosophy of history.
[00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.780]   This is how God sees history,
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.300]   how God sees historical kingdom.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.960]   They rise and they fall.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.380]   No king, no kingdom on earth will last forever.
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.940]   Only God's kingdom will last forever.
[00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.200]   Now this is our pride and our presumption
[00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:20.040]   that we think our earthly kingdom will last forever.
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.500]   The story tells us no earthly kingdom can last
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.220]   without God's permission.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:33.060]   God can allow a certain king, a certain official
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:34.300]   to be in the White House.
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.780]   God can allow this or that king to rule
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.420]   over some part of the earth.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.100]   But everything is in God's hand.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:49.220]   Now what God allows does not always
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:51.620]   mean God approves of it.
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:54.780]   God can allow evil to exist.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:58.180]   That's pretty difficult for us.
[00:24:58.180 --> 00:25:00.860]   God can allow evil to exist.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.540]   However, there's always judgment at the end.
[00:25:04.540 --> 00:25:07.100]   There's always righteous judgment at the end.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:10.140]   And judgment often comes as a surprise.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.860]   And you would not expect that.
[00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.180]   Here in this story, Belshazzar the king
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.100]   thinks that his kingdom will go on
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.100]   at least for a little while.
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:23.340]   Why God, of course God is counting down his days,
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:25.700]   but he thinks his kingdom will go on
[00:25:25.700 --> 00:25:27.140]   and business as usual.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.020]   Now the king even expects that God
[00:25:31.020 --> 00:25:33.340]   to show up to approve his plan.
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:36.420]   And in this chapter, God does show up.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:39.540]   But God does not approve his plan.
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:43.380]   Now think about our lives.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:46.580]   Sometimes we want the approval of God, right?
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.780]   Maybe we're launching a new career.
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.420]   Maybe we have a family plan
[00:25:51.420 --> 00:25:53.980]   or we have our own personal plan.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:58.780]   We always want God to show up and give us the approval.
[00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.820]   It may, it may not.
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:07.140]   Because it is up to the will of God.
[00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.860]   The second point here is that the will of God
[00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:12.780]   transcends our will.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.580]   Divine will transcends your will.
[00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:21.260]   God's will is over above your will.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.540]   And so often we want the approval of God
[00:26:24.540 --> 00:26:27.580]   because we like to do this or that,
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:29.540]   or we plan for this or that.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.620]   And sometimes we even think that
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:35.020]   if we pray hard enough,
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.860]   if we work hard enough,
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:41.820]   then our intent, our plan will work out.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:44.900]   God may approve my plan.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:46.700]   And this is a real temptation.
[00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:49.300]   This is a real temptation for us.
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:54.820]   And it's pride on our behalf.
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.380]   It's just tempting to even sometimes
[00:26:58.380 --> 00:27:01.740]   we misuse the name of God for our plan.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:08.100]   Instead of humbly seeking the will of God in our lives,
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.580]   sometimes we think we can misuse or abuse the name of God
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:15.620]   so that we'll get the approval from God.
[00:27:15.620 --> 00:27:19.020]   You know, this story tells us the job of God
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:22.300]   is not to rubber stamp your plan.
[00:27:22.300 --> 00:27:28.140]   God's not here to do a bidding.
[00:27:28.140 --> 00:27:32.180]   God's not here, not necessarily to approve your plan.
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.900]   Even you have well intent.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:38.860]   It may, may not, right?
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:42.380]   The whole point is God is not here
[00:27:42.380 --> 00:27:44.220]   just to rubber stamp our plan.
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.780]   God is here to help us and mold us
[00:27:48.780 --> 00:27:53.780]   so that we can yield to him in worship and obedience.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.620]   That's what God wants.
[00:27:55.620 --> 00:27:59.140]   You know, he's not necessarily here to say,
[00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:01.260]   "Okay, you can do this.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.620]   "Okay, if you ask me, I will do that for you."
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:09.540]   The whole thing is because the will of God matters,
[00:28:09.540 --> 00:28:11.060]   not our will.
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.660]   Now I wanna close this message,
[00:28:14.660 --> 00:28:16.900]   this story with James chapter four.
[00:28:16.900 --> 00:28:19.740]   James chapter four.
[00:28:19.740 --> 00:28:23.580]   When we read this two verses,
[00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.580]   I think it speaks to what Daniel 5 has to say.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:33.660]   Is that the will of God is higher than our will.
[00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:41.580]   The plan of God should transcend your plan.
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:45.900]   James chapter four.
[00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.620]   Why?
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:52.100]   You do not even know what will happen tomorrow.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.060]   What is your life?
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:58.460]   You are a mist that appears for a little while
[00:28:58.460 --> 00:28:59.820]   and then vanishes.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:02.460]   Instead, you ought to say,
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:07.460]   if it is the will of the Lord,
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:11.180]   we will live and do this or do that.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:16.040]   No, the scripture is trying to confront our pride,
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.580]   confront our priority.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:23.420]   We don't even know we will exist tomorrow.
[00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.780]   It says we are simply a mist.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.980]   You know what a mist is?
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:31.860]   Did you wake up early enough this morning?
[00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:35.900]   You look at your alarm, the mist,
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.780]   actually talking about our breath, you know.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.980]   When we say things, when we're breathing out, you know,
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:46.020]   that is mist.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.020]   The mist will exist for just a little while
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:52.900]   and it will be gone.
[00:29:52.900 --> 00:29:57.420]   And that is your life, that is my life, right?
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:01.100]   Then why, if we exist only like a mist,
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.180]   why do we think this will happen tomorrow
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:05.900]   or that will happen tomorrow, right?
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.900]   What is your life?
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.740]   James challenges and confronts us.
[00:30:09.740 --> 00:30:11.740]   You ought to say, rather,
[00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.620]   if God allows,
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.220]   if this is the Lord's will,
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.180]   then we will live.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:23.260]   We will do this or do that.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.700]   No, the Bible is not encouraging us
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:29.940]   not to manage our life.
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:32.900]   It's not saying that we don't have to plan
[00:30:32.900 --> 00:30:36.220]   for the next day or the next year or next month, you know.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:39.420]   The Bible is all about, you know, management.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:42.780]   You know, we need to be good steward, right?
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:47.060]   However, the Bible also insists that,
[00:30:47.060 --> 00:30:51.460]   hey, God's will transcends your will.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:56.140]   If God allows, if this is the Lord's will,
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:59.620]   you will live and you will do this or do that.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.780]   Why don't we close in prayers
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:07.820]   and I'm sure you have some plans in your life, right?
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:12.820]   And so often, you know, our plans trump God's plan, right?
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:18.420]   Oh God, I have this or that I need to do, okay?
[00:31:18.420 --> 00:31:20.700]   I'll put you on the side, all right?
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.700]   Put you on the side for a moment.
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.900]   And God, I know you're a king, but hey, you know,
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:28.060]   I have this or that to do, you know, I'm so busy.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:30.460]   I'll put you in the footnote.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:34.180]   This is tempting, all right?
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:35.020]   This is tempting.
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:40.340]   As James says, you ought to say, you ought to pray.
[00:31:40.340 --> 00:31:45.060]   If it is the Lord's will, I will live
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:47.500]   and I will do this or that.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:49.100]   Let's be humble and come before God
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:54.100]   and do away our pride to acknowledge His sovereignty, right?
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.380]   Let's pray.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:14.060]   Father, we come before you to confess our sin, our pride.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:18.220]   And so often, our priority trumps your priority.
[00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:22.180]   Sometimes we just think that our plan is so important
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:24.660]   and you are the least important.
[00:32:24.660 --> 00:32:29.820]   We come before you, we confess our sin of pride.
[00:32:29.820 --> 00:32:33.820]   Yes, we don't control our lives.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:38.100]   We don't even know that we will exist tomorrow.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:39.780]   We're just like mist.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:43.540]   We appear a little while, we live for a little while,
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.300]   and then we'll be vanished and be forgotten.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:51.500]   And yet you, in your grace, allow us to live.
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:55.020]   So yeah, we come before you and we pray.
[00:32:55.020 --> 00:33:00.780]   And we say to you, if it is your will, then we will live.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:03.700]   We will do this and do that.
[00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:07.060]   And Father, confront us.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:12.060]   Do we really have the priority of a Christ disciple,
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.940]   putting you as our number one,
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.940]   putting you as the most important,
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.020]   the most important person that we're gonna follow
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.420]   and we're gonna obey and we're gonna worship?
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.820]   Father, we come before you,
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.700]   we ask that your spirit will remind us
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.980]   to reorganize our lives,
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.260]   putting you first, putting other things
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:38.300]   in the lower priority.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:40.220]   Help us to please you,
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.020]   help us to worship you and follow you,
[00:33:43.020 --> 00:33:48.020]   and to be obedient, always seeking your will first,

[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.380]   to listen to your spirit's prompting,
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:56.780]   to help us to live a life that is obedient,
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:58.700]   live a life that will pleasing to you.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:01.500]   Yes, it is your will.
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:03.700]   If it is your will, then we will live
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:05.580]   and we will do this and that.
[00:34:05.580 --> 00:34:07.540]   And thank you for your blessing,

[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:23.580]   that we can come and enjoy your provision.
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:26.500]   Yeah, you are so good, God.
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:30.180]   Thank you, thank you for the grace of life
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:34.780]   and help us and use our life to honor you.

[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.260]   to count His blessing, all right?
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:11.460]   Count His provision and thank God
[00:35:11.460 --> 00:35:15.020]   for everything that we enjoy today, all right?
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:17.380]   Thank you very much and I'll see you next week.
[00:35:17.380 --> 00:35:19.860]   (gentle music)
