[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.840]   - Right.
[00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.540]   Well, this is a time of craziness.
[00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.960]   It's a time of chaos.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.560]   We still in the midst of a pandemic,
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.400]   two years long, right?
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.180]   Probably something at the end of a tunnel.
[00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.620]   I don't know yet, right?
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.820]   We don't know yet.
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.420]   So we just put on masks for now, right?
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.540]   Except those who are singing or speaking,
[00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.700]   just for the sake of clarity.
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.780]   So you look around, there's so much uncertainty.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.980]   And last week, the horrible news
[00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.260]   of Russians invading Ukraine, that is horrible.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.460]   You read all the stories and all the news reports.
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.860]   It's just time of chaos.
[00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.160]   Sometimes in times of crisis,
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.860]   we will think of what the Bible says.
[00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.940]   We try to find answers from the word of God.
[00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.380]   And sometimes we think of words from the Bible
[00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.060]   saying in the end times,
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.180]   there will be war and conflicts on the earth.
[00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.900]   Or sometimes we think of the book of Revelation, right?
[00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.060]   I'm sure you have read this book.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.260]   It's very easy to find as the last book of the Bible,
[00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.020]   the last book in the New Testament.
[00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:16.820]   But it's a very strange book.
[00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.120]   It's a very difficult book to tackle.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.620]   So today, we would like to start a kind of a mini series.
[00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.600]   We'll see how it goes.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.020]   And we will take some passages from the book of Revelation
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.780]   and learn how to read it, learn how to understand it.
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.300]   Especially we know the Bible,
[00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.980]   even though it's not directly written to us,
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.160]   but it's definitely written for us.
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.540]   So how do we read that?
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.460]   I chose this book, book of Revelation,
[00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.660]   because at times of crisis,
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.740]   sometimes we go to this book and say,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.740]   you see, this is what the Bible predicted.
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.280]   And this is what the book of Revelation is all about, right?
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.300]   We look at the conflicts, happened last week,
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.120]   and we look at all these tensions,
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.100]   international tensions or pandemic,
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.740]   or just unrest, just look around.
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.460]   And we go back to the Bible and say,
[00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.860]   hey, this is what the book says, right?
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.140]   This is what the book predicted.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.540]   So how true is that, right?
[00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.540]   So I want you to think with me how to understand this book,
[00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:23.260]   how to understand the book of Revelation.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.540]   If you remember last week,
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.880]   I told you to do something, right?
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.460]   Every day, turn to the Bible,
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.640]   10 to 15 minutes in prayer, right?
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.940]   Reading the word of God, you know,
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.060]   absorbing the word of God.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.060]   Did you do that?
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.020]   All right, I'll make sure you do it, okay?
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.980]   Make sure you do it.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.820]   But sometimes there are passages in the Bible,
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.940]   some portions in the Bible,
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.980]   it's very difficult to do devotion those out of, right?
[00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.900]   Including the book of Revelation.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:51.660]   So we wanna turn to this book, book of Revelation.
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.580]   If you have your Bible in your phone app, turn to it now.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.580]   In your languages, there will also be passages
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.420]   we project on the screen.
[00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.840]   We'll start with chapter one.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.620]   The revelation of Jesus Christ,
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.380]   which God gave him to show his servants
[00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.820]   what must soon take place.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.220]   He made known by sending his angel to servant John,
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.460]   the apostle John.
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.940]   He testifies to everything he saw.
[00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.260]   That is the word of God, the testimony of Jesus Christ.
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.040]   Blessed is the one who reads the words of the prophecies.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.940]   The book of Revelation, this book.
[00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.220]   Blessed is the one who reads the words of this book.
[00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.180]   And blessed are those who hear it and take to heart
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.500]   what is written in it.
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.740]   Because the time is near, the time of Jesus' second coming.
[00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.320]   He came 2,000 years ago into human history
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.900]   and accomplished salvation for us on the cross.
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.420]   But he will come back.
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.380]   The book of Revelation is all about the second coming.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.260]   What will happen, what will soon take place?
[00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.480]   The first word, apocalypses.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.540]   This is the word very familiar to us, right?
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.540]   Because we get the English word apocalypse out of this word.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.700]   Remember two years ago when we first locked down,
[00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.360]   I went out with my two children to pick up some takeouts
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:15.300]   from a restaurant.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.640]   It was March, right?
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.580]   2020, right?
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.100]   2020.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.560]   So it was at night.
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.120]   So we drove out there to a restaurant nearby.
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.040]   We're trying to pick up some takeouts for dinner.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.660]   It was the first day of lockdown and we drove on the street.
[00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.040]   And it was quite a sight.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.280]   Because as you know, in Chicago,
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.360]   you know, the traffic is crazy, right?
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.000]   All the time.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.640]   But it was the first day of lockdown
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.400]   and the street is totally empty.
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.960]   It was like a ghost town.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.440]   It was kind of crazy, right?
[00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:00.340]   This is how we describe situations like this.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.140]   Apocalypse, right?
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.040]   It's the modern meaning of the word apocalypse.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.120]   Means doomsday, right?
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.840]   Destruction of all kinds.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.720]   But originally in the first century,
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.820]   when this word is spoken,
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.380]   the basic meanings means uncover, disclose.
[00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:22.160]   Something which was unknown before.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.400]   Now it's being revealed.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.720]   So that is what apocalypse means.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.680]   The revelation of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.520]   Reveal something to us that is not known before.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.760]   What is it?
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.320]   What must soon take place
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.500]   before the second coming of Christ?
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.200]   And then the passage goes on to explain to us
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.900]   what is the situation.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.440]   Verse four, John the apostle,
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:49.360]   writing a letter to seven churches in the province of Asia,
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   which is today's Turkey.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.980]   John, your brother, I am with you guys.
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:00.980]   Company in suffering and kingdom and patient.
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:01.980]   And patience.
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.780]   And doings.
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.260]   There are hours in Jesus.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.260]   Who, John is saying that I'm writing it
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.060]   from the island of Patmos,
[00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:17.020]   which is a small island
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.100]   off the coast of Ephesus from Turkey.
[00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:23.420]   So he was exiled, why?
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:28.100]   Because the Roman Empire was oppressing the churches,
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.700]   the early churches in those days.
[00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:34.460]   It was kind of the 1890s,
[00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.180]   so '90s after Christ.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:42.880]   So the Roman Emperor was instituting
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:46.340]   some sort of systematic persecution,
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:50.980]   systematic pressure on the early church.
[00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.480]   So it was time of crisis for the church.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.300]   And then John was exiled
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.540]   because he was one of the leaders, one of the pastors.
[00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.260]   He was exiled on Patmos, on the island.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.500]   And he was suffering with other brothers and sisters
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:12.020]   who were in the mainland under the Roman persecution.
[00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.700]   So this is what the book of Revelation is all about.
[00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:19.140]   Sometimes we describe the book of Revelation
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:23.580]   as some special type of literature.
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.480]   We call this type of literature apocalyptic literature.
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.700]   And what it says is it's a group
[00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.980]   or a collection of many different writings,
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:33.820]   different kinds of writings.
[00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.380]   Some of them end up in the New Testament.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.820]   Some of them is outside the New Testament.
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.420]   Some are written by Jewish writers,
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.340]   some are by early Christian writers.
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:46.500]   And they have some commonalities.
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:49.880]   You know, think of Old Testament, the book of Daniel,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.220]   or some chapters in Ezekiel.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.940]   Some of the passages in the Gospels or Paul's letters.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:02.060]   Some common languages all these writings would use,
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.800]   including the book of Revelation.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.480]   So as we turn to the book of Revelation,
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.500]   it's a strange book, right?
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:12.280]   It talks about horses, it talks about locusts,
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.480]   it talks about all kinds of strange phenomenon
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:17.800]   that is foreign to us.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:20.500]   But you need to remember this.
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:23.000]   This sort of writings, apocalyptic literature,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.700]   is written to the people of God who are in crisis
[00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.180]   in order to encourage them,
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:34.180]   in order to let them see what the real reality is.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:36.660]   It's not what you see here now.
[00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:38.100]   It's something happening in the future,
[00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.700]   and something happening above,
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.140]   in another realm, in the heavenly realm.
[00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:44.380]   What is really happening?
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.220]   You see conflicts on Earth,
[00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:47.580]   but there's spiritual warfare,
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:52.580]   which is so real up there and in soon future.
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:54.900]   So the book of Revelation or apocalyptic literature
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:58.060]   is trying to write to,
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.700]   to say to the people of God who are under pressure,
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.860]   their faith is being tested.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:08.860]   And the purpose is to help them see a different reality
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.860]   so that they will find hope in God.
[00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.020]   They will not find hope on Earth.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.900]   They will be encouraged in times of chaos.
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.320]   Don't we all need that?
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:21.340]   We need this today, right?
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.300]   We see conflicts and we see chaos
[00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.820]   and uncertainties,
[00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.380]   all sorts of crazy things happening in our world.
[00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.740]   What is going on?
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.260]   And the apocalyptic literature,
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:32.860]   especially the book of Revelation,
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:34.780]   is trying to talk to us.
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.780]   It's a message written for us
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:40.260]   so that we will understand what God is doing.
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:42.180]   So the first three chapters,
[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.140]   we're not going to go into details,
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:47.440]   but first three chapters is actually Apostle John
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.580]   writing seven letters to seven churches.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.620]   And they will circulate those letters
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.140]   and to encourage the churches
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.900]   who are under trials and temptations.
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.780]   And then in chapter four,
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.540]   the Apostle John is being lifted up,
[00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:02.180]   being taken away from the Earth.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:05.100]   And he entered into the heavenly realm.
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:10.020]   And he saw something like a Roman Empire royal court,
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:12.420]   like the king's court, right?
[00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:14.740]   Going to the White House up there.
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:18.900]   So he looked around and see who is seated on the floor.
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.540]   It's not the Roman emperor.
[00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:22.380]   It's not Caesar.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:28.380]   He saw who is seated on the floor is God himself.
[00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:32.340]   Is the God of history.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:35.180]   The God who's still in control.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.180]   And then it launched many, many different chapters
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.300]   talking about the visions that he saw.
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.420]   And he reported back to the churches.
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:46.020]   Let's take a look.
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:47.580]   Chapter five.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.200]   Let me get this ready.
[00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:53.260]   It's so dark here.
[00:10:53.260 --> 00:10:54.540]   Hold on one second.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:55.380]   All right.
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.540]   Chapter five, verse one.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.380]   See that?
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.540]   Chapter five, verse one.
[00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:06.500]   Then I saw in the right hand of him,
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.680]   who sat on the floor,
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:12.060]   a scroll with writing on both sides
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.340]   and sealed with seven seals.
[00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.660]   I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice,
[00:11:16.660 --> 00:11:21.140]   who is worthy to break the seals and open the scroll.
[00:11:21.140 --> 00:11:23.620]   But no one in heaven or on earth,
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.140]   under the earth could open the scroll
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.380]   or even look inside it.
[00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:32.340]   So I wept and wept
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:35.260]   because no one was found who has authority,
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:38.140]   who was worthy to open the scroll
[00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:40.600]   to see what is written inside.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.980]   Now in the ancient world,
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:47.980]   important information is always written on the scroll.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:51.260]   Made of animal skin or paper.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.060]   And then they roll it up
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.340]   and then they put some lumps of clay
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:59.820]   on top of the roll up document.
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.940]   And then someone who has authority
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.100]   with a ring or with a stamp,
[00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:07.740]   will put the stamp on the lump of clay
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.760]   and seal it, close it up,
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.140]   and archive it in the royal bank
[00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.980]   or royal building or temple, anywhere important.
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:19.580]   In the, say in today's language,
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:21.860]   the White House office, right?
[00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.340]   In the government archive.
[00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:29.440]   So whoever wants to check what was written in the document,
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:33.700]   he has to bring his stamp or the ring
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:38.540]   and to match with the impression on the clay
[00:12:38.540 --> 00:12:41.340]   to break the seal and open it up.
[00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:44.100]   Now what John saw was this.
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.920]   He saw a scroll with seven seals.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.340]   The document is closed up.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:52.960]   But he found no one who could open the scroll.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:56.420]   What is written inside the scroll
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:12:58.300]   is definitely words of judgment.
[00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:01.420]   If you have some Old Testament background,
[00:13:01.420 --> 00:13:04.100]   you understand a scroll written,
[00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.740]   words with front and back all over the place.
[00:13:07.740 --> 00:13:12.740]   Book of Ezekiel, talking about the word of judgment from God.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.880]   He will vindicate the oppressed,
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:19.080]   vindicate the people of God.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.720]   He will help the people of God
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.480]   and will bring judgment on the oppressor,
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:27.380]   on the evil forces that is pressing down on the church.
[00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.960]   John found no one having the authority to open the scroll.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:34.280]   So what will happen?
[00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:36.000]   Nobody knows.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.040]   What is the fate?
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.440]   What is happening to the church?
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.840]   What will look like tomorrow?
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.440]   Nobody can tell.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.440]   That's why he was weeping.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.360]   Nobody can be found to open the scroll,
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.820]   to tell us who is in control tomorrow, right?
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:55.660]   Especially in the church
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.020]   when they were under so much pressure.
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.180]   Then in verse five,
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:04.800]   then one of the elders who was worshiping in the throne room
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.040]   said to me, "Do not weep.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:11.480]   See the lion from the tribe of Judah, the root of David.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.160]   He has triumph.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.800]   He is able, he has the authority to open the scroll
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:16.960]   and his seven seals.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:21.960]   Finally, the lamb of God, who was slain and rose again.
[00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:26.160]   He is also the lion from the tribe of Judah,
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:27.720]   from the tribe of David.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:30.440]   He is the real conquering king.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.600]   He has conquered death and evil,
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.500]   and he has the authority to open and break the seal,
[00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:40.720]   to help us see what will soon happen.
[00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.240]   Who is in charge tomorrow?"
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:49.440]   So chapter six, six verse one.
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:53.880]   "I saw as the lamb opened the first of the seven seals,
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.440]   that I heard one of the four living creatures, the angels,
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:01.880]   say in a voice like thunder, 'Come!'"
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:02.960]   Verse two.
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.800]   "I look, and there before me was a white horse.
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:11.040]   Its rider holding a bow.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:15.800]   He was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.800]   bent on conquest."
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:22.480]   Now definitely this is some strange images for us.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.560]   For sure, this is negative.
[00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:28.680]   It's a world of judgment, right?
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.120]   So definitely it's judgment of God
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:35.480]   against the church oppressor, right?
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.720]   God will do something to stop the oppression.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.880]   God will do something to the evil empire.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:47.880]   And definitely in this image, we see war, white horse,
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:53.200]   rider holding a bow, conquest, military image.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.640]   Now here's what we struggle with,
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:00.320]   because we modern readers, we modern people,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:03.720]   we often misunderstand the images
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:05.200]   from the book of Revelation.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.160]   There are all sorts of, we're trying to read our own meaning
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.000]   into the text, right?
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   We try to impose our own understanding onto the text.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.160]   Let me demonstrate how,
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.480]   you probably heard something like this.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.840]   Many people would misinterpret the images here.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:28.840]   Let me demonstrate how to do it wrongly, okay?
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.760]   All right?
[00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:32.240]   Let me try to demonstrate how to do it wrongly.
[00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.080]   And this is so wrong, okay?
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.080]   So you see in this image, there's color white.
[00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.120]   There's white horse, right?
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.880]   And you see, no, military conflict, right?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.480]   Conquest.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:47.400]   Let me demonstrate.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:55.200]   You see the flag of Russia has white color, right?
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.000]   White, blue, and red, right?
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.120]   White, bingo.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:06.640]   You got Revelation chapter six, white horse, right?
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:09.920]   And then if you Google white horse Putin,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.120]   you find pictures like this, right?
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:14.640]   Bingo.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.440]   Revelation six, right?
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.920]   That's the first seal being broken, right?
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.600]   And then you say, "Ha ha, you know, prophecy fulfilled.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.920]   "2,000 years ago it was written there, right?
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.280]   "Chapter six of Revelation, the first seal, right?
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.560]   "Last week it happened, it broke the seal."
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:31.840]   (laughs)
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.640]   You see a lot of misinterpretation,
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.520]   just so wrong these days, you know?
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:41.920]   Because we just don't know how to interpret
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:44.160]   this sort of, you know, imageries.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:45.720]   They're strange to us.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:48.520]   Now I want to tell you how to read the Bible,
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.440]   especially the book of Revelation.
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:51.840]   The Bible, the book of Revelation,
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.720]   is not written to us, right?
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:57.120]   It's not directly written to us.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.520]   It was originally in Greek, not in English,
[00:18:00.520 --> 00:18:04.520]   not in Chinese, not in any contemporary languages.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.840]   It was written in Greek.
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:09.000]   It's not written to us, but it's written for us.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.520]   So when we try to understand what is going on here,
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   we should stop from reading our own meaning onto the text.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.960]   We should ask, how did the first audience,
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.400]   the early churches in the first century,
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.680]   how would they understand these images, right?
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:30.640]   So this is totally wrong, okay?
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:32.400]   Don't take it home, all right?
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.240]   Don't take it home.
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.840]   This is the wrong interpretation.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:39.200]   But you see this kind of problem
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:41.480]   whenever we try to understand
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:44.240]   what the book of Revelation is all about?
[00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:45.840]   Don't do that.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.360]   Instead, we ask, how would the first century Christians
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.680]   understand the imageries?
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.240]   White horse rider with a bow.
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.080]   Let me show you some.
[00:18:58.080 --> 00:19:00.160]   Ancient coins.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.880]   Parthian coins, all right?
[00:19:03.880 --> 00:19:06.880]   Do you see a soldier holding a bow?
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.720]   Yeah, the triangular thing, right?
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:13.400]   It's not very clear, but it definitely is a bow, okay?
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.720]   And then underneath, horses, right?
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.440]   White horse.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.760]   And the king was riding on the horse.
[00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:23.240]   These are Parthian coins.
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:29.920]   And it just happened for the ancient Parthian empire,
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.880]   the sacred color happens to be white.
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:40.040]   In their army, there's always white horses.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.080]   Let's take a look at the map.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:46.240]   The Roman Empire on the left,
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:48.320]   the Parthian Empire on the right.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:52.800]   For 400 years, this is the ancient, powerful empire.
[00:19:54.040 --> 00:19:59.040]   It always posed a military threat
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:04.160]   to the eastern border of Roman Empire, the Parthian Empire.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:07.360]   In fact, the Roman historians,
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:10.600]   when they talk about the threat against the empire,
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.040]   the old Roman Empire,
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.840]   they would talk about the Parthian Empire.
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.600]   In those days, even the Jewish people
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.880]   living on the east coast, the east border,
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.160]   the land of Palestine,
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   from time to time when they talk about the last day,
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:28.400]   the final battle, right?
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:31.560]   Some big battle would happen.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.320]   They would say the Parthians would be involved.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:37.040]   In fact, in first century,
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:41.280]   there were two major battles
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.360]   fought between the Romans and the Parthians.
[00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:50.560]   Two times, the Parthians successfully challenged Rome.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:54.840]   So most probably,
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:21:02.320]   the first seal, white horse, rider with a bow,
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:06.840]   will remind the first audience, the first century audience,
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.360]   the Roman audience, their greatest enemy,
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:12.640]   most likely, are the Parthians.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:16.880]   Now, you will continue and ask and say,
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:21.880]   hey, I know a little bit about ancient history.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.920]   The fall of Rome didn't happen until AD 400 something.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:30.800]   Right, 476.
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.800]   And the fall of Rome was not caused by the eastern Parthians.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:39.840]   It's actually caused by the northern barbarians.
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:45.160]   It was the barbarians' job, right?
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.600]   Brought down the Roman Empire.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.080]   Does it mean Revelation is wrong?
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.600]   No, because the imagery is very flexible.
[00:21:53.600 --> 00:21:59.880]   The imagery is, don't even talk about taking over Rome, right?
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:01.800]   The imagery, the first seal,
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.480]   the white horse rider with a bow,
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.720]   it simply means military pressure or military threat.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.280]   It's a common image that John used in the first century.
[00:22:14.560 --> 00:22:17.640]   They are scared by the Parthians,
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.400]   the Romans are scared by the Parthians.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:23.600]   To use this image is to communicate a message,
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.920]   a message of judgment,
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:29.320]   a message to remind the Roman Empire,
[00:22:29.320 --> 00:22:32.040]   remind the first audience who are under persecution
[00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:34.800]   by the Roman Empire, that Roman,
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:38.000]   the Romans are not that powerful, right?
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.600]   That's the first seal, that's the message.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.960]   It's the same thing that we use the image of
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:49.960]   Osama Bin Laden to challenge the American power, right?
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:55.280]   Now Osama Bin Laden is already gone, right?
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.360]   But the message is there, right?
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   To remind us the weakness, the vulnerability of the empire.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.200]   It's the same thing happening here in chapter six,
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:06.760]   first seal.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.480]   So the message is, in God's eyes,
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.680]   the empire oppressing the church will fail.
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:18.600]   It will fall.
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:22.040]   It looks very powerful, but it's not.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.600]   The first seal is talking about this.
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:29.120]   So it talks about the evil empire,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.760]   the evil force will fall one day.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:36.760]   Not because of the Parthians, but because of God himself.
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:39.200]   So as you read the book of Revelation,
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.560]   you will find out who is really the one
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:46.640]   who brings down the evil empire, 1115.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.520]   Now it talks about, it already talk about the seven seals.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.880]   Now it talks about the seven trumpets,
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.200]   and later on talk about seven bows, okay?
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.320]   Now we're right in the middle, seven trumpets.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:03.840]   The seventh angel sang his trumpet,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.120]   and there were loud voices in heaven which said,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.960]   the kingdom of God has become the kingdom of our Lord
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:15.480]   and his Christ, and Christ will reign forever and ever.
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:20.480]   Christ is the one who finally, ultimately,
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.400]   will bring down all this evil forces,
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:25.680]   and behind all this forces is Satan himself.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.760]   So as you can tell, the book of Revelation
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.680]   is not news report written ahead of time.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:36.240]   Now don't go to the book of Revelation and say,
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.040]   this is newspaper, today's newspaper,
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.320]   written 2,000 years ago.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:42.960]   No, that is wrong interpretation.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:46.000]   That is a misunderstanding.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   The book of Revelation also is not a weather forecast.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.600]   It's not telling us, okay, tomorrow three o'clock p.m.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:24:57.320]   it will rain, it will snow, or something like that.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   The book of Revelation does not intend to tell you
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.440]   when things happen, and how things happen exactly.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:07.440]   It doesn't do that.
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.360]   Apocalyptic literature doesn't do this.
[00:25:10.360 --> 00:25:12.520]   It doesn't answer our questions.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.320]   Our most interesting question is when and how, right?
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:17.920]   When does it happen?
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:19.720]   When will Christ come back?
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:21.080]   What will it look like, right?
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.640]   These are our questions, the when and how questions.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.760]   The book of Revelation is answering some other question,
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.160]   some more important question, which is the who question.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:33.200]   Who is in charge, and who is in control
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.400]   in the human history?
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.200]   When you see chaos out there,
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.160]   when you see everything is not right,
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:42.360]   who is the real Lord, who is in control?
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.040]   So it's not weather forecast,
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.840]   it's not newspaper within the head of time.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:47.680]   No.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:52.280]   Perhaps a better analogy is to think
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:55.160]   Revelation as a syllabus.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:58.400]   You all go to school, right?
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:02.480]   You receive a syllabus on the first day, right?
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.920]   It tells you the professor's name,
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.800]   the course name, classroom, and then the schedule, right?
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.360]   Okay, it's Monday, Wednesday, Friday,
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.240]   which assignment will be due,
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.720]   and what lessons will be taught,
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:21.760]   and how you prepare for that, right?
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.640]   And then when's the midterm, when's the final exam, right?
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:25.760]   And then, let's say, for example,
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:28.640]   you walk into your classroom one day, right?
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:30.720]   It was the day of midterm.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.800]   So you sit in the classroom,
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:33.560]   and then the professor came in,
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:36.920]   the teacher came in and gave you the midterm exam.
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.800]   Okay, you got your midterm exam,
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:42.960]   and say, "Wow, prophecy came true.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.800]   "It's really the midterm."
[00:26:45.800 --> 00:26:48.480]   Would you say that?
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.160]   Of course not.
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.600]   Of course not, because as you understand,
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.400]   this is a syllabus, right?
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.720]   It told you ahead of time,
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.920]   not in the sense of prediction,
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.960]   but in the sense that it's a plan, right?
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:05.080]   The plan the professor has already given you
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:06.360]   in the first day, right?
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:10.240]   And it also tells you who is the agency
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:14.240]   behind the syllabus, who is making things happen,
[00:27:14.240 --> 00:27:17.480]   who is fulfilling or accomplishing
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:21.400]   all those things printed on the syllabus, right?
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.360]   Who is the planner, the teacher?
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.000]   Who is the executor, the teacher himself,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.720]   the professor himself?
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:32.600]   So you walk in on the day of midterm,
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.560]   and say, "That's right.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.240]   "That's how he planned.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:42.040]   "We are working out and going along with his plan."
[00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.880]   And the teacher has the authority
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:49.360]   to execute exactly everything according to the syllabus.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:55.200]   Human history is divine syllabus.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:59.120]   What we see in human history,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.560]   what we see happening in our world,
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.160]   is the syllabus of God himself,
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:07.720]   the heavenly Lord, the King of kings.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.800]   He has written the syllabus.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:14.320]   That is the message, that is the theology
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.520]   of the book of Revelation.
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:21.760]   God is in control of the syllabus.
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.440]   God is in control of human history.
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:27.200]   So no matter what happens in history,
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.680]   no matter what happens in your life and in my life,
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:36.600]   even though we see churches being persecuted in China,
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.760]   in some of the Muslim countries,
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:41.840]   churches, brothers and sisters being persecuted,
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:47.960]   you go back to history, you go back to syllabus,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:51.880]   you know that behind it, there is someone in control,
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:54.560]   and God is still in control.
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.680]   Everything that we see in your life, in my life,
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.760]   is according to the entire syllabus
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.040]   set out by God himself.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.600]   God will do all things according to his word,
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.920]   according to his syllabus.
[00:29:10.920 --> 00:29:14.360]   That's why we can trust him.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.280]   That's why we should find hope in him.
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.040]   Now that's what Revelation
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:22.000]   or Apocalypse literature is trying to do,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.960]   is to tell us we can find hope only in him.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.840]   He is the one who is guarding and accomplishing,
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:34.560]   planning, executing the syllabus, right on his timing.
[00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.640]   Even though we have questions we cannot answer,
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.000]   even though we see crisis,
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.040]   we try to find out the reasons behind it,
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:45.000]   sometimes we don't.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   But look, everything is according to the syllabus of God.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.080]   Everything is according to his plan.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:55.360]   So we can trust him.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.720]   We find hope in God so that we can inform
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.200]   our own present living.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.760]   We will not be hijacked by fear, right, and unbelief.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:11.240]   Because we know everything will be according to his word.
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:13.800]   He is the faithful God who will execute everything.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:18.160]   Even though we don't have all the detailed answers,
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.440]   but yes, we can trust in him.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:25.200]   I'm sure in the past week or so,
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.040]   you got a lot of news stories
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.440]   about what is going on in our world.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:33.120]   You probably heard a lot of news stories
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:37.320]   or some really sad reports from the Ukraine crisis.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:39.400]   I received a lot too.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:43.040]   I want to share one of those with you.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:48.480]   The president of Ukrainian Baptist Theological Seminary.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:55.240]   Crisis came and he said,
[00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:58.440]   "Now the church will go underground.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:01.320]   "We had that under the Soviet Union
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.400]   "and the church did not forget,
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:06.520]   "should never forget what it means to be persecuted.
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:10.520]   "We, the church, will rearrange,
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:13.640]   "reorganize and do what we always do."
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.520]   Preach the gospel.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:18.520]   Isn't that true?
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:23.080]   Isn't that true if we find our hope,
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.360]   our ultimate anchor,
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:28.240]   nothing in the world but Christ himself
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.200]   who is in control of human history.
[00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:36.200]   If he is in control, then this hope,
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:41.200]   this promise will inform how we react in times of crisis.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.640]   We will reorganize.
[00:31:44.640 --> 00:31:47.040]   We will do what we always do
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.920]   or what we always called to do,
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:52.080]   to preach the gospel,
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:57.840]   to live a life of Christ follower.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.480]   Nothing will change.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.080]   Yes, there are times in darkness
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:05.920]   and sometimes we feel darkness is so overwhelming
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:10.920]   and the evil forces seem invincible, very powerful.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.840]   But the book of Revelation is reminding us
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:19.240]   all these evil forces are not omnipotent.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:22.480]   They are not all powerful.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.320]   They are limited.
[00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:28.360]   God himself is omnipotent.
[00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:31.200]   God himself is all powerful.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.800]   We still preach the gospel.
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.280]   We still live for the kingdom.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:39.360]   Don't be hijacked by all this fear and uncertainties.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.160]   Your history is the syllabus of God.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.720]   Yes, we have a lot of questions without answers,
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.240]   but that's okay.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.080]   Midterm will come.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:54.360]   The final exam will come.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:58.600]   God will do according to his word.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.160]   Let me close with chapter five, verse five.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:08.440]   Then one of the elders said to me,
[00:33:08.440 --> 00:33:10.120]   "Do not weep.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:13.640]   "See the lion of the tribe of Judah,
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.320]   "the root of David, has triumphed.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:22.400]   "He is able to open the scroll and the seven seals."
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.160]   Let us all pray.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:29.080]   Father God, our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.600]   you are the one in control
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:38.120]   and you are the only king that is worthy of our praises.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.240]   (pensive music)
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:45.400]   We face times of uncertainty and crisis
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:48.320]   and we're living in a time of chaos.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:50.720]   No matter what we face,
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.160]   remind us once again with the heavenly vision
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:59.280]   that you are the one who is in control.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   That our own personal life, world history even,
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:08.720]   is in your syllabus, is in your plan.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:13.360]   Yes, we see evil forces all around us.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.960]   We see chaos and crisis.
[00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:17.920]   We even see some of the people
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:21.720]   who are living less fortunate than us.
[00:34:21.720 --> 00:34:23.920]   They are facing persecutions.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.000]   Our dear brothers and sisters in other places,
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.640]   they are less fortunate than us.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.600]   Yes, we see a lot of things that are not going right.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:40.720]   And it seems to us the evil is having the upper hand.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:46.480]   But remind us once again that Christ our Lord,
[00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:50.440]   the Lamb of God, who was slain on the cross
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.920]   and rose again from the tomb,
[00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:57.240]   you are the one who is in charge.
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:34:58.960]   And we pray that our own personal life
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.960]   will dedicate ourselves again to you.
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:06.600]   I pray that you will increase our trust and faith in you.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.560]   You will increase our love for you.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:13.440]   We still do what we are always called to do,
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:16.880]   is to live according to your will,
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.240]   to preach the gospel, to build up your church,
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.360]   to serve you with our gifts.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:26.240]   And pray that you will continue to renew us,
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:27.560]   renew our perspective.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.560]   To live faithfully in your sight,
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:38.600]   to live faithfully according to your word,
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.840]   to hear your word and to apply it into our lives.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.960]   May our lives be pleasing to you.
[00:35:45.960 --> 00:35:47.960]   In Christ name we pray, amen.
