1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 you up to the service. Thank you guys. Oh, Mark.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:14,520
 I want to say hi to one another. Give a handshake or a high five, you know, to your

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:19,120
 neighbors. What a blessing to be here and to worship together.

4
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:25,080
 That's it. That's it. OK.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:32,400
 As you can tell, I'm suffering from a very mild form of coming cold, so I usually

6
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,960
 don't wear a mask, but, you know, I wear a mask.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,800
 So people are pretty surprised this morning and asked me why I'm wearing a mask.

8
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,960
 You know, as you can tell, you know, I don't want to spread germs.

9
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,400
 So but it's very mild form of coming cold.

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,200
 I'm coming to the end of it.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,840
 So so praise God for for the opportunity to to worship together because, you know,

12
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,880
 showing up here, you know, not being sick, not being sick enough to be to be absent.

13
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,160
 It's a blessing, right?

14
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,920
 It's a blessing to sit with, you know, brother and sister in Christ to worship

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,280
 together and to think about the word, especially in this coming weeks as the

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,760
 Holy Week approaches us.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:18,480
 The Good Friday, the Palm Sunday, next Sunday and then Good Friday and Easter

18
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:25,200
 Sunday is the best time to reflect and to think about what the love of Christ

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,520
 really means for us.

20
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:35,160
 And there's nothing that is better is to go into the word of God, to come to the

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:40,200
 scripture. And last week, as you remember, we were talking about the last days of

22
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,480
 Jesus, the last week of Jesus.

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,840
 And we were at chapter 12 of the Gospel of John.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:53,080
 And we brought out a couple of points when we studied the story in chapter 12 of

25
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,280
 Gospel of John, the Mary of Bethany.

26
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,760
 He annoyed the feet of Jesus with the most expensive perfume and she broke the jar

27
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:07,360
 and just started to annoy Jesus.

28
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:14,440
 And the purpose of it is to prepare for the death of Jesus Christ.

29
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:22,960
 So, in the perspective of Mary, she knew the cross was necessary.

30
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,560
 So, there was the first point.

31
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,000
 The first point is a big point.

32
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,320
 The necessity of the cross.

33
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:35,720
 She saw that Jesus had to die, had to die to pay for the sin, for sinners to

34
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,400
 accomplish the work of salvation on the cross.

35
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,880
 So, the cross was necessary.

36
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,440
 Jesus has to die.

37
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,360
 That's why she prepared Jesus' body ahead of time.

38
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,000
 And then, in the same story, we see another character, Judas, who betrayed

39
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,520
 Jesus, and we see the foolishness of the cross.

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:00,560
 And certainly, for Judas, he could not see any wisdom from the cross.

41
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,760
 And he was following a leader, the Messiah, for his political need to provide

42
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,920
 some sort of practical solution to his issue, to the issue of his day.

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,640
 It's the political problem.

44
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,880
 The Roman Empire was the political problem for the Jewish people.

45
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,160
 So, they were looking for a political Messiah.

46
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,720
 Of course, for Judas, this Messiah, Jesus, does not fit the profile that

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,760
 they were looking for.

48
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,080
 So, there he goes.

49
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:30,440
 He only saw the foolishness of the cross.

50
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,040
 So, now we are on chapter 13.

51
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,720
 Chapter 13.

52
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,240
 Let me read the scripture.

53
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,120
 It's a familiar story.

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,760
 I'm sure you heard about it.

55
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,920
 So, let's read John chapter 13.

56
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:54,160
 "Before the Passover celebration, Jesus knew that his hour had come to leave

57
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:57,240
 this world and return to his Father.

58
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,360
 He had loved his disciples during his ministry on earth, and now Jesus loved

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,520
 them to the very end.

60
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:10,600
 It was time for supper, and the devil had already prompted Judas, son of Simon

61
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,600
 Zechariah, to betray Jesus.

62
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,680
 Jesus knew that the Father had given him authority over everything and that he had

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,600
 come from God and would return to God.

64
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,200
 So, he got up from the table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel around his waist.

65
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:35,520
 He poured water into a basin, and he began to wash the feet of the disciples,

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,600
 drying them with the towel he had around him.

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,120
 When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, 'Lord, are you going to wash

68
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,360
 my feet?'

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:51,640
 Jesus answered, 'You don't understand now what I'm doing, but someday you will.'

70
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,880
 'No,' Peter protested, 'you will never, ever wash my feet.'

71
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,200
 Jesus replied, 'Unless I wash you, you will not belong to me.'

72
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:06,720
 Simon Peter exclaimed, 'Then wash my hands and head as well, not just my feet.'

73
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:12,600
 Jesus replied, 'A person who has bathed all over does not need to wash except for

74
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,200
 the feet to be entirely clean.

75
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:19,120
 And you disciples are clean, but not all of you.'

76
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,240
 For Jesus knew who would betray him.

77
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,480
 This is what he meant when he said, 'Not all of you are clean.'

78
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,240
 After washing the feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked,

79
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,440
 'Do you guys understand what I'm doing?

80
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:42,680
 You call me teacher and Lord, and you are right because that is what I am.

81
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,560
 And since I, your Lord and teacher, have washed your feet,

82
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,320
 you ought to wash each other's feet.

83
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,240
 I've given you an example to follow.

84
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,120
 Do as I have done to you.'

85
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,640
 This is the word of God.

86
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,680
 Pardon my extra bass voice.

87
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,200
 I know it's sexy, but...

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:08,680
 Yeah, I struggle whether I should preach today, but, you know, I got a little bit better.

89
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:11,440
 So thank God for answering my prayer.

90
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:16,040
 Otherwise, I will call on some of you to substitute the preaching today,

91
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,400
 especially you, Moody students.

92
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
 I'll call on you Saturday night and say, 'I cannot preach, okay?

93
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,720
 You should preach.'

94
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,520
 All right.

95
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,800
 So God bless you today.

96
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,880
 All right.

97
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,560
 Now, back to the story, okay?

98
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,560
 The story.

99
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,120
 Jesus washing the feet of the disciples.

100
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
 Very familiar, right?

101
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,440
 There are two major points here I want to point out.

102
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:42,200
 First one is that when we talk about foot washing,

103
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:47,800
 so often we can think of is this iconic painting, all right?

104
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,400
 What is the name of this painting?

105
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:54,760
 Last breakfast, lunch, or supper?

106
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,920
 Supper, right?

107
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,760
 Supper.

108
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,240
 Da Vinci's.

109
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,080
 So it was back in the 1600, I think.

110
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,200
 Yeah, he drew this iconic picture.

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,320
 And as you can see in this picture, 15th century painting,

112
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:14,440
 one long dining table, and Jesus is at the center.

113
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,120
 Can you see Jesus?

114
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,640
 Yeah.

115
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:21,160
 He's right at the center, and six disciples line up on his left,

116
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,200
 and then six others on his right.

117
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,120
 So this painting reflects the dinner setting at the time of the painting,

118
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,920
 15th century, 16th century, the time of Renaissance.

119
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,480
 European setting, European dining table, right?

120
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:43,760
 Something we are more familiar with, the dining setting.

121
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:54,120
 But as you know, in Jesus' day, the setting of supper is quite different.

122
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,360
 And you remember, as we read the story,

123
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:02,280
 this is probably the last evening of Jesus' spend with his disciples.

124
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,960
 And as we know from the storyline,

125
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:10,720
 John 13 is the last evening, last dinner with his disciples.

126
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,160
 And it was probably on Thursday evening, Thursday evening.

127
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:22,640
 And the next day is so-called Passover and the Shabbat.

128
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,200
 And Jesus and his disciples gathered together,

129
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,920
 probably in a pretty big room.

130
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,280
 And the Bible says it's an upper room.

131
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:31,960
 It's an upper room.

132
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,640
 It's on the second floor.

133
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:36,800
 So it's a big dining area.

134
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,920
 And they set up for their last supper, Jesus' last supper.

135
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:49,160
 And it was probably a formal Passover meal of Jewish people.

136
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:52,480
 At this time, it's the Passover season,

137
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:59,680
 and people were getting ready in Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover meal.

138
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,560
 The setting of Jesus' day is different.

139
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,600
 What we call, when they sit together to have dinner,

140
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,640
 it's not a long dining table.

141
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:14,320
 It's actually something called triclinium.

142
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,440
 As you can tell from the word, triclinium is to recline.

143
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:27,160
 And there are three tables or three couches reclined, forming a U-shape.

144
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,360
 Now, back in the days of Jesus, under Roman occupation,

145
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:37,240
 many of the Jewish people actually welcomed some of the Roman lifestyle.

146
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,760
 And this is one of them.

147
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,800
 This is one of them, triclinium.

148
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:46,800
 So one day, one meal a year, the most important meal, the Passover meal,

149
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,320
 they would dine in the Roman style.

150
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,000
 And that is the Roman style they would imitate.

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:59,200
 Triclinium is to have all the guests, all the people dining together.

152
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,080
 They will recline together.

153
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,120
 And then the food would be in the center.

154
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:10,640
 You would recline on your left side, lying on your left side,

155
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,640
 and your right hand would be free to reach out to the food in the center.

156
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,360
 All right?

157
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,160
 So it's a U-shape, and then the center is for the waiter or waitress or the busboy.

158
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,240
 Right?

159
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,720
 They will serve the food, and then you ask for refill.

160
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,480
 The servant will do it for you.

161
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,280
 And your legs, as I explained before, your legs will be sticking out.

162
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:34,880
 Right?

163
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,160
 So your legs, your feet, away from the food.

164
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,000
 And you stick your feet out there as you enjoy the feast.

165
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,440
 And then the servant in the midst of them will do the foot washing.

166
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,920
 Will do the foot washing.

167
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,680
 Now, something more about the triclinium.

168
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,240
 Something more about the Roman way of dining.

169
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,760
 Is that the seating arrangement, where you sit,

170
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:15,320
 where you sit around the triclinium, there's different levels of honor.

171
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,880
 This is pretty much the same as a traditional Chinese or Asian culture.

172
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,560
 I remember years ago, I visited southern China,

173
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:29,440
 and then we were meeting with some church leaders and city officials.

174
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,240
 So I remember one evening, we went out to a restaurant,

175
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,520
 to a private room, a dining room.

176
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,520
 And then we went to the dining hall, and there was a big round table, right?

177
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:45,320
 The Chinese table, usually round, right?

178
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,560
 So we went into the room, and back then I was a young guy.

179
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,400
 Right?

180
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:54,320
 So I still remember I walked into that room with a bunch of elders

181
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,280
 and people who are much older than me, right?

182
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:01,880
 And do you know what you should do and how you should behave?

183
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,240
 You do not sit.

184
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,160
 You are told where to sit, right?

185
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,480
 So the city officials, the big guys, right?

186
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,120
 They are probably the oldest person in the room, the elder.

187
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:19,720
 He will sit first, and he will assign a seat, right?

188
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,480
 So, you know, beside him, right or left,

189
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:29,720
 you know, probably other governors or city officials or government workers.

190
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:36,000
 And then come alongside, and then the last one being probably the youngest one.

191
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,240
 So it is a culture of honor and shame.

192
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:48,040
 So even where you sit, where you sit, it is a matter of honor or shame.

193
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,480
 This is the same way in the Roman triclinium arrangement.

194
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,360
 Every seat is prearranged from the elder to the least,

195
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:03,320
 from the greatest to the least, from the eldest to the youngest.

196
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,400
 It's a culture of honor and shame.

197
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:12,880
 So if we map out the triclinium, the host, okay, the host,

198
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,200
 probably a little bit small, the font, but that's okay.

199
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:25,120
 The host will be on the left, sitting second to the left.

200
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,160
 And the guest of honor on his left.

201
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,720
 And the trusted friend, another guest of honor,

202
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:36,280
 usually the youngest, on the right side of the host.

203
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:41,640
 And then the seating will continue in a clockwise direction,

204
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,880
 often from the older and then all the way to the youngest.

205
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,800
 And then on the lower right, on our lower right,

206
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:56,080
 would be the seat of the least honor.

207
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:01,120
 And usually the youngest person or the servant

208
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,280
 would be sitting in the lower right.

209
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:09,120
 Now as you can tell, triclinium in the Roman culture

210
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:13,760
 is a symbol of political power.

211
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,880
 It's all about domination.

212
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:19,120
 It's all about who's going to sit at the highest honor,

213
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,240
 who's going to take the least honor.

214
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,640
 The ruling class, the leaders, would exercise their right

215
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:29,800
 and their power over other people.

216
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:33,560
 So you come into the dining room of Roman triclinium,

217
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:37,600
 you will feel that this is not just a meal.

218
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,800
 You know, it's politics.

219
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,160
 It's all about power.

220
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,480
 It's all about dignity and about honor.

221
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:50,600
 Now if you map this out in such a way

222
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,520
 that Jesus is the host,

223
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,480
 he would be sitting on the second to the left, right?

224
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,640
 He's the host, Jesus there.

225
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:06,200
 And then probably on Jesus' left is Judah.

226
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,680
 And then on his right is the youngest of the 12,

227
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:12,520
 Apostle John.

228
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,040
 And then on the other side of the dining hall

229
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,600
 is Peter himself, Simon Peter.

230
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,320
 Now why did I say that?

231
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,560
 Because there are different details

232
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:26,520
 in the Last Supper stories from all four Gospels.

233
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,960
 There are different details that tell us

234
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,920
 actually this is how they arrange the seating positions

235
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,480
 in the Last Supper.

236
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,440
 Let me give you an example.

237
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,240
 Now remember this map, right?

238
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,640
 This is where you sit.

239
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,200
 This is where Jesus is.

240
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,640
 If you're Simon Peter, where are you?

241
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:46,480
 You're on the list, right?

242
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,880
 By the door.

243
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:53,480
 So, you know, he is in the position of servanthood.

244
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,160
 John, probably the youngest among the 12,

245
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,880
 and we know John died the last among the 12, right?

246
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,600
 He was also the author of the last book of New Testament,

247
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,080
 the Book of Revelation.

248
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:09,360
 So naturally we would think that John is the youngest guy.

249
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,160
 Judah is right next to Jesus and sharing the same bowl,

250
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:17,120
 dipping food into the bowl and enjoy the food together.

251
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,920
 So Jesus and Judah's probably are very close to each other.

252
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,320
 So if you remember this map,

253
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,400
 you remember this seating arrangement,

254
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:32,680
 let me turn to one of the verses in chapter 13,

255
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,920
 talking about the Last Supper.

256
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:39,800
 You would immediately understand,

257
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:43,280
 all details here would immediately make sense.

258
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:50,400
 The story goes, when Jesus says, "Someone will betray me."

259
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,600
 He said, "Among you 12, someone would betray me."

260
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,520
 Verse 22, the disciples look at each other,

261
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
 wondering whom he could mean.

262
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:05,560
 The disciple Jesus loved,

263
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,760
 probably John himself, right?

264
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,360
 He's the beloved disciple.

265
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,600
 He wrote the Gospel of John.

266
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,560
 He's the youngest guy.

267
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,680
 Now, how is he being described?

268
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,720
 The disciple Jesus loved John,

269
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,720
 was sitting next to Jesus at the table.

270
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:27,600
 Simon Peter motioned to him, motioned to John and asked,

271
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:30,400
 who is Jesus talking about?

272
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:35,400
 But why didn't Peter go ask Jesus himself?

273
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,960
 Well, the only reason is because in the triclinium,

274
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,280
 he's the farthest guy away from Jesus.

275
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,480
 He could not ask Jesus personally, individually.

276
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,600
 So he has to motion to John.

277
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,160
 John is right next to, actually in front of,

278
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:55,160
 on the right side, reclining in front of Jesus.

279
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,320
 So he motioned to him and asked,

280
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,680
 who is Jesus talking about?

281
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,880
 So that the disciple leaned over to Jesus,

282
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,880
 remember they're reclining,

283
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:09,240
 and asked, "Lord Jesus, who is it?

284
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,720
 "Who is it going to betray you?"

285
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,560
 Jesus respond, "It is the one to whom I give the bread

286
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,720
 "I dip in the bowl."

287
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,480
 And when Jesus had dip it, he gave it to Judas,

288
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,120
 not Peter, right?

289
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:27,520
 If he had to give it to Peter, he has to throw it over,

290
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:30,520
 right, give it next to Judas.

291
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,320
 So immediately you understand,

292
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:39,560
 the gospel description reflecting the local Roman,

293
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:44,240
 or Roman Jewish, you know, high class triclinium dining,

294
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,480
 you know, fashion.

295
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:49,680
 They're sitting around the U-shape, reclining,

296
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,720
 feet sticking out, right?

297
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:56,680
 And then the background give us, you know,

298
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:01,680
 some more, you know, some more ways to understand

299
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,920
 some of the biblical descriptions.

300
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,760
 And I think this background brings about

301
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,160
 some of the surprises in the story.

302
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,360
 Some of the big surprises.

303
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,120
 Perhaps the story is too familiar to us,

304
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:21,000
 and that sense of surprise, that sense of, you know,

305
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,840
 ha-ha, you know, it's gone.

306
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,520
 But let's revisit.

307
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,520
 You know, in those days, everybody wear sandals.

308
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,360
 Everybody wear sandals.

309
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,680
 Anyone wear sandals today?

310
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,320
 Open toes.

311
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,960
 You wear sandals and you go to the dining hall,

312
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:40,040
 from your home to the dining hall,

313
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,040
 your feet bound to pick up some dirt, right?

314
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,880
 Stinky feet, dirty feet.

315
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:51,640
 And foot washing in those days

316
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:56,400
 is a necessary part of dinner arrangement.

317
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,200
 You gotta have someone do the foot washing for you, right?

318
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,200
 Usually people of lowest ranking class,

319
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:12,400
 servants, slaves, women, or widows,

320
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:15,400
 they are being tasked to do such things.

321
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,760
 They are the waitress, they are the busboys,

322
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,560
 or they are the servers.

323
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,080
 So they are the foot washers as well.

324
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,720
 Now, then you can understand why

325
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:30,000
 in some of the gospel stories,

326
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,480
 talking about in the Last Supper,

327
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,440
 the disciples were arguing against one another,

328
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,120
 who is gonna be the greatest,

329
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,400
 and who is gonna be the least, right?

330
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,160
 Remember some of those stories?

331
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:43,080
 You know, why did they argue about it?

332
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,960
 Well, there's a practical need to argue about it.

333
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,440
 You know what I'm saying?

334
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,560
 Someone has to do foot washing, right?

335
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,920
 Now, Jesus is the host, He arranged the entire dinner.

336
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:58,600
 What He missed doing, He didn't do one thing right.

337
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,400
 Jesus didn't do one thing right.

338
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,360
 He did not arrange a servant among them.

339
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:06,120
 He did not hire a servant, right?

340
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,160
 He did get the Airbnb and get the dining hall ready,

341
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:12,200
 but nobody's gonna serve, right?

342
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:16,000
 So all the 12 disciples show up in the dining hall,

343
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,720
 what food is being served,

344
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,680
 but there's no one among us

345
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,360
 to do the most necessary part, right?

346
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:24,200
 Because our sandals, our feet,

347
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,560
 when we took off our sandals,

348
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:27,480
 our feet are full of dirt, right?

349
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:30,960
 And part of the manner of dining in Trichilium

350
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,400
 is to have your feet washed, right?

351
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:39,200
 Think about our culture, the dining custom.

352
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,440
 When we sit down in, say, a Chinese restaurant, right?

353
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,480
 What's the first thing that is necessary

354
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,400
 when you sit down?

355
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,600
 Tea.

356
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,040
 Somebody has to bring tea or ice water.

357
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,160
 Somebody has to do that, right?

358
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,600
 You expect that.

359
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,320
 It's kind of our cultural expectation or cultural values.

360
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:07,800
 In Jesus' day, around the Trichilium,

361
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:11,320
 people would expect the first thing.

362
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:14,680
 We come in, a servant will wash our feet, right?

363
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,320
 That's why they argue against one another.

364
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,240
 Who's gonna do it now, right?

365
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,120
 Oh, Jesus didn't, forgot probably,

366
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,000
 forgot to book a maid servant, right?

367
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,720
 And nobody would be so disrespectful

368
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,000
 and say, "Teacher, you missed something."

369
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,280
 Nobody would do that.

370
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
 That's why among the 12, they would have to argue.

371
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,160
 They have to figure out,

372
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,560
 "Hey, when we got to have our feet washed,

373
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,000
 "who's gonna be the one, right?"

374
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:49,040
 And then as they come to the table, surprise, surprise, right?

375
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:54,320
 Jesus put all the 12 in a clockwise position.

376
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,320
 On this right is youngest disciple, John.

377
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,680
 On his left is Judas.

378
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:04,600
 And then clockwise, and then to the last one,

379
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,920
 is Simon Peter.

380
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,240
 Now that's a surprise,

381
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,920
 because Peter has been the head among the 12, right?

382
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,040
 He is the best Sunday school student, right?

383
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,520
 He always answer the questions often wrong,

384
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,520
 but he's the most active student among the 12.

385
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,040
 And he's actually the one of the closest to Jesus.

386
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,640
 And surprise, surprise to Simon Peter.

387
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,640
 He's sitting right next to the door, the least position.

388
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:39,720
 The surprise is, Jesus is doing the foot washing.

389
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:45,080
 Jesus got up and he did it.

390
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,440
 And look at what Jesus did.

391
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,120
 Jesus knew that the Father had given him

392
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,560
 authority over everything,

393
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:56,400
 that he had come from God and would return to God soon.

394
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:02,280
 So Jesus got up from the table, from the triclinium.

395
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,880
 He took off his robe,

396
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:09,080
 wrapped a towel around his waist,

397
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,000
 and poured water into a basin.

398
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:17,160
 There, then he began to wash the feet of the disciples,

399
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,240
 and then dry them one by one with towel around him.

400
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,680
 Now, as you can tell, I highlight all the verbs here.

401
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,440
 If you read the Gospel of John from chapter one

402
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,040
 all the way to this chapter, chapter 13,

403
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:35,880
 you understand the narrator or the author,

404
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,120
 it's like a cameraman.

405
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,440
 It's like a cameraman.

406
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,720
 At this point, it was pretty fast

407
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,760
 from chapter one to chapter 12.

408
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,240
 Boom, boom, boom, miracles, miracles, miracles, miracles.

409
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,680
 And talking, talking, talking.

410
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:50,240
 All the controversials about Jesus,

411
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,000
 all the teachings about Jesus.

412
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:55,960
 One chapter after the other, pretty fast, pretty fast.

413
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:59,520
 And then come to chapter 13, it comes to a slow-mo.

414
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,400
 You know, just zoom in to the actions, right?

415
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,360
 You know, all the verbs, you know,

416
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,960
 just two verses, four and five.

417
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:12,760
 He rose, he lay aside, he took up a towel,

418
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,840
 he wrapped around his waist, poured water out,

419
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,080
 and then washed their feet, and wiped dry their feet.

420
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
 It is not domination.

421
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,000
 It is not Roman politics.

422
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,880
 It is servanthood.

423
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,480
 The greatest becomes the least.

424
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,680
 It's all about serving.

425
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,840
 Now, do not miss, please do not miss

426
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,720
 the significance of this story.

427
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,440
 It's not just a nice, warm story about servanthood,

428
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,400
 about Jesus washing the feet of a disciple.

429
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:54,080
 It's not just an act of servanthood.

430
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:56,640
 It foreshadows something else.

431
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,200
 It foreshadows something that's gonna happen soon,

432
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:03,080
 which is the crucifixion of Jesus.

433
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:08,560
 He took off his majesty.

434
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:11,960
 He stood up, he took it off,

435
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,000
 and he took on the form of servant,

436
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,120
 and then he died on the cross.

437
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:23,200
 He poured out his blood this time, pretty soon.

438
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:27,480
 On Calvary, not water, but like water,

439
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,960
 he poured out his blood to be the least.

440
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,120
 And remember in one of the seven words,

441
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,960
 one of seven last words of Jesus on the cross,

442
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:41,240
 one of them in the Gospel of John

443
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:45,280
 is that Jesus said, "I am thirsty."

444
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:50,880
 The living water become thirst.

445
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:55,280
 So foot washing is not just about serving.

446
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,440
 It points us forward, or what we call foreshadows,

447
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,160
 the cross.

448
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:05,360
 Jesus washing the feet of disciples is to prepare them

449
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:10,400
 what is he doing ultimately on the cross.

450
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,680
 That's the first point.

451
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:15,640
 The second point is that foot washing points

452
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,920
 toward the way of disciples,

453
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,320
 the way of how disciples should live.

454
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,720
 Now why do I say that?

455
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,400
 I mean, I think the point is obvious

456
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:30,040
 because in washing the feet of disciples,

457
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:35,040
 Jesus demonstrates so clearly the true meaning of service,

458
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,680
 or better, the better way to put it,

459
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,680
 is the true meaning of using his power.

460
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:46,400
 We all have power.

461
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,160
 We all have our rights, our privileges.

462
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:53,200
 You know, especially in American culture,

463
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,080
 we emphasize power.

464
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,000
 We emphasize our rights.

465
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,440
 Nothing wrong with that per se,

466
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,480
 but as we follow Christ,

467
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:09,000
 Christ gives us another way of using our power,

468
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,040
 using our rights.

469
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,680
 There are a few points we should point out

470
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,560
 in the last supper,

471
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,280
 especially in the triclinium arrangement.

472
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:23,280
 First, is that Jesus puts Judas in the seat of honor

473
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:29,080
 on his left, on his left.

474
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,360
 He took a piece of bread,

475
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:33,520
 dip it in the bowl,

476
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,800
 and give it to Judas.

477
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:40,400
 Judas is not sitting just on his left

478
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:44,160
 in the seat of honor,

479
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,800
 but for the very first time,

480
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,680
 or very last time,

481
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:51,200
 Jesus gives him one less reason to betray him.

482
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,040
 One less reason.

483
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:54,960
 Loving the enemy.

484
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:57,840
 Demonstrate clearly.

485
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,160
 Second point.

486
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,840
 I said John should be the youngest among the 12, right?

487
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,880
 Jesus put him first on his right.

488
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:13,160
 The youngest, the least, is put on the first.

489
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:19,160
 Third, Peter, far right, lower right,

490
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,080
 has been head of the 12,

491
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,920
 but now Jesus put him last.

492
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:29,120
 The entire Jesus triclinium arrangement

493
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:36,160
 is some sort of anti-Roman political story.

494
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:41,600
 Jesus said, "This is how you work in the Roman world,

495
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:45,400
 "but when you come around my table,

496
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,920
 "when you be my disciples,

497
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,080
 "we work in quite different ways."

498
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:54,640
 It's an upside-down world, right?

499
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,880
 Jesus turned the whole world upside down.

500
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,640
 The head would be the last, right?

501
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,800
 The first would be the least.

502
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:05,840
 The oldest would be the servant.

503
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,600
 You know, what does it talk about, discipleship?

504
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,200
 What does it talk about our church, right?

505
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,200
 We have a short series on being a healthy church, right?

506
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,360
 I think the most healthy church,

507
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,400
 most healthy church culture

508
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,120
 would be a culture of Jesus' triclinium,

509
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,560
 the Last Supper.

510
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,960
 When we come together,

511
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,960
 all powers are being reconfigured.

512
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,320
 Everything has changed.

513
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,280
 The configuration of structure,

514
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,160
 social, political power, spiritual power, or whatever.

515
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:51,800
 When you come to the table of Jesus, everything has changed

516
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:58,120
 because He came to serve, not to be served.

517
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:04,000
 There's a book, a very good book,

518
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,320
 written by Scott McKnight.

519
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,720
 He used to be a New Testament teacher

520
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:12,400
 at Northern Seminary, not too far away from us.

521
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:17,240
 He said, the title of the book is "A Church Called Tov."

522
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,840
 Okay, what is it?

523
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:22,120
 Tov is actually a Hebrew word, means good, goodness.

524
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:24,400
 All right, good, tov.

525
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:30,040
 So the book talks about a healthy church culture,

526
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,760
 a tov culture, a goodness culture.

527
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,640
 How do we form a goodness culture,

528
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,880
 especially in our generation?

529
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,760
 When people look at church

530
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,200
 or established religion,

531
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,400
 organized religion,

532
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,480
 they often look at church in a negative way.

533
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:55,560
 There's just so many horrible stories

534
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:58,800
 done in the name of God, in the name of the church.

535
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,560
 It's just sobering to hear all the stories.

536
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,240
 And Scott McKnight wrote this book,

537
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,040
 and he lays out four ways of power.

538
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,280
 He said the first way is power over.

539
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,600
 You have domination over other people.

540
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,400
 You're in charge, and other people listen to you.

541
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:22,320
 The second way is power to.

542
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:26,720
 You have the power to influence other people.

543
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,960
 And the third way is power with,

544
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,880
 to share the spotlight,

545
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,600
 to share power and your platform with other people.

546
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:42,080
 Let other people speak, let other people lead.

547
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,280
 Empower another person, right?

548
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:47,760
 Power with.

549
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:52,760
 But the ultimate form of, but but call, exercise of power,

550
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:57,080
 Jesus' way, is power for.

551
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,960
 That's what Jesus did.

552
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,680
 He demonstrated to his disciples,

553
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,960
 to serve, but not to be served.

554
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,960
 The greatest shall be the last.

555
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,360
 Greatest shall be the least.

556
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,920
 Now, some of the homework that I wanna give to you.

557
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:17,840
 What does it mean to apply,

558
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,120
 to use our power and use it for, you know, power for?

559
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:25,960
 Couple of points.

560
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,520
 First, forgiveness.

561
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,720
 Have you ever thought about forgiveness as an act of power?

562
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:38,240
 You decide to forgive someone who has wronged you.

563
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:40,640
 It is an act of power.

564
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:45,800
 And biblical forgiveness is an exercise of power for.

565
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:49,120
 You decide not to retaliate.

566
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,640
 You decide to forgive, just like Jesus did.

567
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,320
 Forgiveness.

568
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,960
 Second, giving.

569
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,320
 Giving is also exercise of power for, right?

570
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,640
 Instead of taking.

571
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,760
 Taking, accumulating, is power over.

572
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,200
 But in the biblical lifestyle, in discipleship,

573
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,200
 we ought to exercise and continue to exercise power for.

574
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,800
 To give is an act of power for other people,

575
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,760
 for the church, for other ministries.

576
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,120
 Third, serving.

577
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:35,680
 Serving definitely, ministry definitely, is powerful.

578
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:39,600
 Let me ask you a question, a very quick question.

579
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,600
 Have you ever done anything to serve other people lately

580
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,920
 without telling anyone?

581
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:50,400
 Without telling anyone, even your wife or husband,

582
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:52,680
 your best friend, nobody knows.

583
00:34:52,680 --> 00:34:57,840
 You give, you do something for other people, you know?

584
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:00,160
 (audience laughing)

585
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,000
 Powerful.

586
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,200
 That is the way of discipleship.

587
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,280
 That's how we should act.

588
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,280
 That is the whole point of Jesus' foot washing

589
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,640
 for the disciples.

590
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,080
 Let me close with one very short quote, okay?

591
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,920
 Very short quote.

592
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:24,920
 Back in the 1700s, 1700s, 200 some years ago,

593
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,160
 there was a German missionary.

594
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,080
 His name is Sensendorf.

595
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,600
 It's not very well known.

596
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,760
 Nobody would have interest to know about his life

597
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,720
 or what he did.

598
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:43,800
 But there's one saying that he said

599
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,720
 that has been echoed

600
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:52,800
 or has touched so many lives.

601
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:58,520
 To remind people what it means to follow Jesus Christ,

602
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,160
 what it means to be his disciples,

603
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,760
 what is the purpose of our life

604
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,680
 as we commit our life to Jesus Christ himself,

605
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,720
 to be Christ's follower.

606
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,560
 What does it mean?

607
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,440
 What is the ultimate purpose?

608
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,240
 And I wanna end today's sermon with this quote.

609
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:14,440
 It's a very short quote.

610
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:21,080
 The quote said, "Preach the gospel, die, be forgotten."

611
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,560
 Be forgotten.

612
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:30,080
 That is the ultimate goal of Christian discipleship.

613
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,040
 Now, we don't have any problem

614
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,920
 with preaching the gospel usually, right?

615
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,480
 Probably we are afraid of doing so,

616
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:43,120
 but that's not a big issue, preaching the gospel.

617
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:47,440
 And we usually have no problem dying, right?

618
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,520
 Someday you die, someday I die, right?

619
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,480
 You have to die, you know, someday.

620
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:56,200
 Usually you have no problem with the second part.

621
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,840
 Usually we have problem with the last part, the third one.

622
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:00,680
 Be forgotten.

623
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
 You wanna do something

624
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:06,040
 and you wanna prolong so-called your name, right?

625
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:08,400
 Your reputation or your power.

626
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,680
 But this story in John 13

627
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:19,680
 tells the ultimate purpose for discipleship.

628
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,080
 Follow Christ.

629
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,120
 It's not about us.

630
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,200
 It's not about us being served

631
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,640
 or us being, you know, feeling good.

632
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,560
 It's about us doing something to respond

633
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,560
 to the grace of God with our life

634
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,080
 and ultimately be forgotten.

635
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:42,120
 And that's okay.

636
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,320
 Let's work on it.

637
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,600
 Give our life back to God,

638
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:50,320
 God who save us, who redeem us.

639
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:53,200
 And let's work for His glory,

640
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,720
 for God's name, not my name, not your name,

641
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,200
 not even our church's name, not our ministry's name,

642
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,240
 but for the name of God.

643
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,800
 Let God's name be glorified.

644
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,120
 Let Him get glory and we be forgotten.

645
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,320
 Let's pray.

646
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:14,080
 Father God, we give you thanks

647
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:18,880
 because you have demonstrated your love to us.

648
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,080
 You are the one who is greatest

649
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:27,760
 and you willingly, sacrificially lay down your majesty

650
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,320
 to come into our midst,

651
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,200
 took on the form of humans,

652
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:38,440
 took on the form of servant, slave.

653
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,480
 You pour out your life to save us, to redeem us,

654
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,440
 to bring us back to our Father.

655
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,680
 And we want to give you thanks.

656
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:51,240
 I pray that this is our prayer,

657
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:56,080
 to do the work, to preach your gospel.

658
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:01,120
 Then we die and it's okay to be forgotten

659
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:06,480
 because ultimately your name is what matters

660
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,960
 in Jesus' name.

661
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:12,300
