[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   - Hey, Chris, it's CEO.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.040]   And today, I would like to end this three-part series
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.800]   on some reflections on the Israel-Palestine conflict.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.280]   If you are following the news stories,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.760]   this conflict is still going on
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.360]   with ground invasion from Israel.
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.080]   And there were a lot of people who lost their lives,
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.680]   and many of them, over 50% of them in Gaza,
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.240]   were children and women.
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.240]   So this is very tragic.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.120]   But we'll take this conflict
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.840]   in light of this current conflict,
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.460]   and we ask the question, what we can reflect upon.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.340]   We know that ideas do have consequences.
[00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.720]   Theology matters.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.360]   Your understanding of God and faith
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.200]   in the Bible is critical.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.200]   If we have a truncated understanding of faith
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.400]   or the Bible or God,
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.320]   it will trickle down into our daily life,
[00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.920]   and it will affect us.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:00.960]   Let me give you some example.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.400]   If you believed God to be a tiger parent,
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.840]   any one of you have a tiger mom or tiger dad?
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.840]   If you believe God is like that,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.480]   tiger parent, stern and straight,
[00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.200]   it's probably very difficult for you to translate
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.040]   grace and joy in your own life, right?
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.280]   If you constantly think that God,
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.320]   in that kind of image, stern and straight,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.880]   tiger parent, always a righteous judge,
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.920]   it's pretty difficult to live a graceful life.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.240]   And/or if you think that the Bible
[00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.720]   is a moral book of legal demands,
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.720]   there are hundreds of laws or legalistic demands,
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.080]   lists of do's and don'ts in the Bible,
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:49.640]   then you probably have two options.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.400]   One option is to be a Pharisee, right?
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   A Pharisee would come up with a list of manageable works,
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.280]   of good works, that he can attend to.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.040]   He can do all of this do's and don'ts
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.200]   and feel good about himself, right?
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.040]   It's a self-righteousness.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.360]   Or the other option is that you live hopelessly,
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800]   and there's no way you can match the standard of God.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.040]   You always feel you're not good enough,
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   and grace is so far away from you, right?
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.080]   So what I'm saying is ideas do have consequences,
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.080]   and our understanding of God should be growing, right?
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.000]   We get a better understanding of the Bible.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.960]   So in this, in the light of this conflict,
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.720]   we ask the question, what can we reflect upon?
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.760]   And one idea we often encounter in the news story
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.200]   is that God seems to have two peoples.
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.080]   One is the Gentiles.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.960]   The other one is the Jews.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.800]   So it seems to be that God has two plans, right?
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   Plan A is to save the chosen people, so-called,
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.000]   ethnic Israel or ethnic Jewish people.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.480]   And then plan B is to save the Gentiles, right?
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.360]   And we are Gentiles, right?
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.520]   We are non-Jews.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.440]   Ethnically, we are not Jews.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.240]   So there is a popular theory that God has two plans,
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.840]   plan A for Jews and plan B for Gentiles.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.840]   And so it ends up God has two distinct peoples.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.720]   Is that really true?
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.400]   Is that really biblical?
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.040]   Now, if we think that God has two plans,
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.880]   if we think that God has two peoples,
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   and one of the two peoples has more privileges, right?
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.840]   They are kind of a superior people, right?
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.600]   Being chosen, right?
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.760]   And the other one, the Gentiles,
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.120]   you know, they kind of did plan B, right?
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.320]   So plan A was to save one kind of people.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.320]   And if that kind of people remain unbelief,
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.320]   the gospel spilled out to the rest of the secondary people,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.040]   right?
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.960]   If we think that way, this idea has consequences.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.960]   We will see one people superior,
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.360]   the other people inferior.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:21.960]   So we have to examine that kind of notion,
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.760]   one for the ethnic Jews and one for the Gentiles.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.480]   Is that really correct?
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.480]   So we have to go into a big passage in Romans 9 to 11,
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:36.120]   three chapters long.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:38.280]   So in the letter of Romans,
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.960]   Paul is trying to explain to us
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.440]   what it means to be in Christ.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.880]   We are standing in Christ,
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.680]   that means we are fully righteous,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.480]   not because of what we have done,
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.240]   but what Jesus has done for us on the cross.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.960]   So chapter one to chapter eight,
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.840]   he's trying to expand what it means
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.400]   to believe in the gospel.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.720]   It's all about Jesus Christ.
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.400]   It's not about us.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.760]   And then in 9 to 11,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.960]   he's trying to tackle another tricky question.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:13.000]   The Roman Christians might have been asking,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.240]   and to understand these three chapters,
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.680]   we have to understand some sort of background
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:23.000]   of the Book of Romans and the city of Rome
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.640]   in that time period, in the first century,
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.440]   especially mid first century.
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.920]   What is going on there?
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.400]   What we can do is that we can outline three things.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.800]   And the first thing, as you can see on the screen,
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.840]   most Roman Christians were Gentiles at that time.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:40.720]   So they lived in the city of Rome,
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.560]   they gathered in small groups in the bigger homes,
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.280]   and they constitute the early church in the city of Rome.
[00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.240]   But most of them are non-Jews, Gentiles.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.600]   And then we know that in the city of Rome,
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.280]   especially in the first century,
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.400]   there was a wave of anti-Semitism.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.600]   People just don't like the Jews.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.880]   And that kind of feeling,
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.680]   that kind of atmosphere was very, very strong.
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.680]   And in fact, we know that some of the Roman Empire policy
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.980]   would kick out some of the Jews out of the city of Rome.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.880]   And that kind of public policy will feed
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.880]   into that kind of anti-Semitic atmosphere.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.360]   With that, you can understand some of the Gentile Christians
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:32.760]   coming to the church, they thought that we are better.
[00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:35.160]   And the Jews are being kicked out, right?
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:36.800]   Being discriminated.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.680]   And the Gentile Christian would have thought
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.320]   that God's plan for the Jews was over,
[00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:43.800]   it's game over for them.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.160]   Now, they ask questions like,
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.440]   we are the people of God, we are the Gentiles.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.640]   And there were no more Jews, right?
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.360]   They may feel that, or imagine that they are better,
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:02.360]   they feel superior, and they became arrogant.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.560]   We are Gentiles, we win.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.240]   And the Jews are being kicked out,
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:09.360]   and God's plan for them, God's saving grace for them
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.600]   is game over.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.480]   Because, as you can tell,
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.740]   how many Jews were in the early church?
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.360]   Not many, right?
[00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:23.260]   But the foundational population of Christians
[00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:27.140]   in the early church were Jewish Christians.
[00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.360]   And then, as the church spread to other places
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:33.280]   in the Roman Empire, more and more Gentile Christians
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:36.080]   came into the church, and they became the majority,
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.600]   and the minority was the Jews.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   So, Gentile Christians having some sense of superiority
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:49.280]   with the culture around them, antisemitism.
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.000]   So, Paul is trying to write in this three chapters,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.720]   nine to 11, trying to address this problem.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:08:00.560]   Paul argues that, yes, only a handful of Jewish Christians
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.640]   in the early church.
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.660]   But don't forget, they are the foundational people.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.700]   Remember, Apostle Paul, Peter, James, and John,
[00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:15.700]   all these early disciples, they were all Jewish Christians.
[00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:16.840]   They are the foundation.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.080]   But yes, only a handful of them believe in Jesus Christ,
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.040]   and the majority of the church people are Gentiles.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:27.640]   But Paul argues that this does not mean
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:30.320]   God's plan has failed.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.000]   So, 9-6, he says, "It is not as though God's word
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   "had failed, for not all who are descended from Israel
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.800]   "are Israel."
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.880]   What the heck is he talking about, right?
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.960]   Israel in two different senses, right?
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:49.600]   So, we can imagine two circles, right?
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.080]   Two circles, the big one is the ethnic Israel.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.140]   All the people who are descended from the forefathers
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:58.300]   of Israel, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:02.140]   they constitute the ethnic Israel at large.
[00:09:02.140 --> 00:09:06.020]   But there's a smaller circle inside, the true Israel.
[00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:08.800]   They believe Jesus as the Messiah,
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.200]   so-called the Messianic Jews today.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:16.880]   They embrace Jesus as the Messiah.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.000]   They're not waiting for another Messiah.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.280]   They know Jesus on the cross and from the empty tomb,
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.640]   He is the Messiah.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:25.040]   So, they believe in Jesus,
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.280]   and they call on the name of Christ.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.280]   So, they constitute the true Israel, the believing Jews.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.280]   So, Paul is saying,
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:40.680]   not everyone descended from Israel, ethnic Israel,
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.580]   is the true Israel.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.720]   And as I told you in the early church,
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:53.320]   some of the most important people were Jewish.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:56.360]   Paul, Peter, James, and John, et cetera.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:10:01.360]   So, Paul is trying to argue that God's plan for the Jews
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.280]   is not over, it's not over.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   Because see, there are true Israel, the remaining Israel,
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:13.980]   the believing Jewish people, they are still with us.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.720]   Because what matters is not whether they're ethnically
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.600]   related to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.120]   What matters is that they are standing in Christ.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.640]   10, nine, familiar verse.
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.700]   If you confess with your mouth, Jesus is Lord,
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:33.080]   and believe in your heart that God raised Jesus
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.880]   from the dead, you will be saved.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.260]   Verse 12.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.960]   See, there's no difference, there's no difference
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.060]   between Jew and Gentile.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.640]   The same Lord is Lord of all, and richly blesses
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.760]   all who call on His name.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:54.560]   So, God's plan for His original chosen people
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.200]   is not over.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.440]   Paul is saying, look at the true Israel.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:01.720]   Yes, they are the minority, but they are still there.
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.720]   Right?
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:04.840]   And then, in these three chapters,
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.640]   Paul moves on to an analogy,
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:13.620]   and the analogy is the olive tree.
[00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:16.120]   So, here's my amazing artwork here.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:20.020]   As you can tell, there's one olive tree,
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:25.280]   and God has not rejected His people, the ethnic Jews.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.720]   There's still a future for them,
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:32.000]   because God's saving grace is for all, right?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   He will execute His plan.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.280]   So, here's just this analogy.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.120]   There are a few things I'd like to point out
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.040]   from this amazing artwork, is that the root of the tree,
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:44.480]   the stem of the tree, is the Old Testament Israel,
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.340]   the Jewish people.
[00:11:46.340 --> 00:11:50.920]   Salvation is from them, and Jesus, by the way, was Jewish.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.080]   Right?
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.720]   He was 100% Jewish.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.320]   The root of the tree is the Old Testament Israel,
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.920]   and then there are natural branches.
[00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:05.560]   On the left, the green ones, are the believing Jews.
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.360]   Paul, Peter, James, and John, and all that.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.960]   But some of the natural branches have been broken off.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.400]   Lower right.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:16.840]   They have been broken off because of their unbelief,
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:19.160]   because they hardened their heart.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:21.640]   So, those are the unbelieving Jews.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.080]   They are being broken off.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:28.640]   However, from another tree, the Gentiles are being
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.280]   crafted in.
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.040]   They are from another tree, from the wild olive shoots,
[00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:41.020]   taken from the other tree and crafted into the one tree,
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:43.060]   the olive tree.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:46.400]   Now, this famous olive tree speaks of God's
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.840]   undeserved grace.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.300]   We don't deserve, if we are Gentiles,
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:55.740]   we don't deserve to be crafted in to the tree of salvation.
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.000]   Remember in Rome, the Gentiles were bragging about
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.440]   the fact that we are the majority, and the Jews are gone.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.660]   Right?
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:07.680]   It's game over for them.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:10.060]   That's what the Gentiles was thinking.
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:15.060]   But this tree analogy is trying to present to us grace.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:18.320]   It's because of grace we are being crafted in.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.060]   11, 17.
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:25.400]   Paul says, "If some of the natural branches have been
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.400]   "broken off, and you, although you are wild olive shoots,
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.040]   "have been crafted in among the others,
[00:13:34.040 --> 00:13:39.040]   "and now share the nourishing sap from the main olive root,
[00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:44.020]   "do not boast over those natural branches.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.480]   "Do not think we are being crafted in so we are better,
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.820]   "so we are in a better place in terms of grace."
[00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:51.800]   No.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   Paul says, "Do not boast over those natural branches.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.000]   "If you do consider this, you do not support the root,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.080]   "but vice versa, the root supports you."
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:06.080]   Right?
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:08.960]   We share the salvation.
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.600]   We are being called the people of God.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:13.120]   We are Gentiles.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.120]   Don't boast about the fact that, okay, we are the majority,
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:19.480]   and the minority is over.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.240]   The Jews is over.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:23.240]   Now, two questions here.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:25.000]   How many olive tree is there?
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.040]   How many?
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:29.640]   One.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.960]   There's only one.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.380]   So there's only one people of God,
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:35.760]   not two peoples of God, right?
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.440]   One tree, two kinds of branches,
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.840]   the natural and the wildly crafted, right?
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:45.000]   Second, where are you?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.900]   We are the Gentiles.
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.240]   We are the yellow, right?
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.240]   On the right.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.640]   We are not the natural branches,
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.920]   but by grace, we are being crafted in.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.560]   So the olive tree speaks of God's grace to all of us,
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.640]   especially the Gentiles.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:02.600]   Us, all of us, every one of us.
[00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:05.880]   We are being called the sons and daughters of God,
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:09.480]   being crafted into the people of God.
[00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.800]   It's all because, not because we are better,
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.200]   and it's not because they are worse.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:17.440]   It's because of the grace of God.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:20.280]   We enjoy the blessing, the relationship with God,
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.720]   and thank God for his saving grace, right?
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.720]   And there should be not boasting, but gratitude.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:32.800]   We can come before God as his people.
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.680]   We should be thankful,
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:37.440]   thankful for what Jesus has done for us.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.800]   At the same time, Paul is arguing
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.720]   that God's plan for the Jews
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:43.960]   is yet to come.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.640]   It's not a game over for the Jews.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.360]   God's promised to save many of those unbelieving Jews,
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   and it is yet to come, 1125.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.080]   Paul said, "I do not want you to be ignorant
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.960]   "of this mystery."
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:04.680]   Now he's like opening the lid of the pot,
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:05.920]   and you can see inside,
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.120]   there's a spiritual mystery yet to come.
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:10.080]   He said, "Brother and sisters,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.960]   "so that you may not be conceited,
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.640]   "Israel has experienced a hardening in part."
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:20.320]   Part of the people are being hard-hearted,
[00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:24.400]   not believing Christ as, or Jesus as the Messiah.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.880]   "Until the full number of Gentiles has come in,
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.080]   "and so all Israel will be saved."
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:35.560]   All right, this is a very, very difficult verse,
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.400]   and one thing you need to know is that,
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:41.200]   first thing is there's a mystery.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.200]   There's a future unseen, not unfold yet,
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:49.800]   that is so all Israel will be saved.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.000]   Now, one thing you need to understand,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.680]   first, the key word here.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:01.680]   The word all does not mean each and every single Jew.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.520]   Now, how do we know that?
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:07.880]   This is obvious because if you check the Old Testament,
[00:17:07.880 --> 00:17:12.560]   many times it uses the phrase all Israel,
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:13.840]   and many times from the context,
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.560]   you know that it does not mean,
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:20.440]   and cannot mean every, each Israelite.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:23.080]   It simply means many of them,
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.760]   representative number of them.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:28.480]   And secondly, there's an adverb here,
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.720]   so, NIV translate, so, S-O.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:35.920]   ESV has it in this way,
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.000]   or in this manner,
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.480]   or in the same manner.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:43.840]   Now, the word translation is very important here.
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.040]   You know, ESV or NIV are right on,
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:48.400]   especially ESV.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.440]   In this way, in a similar manner.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.920]   Now, what does it mean?
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:58.920]   This adverb, so, or in this way,
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:05.320]   does not mean a straight sequential order.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.920]   It does not mean, okay, A happen,
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.320]   and then B happen.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:14.360]   So, cross that.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:16.320]   It does not mean the full number of Gentiles
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.080]   come in to the church.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:21.880]   We count one billion, two billion, three billion, and seven.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:25.760]   Done, and then all Israel will be saved.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.440]   No, it does not mean that,
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.440]   because that adverb is not a straightly sequential adverb.
[00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:38.200]   What it means is that, it is trying to show you
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.120]   it is in the like manner.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.960]   Now, what does it mean?
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:44.160]   Look at the bottom of the slide.
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.200]   The yellow line is the full number of Gentiles
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:51.320]   being crafted into the church in the human history.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.080]   In the last 2,000 plus years,
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:57.160]   Gentiles from here and there,
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.600]   here and there, generation to generation,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.080]   are being crafted.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.520]   God's saving grace becomes reality
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.280]   to each and every one of them.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:08.560]   And the full number of Gentiles will be crafted, right,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.960]   in the entire human history between the first coming
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:12.600]   and the second coming of Christ.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.400]   That's the yellow line.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.880]   And Paul said, "In this way, in the same manner,
[00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:23.880]   "all Israel, all true Israel, will be saved."
[00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.680]   So, the green line.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:28.720]   So, it's not sequential, full number, boom, done,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.960]   and then B happen.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:35.800]   It's actually happening the same time, in the same manner.
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.000]   So, all Israel, true Israel, will be saved
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   because God is choosing and saving
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.800]   from generation to generation,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:45.640]   from different times and space,
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   different places here and there,
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.640]   and save them to be God's true people, true Israel.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.720]   So, that's the amazing thing about God's grace.
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.320]   We, the Gentiles, we can be God's people.
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.000]   You can be God's people.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.780]   Not because we are naturally related,
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:11.780]   not because of blood relation, not because of ethnicity.
[00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:17.540]   We are saved because faith alone in Jesus Christ.
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:21.480]   If we confess with our heart and our lips
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.740]   that Jesus is Lord, then we are saved.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:26.280]   It is by grace.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.000]   It's by faith alone.
[00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.300]   Now, no other verses in the entire New Testament
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:36.940]   is more clear than this one, Galatians 3.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.960]   It says about Gentile Christians,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.060]   Paul says, "You are all sons of God
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:43.540]   through faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.000]   All of you who were baptized in Christ
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.140]   have clothed yourself with Christ.
[00:20:48.140 --> 00:20:50.620]   The image of Christ is on us,
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:54.340]   and there's neither Jew nor Greek."
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.640]   It really doesn't matter.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:21:00.640]   Your ethnicity, slave or free, economic status,
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:05.620]   male or female, gender, for you are in Christ.
[00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.120]   You are all one in Christ.
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:10.840]   If you belong to Christ, you are the seed of Abraham.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.180]   You are the children of Abraham.
[00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.180]   Not because of ethnicity, but because of faith.
[00:21:16.180 --> 00:21:20.020]   You have the same faith with Abraham's faith.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.780]   So, you are heir according to the promise of God.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.720]   Now, by the way, this is not replacement theology, right?
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:29.480]   If you know that kind of word,
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:35.220]   that means church is replacing the original people of God.
[00:21:35.220 --> 00:21:36.980]   No, it's not replacement.
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:41.080]   It is fulfillment, fulfill in Christ.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.740]   That's what the apostle says in Romans 9 to 11.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.820]   God's plan is still going on.
[00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:52.500]   Yes, there's only a handful of Jews believing in Christ,
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:55.060]   but God's plan will continue.
[00:21:55.060 --> 00:21:59.100]   It's a mystery, but it's active.
[00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:04.980]   And God's plan continues to unfold in humanity,
[00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.740]   in human history.
[00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:09.060]   His saving goal, His saving plan
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.260]   will continue to be accomplished.
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:16.820]   And that is amazing because God's mysterious plan
[00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:19.340]   for the future, for His people,
[00:22:19.340 --> 00:22:22.480]   for you and for me continues to unfold.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.260]   If we think about that,
[00:22:25.260 --> 00:22:30.760]   now we understand why Paul ends these three chapters
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:34.400]   with doxology, with praises.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.420]   That's the end of chapter 11.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.020]   He says, "Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:46.260]   "and knowledge of God, how unsearchable His judgments,
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.900]   "His paths, the paths of God beyond tracing out."
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:52.580]   There's no way we can comprehend the future.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:57.580]   There's no way we can advise God what He is doing.
[00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:00.180]   We just cannot comprehend
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:02.600]   because the riches of God's wisdom.
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:05.960]   "Who has known the mind of the Lord?
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.640]   "Who has been His counselor?" 35.
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:13.080]   "Who has ever given to God that God should repay him?
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:16.720]   "For from Him, through Him, to Him are all things to Him.
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.040]   "Be the glory forever, amen."
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:22.800]   He just end this passage with doxology,
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.000]   praising God together.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.500]   That's the response song here.
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:30.920]   He just cannot keep it to himself.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.640]   Paul, when he thinks about the plan of God,
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.420]   unsearchable plan and mysterious plan,
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:41.600]   he just wanna praise God and continue to serve Him.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.200]   Sometimes we don't see the future.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:52.080]   The future seems unknown to us.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:58.320]   Or even we feel confused about what the heck God is doing
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.760]   in the future.
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:03.400]   That is what the Roman church was struggling with.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:06.980]   And Paul burst out with worship and praise
[00:24:06.980 --> 00:24:09.000]   and say that, "Yes, we don't quite know
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.100]   "where God is leading.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:12.520]   "We don't quite see the future.
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:17.520]   "We cannot just fast forward one year from now,
[00:24:17.520 --> 00:24:20.320]   "six months from now, six years from now,
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:22.960]   "or 10 years from now, what will be unfold?
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.840]   "We just don't know yet.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.520]   "It's mysterious to us."
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:31.520]   But that does not mean God is not actively doing His purpose.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.600]   Remember this line?
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:37.560]   I'm sure you heard of it.
[00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.320]   Never place a period where God has placed a comma.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.140]   God is still working in the world,
[00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:50.060]   saving the Gentiles, saving the Jews, saving us.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:56.560]   And indeed, God's working in our life,
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:25:00.160]   sometimes it seems mysterious.
[00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:05.060]   But the fact that it's mysterious is unknown to us,
[00:25:05.060 --> 00:25:10.060]   should not and must not limit the possibilities of God.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:13.440]   God's plan in the world continues.
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:15.520]   It continues to unfold.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.120]   And that's why after this doxology,
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.860]   Paul urges us in chapter 12,
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:25.200]   "Therefore," see the connection here?
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:30.100]   "God's plan is unsearchable yet active.
[00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:32.940]   "God's purpose is going to continue.
[00:25:32.940 --> 00:25:38.220]   "It is not a period, it's a comma.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:43.140]   "God continues to orchestrate things for His glory.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:45.220]   "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters,
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:47.240]   "in view of the mercy of God,
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.440]   "to offer your whole life, your whole body,
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:55.880]   "as living sacrifices, holy and pleasing to God.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.960]   "This is your spiritual act of worship.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.900]   "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:06.300]   "Do not think according to the culture,
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.560]   "according to the world,
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:11.720]   "but be transformed by renewing our mind."
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.520]   Dig into the word, study the word of God,
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.620]   and see what God is doing in the past,
[00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:21.520]   what God is doing in Christ.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.280]   And we will be amazed that God's plan is mysterious,
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.760]   but yet His plan continues to unfold.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.060]   Praise God.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:34.880]   Praise God.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.620]   "To Him, through Him, to Him are all things.
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.340]   "To Him be the glory forever."
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:47.420]   That should encourage us to continue to serve our mighty God.
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:53.980]   No matter what, offer our whole life as living sacrifice
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:57.340]   to worship Him, to follow Christ,
[00:26:57.340 --> 00:27:01.480]   not the world, but our Savior, Messiah.
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:05.080]   We're gonna sing the last song.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:10.080]   And I pray that this song will be a prayer for all of us.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.060]   Thank God for all the times, good or bad,
[00:27:14.060 --> 00:27:18.420]   continue to serve Him and follow Him.
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:20.360]   Let's pray.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.400]   Father, once again,
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.820]   we acknowledge that we are so limited in our sight.
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.340]   We can only see a few things.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.100]   A few minutes ahead of us.
[00:27:34.100 --> 00:27:39.060]   We can plan, we can worry about the future,
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:45.380]   but yet your word reminds us that you are the active agent.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:51.180]   You continue to work for your glory,
[00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:55.100]   saving Jews and Gentiles alike,
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.460]   saving all of us in Christ.
[00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.800]   Yes, life is full of mystery,
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.700]   but we know they are all commerce.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:11.580]   You have not put periods in our life journey.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:18.380]   Your plan, your purpose continues to unfold in our life.
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:24.060]   In the midst of uncertainty, in the midst of unknowns,
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.940]   pray that you will increase our faith
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:28.900]   to see how amazing you are,
[00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:33.580]   how rich and unsearchable your plan is.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:37.900]   To you be all the glory in Christ, we pray.
