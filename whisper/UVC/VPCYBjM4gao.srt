1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 - Well, yes, so this Thursday, you're welcome to join us

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,160
 for the barbecue hangout, all right?

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,500
 We'll make sure you have good meat, okay?

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:16,280
 I'm going to Costco tomorrow, so we'll shop enough food

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:19,040
 for all the people, but you have to RSVP, okay?

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:23,080
 You have to tell me, or maybe Amanda, too.

7
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:25,480
 You can tell her that you are coming, okay?

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,400
 So we know you have to feed your stomach,

9
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,120
 we have to prepare fireworks for you, okay?

10
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:33,400
 We will have some fireworks for you, okay?

11
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:36,840
 Just a little bit, so don't burn down my house.

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,840
 Well, being Asian, every July 4th is a very interesting day.

13
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:44,920
 My neighbors, most of them are different ethnic background,

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,760
 and they spend quite a bit on fireworks.

15
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:51,560
 But I'm Asian, so I don't do this stuff.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,920
 But it's going to be fun, though, right?

17
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,800
 We'll do a little bit, okay?

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,560
 We're going to have fun Thursday, Thursday evening, all right?

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,160
 Again, I want to remind you to pray for one another.

20
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,360
 We're going to start a new series on back to basics.

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,160
 What does it mean, back to basics?

22
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:15,200
 You know, in our daily life,

23
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,360
 there are a lot of basic principles we have to master, right?

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,440
 Anyone do workout from time to time, or regularly, anyone?

25
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,880
 Only a few hands, okay, great, great, okay, back there, too.

26
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,280
 All right, good, good, good, yeah.

27
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,720
 There are some basics you have to master, right?

28
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:36,000
 There are some basics in terms of diet,

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,960
 in terms of what you take in, and how you work out,

30
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,400
 and all the activities have some sort of basic principles.

31
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:47,120
 Anyone plays music instruments here?

32
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,320
 Music instruments, yeah.

33
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,800
 You remember in those days when you learn

34
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,880
 to operate an instrument,

35
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,240
 a musical instrument, make good sound out of it,

36
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,240
 there are some principles or some basic exercise

37
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,720
 you have to just drill, right?

38
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,680
 It's boring, but in order to do it well,

39
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,320
 in order to enjoy it, you have to master the basics.

40
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:16,440
 And I have this idea about back to basics series

41
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:19,560
 because I saw this picture not too long ago.

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:22,480
 And someone posted on social media,

43
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,360
 it's talking about a building,

44
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,240
 you know, a high rise or the taller the building,

45
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,920
 the deeper the foundation is needed, right?

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,360
 The foundations cannot be seen.

47
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,400
 It is underground, right?

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,000
 Many, many feet underground, many meters underground.

49
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,640
 And you have to build that foundation solid enough

50
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,320
 and deep enough in order to build up your life, right?

51
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,600
 Story after story so that the building

52
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,560
 will not easily damage or collapse.

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,960
 So, you know, talking about architectural terms,

54
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,880
 you need the basics, right?

55
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:02,280
 You need the foundation.

56
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,040
 Talking about a spiritual life,

57
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,840
 talking about your relationship with God, right?

58
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,400
 All of us who are in Christ,

59
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,560
 all of us who are following Christ Jesus our Lord,

60
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,480
 we begin our spiritual life from the first moment

61
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,200
 we came to know Christ.

62
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,800
 And from the first moment we came to know Christ,

63
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,920
 we know that the spiritual life needs our,

64
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,080
 need us to master the basic.

65
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,360
 The basic things in our spiritual life are necessary

66
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,480
 so that you can continue to enjoy

67
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,000
 your relationship with God,

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,800
 so that you can continue to grow in faith,

69
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,680
 solid faith in Christ.

70
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,600
 So this is part one of the series

71
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,200
 and I have two important points.

72
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,480
 First point is the importance of the Word of God.

73
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,360
 Second point is the power, the strength of the Word of God.

74
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,240
 Now it's very simple when you think about the Word of God

75
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,920
 as something basic for Christian living,

76
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,880
 for our following of Jesus Christ,

77
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,480
 our spiritual relationship with God.

78
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,320
 The Word of God.

79
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:20,040
 You cannot do without the Bible.

80
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,080
 We are people of the book, all right?

81
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,560
 We are people of the book.

82
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,880
 We need to understand the Bible.

83
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,000
 We need to enjoy reading the Word

84
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,240
 or train ourselves so that we can understand

85
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,920
 the biblical messages in the Bible.

86
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,640
 Now everyone has a Bible today, right?

87
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,200
 You just download an app, right?

88
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,160
 And you've got all the versions in the world.

89
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:51,120
 Whatever languages you have or you master,

90
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,640
 you can read the Bible in almost,

91
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,200
 almost, actually many of the known languages.

92
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,960
 So think about the Word of God.

93
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,360
 How important that is.

94
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,880
 You think about the Bible,

95
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,280
 there are many, many passages talking about

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,280
 the importance of the Word of God in our lives.

97
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,120
 New Testament or Old Testament.

98
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,520
 Let me give you some samples.

99
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,960
 1 Peter 2, verse one.

100
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,640
 So put away all malice and all deceit

101
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:27,440
 and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.

102
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,360
 Those are the values of the old life.

103
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,240
 Before we came to Christ, put away all the sins.

104
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:41,280
 And Peter said, like newborn infants, newborn infants,

105
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,080
 long for pure spiritual milk,

106
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,360
 that by it you may grow up in salvation.

107
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,960
 If indeed you have taste, that the Lord is good.

108
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:55,960
 Like a newborn babies, right?

109
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,880
 We have tons of babies out there, right?

110
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,480
 Oh man, they are noisy, right?

111
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,200
 Whenever I see them, you know,

112
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,840
 I remember the many, many years ago,

113
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,440
 I have my son and daughter and you know,

114
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,320
 I have to give them milk, right?

115
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,400
 I have to take care of them.

116
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,480
 And what they yearn for is something to grow, right?

117
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:23,040
 Now, Rachel and Nathan are adults now, right?

118
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:27,400
 You know how heavy they are?

119
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,000
 I cannot pick them up now, right?

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,160
 They're more than 100 pounds, right?

121
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,080
 120 pounds, 30 pounds or even.

122
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,440
 Well, how did they grow up?

123
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,640
 You know, how did they grow up?

124
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,920
 Because they have food, right?

125
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,320
 As babies, they need spiritual milk,

126
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,400
 spiritual nourishment, right?

127
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,320
 They need the nutrition.

128
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:53,320
 They need the food in order for them to grow.

129
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:58,520
 Same here, this is the analogy applied to Christian life.

130
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,840
 As we go about our Christian living,

131
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,240
 we need the spiritual milk.

132
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,680
 And what Peter is talking about

133
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:11,440
 is actually the Word of God, pure spiritual milk.

134
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,160
 Without it, we cannot grow, right?

135
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,520
 You realize that from,

136
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,880
 in your spiritual journey,

137
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,520
 whether you're a new Christian

138
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,280
 or you have been Christian for many, many years like me,

139
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,120
 I've been Christian for decades.

140
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,680
 Whenever I ignore the Word of God

141
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,920
 or go without the Word of God,

142
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,320
 then I feel weak.

143
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:41,400
 I feel I don't have the perspective

144
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:44,040
 to live my Christian life.

145
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,480
 But whenever I am filled with the Word of God,

146
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,800
 then I know how to live as a Christian.

147
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,120
 And at least I know why, right?

148
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,360
 There are many, many people who have gone astray

149
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,820
 from their faith.

150
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,520
 It's because they go about their life, their Christian life,

151
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,520
 without the spiritual milk, right?

152
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,800
 So that's one of the samples we can find

153
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,000
 from the New Testament.

154
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,920
 There are many, many different passages,

155
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,200
 especially in the Old Testament too.

156
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,760
 Now in the Old Testament, there's a book called Psalms.

157
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:21,440
 Psalms, how many Psalms are there in the book of Psalms?

158
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:27,400
 It's a collection of 150 poems or songs or Psalms

159
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:33,200
 that the poets in the ancient time

160
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,280
 sing about and pray about, worshiping God.

161
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:40,760
 And many of the Psalms actually talk about the value,

162
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:44,960
 the importance, and the wonder of the Word of God, right?

163
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,520
 Can you think of any samples?

164
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,440
 Psalm one is one of them, right?

165
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:52,640
 But it's the man who does not walk in the counsel

166
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:56,520
 of the wicked or stand in the way of sinners

167
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,520
 or sit in the seat of markers,

168
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:04,400
 but his delight, his enjoyment,

169
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,720
 he's enjoying something.

170
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,440
 It's the law, the Torah of the Lord.

171
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,440
 On his law, he meditates regularly, day and night.

172
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,040
 Now here comes the analogy.

173
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,320
 He, if he does that, he is like a tree

174
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,240
 planted by streams of water.

175
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,200
 And he's gonna yield his fruit in his season,

176
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,000
 and the leaf does not wither.

177
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,840
 Whatever he does prospers.

178
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,520
 What a beautiful picture, right?

179
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,520
 A tree planted by the river, by the streams of water.

180
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:46,480
 And he is called blessed, right?

181
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,840
 He will receive the blessing of God.

182
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,520
 Psalm one is one of the samples.

183
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,360
 And then Psalm 19 I preach about, right?

184
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,120
 About creation and about the word of the creator.

185
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,320
 There are many Psalms like this.

186
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,560
 150 Psalms, there are many, many Psalms

187
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,880
 that talk about the word of God that is so important.

188
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:12,000
 Today, I would like to pay more attention to Psalm 119.

189
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,080
 Psalm 119 verse one,

190
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,400
 beginning with the same word as Psalm one does.

191
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:20,280
 Psalm 119 verse one.

192
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,720
 Blessed are they whose ways are blameless,

193
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,560
 who walk according to the law of the Lord.

194
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,680
 Verse two.

195
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,360
 Blessed are they who keep his statutes

196
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,600
 and seek God with all their heart.

197
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,960
 Right?

198
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,440
 Blessed.

199
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,200
 Just like Psalm one, talking about the word of God,

200
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,880
 the importance of the word of God in the people of God.

201
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:49,360
 And Psalm 119, verse one, started with the same word.

202
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,600
 Blessed are those people whose ways are blameless.

203
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,280
 That does not mean, blameless does not mean perfection.

204
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,160
 No one's perfect, right?

205
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,520
 You're not perfect, I'm not perfect.

206
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,880
 You're sinners, I'm a sinner, right?

207
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,160
 We're all broken, we need the redemption of Christ.

208
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,340
 We all need that, we all need the grace of God.

209
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,080
 But what does blameless mean?

210
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,760
 Blameless means he's dedicated.

211
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,000
 Someone who is dedicated and is faithful, right?

212
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,320
 Is truthful.

213
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,160
 To do one thing is to walk according

214
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,400
 to the Torah of the Lord, Torah of Yahweh.

215
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,360
 Blessed are they who keep his word

216
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,080
 and seek God with all their heart.

217
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:39,080
 Psalm 19 is actually the longest chapter in the Bible.

218
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:44,600
 The longest poem, longest Psalm in the Bible.

219
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,320
 A total of 176 verses.

220
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,340
 Why?

221
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,960
 Why 176?

222
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,960
 Because in, well, the Old Testament

223
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,080
 was written primarily in Hebrew.

224
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:02,540
 Hebrew has 22 alphabets, right?

225
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:05,200
 How many alphabets are there in English?

226
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,640
 20, right?

227
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,720
 Yeah, 26, right?

228
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,360
 (laughing)

229
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,640
 26, yeah, you're right.

230
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,360
 In Hebrew, it's not 26, it's 22.

231
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,600
 From aleph, the first letter, to the last letter, taf.

232
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,200
 22 letters.

233
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,560
 And in this Psalm, the amazing thing,

234
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:30,560
 the beauty of it is that every eight verses,

235
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,580
 all eight lines begins with the same letter.

236
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,140
 And you go from, like, English go from A to Z.

237
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:41,800
 In Hebrew, go from aleph all the way to taf,

238
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,760
 this 22nd letter.

239
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,760
 So there are 22 sections in this longest chapter

240
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,680
 of the Bible, and each section is eight verses.

241
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:55,480
 We call them acrostic Psalm.

242
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,160
 You know, it's just a big word for alphabetical Psalm, right?

243
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,240
 Alphabetical Psalm, right, from A to Z.

244
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,320
 So it's the longest chapter of the Bible.

245
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:10,080
 Why is this longest chapter of the Bible

246
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:12,120
 written in such a way?

247
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:17,120
 It's because when you read through Psalm 119,

248
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,360
 you get the sense of perfection.

249
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,720
 You get a sense of unity.

250
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,660
 It's something to look at, something that is beautiful.

251
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,800
 Talking about what?

252
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,800
 The entire Psalm 119 praises or wonders

253
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,120
 about the Word of God.

254
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:41,220
 So the Word of God, the Bible, the Word of God,

255
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,000
 that is revealed on the pages of Scripture.

256
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,740
 It's like a beautiful painting.

257
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,520
 You look at the painting, you go to an art museum

258
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,360
 in Chicago, some big museum, you go in there

259
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,960
 and you see some life-size painting, oil painting.

260
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,780
 It's beautiful, and you can appreciate it.

261
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:06,000
 Psalm 19 has the same message.

262
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,460
 The Word of God is like a beautiful artwork,

263
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:12,200
 and you can look at it and you can appreciate it,

264
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:16,760
 and you can sense that there's unity in the Word of God.

265
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:19,480
 There's perfection in it, there's beauty in it,

266
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,720
 just by looking at it.

267
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:26,240
 One of my professors in the days of seminary,

268
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,680
 his name is Bruce Waukee.

269
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,280
 He's very old now.

270
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,000
 He's already retired, but he's one of the

271
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,120
 Old Testament experts in the world.

272
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,780
 And I remember in one of his classes,

273
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:44,780
 he told us every single word in the Bible,

274
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,740
 of course he's an Old Testament professor,

275
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:49,060
 always focused on his Old Testament, right?

276
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,020
 So he's saying every single word in the Old Testament

277
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,740
 is worth your reflection.

278
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:58,580
 Every single word, right?

279
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:03,340
 God does not waste any word in the Scripture.

280
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:06,220
 So the Word of God is like a beautiful painting, right?

281
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,800
 There are broad brush and there are details there,

282
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,800
 and you can look at it and appreciate it,

283
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,140
 and that is the importance of the Word of God.

284
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:18,720
 Not only the Word of God gave birth to us

285
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,120
 and made spiritual life,

286
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,000
 make our spiritual relationship with God possible,

287
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,240
 it is also beautiful and perfect.

288
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,680
 And the second point I wanna point out

289
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:35,040
 is the power of the Word of God.

290
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,640
 As you read through Psalm 119,

291
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,280
 not only is it beautiful poetry,

292
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,840
 the content tells you that the psalmist

293
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,840
 needs the Word of God in the midst of suffering, right?

294
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:53,160
 So Psalm 19 is actually a lament,

295
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:57,040
 an individual lament, right?

296
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,360
 Some songs are played in minor keys,

297
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,540
 some songs are in major keys,

298
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:06,480
 but Psalm 19 is in kind of minor key,

299
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,320
 because as you read through the Psalm,

300
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,560
 more than 17 times,

301
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,320
 the psalmist mentioned his suffering to God,

302
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:17,560
 and he was praying so hard.

303
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,560
 His struggle with his pain or his suffer with his struggles,

304
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,840
 whatever that is,

305
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,280
 and he's trying to pray to God and draw strength from God.

306
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,920
 But when he suffers, how does he respond?

307
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:36,660
 Let us read some of the verses here.

308
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,140
 Verses 85 and following.

309
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:47,460
 The arrogant dig pitfalls for me,

310
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,700
 contrary to your law.

311
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,260
 All your commands are trustworthy.

312
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:58,260
 Help me, God, for men are persecuting me with thou cause.

313
00:16:58,260 --> 00:17:01,860
 They almost wipe me out from the earth,

314
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:03,980
 and I have not forsaken your precepts.

315
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:08,380
 That's part of his prayer, part of his long prayer.

316
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:13,080
 He said the arrogant people, the enemies,

317
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:18,080
 are persecuting him, pursuing him, without any cause.

318
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,820
 So this guy is really suffering.

319
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,340
 This guy is really struggling with a lot of challenges,

320
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:26,100
 a lot of issues in his life, right?

321
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,140
 And something we can relate to, right?

322
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:31,860
 Probably you have some enemies too.

323
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,220
 Probably you are suffering as well at this point.

324
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,420
 Either the suffering can be described

325
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:44,420
 in terms of emotions, mental, or even physical, right?

326
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:52,380
 The psalmist is crying out to God, I am suffering.

327
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:56,020
 People are digging traps for me.

328
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,540
 They are setting traps for me.

329
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,300
 They are trying to wipe me out, right?

330
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,300
 But the psalmist is trying to draw closer and closer to God.

331
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,200
 He said all your commands are trustworthy, however,

332
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,040
 and you can help me because I have not forsaken

333
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,760
 your precepts, your teaching.

334
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:21,160
 So you should think about whenever you are struggling,

335
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,440
 there's one thing you can do, you cannot do without.

336
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,520
 It's the word of God.

337
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:36,480
 Let's read some of the verses.

338
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,960
 Let's continue.

339
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,460
 Verses 50 and 165.

340
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:49,120
 Psalm says, my comfort in my suffering is this.

341
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,120
 Your promise, your promise, O God, perseveres my life.

342
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:59,520
 Great peace have they who love your Lord

343
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,820
 and nothing can make them stumble.

344
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:06,240
 So he's trusting in God by reading the word of God,

345
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,080
 drawing close to God, finding comfort in his suffering,

346
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,280
 finding peace in his suffering.

347
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,280
 So how does this psalmist respond to suffering?

348
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,880
 How does he respond?

349
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,960
 He turns to the word of God.

350
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:31,240
 You struggle, the one thing you do, you turn to God.

351
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:34,960
 You read the word, right?

352
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,600
 You know, as a pastor, I often go to hospital

353
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,600
 for visitations, visit the sick and the weak,

354
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,760
 those who struggle, those who suffer.

355
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,760
 And so often, when a friend or a neighbor are on sickbed,

356
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:58,600
 you just find that your human words are limited, right?

357
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:03,000
 What can I say besides sickbed, right?

358
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,800
 What can I say to give people a little bit sense

359
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,840
 of comfort and peace?

360
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:11,800
 I remember one time some years ago,

361
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,400
 I was visiting a patient who was suffering

362
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,180
 from terminal disease, cancer.

363
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:21,300
 And he was in terrible pain.

364
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,920
 And I was in the hospital room

365
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:29,680
 and there was no hope for him to recover, no hope.

366
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,760
 He just had days remaining and counting down.

367
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:38,320
 And what can I say to bring comfort

368
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,960
 and to bring a little peace to the dying, right?

369
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,840
 To those who are suffering.

370
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,040
 And so often, as I told you,

371
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,160
 words coming out of my mouth are so limited, right?

372
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,120
 But I find it's very interesting and very amazing

373
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
 that at the end of the visitation,

374
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,160
 I usually read something from the Bible.

375
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:06,960
 And maybe Psalm 23, and you know this Psalm, right?

376
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,280
 It's a very familiar Psalm.

377
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,280
 Some of the Psalms, some of the words from the Bible,

378
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,280
 I end my visitation with those words.

379
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,000
 And somehow the person who is suffering,

380
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 after hearing the word of God, right, find some peace.

381
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,560
 You can look into his eyes

382
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:31,440
 and he was experiencing something,

383
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,320
 some peace beyond human understanding, right?

384
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,520
 That's exactly what the Bible says, right?

385
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,440
 That's exactly what the Bible promises,

386
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,000
 that if you read the word of God, right,

387
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,440
 in the midst of suffering,

388
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,800
 you will experience some peace

389
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,080
 that is beyond the world can offer.

390
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,280
 It's offered by God in Christ only.

391
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:00,240
 I remember when I suffer in different seasons,

392
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,800
 when people, whatever people say,

393
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:07,680
 you know, I find that their words are empty.

394
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:11,160
 Now, there's no ability to comfort me.

395
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:14,840
 But when I turn to the word of God in my quiet time,

396
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,720
 in my own personal prayers,

397
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,640
 I regain strength, right, to do life.

398
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,360
 I regain strength and peace to go on.

399
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:29,480
 Same thing here, Psalm 119, verse 111.

400
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,320
 It said, "Your statues are my heritage forever,

401
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:39,800
 "and they are the joy of my heart," right?

402
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,080
 Someone who is suffering,

403
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:44,440
 but reading the word of God, drawing close to God,

404
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,440
 knowing that the word of God has power to heal,

405
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:54,160
 the power to comfort, the power to grant peace, right?

406
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,560
 Some years ago, Christianity Today magazine

407
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:04,680
 interviewed someone called Billy Graham.

408
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,600
 You know, those of us who are,

409
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,480
 well, many of you are younger, right?

410
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,160
 I'm one of the old guys here.

411
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,960
 You know, I still remember Billy Graham.

412
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,960
 I went to one of his evangelistic gathering, right?

413
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,080
 Billy Graham was the greatest evangelist in 20th century,

414
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:27,240
 and he has led many, many people to Jesus, to Christ.

415
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,600
 And the Christianity Today interviewer

416
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:32,520
 asked Billy Graham one question.

417
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:38,360
 After all of the great works God worked through him,

418
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,720
 leading many people to Christ,

419
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,680
 millions of people to Christ,

420
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,440
 and the interviewer asked him a question.

421
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,440
 He said, "Billy, if you could restart your ministry,

422
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:54,320
 "restart your work, what would you do?

423
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:59,100
 "Is there anything you would do differently

424
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,040
 "if you restart your whole thing,

425
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:04,160
 "you know, your whole ministry, your whole work for God?"

426
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:09,160
 And Billy Graham said, "I would actually spend more time

427
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,680
 "to study the Word of God before I preach."

428
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:16,920
 That's pretty interesting, right?

429
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:21,920
 I would study the Word of God and preach less, right?

430
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,580
 You know, at times, we envy the people in the Bible,

431
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,760
 like Abraham, right?

432
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:34,760
 Abraham, in his faith journey in God,

433
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,360
 God appeared to him visually and spoke to him directly,

434
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,840
 right, and most of us,

435
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,440
 we don't usually have that kind of experience,

436
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,680
 direct encounter with God, right?

437
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,560
 And God just show up in your dream or in your bedroom

438
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,520
 and say, "Hey, you know, I want you to do this, right?

439
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,840
 "I want you to stop doing this," right?

440
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,280
 We usually don't have that kind of spiritual encounter

441
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,360
 with God.

442
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,880
 However, if you go back to the story of Abraham

443
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:10,120
 in the book of Genesis, Genesis 12 to 25,

444
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,080
 and you count how many times God actually appeared

445
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,080
 to Abraham and spoke to him directly, how many times?

446
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,340
 Let me do the calculation.

447
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,720
 Abraham started to follow God when he was 75 years old,

448
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,840
 and he passed away at the age of, very old age,

449
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:33,600
 175, so he followed God for 100 years,

450
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,600
 for almost a century, and in that 100 years,

451
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:43,800
 we counted from the book of Genesis, chapter 12 to 25, right?

452
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:46,560
 How many times God actually appeared to Abraham

453
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:50,280
 and spoke to him directly, appeared to him visually?

454
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,480
 How many times?

455
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,520
 You wanna make guess?

456
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:55,960
 Eight times.

457
00:25:56,920 --> 00:26:01,760
 Eight times, eight times only in his entire faith journey.

458
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,960
 Only eight times God appeared to him directly

459
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,600
 and said something to him,

460
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,800
 and if you go to this eight encounters,

461
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:14,480
 all of the eight encounters are not QA sessions.

462
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,960
 It's not like God show up and,

463
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,040
 "Hey, you wanna ask me some questions?

464
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,440
 "You know, I'll take any question.

465
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,920
 "I'll give you answer."

466
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:24,120
 No, it's not a QA session with Abraham.

467
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,320
 There's no QA session, and so often,

468
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:30,000
 God spoke to Abraham directly, not according to his term,

469
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:34,800
 right, and so often, God says something to Abraham,

470
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,960
 and Abraham did not wanna hear that, right?

471
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,720
 Like, "You have to wait, okay?

472
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,560
 "I'll give you a son, but you have to wait," right?

473
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,400
 You like the answer?

474
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,220
 Of course not, right?

475
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,480
 It's testing your patience.

476
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:51,440
 And so often, God show up to Abraham and spoke to him,

477
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,280
 and leaving him, after the encounter,

478
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,720
 leaving him even more confused, right?

479
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,240
 So if you would choose,

480
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,200
 would you want to receive the word of God like Abraham did?

481
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:06,200
 I wouldn't do that, right?

482
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:10,600
 It's so puzzling, and it's so mind-boggling, right?

483
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,520
 You show up, and then you said something to me,

484
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,360
 I didn't wanna hear that, right?

485
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,480
 But you said, "Trust me," right?

486
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,680
 And then you disappear.

487
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:21,240
 Eight times only, in 100 years.

488
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,720
 I wouldn't wanna be Abraham.

489
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:27,840
 You know, I wouldn't want to envy him.

490
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,720
 But for me, being people in Christ now,

491
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,960
 having the whole Bible already revealed to us, right?

492
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,640
 The Old Testament and New Testament

493
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,560
 is a complete revelation of God's will,

494
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,640
 clear and loud, right?

495
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:49,600
 The Bible, we all have it,

496
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,680
 has all the clear principles of following God.

497
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,680
 All the moral, spiritual requirements,

498
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,720
 the ways of God are clear,

499
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,400
 clearly spelled out on the pages of Scripture.

500
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,160
 And that's why we have to say,

501
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:07,680
 we are the people of the book.

502
00:28:07,680 --> 00:28:09,760
 We need to follow the book, right?

503
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,720
 We need to learn how to read it,

504
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,360
 and read the word of God more and more.

505
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:19,280
 Dive into it, understand it,

506
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,600
 and struggle to interpret it,

507
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,600
 to understand it, and apply it into our lives.

508
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,000
 So today, as the first part of our series,

509
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,200
 I would like to end with two take-homes.

510
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,760
 First, we all have 24 hours.

511
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:41,720
 Take the best time period of your day.

512
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:45,040
 Some of us are morning persons,

513
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,560
 some of us are not, right?

514
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,560
 Your best hour, what would that be, right?

515
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,440
 Maybe at noon, or maybe at night,

516
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,640
 whatever that is, take at least 10 minutes a day

517
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,120
 to read the Bible.

518
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,480
 If you don't know where to start, okay,

519
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,520
 let me suggest to you, if you're new believers,

520
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,320
 start with one of the gospels,

521
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,640
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

522
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,440
 either one of the four, right?

523
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,160
 You can start with Gospel of John,

524
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,280
 read one chapter a day.

525
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:19,280
 It will take you less than 10 minutes, right?

526
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:25,280
 If you're believers for quite a long time, right,

527
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:31,640
 and you don't know where to start now, right,

528
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,560
 well, you can start with the Old Testament,

529
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,120
 the book of Psalms.

530
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,080
 There are 150 Psalms, right?

531
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,600
 You can read one Psalm a day.

532
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,640
 Take at least 10 minutes in your,

533
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,400
 what we call quiet time, or devotional,

534
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,960
 to read part of the Bible, all right?

535
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,360
 I'm not asking you to read it in one sitting,

536
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,640
 cover to cover.

537
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,280
 No one can do that, right?

538
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,200
 Take at least 10 minutes a day to read the Bible,

539
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,520
 and to meditate on it, right?

540
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,840
 Take it, store it in your mind, right?

541
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,280
 Remember it, kind of remember the sketch of the passage,

542
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,800
 and bring it with you in your work, right?

543
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,400
 You go about your daily life,

544
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,680
 go grocery shopping, or whatever you're doing.

545
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,640
 You know, just from time to time,

546
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,960
 remember that, and to reflect upon it.

547
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,880
 And today, I take the suggestions

548
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,000
 from one of our brothers, James,

549
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:30,000
 that we are going to do the verse of the month, okay?

550
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,680
 Verse of the month.

551
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:36,680
 I'll take one verse of the Bible,

552
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,960
 and actually, it's not verse of the month,

553
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,200
 verse of the week, okay?

554
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,520
 Verse of the week.

555
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:48,360
 I'll take one verse of the Bible every single week,

556
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,320
 and we're going to meditate on it,

557
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:53,120
 and we're going to memorize it, okay?

558
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,720
 We're going to recite it together as a congregation,

559
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,120
 as a family of God, we're going to read it,

560
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:03,840
 and remember it, and memorize it, right?

561
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,120
 Next week, we come back, we're going to reveal,

562
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:11,400
 and it's going to be another verse for next week.

563
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,240
 How about that?

564
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,800
 Pretty good suggestion, right?

565
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,640
 Yeah, thank you, brother.

566
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,640
 Yeah, so our verse of the week is this.

567
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,680
 Your word is the lamp to my feet,

568
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,240
 and the light for my path.

569
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:29,560
 Can we read it together?

570
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,160
 Have Lucy come up here.

571
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,120
 Let's read it together, Psalm 119, 105, okay?

572
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,360
 119, 105, you have to memorize the reference as well, okay?

573
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:42,840
 It's from Psalm 119, verse what?

574
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,400
 105, okay?

575
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,000
 Let's recite it together, all right?

576
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,360
 Psalm 119, verse 105.

577
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,200
 Your word is the lamp to my feet,

578
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,160
 and the light for my path.

579
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:58,480
 Wonderful word, right?

580
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:03,040
 Yeah, the word of God, may it be the lamp and the light

581
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,360
 for our daily walk, right?

582
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,400
 You may face different trials and temptations,

583
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,400
 but may the word of God feed you.

584
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,600
 He can give you strength, right?

585
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,000
 Give you the power to live the life God intend to you,

586
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,560
 to live.

587
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,760
 Let's all pray together.

588
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,000
 Father God, we give you thanks for your word.

589
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:30,480
 I wanna give you thanks because you are the God

590
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,600
 who still speaks.

591
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,600
 You speak through your word.

592
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,360
 Speak through your scripture.

593
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,720
 And I just pray for all the brothers and sisters here.

594
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:48,000
 May we continue to dig into your word,

595
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,360
 to meditate on it day and night,

596
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:54,360
 so that we will receive blessing from you,

597
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:58,760
 to grant us strength, grant us the ability,

598
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:02,680
 the amount of grace that we need

599
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,680
 to go on tackling with different challenges in our lives

600
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,920
 so that we can live the spiritual life

601
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,480
 you intended us to live.

602
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,520
 Thank you for calling us to be your people.

603
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:20,120
 We are indeed the people of your word, people of the book.

604
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:24,400
 May your word dwell in our hearts and our mind,

605
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:28,600
 and be our guidance, be our principle.

606
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,960
 Indeed, your word is the lamp unto our feet

607
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,080
 and the light unto our path.

608
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,360
 Help us to rely on you, to draw close to you

609
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,000
 by reading your word, to study the word together,

610
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,600
 to have Bible study to remind each one of us

611
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,760
 the reality of your spiritual life,

612
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:50,080
 reality of our relationship with you.

613
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,200
 Thank you for being our God who loves us so much.

614
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,720
 Again, we wanna give you thanks, praise you,

615
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:01,360
 praise you for the fact that you reveal your will

616
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,160
 through scripture.

617
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:05,240
 Thank you, God.

618
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,200
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

619
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,040
 (gentle piano music)

620
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,160
 Well, we'll end our service here,

621
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:12,400
 and we have some refreshment out there

622
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:16,480
 in the cafe or coffee or tea or just water.

623
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,880
 So stay behind for some time of fellowship

624
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,160
 and say hi to your new friends

625
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:21,760
 and say hi to our neighbors.
