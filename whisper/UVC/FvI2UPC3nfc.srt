1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
 Welcome family, it's great to be with you again.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,000
 Today is part two of this message that we're looking at asking and receiving in Matthew

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 chapter 7.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,920
 We're going to be in verses 7 to 11 again.

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,400
 So let's dive into this and look at what God has to say to us.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,400
 Starting in verse 7 it says this, "Ask and it will be given to you.

7
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,400
 Seek and you will find.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,120
 Knock and it will be opened to you.

9
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:25,960
 For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds.

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,240
 And to the one who knocks it will be opened.

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,720
 For which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?

12
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:34,360
 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,320
 If you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more

14
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,140
 will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?"

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,960
 You know, last week as we began to look at this passage and discuss it, we talked about

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:55,320
 kind of the obvious and direct reality of this passage, that Jesus is just challenging

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,240
 us to ask God, and that we don't do that enough.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,520
 And a lot of times it's because we don't have faith.

19
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:07,400
 We're not actually confident and trusting God that he actually will be present in our

20
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,160
 life, meet our needs, bring the transformation that we need or the provision that we need,

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,120
 whatever it is that we might be asking for.

22
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,120
 A lot of times we don't trust that God can do that.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,840
 And so we talked about some of those obstacles to faith that we need to deal with.

24
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,040
 Maybe we don't believe that God is powerful enough.

25
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:26,640
 Maybe we don't believe that God is good enough.

26
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,200
 Or maybe we don't really believe that we're weak and we think that we can still find the

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,840
 solutions and the answers and fix our lives on our own without God.

28
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:39,440
 Whatever those things are, we need to learn to put them out of our life so that we can

29
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:46,320
 begin to truly trust and have faith in God and begin to ask him for the things that we

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,280
 need in our life, the big and the small things.

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,820
 And today I want us to consider, what are we supposed to ask for?

32
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,080
 Because if we're learning the lesson that we talked about last week and we're saying,

33
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,760
 "Okay, I want to learn to have more faith.

34
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,560
 I want to learn to have more confidence and trust in God.

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,280
 I want to learn to ask God.

36
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,880
 I want to learn to rely on him for everything."

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:11,120
 Then we get to the question of, "But what do I ask for?

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,560
 What's important for me to ask for?"

39
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,800
 And that's a really valid question for us to ask.

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,320
 James chapter 4, in the first eight verses, it says this, "What causes quarrels and what

41
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,980
 causes fights among you?

42
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,360
 Is it not this?

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,160
 Your passions are at war within you.

44
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,380
 You desire and do not have, so you murder.

45
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:30,400
 You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,520
 You do not have because you do not ask.

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,040
 You ask and do not receive because you ask wrongly to spend it on your passions.

48
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,200
 You adulterous people, do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?

49
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,960
 Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.

50
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:50,240
 Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the scripture says he yearns jealousy over

51
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,600
 the spirit that he has made to dwell in us?

52
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,520
 But he gives more grace, therefore it says God opposes the proud and gives grace to the

53
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,520
 humble.

54
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,320
 Submit yourself therefore to God.

55
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,120
 Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

56
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,640
 Draw near to God and he will draw near to you.

57
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,560
 Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded."

58
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,120
 This passage is giving us a picture of God's love for us and how God really does want us

59
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,320
 to be in relationship with Him and not distracted by everything else in our world.

60
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:21,560
 How God even has a spirit of jealousy and says, "Hey, I want you for myself.

61
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:25,120
 I love you and I want you to be in relationship with me."

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,660
 But in the beginning it echoes some of the things that we've been talking about.

63
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,560
 In verse 2 it tells us that we don't have because we don't ask.

64
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:35,400
 It's saying, "Listen, there's a lot of things in your life that you don't have just because

65
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,400
 you're not asking.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,760
 You're not even asking God for them."

67
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,120
 But then in verse 3 it says that there are things that we ask for and don't get because

68
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,680
 we're asking for the wrong things.

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,080
 We are asking for things that we just want to spend on ourselves.

70
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:54,680
 We're asking for things to gratify our own flesh and our own lusts and our own passions

71
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,080
 and our own pleasures and our own comfort.

72
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,160
 And that's not necessarily what God wants to give to us.

73
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:06,240
 And so there are things that we ask for and don't get because we're asking selfishly.

74
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:10,860
 And that's what I want us to think about today as we learn to ask, "What are we going to

75
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,860
 ask for?"

76
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:17,320
 And I think Jesus gives us some clues in this passage and also just in the context of the

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,480
 entire Sermon on the Mount.

78
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,400
 We see that Jesus is pointing us towards what we should ask for.

79
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:31,540
 So when we look at verse 9 of Matthew chapter 7, Jesus gives us this illustration of someone

80
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,760
 asking for a gift.

81
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,000
 And Jesus says, "Which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?

82
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,360
 Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?

83
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,600
 If you then who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more

84
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,520
 will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?"

85
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,440
 Now part of this illustration, Jesus is just pointing us to the fact that God is good and

86
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,960
 he wants our good in our lives.

87
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:00,620
 And that God is going to act in that way that we can trust the goodness of God, just like

88
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,640
 we talked about last week.

89
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,240
 And that's a powerful truth here.

90
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,920
 But I think there's also a powerful truth here for us to consider about what is good

91
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,880
 in our lives and what is best.

92
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:14,560
 God knows us in a way that we don't even know ourselves.

93
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,440
 And God is going to work in our lives in a way that is truly for our best, not just for

94
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,860
 what feels good to us in the moment.

95
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,440
 And that brings up some different questions here.

96
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,220
 What does it mean to ask God for truly good things?

97
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,080
 What does it mean to ask God for truly what's best for us in our lives?

98
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,500
 I think all of us can think of plenty of things that we would ask God for.

99
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,840
 And so if we just say, "Okay, God wants me to ask him for things and that's the end of

100
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,880
 it," we would probably all say, "Okay, I know what I want to ask for.

101
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,200
 I want to ask for comfort.

102
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,200
 I want to ask for stuff.

103
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,960
 I want to ask for success.

104
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
 God give me a lot of money.

105
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
 Give me a big house.

106
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
 Give me a few cars to drive.

107
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,800
 Give me good health.

108
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,320
 Give me time to sit on the beach with my family.

109
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,040
 God make things easy.

110
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,420
 Give me relationships where no one's unkind to me.

111
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:11,720
 And make everything work out at my job.

112
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:16,280
 Or better yet, make me not even have to go to work anymore.

113
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,320
 Make me no longer have to do school."

114
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,480
 If we were just going to ask for whatever we wanted, it would probably be a pretty long

115
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:28,680
 list of things that were focused on our own selfishness and on our own comfort, right?

116
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,200
 That's just the honest reality of most of us as humans.

117
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,680
 And that's borne out in the way we live our lives.

118
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:40,560
 The things that we pursue and the things that we try to fill our lives with are often based

119
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,680
 and focused on our own selfishness or comfort.

120
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,640
 They're based on trying to gain things and possessions and prestige and stuff, comfort,

121
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,600
 pleasure for ourselves.

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,720
 And they're based on trying to insulate us from things that would hurt us or make us

123
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,600
 uncomfortable or make life difficult or make anything challenging in our life.

124
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,160
 That's how most of us operate.

125
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,060
 That's how most of us live our lives.

126
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,600
 But is that really what's best for us?

127
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:11,240
 Well there's no question that that's something that feels good in the moment, right?

128
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,880
 It feels good to have an easy life.

129
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,640
 It feels good to not deal with challenges and adversity.

130
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:19,720
 It feels good to not have anyone in your life be sick.

131
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:23,120
 It feels good to not have anyone be unkind to you.

132
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,600
 There's no question that that's what feels good in the moment is pleasure and comfort

133
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,560
 and the pursuit of those types of things.

134
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:33,520
 But is that what's truly best for us?

135
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,480
 And so when Jesus is pointing us to the fact that God is good and he's going to give us

136
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:42,040
 good things, he's going to give us bread, he's going to give us a fish, he's going to

137
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:48,000
 give us what we truly need in our lives to sustain us spiritually, that Jesus is actually

138
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,480
 teaching us to pursue holiness.

139
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:55,320
 Jesus is teaching us to pursue what's truly important in our lives.

140
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:59,200
 And I think there's a really powerful truth here as well.

141
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:02,800
 That God is ultimately waiting for our response.

142
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,440
 I've talked about this a lot, but God is not coercive.

143
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,440
 He is not.

144
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,760
 He's a God of love and he's not a God who forces us to do things.

145
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:17,720
 God has all the power in the universe, but he doesn't use that power to force us to do

146
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
 things.

147
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:25,200
 He can control things and he turns the course of history wherever he wants it, but he doesn't

148
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,720
 force us to love him.

149
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,280
 He doesn't make us enter into relationship with him, even though he could, because God

150
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,480
 is a God of love.

151
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:38,160
 And that's true in our lives as followers of Jesus as well.

152
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:42,760
 We see it true in the world at large that there are many people who do not love God

153
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,360
 and who are not in relationship with him, who are not a part of the kingdom of God.

154
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,920
 God is not going to force them to be in relationship with him.

155
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,880
 But even those of us who have begun relationship with God and come into the kingdom and begin

156
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,360
 to live our lives in obedience to him, he's still not going to force us to change.

157
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,040
 He's going to invite us to change.

158
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:08,360
 He's going to invite us into transformation, but he's not going to force us to make it

159
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,040
 happen.

160
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,260
 God is waiting for us to respond.

161
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,280
 Just like when you send an invitation to someone and you say, "Hey, I want you to come to my

162
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,400
 birthday party," or "I want you to come to my graduation party," or "I want you to come

163
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,760
 to my wedding and my retirement party," whatever it is, you send the invitation, you say, "Please,

164
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,720
 RSVP," and then you wait for their response.

165
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,880
 That is what God is doing to us.

166
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,880
 God is inviting us.

167
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,840
 He's saying, "Hey, I want you to come into relationship with me.

168
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:39,400
 I want it to be deep and fulfilling and satisfying, and I want it to be transformative in your

169
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
 life.

170
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,000
 And this is what I'm inviting you to.

171
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,840
 I'm inviting you to live out the values of the kingdom and to experience all the goodness

172
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,520
 of what it means to be a child of God.

173
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:55,400
 But I'm not going to force you to do it, and I'm going to wait on you to respond."

174
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:57,320
 And that's what God is doing.

175
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:02,560
 Because God is waiting for us to respond, we have to begin to pursue holiness.

176
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,940
 We have to begin to choose to draw near to God, like the book of James talks about.

177
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:12,600
 If we will draw near to Him, then He will draw near to us.

178
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,080
 But He's waiting for us.

179
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,800
 I think that's really powerful.

180
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,600
 A lot of times when we look at our life and we say, "Well, I've asked for something that's

181
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:25,680
 not coming to pass," or "I want to grow in my faith, and why doesn't God just make that

182
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,320
 happen in my life?"

183
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,520
 Sometimes we assume that it's God's fault, that like, "Well, this hasn't happened yet

184
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:34,080
 because God just doesn't really love me or He doesn't really care about me, or He doesn't

185
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:37,760
 want to meet this need, or He doesn't want to help me grow in my faith, or He doesn't

186
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:40,240
 want to change this thing in my life."

187
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,040
 And actually the opposite is true.

188
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,920
 God is right there the whole time saying, "I love you.

189
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,240
 I want to go deeper in fellowship with you."

190
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,400
 We're the one who is not responding to God.

191
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,680
 We're the one who's holding God at arm's length, and we're the one who's saying, "God, I don't

192
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,840
 want to go any further in my relationship with you.

193
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,200
 I don't want to give you any more control over my life.

194
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,100
 I don't want to give you any more access into my heart."

195
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:10,040
 God is waiting for our response, and Jesus is teaching us that we need to pursue holiness

196
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,520
 and draw near to God.

197
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:16,560
 God wants to give us those things that are spiritually sustaining to us, the bread and

198
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,860
 the fish, but we don't have them because we're not responding.

199
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:23,740
 We're not asking God for those things.

200
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,280
 We're not saying, "God, instead of just making me comfortable and giving me everything I

201
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:32,180
 want in my life, can you give me the things I truly need?

202
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,340
 Can you give me holiness?

203
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,600
 Can you give me righteousness?

204
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,560
 Can you help me to live rightly before you?

205
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,080
 Can you help me to live out the values of the kingdom, even if it means walking through

206
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,080
 adversity?"

207
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:46,520
 But we don't ask for that, and God is waiting for us to ask.

208
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,300
 God is waiting for our response.

209
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:54,860
 There was this pastor of a previous generation that spent a lot of time preaching and ministering

210
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,860
 right here in Chicago.

211
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:56,860
 His name was A.W.

212
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:57,860
 Tozier.

213
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,340
 He wrote a lot of excellent books, so if you haven't ever read any of them, I encourage

214
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,720
 you to check some of them out.

215
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,060
 I remember reading one of his books and coming across this interesting statement where he

216
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,620
 said, "Every man is as holy as he wants to be."

217
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:15,820
 On the face of it, that statement sounds kind of crazy and almost heretical, right?

218
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:18,060
 It almost sounds like, "What is this guy saying?

219
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:22,580
 Is he saying that we manufacture holiness, that we make holiness happen?"

220
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:24,620
 We know that is not true in any way.

221
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,480
 That it's only through Christ and what he's done on the cross that we could ever draw

222
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
 near to God.

223
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,160
 It's only through Jesus that we could ever have relationship with God.

224
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,000
 It's only through Jesus that we could ever experience holiness.

225
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,040
 It's not that we manufacture holiness, and that's not what Tozier was saying.

226
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,640
 What he was saying is that when there is a deficit in our holiness and the rightness

227
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:50,840
 of our relationship to God, it's because there's a deficit in our desire.

228
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,120
 It's not because God doesn't want us to be holy.

229
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,800
 It's not because God doesn't want to teach us and grow us.

230
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,900
 It's not because God doesn't want to take us farther.

231
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,040
 It's because we don't want it.

232
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,920
 We don't want to go any further.

233
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,680
 We don't want to grow any more.

234
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,360
 We don't want to become more holy and any closer to God.

235
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,400
 And that is a powerful truth.

236
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,000
 I think Matthew 7 is really pointing us towards that here.

237
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,320
 Jesus is saying, "Listen, I want you to learn to ask God for good things in your life, and

238
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,640
 you need to know what to ask for.

239
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,720
 Ask for the good stuff.

240
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,840
 Ask for holiness.

241
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:32,720
 Ask for the spiritually transformative things in your life, because that will cause you

242
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,160
 to grow into who God wants you to be.

243
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,640
 And if you're not growing into who God wants you to be, it's not because God doesn't want

244
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:39,640
 it for you.

245
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,080
 It's because you don't want it, and you're not moving towards it.

246
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,280
 You're afraid of it, or you're holding on to your sin, or you're letting something else

247
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,280
 hold you back.

248
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:54,040
 And I think when we look at these verses in Matthew 7 in the context of the Sermon on

249
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:59,840
 the Mount as a whole, we see that Jesus is teaching us that God desires us to possess

250
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,840
 and live out Kingdom values.

251
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:07,600
 If we say, "Okay, Jesus is telling me to ask," and if we just pulled this passage out, Matthew

252
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:12,680
 7, 7-11, and looked at it out of context, we could say, "Well, what is Jesus telling

253
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:13,680
 me to ask for?"

254
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,680
 Anything, right?

255
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:17,640
 Like I said earlier, maybe it's just stuff and comfort and pleasure.

256
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:24,000
 But when we look at it in the context of the entire Sermon on the Mount, it begins to open

257
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,400
 up what we're supposed to ask for.

258
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:31,520
 Jesus tells us to ask, "What has He been talking about this whole time?"

259
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,840
 He's been talking about the values of the Kingdom.

260
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,800
 He's been talking about poverty of spirit.

261
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,280
 He's been talking about meekness.

262
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,960
 He's been talking about being a peacemaker.

263
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:44,080
 He's been talking about storing up treasures in Heaven, seeking first the Kingdom of God.

264
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,520
 He's been talking about being pure of heart.

265
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:51,680
 He's been talking about having a clear spiritual vision.

266
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,800
 All these things that we've discussed over the last year that Jesus has been talking

267
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:01,760
 about, that's the context of this statement where Jesus is asking, "It will be given you."

268
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,160
 He's saying, "Hey, here's the values of the Kingdom.

269
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,200
 I'm laying them out in front of you."

270
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,760
 And as you listen to them, yes, they are things that you do not currently possess in your

271
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:12,400
 life.

272
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,600
 So ask, and it will be given to you.

273
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,680
 Ask God for them.

274
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:21,000
 Seek them, and you will find them.

275
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:26,520
 Look, and God will open that door and begin to give you those values of the Kingdom in

276
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:30,760
 your heart and in your life and begin to allow you to live them out.

277
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,800
 And that's one of the things that Jesus is teaching us here.

278
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,820
 Jesus is teaching us what to ask for.

279
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:39,400
 We should ask for the values of the Kingdom.

280
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:45,240
 We should seek the values of the Kingdom, and we should ask God to begin to give them

281
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,880
 to us so that we possess them and we live them out in our lives.

282
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:55,440
 Another thing that Jesus is teaching us here is that God is more interested in our spiritual

283
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,120
 well-being than our material well-being.

284
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,560
 That's really important for us to understand.

285
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,920
 When we think about prayer and we think about asking God, I think all of us have had experiences.

286
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:09,560
 If you've been a follower of Jesus for very long, I'm sure you've had an experience where

287
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,520
 you've asked God for something, and you didn't get what you wanted, or you didn't get it

288
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,300
 in the way that you wanted.

289
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,660
 And that's challenging for us.

290
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,880
 That challenges our faith.

291
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:21,400
 That causes us to say, "Okay, God, can you answer prayer?

292
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,360
 Do you want to answer prayer?

293
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,760
 Why would you not answer this prayer?"

294
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,640
 It gives us a lot of questions, right?

295
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:34,240
 And I think we need to understand that God is more interested in our spiritual well-being

296
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,120
 than our material well-being.

297
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,920
 Sometimes we ask for something that may be what's best for us materially and physically,

298
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,360
 and in the moment we may ask God for some stuff or for some pleasure or for some comfort

299
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,400
 or to work something out in a way that's great for us.

300
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,280
 And maybe that's not what God wants to do in our life at that moment.

301
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:01,600
 Because maybe God sees that giving us that thing or that position or that situation or

302
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,520
 that job or that educational achievement or whatever it is in that moment would actually

303
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:09,440
 not be what's best for us spiritually.

304
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:15,040
 Maybe that would cause us to be proud or cause us to look down on other people.

305
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:19,880
 Or maybe it would just cause us to miss out on a lesson that we desperately need to learn,

306
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,880
 that we've got to go through some adversity to learn.

307
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,320
 And so God in his love for us is more concerned with our spiritual well-being than our material

308
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
 well-being.

309
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:35,520
 And sometimes God says no or sometimes God says wait when we ask because he has a lesson

310
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:41,780
 that's so valuable for us to learn spiritually that we would not learn if he just said yes

311
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:44,160
 and gave us the thing that we want.

312
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,080
 And we have to remember that when we're asking God.

313
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,480
 Jesus is pointing us to that in the Sermon on the Mount.

314
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:55,240
 He's saying yeah, there's a lot of things that you could ask for, but here's what you

315
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:59,400
 really truly need, what's really truly going to be good for you and what's really truly

316
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,480
 going to bring peace and fulfillment and satisfaction and joy into your life is to possess and live

317
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,480
 out the values of the kingdom.

318
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,080
 You need to ask God for that.

319
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,120
 And God's more focused on you being healthy spiritually than he is on you just getting

320
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,240
 everything you want out of life.

321
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:18,200
 And that's really valuable and powerful for us to know.

322
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:24,120
 There are times when we just want things to be easy and simple and quick and exactly how

323
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,120
 we want them to be.

324
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,880
 And we ask God for that.

325
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,880
 And that's okay.

326
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,280
 It's okay to ask God.

327
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:35,440
 But God doesn't necessarily say yes to that because God wants what's best for us in a

328
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,960
 deeper way.

329
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:39,440
 And that's what God is going to move towards.

330
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,640
 You know, God is more interested in his kingdom than ours.

331
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,360
 Sometimes we ask God things that really just have to do with our own kingdom and our own

332
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,520
 pursuit and what's going to benefit us.

333
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:55,240
 And God loves us and he wants good for us, but he's more interested in the goals of his

334
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:57,720
 kingdom than he is in ours.

335
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,600
 And that may sound selfish.

336
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,200
 We might say, well, how could God be so selfish and not want what's best for me?

337
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:09,960
 But if we're honest with scripture and who God says he is, if God really is all powerful

338
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,600
 and all knowing, then how foolish would it be for him to allow our goals and priorities

339
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:21,760
 to outsize his goals and priorities.

340
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,360
 His kingdom should come first.

341
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,480
 And so it's only right for God to be more interested in the goals of his kingdom than

342
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,360
 in the goals of our kingdom.

343
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,840
 And the reality is that God is more interested in his glory than ours.

344
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,320
 And again, if we're honest with scripture, that's only right.

345
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,000
 That's exactly how it should be.

346
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:48,240
 God should be more interested in glorifying himself than in glorifying us.

347
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,960
 And so as we ask for things in our life, we need to understand that God is going to respond

348
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:58,560
 and God is going to teach us and to grow us and to love us.

349
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:03,480
 But it may not always move in the direction of our glory or the goals of our kingdom or

350
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,880
 even our comfort and pleasure.

351
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,160
 Sometimes it will, but there will be many times when it does not because God is more

352
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,560
 interested in our spiritual well-being.

353
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,840
 He's more interested in glorifying himself and in advancing his kingdom than in just

354
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,400
 giving us what we want.

355
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:24,400
 So I want to give us a few things to think about as we close out here.

356
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,560
 As we begin to think about asking God and what we should ask for, I would say, don't

357
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:33,240
 be afraid to ask God for anything big or small.

358
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,320
 God cares about your life and he wants to hear the desires and needs of your heart.

359
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,400
 So pour those out to him.

360
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,720
 Even if those are small things, pour them out to God.

361
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,840
 If they're emotional needs, pour that out to God.

362
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,480
 If they're physical realities, pour it out to God.

363
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,520
 Even if you're not sure and you say, "Well, I don't know if I'm just asking for my own

364
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,520
 comfort or pleasure."

365
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,880
 There's nothing wrong with asking.

366
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,280
 If that's not what God has for you, then God will reveal that to you.

367
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:02,520
 But it's just like little children are not afraid to ask a loving parent for a gift,

368
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,160
 even if they know the answer might be no.

369
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,640
 And we are God's children.

370
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,640
 He loves us.

371
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,880
 So don't be afraid to ask for gifts, even if it's something that may not be right for

372
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,960
 you at the time.

373
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,800
 God can tell you no.

374
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:18,560
 Don't be afraid to ask for anything big or small.

375
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,400
 Pour your requests out to God.

376
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:24,320
 Consider that privilege that you have of going before the Almighty God of the universe to

377
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,920
 make your requests known.

378
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,960
 And then I would encourage you to, if you're not sure whether or not you should ask for

379
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,000
 things, ask for things that you know are in alignment with kingdom values.

380
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,920
 Ask for things that you know are in alignment with God's will.

381
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:43,080
 You know, we can say, "Well, I don't know if I should ask for this in my work or for

382
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,080
 that in my work."

383
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,320
 Well, if one situation in your job is going to give you an opportunity to display poverty

384
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,440
 of spirit or to be a peacemaker, then you should probably ask for that because it's

385
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,000
 in alignment with the values of the kingdom.

386
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,360
 There are certain things that we don't have to wonder about whether or not we should ask

387
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,080
 for or God wants us to have them if they're already in alignment with kingdom values.

388
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,440
 We don't have to ask God and say, "God, do you really want me to help the poor and the

389
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,440
 needy?

390
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,280
 Is that something that you want me to do?"

391
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,920
 The answer is already yes.

392
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:17,600
 God's made it clear that that's a kingdom value that we should be helping those who

393
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,720
 are in need.

394
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:23,520
 So you might need to ask some specific questions about how you do that and who specifically

395
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,520
 you help.

396
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:28,160
 But you don't have to ask whether or not you're supposed to help because you already know

397
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:30,060
 the kingdom value there.

398
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:34,960
 And so think about kingdom values in your life and some areas, some of those situations

399
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,080
 that you may be confused about and you may be asking God's questions.

400
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:43,640
 Maybe those questions are already answered just by looking at and aligning yourself with

401
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,280
 the values of the kingdom in those areas.

402
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:51,680
 And ask for things that match God's priorities, that align with God's priorities.

403
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,560
 What's important to God?

404
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:58,080
 God wants the people around you to feel his love, to feel his forgiveness, to feel his

405
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,200
 grace, to feel his goodness.

406
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,280
 God wants the people around you to come into relationship with him.

407
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,760
 And so if you say, "Well, I don't really know what to pray for my family," or, "I don't

408
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:10,880
 really know what to pray for my friends or my co-workers or my classmates," that's a

409
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,640
 great place to start.

410
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,160
 Start asking God for those things.

411
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,440
 You know what God's priorities are for those people in your life.

412
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,720
 God wants them to experience his love and his forgiveness.

413
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,680
 God wants them to come into relationship with him.

414
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:29,560
 God wants them to be served by you, by the members of the family of God.

415
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,480
 Start asking for that stuff.

416
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,400
 You don't have to wonder if God's interested in those things.

417
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,080
 We already know that God is.

418
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,480
 Those are priorities in God's heart and in God's kingdom.

419
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:45,000
 And ask for God's glory, things that are in alignment with God's glory.

420
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,560
 Again, we don't have to wonder if God is going to be behind things or in things that are

421
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,800
 glorifying him.

422
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:57,120
 We know that God is going to be in things that are glorifying him.

423
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,160
 And so when you face a situation in your life and you're like, "I don't know what to pray

424
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,160
 here.

425
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:04,240
 I don't know which outcome to pray for," that's a great place to start.

426
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,080
 Say, "You know what?

427
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:09,680
 There's this situation before me and this could happen or that could happen, and I'm

428
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:12,960
 not sure what God wants in my life."

429
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,960
 Begin to pray, "God, would you be glorified?

430
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,120
 I don't know what I'm supposed to choose.

431
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
 I don't know what's going to happen.

432
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
 I don't know the future.

433
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,480
 I don't have control over it.

434
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,520
 But would you be glorified whatever happens?"

435
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:28,560
 Begin to ask for things that are in alignment with God's glory.

436
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:35,000
 The reality is none of us have as much control over our lives as we think we do.

437
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,560
 We are not able to control the situations that are presented to us in life, but we can

438
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,320
 control the way that we respond to them.

439
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:49,120
 And God wants us to ask for his help in every situation that we face.

440
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:52,460
 God wants us to ask for his help when we have a need.

441
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:58,960
 God wants us to ask for his help when we are afraid, when we are confused, when we don't

442
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,440
 know where to go, when we need guidance, when we experience some type of deficit in our

443
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:07,640
 ability and we say, "God, I want to love this person, but I don't know how."

444
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:13,840
 Or "God, I want to live out the kingdom values in this situation, but I don't have the capacity

445
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,160
 to do that."

446
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,440
 God wants to help us in those situations.

447
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:21,680
 God wants us to ask for his help in every situation of our life.

448
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,200
 And we need to learn what to ask for.

449
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:28,160
 The things that align with the values of the kingdom, the things that align with God's

450
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:31,180
 priorities, the things that align with God's glory.

451
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:35,240
 We need to learn to seek holiness, to seek to draw near to God.

452
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:41,720
 We need to pursue that because God is waiting for us to respond to him.

453
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:45,600
 If there's not holiness and righteousness in our life, it's not God's fault.

454
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,520
 It's on us because we're not moving towards him.

455
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,440
 He's always moving towards us.

456
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,800
 And we need to really seek and ask God to allow us to possess and live out these values

457
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,800
 of the kingdom.

458
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,800
 Let's pray.

459
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:04,400
 God, I thank you for the privilege that you've given us to ask you.

460
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,480
 And I pray that we would learn to ask you for the right things.

461
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,440
 I pray that we would learn to ask you for the things that are truly best for us, for

462
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,840
 the things that are spiritually valuable, not just for our material and physical well-being,

463
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:21,400
 but that we would ask for the things that really are going to be best for us.

464
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:25,840
 I pray that we would learn to ask for things that align with the values of the kingdom,

465
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:32,080
 that align with your will and your priorities, your goals, and your glory in our life, God.

466
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:37,560
 And God, I pray that you would help us to begin to ask and seek to pursue holiness in

467
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,600
 our life, to pursue deeper relationship with you.

468
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,760
 And I pray that you would help us to ask that we would be able to possess the values of

469
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,900
 the kingdom, that you would give us these values of the kingdom that we've talked about

470
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:54,480
 in our hearts in a real way so that we can live them out and that we can experience you

471
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,880
 using us to bring healing and love and encouragement and salvation to the world around us, to the

472
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 people around us, God.

473
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:01,880
 In Jesus' name, amen.
