[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   - Thank you so much for your appreciation
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.200]   and I really appreciate and really encourage us as staff
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.140]   to continue to be faithful
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.140]   and we'll put your gifts in good use, all right?
[00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.480]   We could put your gifts in good use.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.480]   Today, we're going to continue our series on way of wisdom.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.800]   How do we live a life of wisdom?
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.580]   And the Bible has so much to say about it.
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.580]   And remember this passage that I talk about last week
[00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.880]   and it's from chapter 24 of Proverbs.
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.920]   And here, the wise teacher is going through
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.160]   some observation and he went past the field
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.240]   of the lazy people, sluggard,
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.800]   and he saw that everything is in ruin
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.800]   and he's trying to apply from his observation of the nature
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.940]   and apply it to his spiritual life, his personal life.
[00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.340]   So again, in the book of Proverbs,
[00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.740]   it's not simply about natural observation.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.740]   It's about observing and then get some spiritual insight
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.860]   so that your life can be built up.
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.300]   And one has to work against and fight against
[00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.040]   the chaos in our lives.
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.760]   You know, in the past week, have you thought the chaos
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.620]   or the chaos overwhelm you?
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.880]   You know, there are tons of chaos around us
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.920]   and if we don't put energy to work against it
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.680]   and fight against it, it will be a field of sluggard
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.640]   and it will be in ruin.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.480]   And your spiritual life, your personal life,
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.680]   your marriage, your family, your work, your career,
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:47.080]   everything will be in ruin.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.740]   And one has to do that and that is what the wisdom literature
[00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.000]   or the book of Proverbs has to say to us.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.480]   It's bottom up, observe how life works.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.360]   Observe the moral order, the spiritual order
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.760]   of God's universe and to observe that
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.020]   so that you can get spiritual insight from it.
[00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.520]   Now, sometimes we have to understand how to read Proverbs.
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.360]   So I really wanna encourage you to read Proverbs.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.720]   And here I give you a simple structure
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.160]   of the book of Proverbs.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.360]   And in this book, there are 31 chapters.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360]   And if you zoom out a little bit,
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.320]   you find that there's a whole structure of the book.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.480]   And you begin with the first nine chapters,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.880]   which is the introduction.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.280]   It's a prolonged introduction.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.560]   It's an invitation to walk in wisdom.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.720]   And you get the sense that the father or the mother
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.220]   is telling the son to walk in wisdom,
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.840]   to invite him to be wise, to learn the way of wisdom,
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.080]   encouraging him and urging the son to choose wisdom
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.040]   and reject folly of the world.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.760]   To choose God, reject the false gods in the world.
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.280]   And then you come to a long collections
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   of individual sayings from chapter 10 to 30.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.840]   And if you read those chapters, have you tried it?
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.780]   If you try to read one verse after another,
[00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.940]   it's sequentially, you try to understand it,
[00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:22.940]   you can't find a really tight flow of argument.
[00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.220]   Because it is not designed to be like that.
[00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:32.220]   It's a collection of a lot of different wise sayings
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.540]   and put them together.
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.140]   It's like an anthology.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.780]   You know what an anthology is?
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.700]   It's a collection of essays.
[00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.460]   It's a collection of articles in a book.
[00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.860]   So there's not necessarily a logical flow from it.
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.860]   So you can read chapter 10 to 30
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.400]   the same way you read the Book of Romans.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.360]   You know, the Book of Romans, we are doing bio study on it
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.580]   and we are still on the early chapters of the Book of Romans
[00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:03.340]   and you have to read it from verse one, verse two, verse three
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.100]   because Paul is trying to build an argument there
[00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.700]   and try to explain some of the themes
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.580]   and is trying to carry you through
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.900]   with some sort of sequential, you know, logical flow.
[00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.700]   But in the Book of Proverbs, it's not like that.
[00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:24.100]   So in order to understand chapter 10 to 30,
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.540]   the best way, I think, is to read them topically.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.380]   Is to read through it and then you try to collect
[00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:34.060]   some of the things that is related
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.360]   to a certain kind of topic.
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.440]   For example, money.
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:42.740]   Wealth and money.
[00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:46.980]   The Proverb has a lot to say about money, about wealth.
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:49.020]   So you read through those chapters
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:50.700]   and try to collect those things.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.340]   Just like you go to Whole Foods,
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.380]   you want to buy something and then you go through
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.980]   different aisles and then you pick what you want.
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:58.380]   It's kind of like that because, you know,
[00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.380]   wisdom is kind of like that.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.460]   Wisdom is observing and collecting
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:06.580]   and try to organize things.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.740]   So you read through these chapters 10 to 30
[00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.420]   with a certain kind of topic in your mind,
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.500]   like family life, work and career,
[00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:19.940]   speech, how we speak and when to speak,
[00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.100]   wisdom of speaking.
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.100]   You categorize them under different topics,
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.420]   under different headings, and then you try to understand
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.460]   what the wise is trying to tell you.
[00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:36.220]   And today, I want to demonstrate this topical reading.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:42.220]   And we're going to understand or study the theme of pride
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.580]   and humility.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:48.220]   Pride and humility.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.300]   What is that?
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.580]   So when you think of humility or pride,
[00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.420]   what do you think of?
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.680]   How do you define it?
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.580]   How do you describe humility?
[00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.580]   How do you describe pride?
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.940]   And from my understanding, we'll read through
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:05.600]   some of the Proverbs that has to do with this topic.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.580]   And I organize it into two related headings.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:14.720]   First heading is humility leads to more wisdom.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:18.780]   That's what humility will do to you.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:23.780]   The second topic is humility will lead to more life,
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:29.660]   life in God, more substantial growth in your life.
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.000]   So in these two headings, I want to study with you
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.760]   what humility, what pride is.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.820]   Now, first of all, what humility is not.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.820]   What is not humility?
[00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:44.100]   What is not?
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:46.080]   Now, humility is not humiliation.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.960]   Humility and humiliation are totally different things.
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.940]   All right, the difference is very, very, very important.
[00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.940]   Because especially for some of us who grow up
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.440]   in a shame-based culture, a shame-driven culture,
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:09.440]   you know, the Asian culture, is very much shame-based.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.100]   And humiliation sometimes is messed up with,
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:16.440]   misunderstood to be humility.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:20.880]   Humiliation or self-abasement, it's to shame yourself
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.520]   into thinking that you are worthless.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.040]   You know, less worth than other people.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.280]   Have less value than other people.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:34.740]   And it's very intriguing because at times,
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.560]   and this is how I experience it,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.340]   is that we think that we don't measure up
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.380]   and we have to compare ourselves to others.
[00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.380]   And in doing so, we try to prove that we are better.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.440]   We try to assert our own value
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.240]   by comparing ourselves to others.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:01.240]   But this is a whole complex of pride and, you know,
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.240]   humiliation, because when you compare yourself
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:09.600]   with other people, so often the result is that,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.380]   okay, maybe I still have something that you do not have.
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:17.400]   I still get something that you don't.
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:23.360]   And it's very easy to fall into another trap for pride.
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.960]   I compare myself with you, against you,
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.880]   and I find that, okay, maybe you are better,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:35.880]   but maybe there's some way I'm better than you,
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.780]   even though there's some other things
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:39.560]   that you are better than me.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:42.800]   Now, that is not humility.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:46.760]   Humility in the Bible says that, yes, I'm broken,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:51.760]   I am sinful, but God accepts me unconditionally in Christ.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   You see, this will free you up from comparison.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:02.280]   This will free you up from being arrogant, from pride,
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:07.920]   because humility is seeing yourself as low,
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:12.360]   humble, in front of God.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:15.960]   No one can measure up to God's standard.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:18.960]   So we come before God and we know, okay,
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:23.960]   we are sinful, we are sinful, and we are humble.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:30.200]   However, we are totally accepted unconditionally in Christ.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.240]   And that's the ground we stand on.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.080]   That is humility in the Bible.
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.920]   Look with me, chapter 15.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:44.120]   "Whoever ignores instruction despises himself,
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:49.880]   but he who listens to reproof gains intelligence," wisdom.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:56.880]   33, "The fear of the Lord is instruction in wisdom,
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.360]   and humility comes before honor."
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   All right, let's begin with the last verse here,
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:06.560]   the second verse, verse 33.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.840]   What is humility here?
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.680]   Look the parallel here.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.320]   You know, the wise saying always says,
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.920]   two short sentences put together.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:19.160]   Look the parallel between two sentences in verse 33.
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:23.400]   "Fear of the Lord is parallel with humility.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:28.800]   Fear of the Lord, as I explained briefly last time,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.960]   or other occasions, fear of the Lord means
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:36.360]   a proper relationship with God,
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:39.280]   a proper relationship with the Creator.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.800]   That is the fear of the Lord.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.800]   That's why I fear God, I worship God,
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.000]   because He is my Creator, He is my God."
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.840]   Right?
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.560]   So proper relationship with God is fear of the Lord.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.560]   And that is parallel, or sort of equal to humility.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:00.120]   To understand my relationship with God.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:03.000]   You see, this is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.920]   This is the gospel.
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:08.440]   I'm totally, 100% accepted by Christ,
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.120]   and that is sheer grace of God.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.160]   It's not because of my works.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.480]   It's not because I'm better.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:17.960]   It's not my goodness.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.800]   I'm totally accepted because what Christ has done for me.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.840]   Right?
[00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.240]   The righteousness of Christ.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:29.200]   I'm solidly grounded in the love of Christ.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.400]   And that is my security.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.600]   My security does not come from
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.160]   because I'm better than my co-worker,
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.560]   or my co-worker is worse than me.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.800]   My security does not come from,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.840]   okay, I'm better than my friends,
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.400]   or better than other people, probably in the church,
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.240]   I'm better than them, so I feel better.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.840]   That is a false sense of identity.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.960]   That is idolatry.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:00.000]   But when you are properly related to Christ,
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.200]   you receive grace unconditionally,
[00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:08.320]   and you receive the gospel,
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:12.160]   that's where your identity and your security come from.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.800]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:18.800]   So we don't have to compare with other people,
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.120]   because I have a solid ground to stand on.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:24.080]   That is the love of Christ, the grace of Christ.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.120]   In my college year,
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:33.960]   I remember a good pastor who taught this.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.960]   He shared one of his experience,
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.960]   and this pastor, I just love him.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.520]   He's so wise.
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:43.960]   And this pastor told us,
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:47.960]   when he was much younger, when he was younger,
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:50.440]   and he joined the church,
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.880]   and he wanted to join the church choir.
[00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:57.080]   So there he was, and he joined the church choir,
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.240]   and he had rehearsal,
[00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:02.240]   and he served in the choir for a few times.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.560]   And then one day, after the choir performance,
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.880]   or after the service,
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.880]   the choir director pulled him aside,
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:15.280]   gently and firmly said to him,
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.680]   and asked him, "Dear brother,
[00:13:17.680 --> 00:13:20.840]   "do you really think that God calls you to be in the choir,
[00:13:20.840 --> 00:13:23.760]   "because you're tone deaf?"
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:29.200]   And for the few times he was trying to join the choir,
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.440]   because he liked to sing.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.760]   He likes to sing.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.600]   He likes to sing hymns and praises to God.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.480]   So he wants to join the choir, or the worship team.
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:44.840]   And then it just dawned on him that he was tone deaf.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.240]   He just cannot sing in tune.
[00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:51.120]   And he messed up other people in the choir.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.440]   And after this realization,
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.440]   he understand he's not musically gifted.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.680]   He's not musically gifted.
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:00.400]   Yes, he can sing praises to God,
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.200]   you know, in the congregation,
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:04.800]   probably it will annoy some of the people beside him,
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:07.560]   but he's not musically gifted.
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.840]   And that's how he come to a conclusion.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:14.800]   And he shared with us his non-participation
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.400]   is helpful for the ministry.
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:24.800]   And he's not gonna be jealous and envious of other people.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.880]   Other people who are musically gifted,
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:31.280]   they can share the stage.
[00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:33.160]   They can lead other people to worship,
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:35.080]   but he's not gifted.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.240]   But he was totally secure.
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.560]   He doesn't feel bad.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:42.600]   He doesn't feel sad.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:44.400]   That's how God created me.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.280]   That's how God gifted me.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:48.640]   And that's how I use my gifts.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.720]   And he is very gifted in teaching.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.440]   Not in music, not in worship,
[00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.640]   but he is very gifted in teaching.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:59.120]   And that's why he's trying to polish his craft
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.720]   and to be a good teacher.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.200]   And he was a good teacher and he is a good teacher.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.240]   And that's what humility does to you.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.720]   You listen to advice.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:12.960]   You listen to those who teaches you.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   And he who listens to reproof gains wisdom,
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.160]   gains intelligence.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.920]   Now, what is humility?
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:26.760]   I like what C.S. Lewis says about humility.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:31.760]   C.S. Lewis is a very famous, well-known theologian
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:34.960]   or apologist in the 20th century.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.440]   Oh, he passed away a long time,
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.240]   but he wrote a lot of things
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.280]   and people are still studying the works of C.S. Lewis.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.760]   In fact, there was a institute of C.S. Lewis
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.160]   and people trying to understand what he wrote.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:52.000]   He wrote so much.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:55.120]   And C.S. Lewis says about humility.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:58.000]   He says, "Humility is not thinking less of you,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.920]   "but thinking of yourself less."
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.040]   Amen?
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:05.440]   Humility is not humiliation.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.960]   It's not thinking less of yourself,
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.800]   but thinking yourself a little bit less.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:15.920]   Because if you're totally grounded in the grace of God
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:18.920]   and the love of God, you're free.
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:21.000]   You're free to compare yourself
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.040]   and contrast yourself with others.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.240]   And that, as I explained, will lead to humiliation
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.360]   or a kind of subtle pride.
[00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:32.680]   Humiliation in the sense that I don't measure up
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.640]   and I'm jealous, I'm envious of other people.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.800]   They have other gifts and I don't have.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:42.800]   And so you're kind of in this loop of humiliation.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.480]   And the other result is pride,
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.280]   is seeing at least I'm better than you.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.040]   No, there's a very, very intriguing complex to it.
[00:16:56.040 --> 00:16:59.960]   But humility is not thinking less of yourself,
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.960]   but thinking of yourself less.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.360]   And the book of Proverbs has so much to say
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.600]   about pride and humility.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.500]   Humility is the way of wisdom.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.480]   Another verse in 1310.
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:18.920]   It says, "Pride only breeds quarrels."
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:24.440]   But wisdom is found in those who take advice.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.720]   You know, have you ever argued with someone?
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.400]   Have argument with the other people?
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:37.440]   Either your spouse or your child or a friend
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.060]   or whoever that is, or even your pastor.
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.080]   You see, in the midst of argument,
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.040]   so often there is pride, right?
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:53.320]   I want to prove that I'm right and you are wrong.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.800]   You know, in premarital counseling,
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:59.000]   I always tell the couples, I always tell couples,
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.480]   in marriage, marriage is only game in town
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:08.260]   that you have the result of,
[00:18:08.260 --> 00:18:13.000]   you don't have the result of win-lose.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.880]   You always have both of you lose
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.020]   or both of you win.
[00:18:19.020 --> 00:18:25.240]   There's no win and being lost in marriage.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.880]   Because if you lay down yourself,
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.120]   if you grounded yourself in the love of Christ,
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.260]   in the grace of God, there's no pride.
[00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.360]   If there's no pride, there's no argument.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.980]   You listen to one another.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:43.600]   You learn from one another.
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:47.680]   See, wisdom is found in those who take advice,
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:49.300]   who listen to advice.
[00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:53.400]   Last night, we have a small gathering
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.400]   with some of the husbands in the church.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.120]   And this is kind of a once in a while,
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:02.200]   once in probably nine months or 10 months,
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:04.320]   we get together for a simple dinner.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:09.320]   So I went there and to my surprise,
[00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:12.920]   we had so much to talk about.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:17.200]   So I show up in the restaurant at 7 p.m., 7 at night.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.800]   Went to Phoenix, 7 o'clock.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.000]   And I was planning to have a dinner for two hours,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:26.280]   for two hour max, right?
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:28.000]   What do men talk about?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.100]   Men have nothing to talk about.
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.560]   But when we sit down and then we warm up
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:37.520]   and then we go into talk about life
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.440]   and talk about family in general,
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.200]   to my surprise, we had a five hours dinner.
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:45.080]   Five hours dinner.
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:47.480]   I got home after 11.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.360]   Yeah, but I really enjoyed the community.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.280]   I really enjoyed the group, you know,
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:56.320]   try to open up ourselves and see,
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:20:00.440]   hey, you know, can we listen to one another
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   and learn from one another?
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:04.120]   Now, I want to tell you,
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:06.580]   this kind of community does not come easily.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.520]   Does not come naturally.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:13.760]   For us, for many of us, we have to commit
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:16.820]   in order to cultivate that kind of relationship.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.320]   We have to open up and we have to make commitment
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.880]   to spend time with one another.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.760]   Otherwise it won't happen, right?
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:27.000]   You go to church sometimes,
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.880]   you find the conversation is not deep.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:33.760]   And you get tired, you don't want to have fellowship.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:35.100]   You know why?
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.880]   It's not because people are shallow.
[00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:42.800]   All of us are yearning for meaningful conversation.
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:45.760]   However, in order to do that,
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.120]   there is investment.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:52.280]   We have to spend time and commitment
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.560]   to stick to one another in order to cultivate
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:00.200]   that kind of family, that kind of community.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:04.800]   So with the men, we talked so much about,
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:05.920]   you know, how to lead the family,
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.360]   how to relate to our kids,
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.800]   how to deal with the local politics,
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:12.000]   you know, election is coming,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.080]   and what are we concerned about,
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.520]   and why do we concern about this or that with our kids?
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.640]   And it was a very, very open
[00:21:19.640 --> 00:21:24.280]   and just great time together sharing
[00:21:24.280 --> 00:21:27.360]   and communication with one another,
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.000]   you know, over a glass of wine.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.480]   And that is wisdom, right?
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.240]   The community is the wisdom.
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:40.280]   So here we come to the second heading,
[00:21:40.280 --> 00:21:44.200]   which is humility leads to life.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:46.480]   Humility will give you more life.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.760]   If you gain wisdom and then you get life
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.560]   and then you get better life,
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.560]   a godly life, and then it will return back to you
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:59.920]   and will give you more humility.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:02.680]   And you will be humble before God and you learn more
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.200]   and then you get more wisdom.
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.440]   And this is a kind of a circularity.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.960]   Circularity in terms of, you know,
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:13.880]   you give and then it will give back to you.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:19.800]   1618, pride goes before destruction.
[00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:23.360]   Haunted spirit before a fall.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:28.120]   Now, this is the observation of the wise teacher.
[00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:32.320]   He observed there was an order in your life,
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:34.080]   order in human life in general.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:36.200]   This is the cosmic order.
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   You think you're powerful, you're invincible.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.520]   If you're prideful, you will fall.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:48.960]   You will fall, inevitably.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:53.400]   Because I'm preparing some of the messages
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.800]   for my trip to Toronto,
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.560]   I'm talking about the book of Daniel,
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:01.040]   especially the later chapters of Daniel.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.960]   Those are really tough chapters.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.840]   You have to do a lot of interpretation,
[00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.000]   do a lot of careful reading.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.320]   And I was doing some research,
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.760]   because the later chapters of the book of Daniel
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.360]   is all about the rise and fall of human kingdoms.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.520]   Rise and fall of human kings, like Assyrian kings
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:25.320]   and Babylonian kingdom and Persian kingdom
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:27.880]   and the Greek kingdom, the Greek empire.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.880]   It's all about the rise and fall of human empire on earth.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.360]   And only God's kingdom is eternal.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.000]   And that's pretty much what the later books,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.480]   or later chapters of the book of Daniel is all about.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:44.600]   So I was doing some research on the rise and fall of kingdoms
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.800]   and it's kind of fun research.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:49.040]   And now, of course, when we talk about
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:52.480]   the fall of any empire, any king,
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.080]   it's a whole complexity of factors go into it.
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:01.000]   How do you explain the fall of an empire?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:07.040]   Either in recent history, like the Soviet Union,
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.520]   fell in 1991, if I'm not mistaken,
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:16.540]   recent history, or in ancient history, in biblical time.
[00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:20.300]   Now, how do you explain the fall of any empire?
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.700]   Of course, there are a lot of different factors go into it.
[00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.960]   You know, economic slowdown or political corruption
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:33.960]   or the fall of, the collapse of their social structure
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:36.760]   or social unrest or there's a food supply,
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:40.360]   you know, farm surplus, not enough.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:41.320]   You know, those things.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.440]   But the newest research I want to share with you,
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:49.020]   the newest research is actually climate change.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.920]   Climate change.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.440]   You never thought of it, right?
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:58.280]   Never thought of it because, you know, an empire fell
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.080]   because, of course, it's mismanagement
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.440]   by one of the bad king, right?
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:05.960]   The last king.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.840]   And the newest research has to say
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:12.040]   there's one more factor that we have forgotten.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.680]   It's climate change.
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.160]   For example, this one.
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.220]   How did the Assyrian Empire fall?
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:24.320]   Now, Assyrian Empire, as you tell from the Old Testament,
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:27.280]   is the most powerful kingdom,
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.560]   the first most powerful empire
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:32.160]   the ancient world has ever seen.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:39.920]   Ancient first empire, Assyria,
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:44.260]   from the seventh century to down to,
[00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:46.960]   well, from the ninth century down to the seventh century,
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.160]   200 years, 200 some years of powerful empire.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.000]   And they conquered land after land after land,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.240]   conquered their whole world.
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.120]   And why did they fall?
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:02.640]   Now, the researchers are saying
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:06.540]   not only the social factors or political factors,
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:07.820]   but there's climate change.
[00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:11.240]   There's 125 years of magnet drought.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:12.600]   125 years.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.520]   Now, one year of drought, you know,
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.080]   you probably can, you know, go through it.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.240]   Two years, you probably can go through it.
[00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:23.980]   10 years, probably you can go through it
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:25.480]   because you have enough surplus.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.480]   But, you know, 125 years of mega drought,
[00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.740]   that happened in the last 100 years of the Assyrian Empire.
[00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:38.360]   That's why the empire fell.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.340]   It collapsed.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.240]   Now, that's very, very relevant for our day, of course,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:46.480]   because it's climate change, right?
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.480]   You see all this extreme climate pattern in Florida,
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:55.160]   in some of the places, in the wildfire, hurricane,
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.460]   wipe out everything.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:27:00.640]   Of course, it has so much to say about
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.960]   what the Bible has to teach us about creation care,
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:09.200]   about environment and all that, right?
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.800]   And many researchers are focusing
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:14.840]   on this kind of direction.
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:15.680]   You know why?
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:18.960]   Because not only because this is a relevant topic,
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.040]   it is because you cannot control it.
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.400]   You cannot control it.
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.480]   No matter how invincible you are,
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:29.600]   you just cannot control climate.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.260]   Now, that's what pride is.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:37.700]   To the empire, to the king,
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:39.840]   they always think that they are invincible.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:44.660]   Pride means self-sufficiency.
[00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:46.800]   I'm all good.
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.620]   I don't need other power, right?
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:51.720]   I can stand on my own.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:57.820]   I have my success, achievement, it's all mine.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:00.000]   It's by my power.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.960]   That's what pride is, self-sufficiency.
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:07.180]   There are factors that you cannot control.
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.820]   Even for empire, you just cannot control it.
[00:28:12.820 --> 00:28:18.020]   And that means you are not invincible.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:20.000]   You better be humble.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.180]   Last verse I wanna share with you is 22.4.
[00:28:24.180 --> 00:28:27.600]   Humility and the fear of the Lord
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.640]   bring wealth and honor and life.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:34.760]   Humility will give you life,
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:38.440]   but pride will give you collapse.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:41.960]   Think about some of the examples
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:45.580]   that you probably have some in mind.
[00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:50.280]   How personal life, how someone who is so successful,
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:53.160]   and he fell and collapsed.
[00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:56.600]   Moral collapse, spiritual collapse.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.680]   Think about even religious institution.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:02.040]   It can fall.
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:04.780]   If you think you're invincible,
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.080]   if you think you don't need to be accountable,
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:11.220]   what lesson we need to learn?
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.620]   Humility and the fear of the Lord,
[00:29:13.620 --> 00:29:15.780]   again, it's a parallel here,
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.500]   bring you wealth, honor, and life.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.360]   You cannot be pride, prideful,
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.820]   and think that you've got everything under your belt.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:30.260]   You see, the book is telling you
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:32.160]   you have to walk in the way of wisdom.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.160]   You need to surround yourself with other people of God,
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.380]   other godly people.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.100]   You cannot go through the spiritual journey by yourself.
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.080]   You have to have someone to help you,
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:50.760]   and that is humility.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:55.140]   And this will give you wealth and honor and life.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.800]   Now, I like the package here,
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:01.400]   wealth, honor, and life, especially the word honor.
[00:30:01.400 --> 00:30:05.760]   You know, in Hebrew, Hebrew is a very concrete language.
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:06.920]   It's very concrete language
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.960]   because you use a word picture all the time.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.960]   And honor, this word, is kavod in Hebrew.
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:16.840]   And what does it mean?
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:21.560]   Kavod means something really heavy, weightlifting.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:23.080]   Have you been to gym?
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:25.400]   Weightlifting, that is kavod.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.140]   That is something heavy.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.360]   Life has substance.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.580]   If you have honor, you have substance.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:36.480]   And humility will give you that.
[00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:38.680]   The fear of the Lord will give you that.
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:43.840]   So that's why we need to learn how to be humble.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.500]   And remember, we have to ground ourselves
[00:30:46.500 --> 00:30:49.820]   in the sheer grace of God.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:54.220]   And once we do that, we have security, true humility.
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:58.320]   So we can do what God has called us to do.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   Kelly has reminded us of the need for Bible study.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.080]   Now, I want to challenge and I want to encourage you.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:09.480]   Yes, we do need that.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:12.020]   To study the word of God,
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:14.120]   to listen to other brothers and sisters,
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.680]   and to be led so that you can understand the word of God.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:20.480]   We all need that, you know.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.340]   If you think you know it all,
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:27.200]   I think among us here,
[00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.800]   I would say I'm the one know it all, right?
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:35.560]   But you know, every time I have Bible study
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:38.800]   with other people, other brothers and sisters,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:41.360]   sometimes we go tangent, okay, fine.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:43.320]   But you know, I always learn something.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.160]   I always learn something.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:49.280]   I'm not going to say, you know, you guys,
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.080]   you know, you don't know much about,
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.600]   you know, the scripture and all that.
[00:31:53.600 --> 00:31:55.340]   That would be pride.
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.240]   But every time I get together with other people
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:58.800]   and listen to their life
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.640]   and listen to how they read the word
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:04.880]   and what they get from the truth of God,
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.320]   you know, that will cultivate wisdom.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:10.040]   And we all need this.
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:12.480]   And humility will give you reward.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.600]   And the reward is eternal life,
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.500]   wealth, honor, and life.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.260]   Let's all pray together.
[00:32:21.260 --> 00:32:26.640]   And ask Father to grant us true humility.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:29.800]   Father, we come before you.
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:32.880]   You are the source of our life.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:35.760]   You created us.
[00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:38.440]   You gifted us in so many different ways.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:40.360]   And we want to praise you.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:43.120]   We want to give you thanks because we are all different.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:47.660]   We're all gifted in a wide diversity of way.
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:50.760]   And that is your will.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.120]   And that is your goodwill.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:57.300]   Thank you, Father, for calling all of us to be your people.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.380]   Teach us the way of wisdom.
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:04.060]   Teach us the way of humility.
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:05.040]   Help us to learn.
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:07.720]   Learn about your word.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.560]   Learn about what you're doing in our life.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:18.140]   Help us to be grounded in your sufficient love.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:22.220]   And God, you are the all-sufficient God.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:24.220]   And we are not.
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.020]   We're not sufficient.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.260]   That's why we need your word.
[00:33:28.260 --> 00:33:29.220]   We need your community.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:30.860]   We need your love.
[00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.100]   Thank you for being our God.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:37.140]   And call us and encourage us
[00:33:37.140 --> 00:33:39.060]   so that we'll walk humbly before you.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:42.780]   Help us to look in our lives
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:45.780]   in the light of what Christ has done for us.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.580]   So that we stand secure.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:53.060]   We know that we are valuable in your sight.
[00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:57.940]   So valuable that your Son died on the cross to redeem us.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:34:03.940]   Let our lives demonstrate your way,
[00:34:03.940 --> 00:34:04.940]   your way of wisdom.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.280]   Help us, sisters and brothers in the church,
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:10.440]   we can learn from one another.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.900]   Help us to cultivate that kind of spirit of learning,
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:16.700]   spirit of humility, to learn from one another,
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.080]   to learn how to fear you,
[00:34:19.080 --> 00:34:21.840]   so that we can walk in the way of godliness.
[00:34:21.840 --> 00:34:25.680]   Shape us and form us and transform us
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:28.640]   so that your word will be our guidance.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.180]   Thank you for being our God, wisdom in Christ's name.
[00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:33.020]   We pray.
[00:34:33.020 --> 00:34:36.420]   Well, God bless you.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:39.060]   And we have some refreshment out there.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:42.140]   And again, I wanna thank you for all your support
[00:34:42.140 --> 00:34:45.580]   for our trip to Toronto.
[00:34:45.580 --> 00:34:48.700]   I'm leaving Chicago on Thursday.
[00:34:48.700 --> 00:34:53.100]   And we'll come back Monday night.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:55.880]   And pray for us and pray for me
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:59.540]   as I speak to other churches.
[00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:01.720]   All right, I have six messages to give
[00:35:01.720 --> 00:35:06.720]   and pray for good well-being.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.120]   All right?
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:10.180]   Okay, God bless you.
[00:35:10.180 --> 00:35:18.040]   And next week, Chi is preaching, all right?
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.640]   So please be here, please be here.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:24.760]   I'm sure he will bring a word of wisdom to all of us.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:25.600]   All right?
