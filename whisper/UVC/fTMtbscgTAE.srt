1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 All right, we continue our series on worship.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,920
 And I think we need to understand what worship is all about.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,920
 And I need to, we need to come before the word of God

4
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:15,120
 because the word of God is our final standard.

5
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,640
 It's the highest standard for our belief and our practice.

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,720
 Ask questions as someone who is in Christ.

7
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,840
 I want to know what worship is all about.

8
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,240
 Is it just about attending an hour of program

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,240
 to go through the motions and to just sing some songs

10
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,200
 and spend an hour and then I'll just check out,

11
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,520
 and then I'll go home.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,640
 Is it what worship is all about?

13
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:45,640
 So let me begin today with this main question.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,600
 This question is how can we become better worshipers?

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
 Or I should say, how can we be worshipers

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,920
 who are pleasing to God?

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,040
 How can we do that?

18
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,200
 So let's take a moment and talk to your neighbor,

19
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,640
 if you can.

20
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:03,800
 How can we be better worshipers

21
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,800
 or worshipers that will please God?

22
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,800
 All right, think about it.

23
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,760
 What would be your answers?

24
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,040
 What would be your answers?

25
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,600
 Now, sometimes when we approach questions like this,

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,720
 or some of the Christian practice

27
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,440
 revealed to us in scripture,

28
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,400
 sometimes we approach questions like this,

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:32,920
 like we approach our boss.

30
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,800
 I'll talk to some of you,

31
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,060
 and some of you are working from home.

32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,960
 And someone share a secret,

33
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,040
 because working from home,

34
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
 and you have to turn on Microsoft Team

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,600
 or Zoom or the online platform,

36
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,560
 and your boss has to know that you are present.

37
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:54,120
 And some of you have a smart way to fake your presence,

38
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,200
 you know, to get your, some sort of software.

39
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,760
 I don't know about this, but until someone told me.

40
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,560
 You can actually buy a software and install a software,

41
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
 and then mechanically remove the mouse from time to time,

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,480
 and just fake your presence in the online meeting.

43
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,600
 And that's a very, very wise way to do it.

44
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,360
 I would say this is beyond my wisdom.

45
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:25,240
 But, you know, is that all God cares about, right?

46
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,560
 I mean, do we treat God as our boss?

47
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,680
 You know, our boss simply, you know,

48
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,360
 want us to check in, right?

49
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
 Clock in and clock out.

50
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,840
 Want your time, right?

51
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,040
 And then we just fake our presence, right?

52
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,960
 Is that what God care about?

53
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,120
 What does God really care about, right?

54
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,880
 In this series, we say that in scripture,

55
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:52,240
 God is revealing to us who he is and what he does.

56
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,200
 From creation to new creation,

57
00:02:54,200 --> 00:03:00,840
 what God really care about is that he will live among us.

58
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,840
 He will be our God and we will be his people.

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,920
 And that's what worship is all about.

60
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,240
 It's not about clock in and clock out.

61
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,880
 Okay, I just check this.

62
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,640
 Okay, I've done this for this week,

63
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,160
 and I'll get worship done, and I'll sing some songs to God,

64
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,120
 and that's it, and I'll go my way, right?

65
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,720
 Is that what God really care about?

66
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,280
 God cares about his presence with us,

67
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,400
 his relationship with us.

68
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,880
 Your boss will not care about his relationship with you,

69
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:29,720
 right?

70
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,920
 That's why, you know, it is legitimate to think about

71
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,960
 how to fake your presence, right?

72
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,000
 Because all your boss cares about is your productivity,

73
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,200
 right?

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,840
 Squeeze you in some way that use you, right?

75
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:49,160
 Use you for productivity, for profit.

76
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,160
 But God cares about his relationship with us.

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,200
 And that's what it means when we believe in Jesus Christ.

78
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,800
 It's not about do's and don'ts.

79
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:04,560
 It's about our relationship with Christ.

80
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,880
 I was talking to someone, his friend,

81
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:10,360
 is a very devoted Catholic.

82
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:13,560
 And he was sharing with me,

83
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,720
 oh no, his friend is not willing to come to church.

84
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:23,280
 Going to church is not just part of his friend's agenda.

85
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,880
 Because as a Catholic, a lot of Catholics are like this.

86
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,520
 And of course, a lot of Christians are like this.

87
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,560
 A lot of evangelical Christians are like that.

88
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,600
 No, a lot of Catholics are, you know,

89
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,760
 when they approach faith, when they approach God,

90
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,600
 it's a cultural thing, right?

91
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,800
 Because my father and my mother were devout Catholics,

92
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,560
 so that's why I am Catholic.

93
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,440
 And that's part of my cultural identity.

94
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:52,000
 And if you ask a devout Catholic,

95
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,280
 so often you get the answer is that,

96
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,640
 of course I am a Catholic, right?

97
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,520
 Now Catholic in the sense of cultural identity, right?

98
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,160
 It's not really a personal encounter

99
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:06,680
 or personal intimate relationship with God.

100
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,920
 And that's what many, many Catholics are lacking.

101
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,480
 And I'm not trying to mention,

102
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:16,480
 but many, many Christians are like this too.

103
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,880
 Many Bible-believing Christians are like that.

104
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,440
 The kind of a cultural identity,

105
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,160
 kind of, you know, attack on an app in your phone, right?

106
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,080
 And you never use it.

107
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,420
 You got some apps in your phone, right?

108
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:30,400
 On your phone, installed, but you never touch it.

109
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,800
 You never use it, right?

110
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,480
 In case you need it, and then you click on it, right?

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,400
 It's not just part of your system.

112
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,680
 It's not, right?

113
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,480
 Many of us approach worship, approach God in that sense.

114
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,880
 And we lost what really God care,

115
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
 what God really care about.

116
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,840
 He care about His relationship with us.

117
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,840
 So therefore in the entire Bible,

118
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,820
 from creation to new creation,

119
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,480
 from the first chapter to the last chapter,

120
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,080
 it's all about worship.

121
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,400
 In some sense, everything is about worship.

122
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,320
 Everything is about God living in you,

123
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,880
 and you live in God.

124
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,280
 Everything is about you and God relationship.

125
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,820
 So we talk about creation.

126
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,200
 The Bible is a grand story.

127
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,520
 And even though we rebel against God,

128
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,380
 that's Genesis chapter three,

129
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:23,380
 but God is not abandoning the fallen world

130
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,520
 to rebel against mankind.

131
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,520
 God chooses to redeem them and to live among them.

132
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,020
 And therefore He saved the Israelites out of Egypt

133
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:37,580
 by grace, and then live among them in the form of tabernacle,

134
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,220
 the tent of Portable Temple,

135
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:44,500
 and living with them and guiding their way

136
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,980
 through wilderness.

137
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,380
 And then once they settle down in the land of Canaan,

138
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,440
 the promised land, God is dwelling with them

139
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,860
 in a stone temple, right?

140
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,060
 And as times go by, we know that all of this

141
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,860
 Old Testament symbols are pointing forward

142
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:01,780
 to Christ Jesus, our Lord.

143
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,540
 And Christ came and Jesus came and died on the cross

144
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,620
 to redeem His people and rose from the dead

145
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,820
 and gave us hope.

146
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:12,540
 And in Christ now, we worship, not in the stone temple,

147
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,980
 not in the tabernacle, because everything points

148
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,500
 to the reality of Christ.

149
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,940
 So in Christ we worship.

150
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,420
 In Christ we encounter God,

151
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,340
 and we build our relationship with Him.

152
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:29,340
 Until someday in eternity, when new heaven and new earth

153
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:34,260
 came down in the midst of us, and God lives among us,

154
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,340
 and that is what we call heaven,

155
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,540
 or should we call new creation, new heaven and new earth.

156
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:42,060
 So the entire story of the Bible tells us

157
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,540
 it's all about His relationship with us,

158
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,860
 and that's what worship is all about.

159
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,380
 Now, as we come to the New Testament,

160
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:52,540
 we find that there were a lot of teachings about worship

161
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,540
 and what worship is all about.

162
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:58,560
 Acts chapter two describes the early church,

163
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,140
 the first generation Christians, what they do in worship.

164
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:05,060
 All the believers devote themselves to the teachings

165
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,020
 of the apostles and fellowship,

166
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,300
 sharing in meals and to prayer.

167
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,180
 A deep sense of awe came over them all,

168
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,580
 and the apostles performed many signs and wonders,

169
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:18,980
 and all the believers, all the disciples met together

170
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,860
 in one place and shared everything they had.

171
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,420
 All the while, they praised God

172
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:26,140
 and enjoyed the goodwill of the people.

173
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,560
 Now, from this short passage, we can see

174
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,060
 worship is a priority.

175
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:35,480
 It's a priority for the tiny Christian movement

176
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,920
 in the beginning.

177
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,920
 They gather together in homes,

178
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,040
 you know, house churches, what we call,

179
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,960
 and worship is always a priority, not an option.

180
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:49,040
 And then worship is about a corporate community

181
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,640
 getting together, fellowship,

182
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:55,080
 face-to-face, sharing with one another,

183
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,900
 and they practice generosity.

184
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,420
 They give, right?

185
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:01,140
 Voluntarily, they give their resources

186
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,860
 to build up the church, the community.

187
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,800
 And worship is also a puppet weakness to the world,

188
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,740
 enjoying the goodwill of all the people,

189
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:14,340
 all the neighbors, all the people, not just the believers.

190
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,940
 And because when they see them worshiping together,

191
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,420
 when they see them gathering together,

192
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:23,580
 there is a function, or there is a power

193
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,580
 of outreaching missional, being missional in worship.

194
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:32,380
 You know, when people come into our gathering,

195
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:38,900
 they hear us praising God, they hear us worshiping God.

196
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:44,960
 What should happen is that they will sense

197
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,760
 that this is a different community,

198
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,640
 a different community that I cannot find

199
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,880
 in the rest of the world.

200
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,680
 Someone pointed to me sometimes

201
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,820
 on some worship songs on YouTube,

202
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,840
 and there were people who comment,

203
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:04,840
 you know, comment below a certain video

204
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,840
 or a certain worship song.

205
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,000
 And some of the comments are really interesting.

206
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,120
 And some of the comments, let me read that.

207
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,480
 Some of the comments reads,

208
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:18,220
 "I am not a Christian, but I am touched by the music.

209
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,400
 "I don't know this song,

210
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,520
 "but I'm touched by the message of the song."

211
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:27,160
 Now that's what worship should do, ultimately.

212
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:31,520
 It is going out, right, reaching out to other people

213
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,560
 so that people can understand our music

214
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,320
 and understand what we are doing,

215
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,800
 and they sense there's something different,

216
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,900
 you know, in the midst of Christian worship.

217
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,900
 So today I would like to turn to one of the passages

218
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,680
 in the New Testament that talks about worship.

219
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,040
 And that is 1 Corinthians chapter 14.

220
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,080
 As you know, the entire letter of Corinthians

221
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:58,420
 is a corrective letter.

222
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,960
 It means that the pastor, the apostle Paul,

223
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,800
 he writes the letter to correct some of the misbehavior

224
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,820
 and misbelief amongst the house churches,

225
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,080
 tiny house churches in Corinth.

226
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,900
 And there were many, many problems in the churches,

227
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,640
 or the house churches in Corinth.

228
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,240
 Division, they have a lawsuit against one another,

229
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,560
 they have sexual immorality,

230
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,680
 idle food controversies, and all that.

231
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,120
 So the entire letter is trying to correct one problem

232
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,600
 after the other.

233
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,600
 In 1 Corinthians 14, actually from 12 to 14,

234
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,900
 Paul is addressing problems in the worship,

235
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:43,340
 in the corporate gathering.

236
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:45,960
 And in chapter 14, there were two parts.

237
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:50,340
 First of all, Paul is talking about the difference

238
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:55,200
 between prophecy and tongues, speaking in tongues.

239
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,720
 And the second part of this chapter,

240
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,560
 he talks about your worship is a witness to other people.

241
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,220
 So let's break this down and try to understand

242
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,880
 what is going on here.

243
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,180
 Chapter 14, verse one.

244
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:12,640
 Paul said, "Let love be your highest priority, highest goal,

245
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,280
 "but you should also desire the special gift

246
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,000
 "or special abilities," by the way,

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,560
 this is New Living Translation,

248
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,240
 which is easier to understand.

249
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:22,600
 "Special abilities that the Spirit gives,

250
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,540
 "especially the ability or the spiritual gift to prophesy.

251
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:29,820
 "For one who speaks in a tongue

252
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,920
 "speaks not to men, but to God.

253
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,120
 "For no one understands him,

254
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:39,580
 "but he utters mysteries in the Spirit."

255
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:42,360
 Now what is he talking about?

256
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,800
 Now, first of all, what is tongue?

257
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,820
 What is speaking in tongue?

258
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,660
 What is speaking in tongue?

259
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:51,760
 I'm not sure you have heard, maybe you have,

260
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,160
 you have heard someone speaking in tongue, right?

261
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,280
 Yeah, when I was in seminary, my first seminary

262
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,760
 was Westminster Theological Seminary in California.

263
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,440
 And I lived with three other roommates, they are Koreans.

264
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,420
 And one of those guys, in the same age,

265
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,920
 when I was really young, right, 20 something.

266
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:13,920
 And then we lived together, four of us.

267
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,060
 And one of my roommate, Korean roommates,

268
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:20,900
 he speaks in tongue, every morning.

269
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,600
 He opened the Bible in his room,

270
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,320
 he does his devotional, and he will pray.

271
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,800
 And he will pray in some sort of unknown language, right?

272
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,260
 Of course, I don't know Korean, right?

273
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:37,720
 I'm not sure he was praying in Korean.

274
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:41,600
 So sometimes I ask him, "Hey, you're praying, right?

275
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,400
 "What kind of language are you praying?"

276
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:48,280
 Because it's different from normal conversation,

277
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,680
 normal speaking of Korean.

278
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,320
 So I ask him, "What kind of language are you speaking?"

279
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,440
 "No," he said, "I'm speaking in tongue."

280
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,440
 Some sort of mysterious, unknown language

281
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,480
 that only he and God understand, right?

282
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,360
 There's some sort of intimate language

283
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:10,360
 that only God and him would communicate, right?

284
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:15,360
 This is kind of like, you know,

285
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:20,400
 when you hear intimate couple talking to each other,

286
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,280
 you don't understand what they're saying.

287
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,120
 But they're talking, right?

288
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,160
 I remember one time I was in a church conference in Texas.

289
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,000
 I was all by myself, right?

290
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,480
 I went to a restaurant and I ordered my entree

291
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
 and I was enjoying my dinner.

292
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,600
 And next to me, at the other table,

293
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:41,760
 was a dating couple, I guess, right?

294
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,880
 They're pretty young and obviously

295
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,200
 they're in love with each other.

296
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,760
 You know, I can understand every single word they say

297
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,720
 in English, but I don't know what they mean.

298
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,160
 They have their own intimate connection, right?

299
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,040
 Communication.

300
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,640
 I guess speaking in tongue is kind of like that, right?

301
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:03,800
 So some people have the gift of speaking in tongue,

302
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,960
 some sort of mysterious, unknown language,

303
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,720
 his intimacy with God, and you can't understand

304
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,120
 until it is being interpreted, right?

305
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,680
 So that's speaking in tongue.

306
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,680
 And obviously there are some people who are gifted

307
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,800
 in such a way in the Church of Corinth.

308
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,480
 So as they gather together, some of the people

309
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,160
 will speak in tongue, you know, freely, right?

310
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,040
 And people around them who don't have the gift

311
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,240
 and where there's no translator or interpreter,

312
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,160
 there's no way you can understand what they say.

313
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,520
 That is speaking in tongue.

314
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,480
 And how about prophecy, all right?

315
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,320
 Prophecy.

316
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:41,080
 So Paul is trying to contrast speaking in tongue

317
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,520
 and prophecy, right?

318
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,360
 But what is prophecy?

319
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,560
 Now, modern people will always understand prophecy

320
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,960
 in a very narrow way.

321
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,340
 What is prophecy to you?

322
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:53,480
 What does prophecy do?

323
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,320
 It's always prediction, right?

324
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,600
 Weather forecast.

325
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,020
 Oh, will it rain tomorrow at 2.50 p.m.?

326
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,820
 Will it snow tomorrow, right?

327
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,760
 We always approach prophecy that way.

328
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:11,020
 But, you know, in the Bible, prophecy is much broader.

329
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,160
 You know, look at the prophets in the Old Testament.

330
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:21,160
 The prophets are spokepersons of God.

331
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:26,320
 And they always begin the message by, "Thus says the Lord."

332
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,520
 This is what Yahweh the Lord says.

333
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,400
 And you better listen.

334
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,120
 And that's what prophets would do, would say.

335
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,520
 And it's kind of like preaching.

336
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,660
 It's kind of like biblical teaching.

337
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:43,020
 So prophecy is not just about, you know, weather forecast,

338
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,500
 or what will happen tomorrow.

339
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:45,620
 It's not about prediction.

340
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,660
 It's about proclamation of the Word of God,

341
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,420
 the authoritative Word of God.

342
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:55,420
 So Paul is trying to contrast prophecy and tongues.

343
00:16:55,420 --> 00:17:00,780
 And what he's trying to get at is that prophecy,

344
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:05,020
 or preaching, or biblical teaching,

345
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:08,560
 is understandable to all the people.

346
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,620
 It's intelligent to all the people,

347
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,900
 because people can understand.

348
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,300
 It's a known language.

349
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,080
 And people can understand its meaning.

350
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:21,080
 But speaking in tongue, that is a barrier, right?

351
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,500
 Because you need to wait for someone to translate

352
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,380
 or to interpret in order to understand it.

353
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,980
 And Paul, in this passage,

354
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,380
 he talks so much about using those gifts.

355
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,820
 He said in the corporate worship setting,

356
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,700
 you better not use tongues.

357
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,420
 You better use prophecy.

358
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,500
 You better speak in such a way

359
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,000
 that everyone can understand.

360
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,840
 So verse four, he says,

361
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:47,580
 "A person who speaks in tongue is strengthened personally,"

362
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,580
 because it's an intimate language, right?

363
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,280
 Only God and him would enjoy it.

364
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,340
 But nobody else around him can enjoy it.

365
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:00,780
 So it's only strengthened personally,

366
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:04,440
 but one who speaks a word of prophecy, preaching,

367
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,300
 strengthens the entire church.

368
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,140
 And I wish you could all speak in tongues,

369
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:13,380
 because Paul, obviously, he also speaks in tongue.

370
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:17,300
 But he never does so in the worship setting,

371
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,840
 in the corporate setting.

372
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,320
 But even more, I wish you could all prophesy, right?

373
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,980
 You could all speak in such a way,

374
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,860
 teach in such a way, preach in such a way,

375
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,340
 everyone can understand.

376
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,700
 For prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues.

377
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
 Unless someone interprets what you're saying

378
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,620
 so that the whole church will be strengthened.

379
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:41,060
 Now notice the key words here, strengthen, right?

380
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,540
 Or the older translation would say to edify, right?

381
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,860
 It's a architectural term.

382
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,260
 So everyone getting together in a church setting,

383
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,700
 in a corporate gathering,

384
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:55,300
 our purpose is to strengthen one another,

385
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,820
 to pray for one another, to build up one another.

386
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:01,180
 Your presence, your prayers, your ministry

387
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:03,220
 is to edify other people

388
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:06,980
 so that the church can be built up, right?

389
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,620
 And the church, the word church,

390
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:11,580
 repeated many, many times in the entire chapter,

391
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,660
 nine times in total.

392
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,500
 Paul is saying we should use our spiritual gifts,

393
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:21,260
 our talents, our abilities to edify the church,

394
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,700
 to build up the church.

395
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:27,060
 And what we have, our skills and our talents

396
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:31,300
 are not for ourselves, but means to bless other people.

397
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,300
 It's not my own possession

398
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,740
 because the Spirit gives you in such a way

399
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,260
 that you can serve other people.

400
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,700
 I have been to many churches

401
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:46,700
 and I've always find that it's such a great blessing

402
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,060
 to see people using their gifts

403
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,180
 and using their skills to build up

404
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,860
 the community of the church.

405
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:59,700
 Some people who are gifted to help other people, right?

406
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,580
 Help in a very practical way.

407
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:05,460
 I know a brother in California.

408
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:09,340
 Every time I meet with him,

409
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,020
 he always ask the question,

410
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,660
 are you in need financially, right, financially?

411
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,020
 He's gifted in such a way that,

412
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:23,140
 I wanna bless you because God bless me so much.

413
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:24,740
 And I wanna bless you in such a way

414
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:27,620
 that God can use you, right?

415
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:32,700
 It's always good to have a friend like that, right?

416
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,660
 But I don't see him often.

417
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,820
 I don't see him often.

418
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:40,020
 But he's just gifted in giving, right?

419
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,540
 And some people who are gifted

420
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:47,540
 in emotional relational intelligence.

421
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,260
 Some people you can meet with them

422
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,500
 and they will encourage you in the conversations

423
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,460
 and they will build you up.

424
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,140
 And you find the conversation with him or with her

425
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,780
 is life-giving, right?

426
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:01,220
 Some people are especially gifted in such a way.

427
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:04,340
 Of course, we're always commanded to love one another,

428
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,340
 to care for one another,

429
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,460
 but some people are especially gifted in such a way.

430
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,060
 And some people who are obviously gifted in music, right?

431
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,300
 And they play music

432
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:16,860
 and so that we can sing songs together, right?

433
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,660
 And some of the gifts need to be developed

434
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,340
 and to be trained to be used.

435
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,980
 Otherwise, you would lose it, right?

436
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,600
 You realize I play most of the instruments, right?

437
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,500
 Why do I do that?

438
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,260
 It's not necessarily I enjoy it,

439
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,540
 but because when I go to different churches,

440
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,260
 you know, I serve different churches in the past,

441
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:43,480
 I find that it's very useful.

442
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:45,800
 And if I can get a handle on it,

443
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,260
 I'll learn it myself, right?

444
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,740
 I'll learn it myself.

445
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,420
 Because I want to bless the community that I'm in, right?

446
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,580
 The fellowship, the small group, or the churches,

447
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,000
 wherever I am.

448
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,940
 A couple of weeks ago, we had the MSI event.

449
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,420
 We went to a museum of science industry.

450
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:09,540
 And for church-wide events, sometimes I do observe

451
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,420
 that we are blessed with many, many people

452
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:14,380
 who don't take advantage,

453
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,880
 but they understand the purpose of the event

454
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,060
 is to connect with other people,

455
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,740
 especially non-Christians.

456
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,420
 Some people who bring new friends,

457
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:26,700
 and they just take the initiative to approach those friends

458
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,820
 and talk to them and to relate to them.

459
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:31,700
 But on the other side of the coin,

460
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:35,420
 sometimes I see Christians who just enjoy their own time,

461
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:38,020
 you know, and take advantage.

462
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,460
 And this is sad, right?

463
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,660
 Because we lose the focus, we lose the purpose

464
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,740
 of why we gather together.

465
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,060
 Paul is saying why we gather together is to strengthen,

466
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,380
 is to edify one another.

467
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:54,980
 Therefore, Paul is saying prophecy.

468
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,260
 When you speak in such a way,

469
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,740
 you can proclaim the word of God

470
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:02,100
 in such a way everyone can understand this is greater,

471
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,220
 this is stronger than speaking in tongue.

472
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,460
 You just enjoy your spiritual high, right?

473
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,980
 The whole church will be strengthened.

474
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:14,700
 And that's the first part of this chapter.

475
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,880
 The second part of this chapter,

476
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,080
 let me read part of the passage here.

477
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,900
 And this is a very important passage.

478
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,740
 Verse 23 and following.

479
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,900
 Even so, if unbelievers or people

480
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,380
 who don't understand these things, the spiritual things,

481
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,460
 come into your church meeting, your church worship,

482
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:35,820
 and hear everyone speaking in an unknown language,

483
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:36,920
 speaking in tongue,

484
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,500
 they will think that you guys are crazy,

485
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,300
 you guys are nuts, right?

486
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,800
 Because they don't understand.

487
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:46,820
 Verse 24, but if all of you are prophesying,

488
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,700
 preaching, explaining the faith

489
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,980
 in such an understandable way,

490
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,340
 unbelievers or people who don't understand

491
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,020
 the spiritual things come into your worship meeting,

492
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,420
 they will be convicted of sin and judged by what you say.

493
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:03,740
 Verse 25, as they listen,

494
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,000
 their secret thoughts will be exposed.

495
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,860
 They will fall to their knees and worship God,

496
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,060
 declaring, "God is truly here among you."

497
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,720
 You see the key word here is understand.

498
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,240
 It's the principle of understandability

499
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,040
 or intelligibility.

500
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:26,360
 It's the principle of doing something

501
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,760
 that people can understand, even visitors,

502
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,540
 non-Christian visitors, will be able to understand.

503
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,800
 (stammers)

504
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,700
 Let me ask you a question.

505
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:42,860
 Is our worship design

506
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:47,080
 understandable to most people?

507
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,820
 Yes, right?

508
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:53,300
 Yeah, we use, I'm very grateful for worship leaders

509
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,860
 and people who serve in the worship ministry

510
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:59,700
 and they choose songs that are newer

511
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:02,700
 or they're more contemporary, right?

512
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:07,700
 I'm not saying we should abandon the traditional hymns, okay?

513
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,560
 All right, for those, well, I'm probably the older guy here.

514
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,740
 That's so sad.

515
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:18,940
 But anyways, when we grow up in the church,

516
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:21,160
 we learn a lot of traditional hymns,

517
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,500
 many, many traditional hymns.

518
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:27,100
 And when I hear those traditional hymns,

519
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:32,660
 I immediately go, this is my language, right?

520
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:33,660
 This is my language.

521
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,900
 And we used to sing from a hymn book, right?

522
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,620
 We sing the old, old hymns.

523
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,700
 But we need to understand worship as a language.

524
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:48,060
 It's kind of a language or kind of a form

525
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,180
 that is always evolving,

526
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:55,180
 from time to time, from generation to generation, right?

527
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,820
 Those songs used to be a great hit

528
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,860
 and no longer the language of today, right?

529
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,320
 Again, I'm not saying we have to abandon

530
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,180
 everything traditional.

531
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,500
 I'm not trying to say, let us embrace the newest thing,

532
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,420
 right, like the iPhone, right?

533
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:19,880
 The newest iPhone, everyone wants to get it, right?

534
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,100
 I'm not trying to say that,

535
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:24,620
 but the mission of the church, Paul says,

536
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:27,620
 is to make worship gathering in such a way

537
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:32,620
 that will honor God and that is also understandable

538
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:36,300
 to other people, right?

539
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:41,300
 So I'm grateful for those who try to use songs

540
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,380
 or new songs to worship,

541
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,580
 because the mission of the church

542
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:49,060
 is not to keep certain tradition, right?

543
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,540
 That is not our mission.

544
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,540
 Our mission is to make faith and the Bible

545
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:57,540
 and our message understandable

546
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,700
 and that is the spirit of the passage here.

547
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:06,100
 Those of you who have been to a traditional worship setting,

548
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:11,600
 when you come in, you pick up a copy of the bulletin, right?

549
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,860
 Do you still remember those days?

550
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:16,300
 Or I'm just dating myself, right?

551
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:21,020
 Yeah, you pick up a copy of a sheet of paper

552
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:25,180
 with the, it's called worship bulletin, okay?

553
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:30,060
 And it lists every single component of the worship service.

554
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,020
 The first one is usually is the call to worship

555
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:35,860
 and then there's a prayer and then there's another prayer

556
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,340
 and then you stand up for the prayer

557
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,460
 and then you sit down for another prayer

558
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,820
 and then there's a scripture reading and then preaching

559
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:47,300
 and then you sit down and you do a certain hymn

560
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,660
 and then after you do a certain hymn

561
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,740
 and then you do some other component

562
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,100
 and then you stand up again for a doxology

563
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:56,020
 and then you sit down and then you do your silent prayer

564
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,940
 and then you go, right?

565
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,300
 You see what I'm saying?

566
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,080
 There's a traditional liturgy, right?

567
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,220
 Traditional liturgy.

568
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:05,180
 And some of the churches still do that, right?

569
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,420
 But we don't, right?

570
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:07,260
 We don't.

571
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:10,060
 Why don't we print a worship bulletin

572
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,020
 and hand you one copy when you come in?

573
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:15,060
 Why don't we do that?

574
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:17,580
 Why don't we do that?

575
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,240
 We don't.

576
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,280
 Because we're lazy.

577
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,620
 We don't wanna do some stuff, right?

578
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,900
 Well, no, no, no.

579
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,920
 We wanna be environmental, right?

580
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,140
 We don't wanna waste paper, right?

581
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,420
 I've been to some churches

582
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,820
 where traditional in worship form,

583
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:37,060
 after the worship service, you see papers lying around, right?

584
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,600
 And then you just go to,

585
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,700
 those papers will go to the trash.

586
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,380
 But what I'm saying is the form

587
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,620
 or the language of worship evolves from time to time, right?

588
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:47,960
 Even the instruments that we use, right?

589
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:52,340
 In my old days, in my old days,

590
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:57,220
 we only do organ and piano, right?

591
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:59,980
 So many, many of the traditional churches,

592
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:04,700
 they have to have organist, someone who play organ, right?

593
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,900
 Wouldn't it be nice if we have a pipe organ in the church?

594
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:10,040
 Don't you think so?

595
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,880
 Yes?

596
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,620
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

597
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:14,540
 But the maintenance will kill you, right?

598
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:19,180
 You need to spend a lot of money to maintain those stuff,

599
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,020
 right?

600
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:23,360
 We use electric piano, right?

601
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:25,220
 Electric keyboard, right?

602
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,340
 Yeah, let me tell you this little story about drum set.

603
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:31,620
 Okay, I told some of you about this drum set.

604
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,420
 Now, I remember in the '90s,

605
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,420
 I was in my church in Vancouver, in Canada.

606
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,200
 We didn't have a drum set.

607
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,120
 And some of the brothers and sisters wanted to suggest,

608
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,520
 "Oh, let's use drum set."

609
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,360
 Those are the early days of the worship team, right?

610
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,960
 The band, worship band, music band.

611
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,240
 And we didn't have a drum set.

612
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,440
 And the deacon board called for a meeting to vote

613
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,360
 whether we should buy a drum set using church budget.

614
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,360
 And there was a huge controversy.

615
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,160
 It was a huge controversy because some people,

616
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,960
 the older folks, they said, "Oh, we should buy a drum set.

617
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,940
 "The older folks especially,

618
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,460
 "they are against the idea of putting a drum on stage

619
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:17,620
 "or buying a drum using church money."

620
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,260
 You know why they think that way?

621
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:25,460
 You have to understand, they grew up in the '70s,

622
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,700
 you know, the '60s and the '70s.

623
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,220
 Those are the days, you know, sexual revolution

624
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:33,700
 and all that liberation movement, right?

625
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:37,820
 And for them, this thing, drum set,

626
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,940
 is for those who smoke weeds, right?

627
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,140
 Those rock band, right?

628
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:48,300
 The rock musicians, they use this kind of instrument.

629
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,740
 But they cannot change, right?

630
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,340
 Because the language has changed, right?

631
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:57,620
 And people use drum set for a different reason now, right?

632
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:01,600
 People play electric guitar for a different reason now.

633
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:06,400
 Those are the old days, all the rebellious teenagers,

634
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,900
 the young people, would play those instruments, right?

635
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:12,140
 And they never thought of putting those instruments

636
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,060
 in the church.

637
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:15,140
 So there was a huge debate

638
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,060
 about whether we should buy a drum set.

639
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,220
 And what is the result of the vote?

640
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:23,540
 It was no.

641
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,500
 We don't buy it, right?

642
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:28,240
 And so it didn't carry through.

643
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,700
 So I was serving in the church and I was saying,

644
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,720
 okay, let me just buy it out of my own pocket.

645
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:37,440
 So I did.

646
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,000
 I spent almost $2,000 to buy this thing, right?

647
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,960
 So this drum set belongs to me.

648
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,500
 It follows me.

649
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:48,480
 It follows me every single day, you know?

650
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,420
 Whenever I serve in the church, I say,

651
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:51,960
 hey, you don't have a drum set?

652
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,100
 Boom, here.

653
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,940
 Okay, it's the instrument,

654
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,100
 it's a personal instrument of the pastor, okay?

655
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,360
 The pastor plays drums too, okay?

656
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,780
 So it's okay, all right?

657
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:04,320
 It's not like we are going astray or something like that.

658
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,200
 But what I'm trying to tell you is that

659
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,840
 there is a different language

660
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,760
 from generation to generation.

661
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,440
 Even the attire is different.

662
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,320
 What we wear is changing, right?

663
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,480
 You go to the tech talks,

664
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,500
 you go to the big announcement from the big company,

665
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:26,820
 the IT companies,

666
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:30,760
 you know, those CEOs, they don't wear suit and tie, right?

667
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:33,280
 They don't do that anymore, right?

668
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,980
 We change, right?

669
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,600
 Whoever does the announcement is short, right?

670
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,480
 And it's okay, right?

671
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,440
 And it's okay.

672
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,920
 And we have to distinguish what the Bible,

673
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:52,400
 what the Bible says, what the Bible says,

674
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:55,860
 and what tradition says, right?

675
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,660
 God want us to hear his word,

676
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,500
 but not just our tradition.

677
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,420
 And that's the spirit of the passage.

678
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:11,620
 Even the songs that we use today, right?

679
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,460
 I remember some months ago,

680
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:16,980
 I was trying to pause my Hebrew, my biblical Hebrew.

681
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:20,780
 So I tried to learn some Hebrew songs.

682
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,720
 So it's a very beautiful songs.

683
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,280
 You know, the Hebrew songs, the Middle Eastern melody,

684
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,000
 is actually very, very sweet, all right?

685
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,520
 So I was trying to play those songs

686
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,460
 because I wanna learn some new Hebrew words, right?

687
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:36,100
 Like Psalm 23, you can sing the whole thing, right?

688
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,340
 And I was using my guitar

689
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,240
 and trying to sing some Hebrew songs

690
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,000
 so that I can remember some of the words, right?

691
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,760
 And then my kids, my children,

692
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,240
 they came over and say,

693
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,480
 "Can you please stop?"

694
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:54,680
 Because it doesn't sound good, right?

695
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,560
 Actually, it sounds good, right?

696
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,800
 Actually, it sounds good.

697
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,200
 And I sing well.

698
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,360
 And you know, what I'm saying is the language has changed.

699
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,840
 The melody has changed.

700
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:08,900
 And we have to be relevant, right?

701
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:12,560
 So the principle here is that worship is vertical.

702
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:17,140
 Worship is that we bring the offering to God vertically.

703
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,580
 Because we are the people of God,

704
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,440
 and God loves us, and God cares about us, we worship Him.

705
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,920
 All because God has created and redeemed us,

706
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,680
 and we respond to the great acts of God.

707
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:31,760
 We respond by saying, "God, thank you for saving us.

708
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,920
 "Thank you for letting us be your people."

709
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,900
 So worship is, first of all, vertical.

710
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,780
 But it is also horizontal.

711
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:43,040
 It's all about other people,

712
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,080
 and we cannot ignore one another.

713
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:48,260
 And worship needs to be edifying,

714
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,480
 to build up other people

715
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,300
 so that people can understand the message.

716
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:57,300
 And even it can be, it needs to be missional, evangelistic.

717
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,200
 When people walk into our church,

718
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,120
 when people join our meetings,

719
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:03,520
 when people come into our worship,

720
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,040
 they will sense that this is different, right?

721
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,840
 And it's not about the size.

722
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:11,160
 It's about the message that we carry, right?

723
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,100
 People can see, hey, God is in the midst of you.

724
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:20,180
 And let me close by trying to answer this question.

725
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,940
 How can we be better worshipers?

726
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:24,820
 First, I would like to suggest, be mindful.

727
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,860
 Be mindful.

728
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,500
 When you come in and worship God,

729
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:32,860
 be mindful in the sense that we are approaching God,

730
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:35,220
 we are approaching God with a pure heart,

731
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,900
 and we need to be fully present.

732
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:42,340
 Our mind, our spirit need to be fully present.

733
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,680
 Even our physical body needs to be fully present

734
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:50,760
 to prepare ourselves so that we can come

735
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:55,760
 to the presence of God to be a worshiper pleasing to Him.

736
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,720
 And secondly, let us be reminded

737
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,440
 to be obedient in our attitude.

738
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,200
 When we come in and pray, prepare our hearts

739
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,560
 so that our hearts is a good soil.

740
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,820
 We can receive the word of God, the message of God

741
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:17,140
 through songs and prayers and sermons and all that we do.

742
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,820
 Be obedient.

743
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,540
 And lastly, let me remind you to be prayerful.

744
00:36:25,540 --> 00:36:31,940
 We approach this holy God, this great and awesome God, right?

745
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:36,420
 And we need to approach Him with a clean heart.

746
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,100
 I always find this good practice.

747
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:43,400
 I come into a worship, corporate worship,

748
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:47,660
 a little bit earlier, and I do a little prayer,

749
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,960
 and I ask for forgiveness.

750
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,460
 I ask that God will forgive my sins and cleanse me.

751
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,800
 And I pray that God will prepare my heart to approach Him.

752
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:01,220
 And sometimes I even need to pray

753
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,900
 and forgive other people, right?

754
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,500
 Other people, other brothers and sisters,

755
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,800
 other family members.

756
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,500
 I need to ask them, I ask God to forgive them, right?

757
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:16,800
 So that I can approach God in a new and fresh way.

758
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,460
 How can you become a better worshiper?

759
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:24,760
 How can you become a better worshiper?

760
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:27,420
 Let us pray and prepare our hearts

761
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:28,980
 to receive the communion today.

762
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,420
 Let's pray.

763
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:36,420
 Father, as we come before your presence,

764
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:37,660
 we want to say thank you.

765
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,820
 Thank you for forgiving our sins,

766
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:44,660
 for cleansing us, for redeeming us,

767
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:49,160
 all because what Jesus our Lord has done on the cross.

768
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:54,220
 He died and shed blood in order for all of our sins,

769
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:58,620
 the past, present, and future, everything forgiven

770
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:03,940
 so that we can be called, declared righteous in Christ.

771
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:07,900
 Thank you for what you have done.

772
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:12,900
 And our worship is a response to your grace.

773
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,020
 Thank you for loving us.

774
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:17,340
 Thank you for calling us to worship you.

775
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:24,580
 So we ask that you will cleanse our hearts and our mind

776
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,400
 so we will focus on you.

777
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,260
 As we come before the Lord's table today,

778
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:35,780
 we ask that you will refresh our heart and our spirit

779
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,580
 as we partake the bread and the cup.

780
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:43,580
 These are the symbols, the tangible reminders

781
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,980
 of your love to us.

782
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,300
 And thank you.

783
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,860
 And may your grace continue to transform us.

784
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:52,300
 In Christ's name we pray.
