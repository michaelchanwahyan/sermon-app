1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,760
 Wave hands to your friends, yeah.

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,840
 (laughs)

3
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:05,680
 Alright.

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:12,200
 Well, one last announcement is the registration, I think.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:16,860
 Oh, okay, alright, we have our continuous daily devotion.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:18,520
 Make sure you subscribe to it,

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,840
 join our social media group,

8
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,120
 and read a small portion of the devotional material

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,720
 to help you walk in the way of God, okay?

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,600
 So the theme is very interesting.

11
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:32,120
 It give us today our daily bread, okay?

12
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:34,960
 Eating is so important for many of us, right?

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,100
 Especially Asian and Chinese, right?

14
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,860
 We greet each other, "Have you eaten yet?"

15
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,840
 (laughs)

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,440
 "Have you eaten your lunch or your dinner?"

17
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:46,920
 We're so concerned about our own feast, right?

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,320
 Our own eating, our own stomach.

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,400
 But the Bible has a lot to say about eating, right?

20
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,000
 The Bible has a lot to say about our food.

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,920
 And in fact, the food, the meals that we have,

22
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,760
 are often tests and temptations to all of us.

23
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,880
 So I hope this daily devotional

24
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:06,320
 will help you and challenge you.

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,340
 Today is the last day for registration

26
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:11,280
 to be the voting member.

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,020
 I have explained to all of you,

28
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:18,280
 the system at UV is kind of a system of democracy.

29
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,520
 Alright, so all the voting members registered to be active,

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:25,560
 and you can nominate each other,

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,960
 and then elect each other to be the new,

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,240
 to become the core team of the new term.

33
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,840
 Our Angus congregation, although it's smaller,

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,680
 we are not small, right?

35
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,240
 We are not small, as I can see.

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,940
 There are, I think five, right?

37
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:46,940
 Five nominees coming out of you guys, alright?

38
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,000
 Maybe 10 out of the 10 o'clock service,

39
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,040
 but five out of you guys.

40
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,920
 This is so important because our pastoral staff

41
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,200
 are working alongside with our elected

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,360
 core team members to lead the church.

43
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,640
 So for the next three years,

44
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,360
 we're gonna generate a new leadership team,

45
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,980
 and we're gonna meet on a monthly basis

46
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,800
 for one hour or so to discuss church business

47
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,680
 and church direction and a lot of things.

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,600
 We come to the church meetings,

49
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,320
 whether it's worship service or fellowship,

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,320
 or later you go to have your feast tonight at Mears.

51
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,440
 You know, you need to understand,

52
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,120
 sometimes we show up to eat, and then we'll be gone, right?

53
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,920
 But there are tons of things behind the scene.

54
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,680
 People are working so hard to make sure

55
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,600
 the schedule is right, and make sure all the tools,

56
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,740
 all the elements are there in order for us to enjoy.

57
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,400
 So you need to understand, church is not just

58
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,900
 what you can see, it's not just one hour

59
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,440
 or two hours a week.

60
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,960
 There are 24/7 behind the scene,

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,480
 people are doing things to prepare stuff for us.

62
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,160
 So the core team leadership is actually in charge

63
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,440
 of all, many of the ministry

64
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,080
 and all the works behind the scene.

65
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,200
 So this is so important.

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,060
 So register if you have not.

67
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,200
 If you have registered, praise God, okay?

68
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,380
 If you have registered, after today,

69
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,380
 we will enter into the second phase of our election,

70
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,580
 is the phase of nomination.

71
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,520
 So there will be three Sundays,

72
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:30,180
 October 9, 16, and 23.

73
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,460
 We're going to generate a list of nomination.

74
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:38,460
 So once you register, you will be able to nominate people

75
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,740
 from the list of qualified nominees, or potential nominees.

76
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,620
 You're gonna nominate among each one of us.

77
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:54,740
 Whoever got the highest number of nominations,

78
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,300
 will go into the third phase, which is election.

79
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:00,400
 All right, election is on the Sundays

80
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,320
 of November 6, 13, and 20.

81
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,820
 So for three Sundays, we're gonna cast our vote, all right,

82
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,500
 to the list of nominees.

83
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,660
 And then after the three Sundays of election,

84
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:15,180
 November 6, 13, and 20, we're gonna generate

85
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,540
 a new group of qualified members,

86
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:23,440
 and the results will be out on 20th of November.

87
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,980
 All right, got it?

88
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,780
 I like this system.

89
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,500
 I like this system, because we always have room

90
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,140
 for new members, for new leaders, for new ideas.

91
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,700
 We need all of you to serve together.

92
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,820
 In fact, the Bible tells us we need to do

93
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,420
 our best to serve God, to use our time,

94
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:51,300
 to use our talent, and to use our treasure

95
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,980
 to serve God's kingdom, all right?

96
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:58,220
 So three Ts, your time, your talent, and your treasure.

97
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,620
 In my years in the past few churches, including this one,

98
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,100
 I'm so amazed by how God has raised up so many people,

99
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,820
 brothers and sisters, to do the little work behind the scene

100
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,820
 and to make the gospel possible, make the church possible.

101
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:23,500
 Each one of us is gifted in many different ways, all right?

102
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,500
 I want to remind you, the church is composed

103
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:32,280
 of different members.

104
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:35,460
 All of us are different, totally different, right?

105
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,300
 You don't want a church that, you don't want a church,

106
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,620
 the church body that has only one guy,

107
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,980
 like everyone looks like Mark Chan.

108
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,860
 That would be the worst church in the world.

109
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:52,020
 Everyone is unique, everyone is different, right?

110
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,940
 So use our talents and discover our talents.

111
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,060
 We started our worship service 1130 until now.

112
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,660
 There were many people working behind the scenes.

113
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,860
 Some were doing the PowerPoint,

114
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,940
 some were doing the OBS,

115
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:10,940
 some were doing preparation and the worship team,

116
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,420
 they practice beforehand and come and set up

117
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,500
 and lead us into the presence of God.

118
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,980
 So there were a lot of things.

119
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:21,060
 We can use our gifts and use our talents, all right?

120
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:26,060
 So these three phrases, please remember today, September 11,

121
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,380
 you're going to register,

122
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,220
 this is the last Sunday to register, all right?

123
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:30,380
 All right?

124
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,540
 All right, so next one.

125
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:35,500
 Oh, courting position, yes, there you go.

126
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:39,020
 All right, so there will be a fellowship dinner today, right?

127
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:43,580
 Praise God, praise God, praise God for good food, okay?

128
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,140
 But I hope we have good time of fellowship as well, all right?

129
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,700
 It's not just about eating, it's about being together, right?

130
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:56,900
 And then what you do as giving, remember my three Ts?

131
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,900
 The third T is treasure.

132
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,700
 You are not just giving for something unknown,

133
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,380
 you're giving to the ministry.

134
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,700
 We are trying to build up our ministry,

135
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:10,020
 that our ministry is not just here and in the neighborhood,

136
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:10,980
 it's not just that.

137
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,900
 Of course, this is our first priority.

138
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:14,820
 As a community church,

139
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,420
 we wanna serve the people in our neighborhood,

140
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:23,420
 but our ministry goes to, I don't know, globally, right?

141
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,540
 Some of our YouTube videos, some of our teaching

142
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:29,420
 will go to somewhere else in the world

143
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,820
 and bless other people.

144
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,660
 So as you give, remember this,

145
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:37,660
 you are participating in the global work of Jesus Christ.

146
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:39,300
 All right?

147
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,060
 There was something I remember, I wanna remind you.

148
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:42,900
 I forgot, yeah.

149
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,700
 Shouldn't be important, but anyways, yeah.

150
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:50,420
 So continue to give and give faithfully, all right?

151
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:55,220
 So today is my substitute preaching

152
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,660
 and let me give you a five minute recap

153
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:01,220
 of what I did in the past two weeks.

154
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,220
 And then I give you the highlight

155
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:06,940
 or my highlight of the whole trip.

156
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:13,540
 We went to different sites and different places in Israel.

157
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:15,900
 If you have seen some of the videos,

158
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,140
 you should, first of all, you should remember,

159
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,220
 we often have some sort of preconception

160
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,900
 of what the land of the Bible, Israel, is, right?

161
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,300
 Now, if you ask your neighbors,

162
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,340
 if you ask your neighbors,

163
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,940
 what do you think of the land of Israel, right?

164
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,180
 What kind of image, what kind of impression

165
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,700
 come into your mind when people mention Israel, Palestine?

166
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,820
 Okay, talk to your neighbor, go to your neighbor.

167
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:44,380
 What are some of the first impressions that you had

168
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,660
 with the land of Israel?

169
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,460
 What are some of those?

170
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,060
 Yeah, what were some of those that came to your mind?

171
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,220
 What was that?

172
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,460
 Here, here, this corner.

173
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,820
 What you guys talk about?

174
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,700
 (laughs)

175
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,380
 Dusty, dusty and sandy, right?

176
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,940
 Yeah, right, right, right.

177
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,460
 What else?

178
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,300
 How about that?

179
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,700
 Huh?

180
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,540
 War, yes, war, right?

181
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,700
 Yeah, it's always a missile and bombs and all that, right?

182
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,540
 That's all you got, right?

183
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:17,580
 That's all you got.

184
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,420
 What else?

185
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,660
 I'm sorry?

186
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,780
 Promised, promised land.

187
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,340
 Promised land, did I get it right?

188
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,540
 Okay, it's good, good.

189
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,900
 That is correct.

190
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,500
 (laughs)

191
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:35,260
 Well, is it sandy, is it dusty?

192
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:37,660
 Some areas are dusty, right?

193
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,260
 Just like Chicago.

194
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,220
 Some areas are really dusty.

195
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,220
 It was very interesting, I meet some friends

196
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,980
 or people, strangers on the street,

197
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,060
 and sometimes we exchange conversation, right?

198
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,420
 And then they ask, "Where you from?"

199
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,740
 And I ask, "Where you from?"

200
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:57,660
 "Oh, you from Sweden or from Germany."

201
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,980
 And then I say, "I'm from Chicago."

202
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,820
 And their impression of Chicago,

203
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,700
 it's very dangerous place.

204
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:07,300
 It's probably the most dangerous place in the world.

205
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,980
 (laughs)

206
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,140
 That's true, right?

207
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,660
 In fact, yesterday, if you heard about the neighborhood news,

208
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:17,500
 I got, I think it happened yesterday or Friday.

209
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,740
 Yeah, it happened Friday.

210
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,140
 There was shooting in the Kenwood High School neighborhood

211
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,500
 in Hyde Park.

212
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
 You heard about it?

213
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,540
 Because you are numb.

214
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,380
 Because you are numb,

215
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:31,580
 because there's so many different shootings, right?

216
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,420
 You just don't care.

217
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,260
 I don't care.

218
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,540
 It's not special anymore.

219
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:38,100
 And in fact, Friday, there was a shooting

220
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:43,100
 near Hyde Park, Kenwood Academy in Hyde Park.

221
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,660
 And I talked to some of the parents,

222
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,540
 who's children are students of Kenwood.

223
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:54,540
 And they told me there was a soft lockdown in Kenwood.

224
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:59,180
 Kind of scary, right?

225
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,260
 It's the beginning weeks of the school year.

226
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:04,220
 And already it's happening, right?

227
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,340
 But you talk to some of the foreigners,

228
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:09,220
 some of the people who've never been to Chicago,

229
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,460
 and then you try to correct their preconception, right?

230
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,460
 You try to correct them.

231
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,940
 And I don't come from,

232
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:21,420
 there were not bullets flying 24/7 here, right?

233
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,860
 You try to tell them, you know,

234
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,060
 I'm from Chicago, I'm normal.

235
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,820
 My street, my neighborhood is actually pretty safe, right?

236
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:30,500
 I live in McKinney Park,

237
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,180
 which is right next to Bridgeport, where we're at now.

238
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,540
 I try to correct them, you know, it's not what you think.

239
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,700
 Now, why did they think the way they do?

240
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,980
 Because of the media, right?

241
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,660
 Because of the media.

242
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,740
 Now, you turn on your TV news,

243
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,540
 you turn on any news channel,

244
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,260
 you always get the sensational stories, right?

245
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:55,260
 Because what is newsworthy

246
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,540
 is always the dangerous stuff, right?

247
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,740
 The exciting stuff, the sensational stuff.

248
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,980
 You don't get any news from me, right?

249
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,860
 Am I newsworthy?

250
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,540
 No, I'm not, right?

251
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,540
 I'm just a normal guy, ordinary, just like you, right?

252
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,340
 I don't read your story on, you know, CNN

253
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,980
 and all the major news channels.

254
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:22,540
 All we got from the news channel is always a,

255
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:26,980
 well, one of the perspectives, right?

256
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,220
 One of the blind spots.

257
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,300
 What is newsworthy is often sensational.

258
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:37,620
 That's why when they hear about Chicago,

259
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,140
 they always think of the gangsters,

260
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,420
 the shootings, right, the killing,

261
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,100
 and all that stuff.

262
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,860
 So I try to correct that.

263
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:50,780
 And I go to the land of Israel for the past two weeks,

264
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,420
 and we had that kind of reorientation too.

265
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,940
 Now, of course, I've been there for many, many times,

266
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,460
 and I don't need that.

267
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:01,100
 But once we arrive, once we arrive,

268
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:05,940
 all of the Team Israel people,

269
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:09,340
 they tell me, "Wow, this is Israel?

270
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,420
 "Is that right?"

271
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,060
 I said, "Yeah, you are in Israel.

272
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,380
 "Check your GPS.

273
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,380
 "You are in Israel."

274
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,500
 (audience laughing)

275
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:19,180
 "You are not in Sahara Desert.

276
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:23,380
 "You are not in some, you know, no man's land.

277
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,780
 "It's actually pretty urbanized, right?"

278
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,180
 I keep telling them, actually,

279
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,740
 Israel is a mini United States, right?

280
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:35,740
 So we land Israel on Monday, two Mondays ago,

281
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,980
 after 13 hours of flight.

282
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,940
 So we land in the Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv,

283
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:47,580
 or near Tel Aviv, and then we check out our rental cars.

284
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,460
 So I drive one car and the other guy, Ronald,

285
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,620
 drive another car.

286
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,460
 So we head out to the north side of Israel, to Galilee,

287
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,700
 right?

288
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,660
 It's a beautiful place.

289
00:13:58,660 --> 00:13:59,780
 It's a beautiful place.

290
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:04,780
 It's the freshwater lake,

291
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,900
 the Sea of Galilee, Lake of Galilee,

292
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:11,900
 is a freshwater lake at the lowest point on planet Earth.

293
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,060
 It's a beautiful place, right?

294
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,340
 Besides the heat wave, right?

295
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:18,500
 It's a beautiful place.

296
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:23,500
 And they took a lot of pictures.

297
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,260
 They have fun.

298
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,380
 And then we check into our Airbnb.

299
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:33,820
 We stayed there for less than a week, four to five days.

300
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:37,900
 And then we drove all the way down to the middle

301
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:40,220
 of the country, which is Jerusalem.

302
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,820
 Now, once we arrived in Jerusalem, it was a Thursday.

303
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,780
 It was a Thursday.

304
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:51,100
 Thursday night, we arrived and checked into our second Airbnb

305
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,540
 and then we settled in.

306
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,980
 And then after an hour, I told the team,

307
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,980
 "Hey, let's meet on ground floor.

308
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:01,180
 Because we have two different Airbnbs."

309
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:05,300
 I said, "After an hour or so, you settle down

310
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,660
 and we're gonna meet on the ground level

311
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:09,820
 and then we're gonna walk the street, okay?"

312
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:11,380
 'Cause we checked in the Airbnb,

313
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:14,700
 and which is located right at the heart of the city,

314
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,900
 which is Ben Yehuda Street.

315
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,740
 Ben Yehuda Street.

316
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:21,340
 If you Google that, you'll find out Ben Yehuda Street

317
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:24,580
 is one of the busiest streets in the city of Jerusalem,

318
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:27,780
 in the new part of the city of Jerusalem, not the old city.

319
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,780
 Anyways, it's very close to the old city.

320
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,180
 So we went to the ground level and I said,

321
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:37,140
 "Hey, it's about time to go for dinner."

322
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,180
 Right?

323
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,620
 So they walked the street

324
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:43,540
 and there's light rail and all that.

325
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:48,420
 And then shops and restaurants are all open.

326
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:52,180
 And Thursday, I mentioned Thursday, we arrived

327
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,460
 because Thursday, Thursday evening,

328
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,860
 is the busiest day of the week.

329
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,460
 Busiest day of the week.

330
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,300
 Why?

331
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,180
 Because Friday is the Shabbat.

332
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:05,300
 So it's the day before Shabbat, right?

333
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,700
 It's like our Friday night.

334
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,500
 It's like our Friday night.

335
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,620
 So their Thursday night is a very busy night.

336
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,620
 And everyone is, you know,

337
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,820
 all the restaurants have tables and chairs out there

338
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,300
 on the sidewalk.

339
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:24,180
 Good food, you know, good drinks,

340
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,340
 and people are chatting and having a good time.

341
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:30,580
 And one of the team member told me,

342
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,660
 "This feels like Europe."

343
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,700
 "This feels like..."

344
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,460
 Is that right?

345
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,940
 Europe is like that, right?

346
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:41,900
 You just chill out in the evening, nice and cool.

347
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:44,220
 I said, "Yeah, exactly."

348
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,100
 Right?

349
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,100
 And then we went to the Western Wall, the Wailing Wall,

350
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,580
 and to check out, you know, all the activities there.

351
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,540
 And it was crazy, so busy.

352
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:56,580
 Because some of the Jews,

353
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:59,060
 especially the religious observant Jews,

354
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,140
 they would go to the Western Wall almost every day

355
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,140
 to pray and to read scripture.

356
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,620
 So we had a good time.

357
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,860
 We went to different site,

358
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:13,860
 and to so-called retrace the steps of Jesus,

359
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,900
 the steps of the Old Testament stories

360
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,140
 or New Testament stories.

361
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:25,260
 Every place that we go is a storied place,

362
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,220
 storied place.

363
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,980
 It means place full of stories,

364
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,220
 place full of traditions, histories, and legends.

365
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,420
 Almost every site.

366
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,140
 You know, I used to study in Israel for quite a bit,

367
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:43,820
 and I stay in the Old City.

368
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,860
 So I go out to the Old City almost every day,

369
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:52,380
 just to walk and to get grocery or stuff like that.

370
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:57,340
 Every stone has a story.

371
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:01,420
 Every corner of the street has a story.

372
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,500
 Has a story that goes back to thousands of years ago,

373
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,700
 go back to the Old Testament time.

374
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:12,700
 And you can relate to what has happened in the past

375
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:18,300
 to what is relevant to all of us today.

376
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:21,860
 And today, I would like to share one of the stories

377
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:24,300
 or one of the sites that I went to,

378
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,020
 which is one of the highlights, all right?

379
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,620
 Now let me read the scripture first.

380
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:30,780
 2 Kings 20, 20.

381
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:33,340
 20, 20, 2 Kings.

382
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:39,140
 Now, this is the conclusion of the reign of King Hezekiah,

383
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,700
 one of the Old Testament kings,

384
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:46,700
 one of the kings reigning in the southern country of Judah,

385
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,860
 right around Jerusalem.

386
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,300
 So this is the conclusion, the concluding note.

387
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,860
 So after chapters of information,

388
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,900
 history about the reign of Hezekiah,

389
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,780
 the writer of the Bible says,

390
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:06,380
 as for other events of Hezekiah's reign,

391
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:11,260
 all his achievements and how he made the pool,

392
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,140
 the water, the water pool,

393
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:15,700
 and the tunnel, the water tunnel,

394
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,980
 by which he brought water into the city,

395
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,940
 are they not written in the book of Kings of Judah?

396
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:26,540
 Now, the last question that he asked

397
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,980
 was a rhetorical question.

398
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:31,500
 But what I mean by rhetorical question

399
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,500
 is that the answer is expected, of course, right?

400
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,500
 There were other events,

401
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:40,420
 many other events and achievements of King Hezekiah.

402
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,340
 Are they not written in the book of Kings of Judah?

403
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,540
 The archive, the government files,

404
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,780
 you know, the, you know, how many gigabytes,

405
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:52,740
 you know, in today's term, are all stored

406
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,940
 in the government archive of the day.

407
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:59,540
 And that archive is called the archive of Kings of Judah.

408
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,660
 Right?

409
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,980
 So there are many other things

410
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:04,300
 that the biblical author can talk about,

411
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,940
 about King of, about King Hezekiah.

412
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:09,140
 And he said, I can talk so much,

413
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,540
 but they are all written in the government archive.

414
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,780
 And I didn't talk about it, right?

415
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,940
 So in the previous chapters,

416
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,940
 he talked about what King Hezekiah has done in his reign.

417
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:22,620
 Some of the highlights in the history

418
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,660
 of the reign of Hezekiah.

419
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,820
 Now, Hezekiah is a good king.

420
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,300
 He's a good king.

421
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,140
 Now, why do I have to mention the good king?

422
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:35,700
 Because in the book of Kings, as you can remember,

423
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,300
 there were many, many kings that we quoted.

424
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:42,380
 Northern country, Israel, the southern country, Judah.

425
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,580
 The book of Kings is all about the history

426
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:50,420
 of the royal people, the kings and the queens

427
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,140
 and the elites of the country.

428
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:58,540
 Most of the kings are bad kings.

429
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,180
 If you talk about the northern king,

430
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:05,740
 the kings of Israel, the northern country,

431
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,420
 none of them is good.

432
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,500
 None of them is good.

433
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:14,300
 Everyone has gone astray from the faith

434
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:18,100
 and let the whole nation to worship the false god, Baal,

435
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,100
 worship the false gods.

436
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,740
 None of them is good in the northern country.

437
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,500
 That's why they went into exile.

438
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,580
 And then he continued to talk about the southern kings,

439
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:34,820
 the kings of Judah.

440
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:37,060
 There are many of them because the history is,

441
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:40,580
 of course, is longer than the northern country.

442
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,340
 The southern country, Judah, also has many kings,

443
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:48,420
 but many of them are bad kings, all right?

444
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,980
 And here and there, there are some good kings.

445
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,340
 Hezekiah is one of them.

446
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:57,020
 Hezekiah is one of them.

447
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,900
 Now, how do you define a good king, right?

448
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,460
 Now, I told you the bad kings,

449
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:04,860
 all they did was to worship the false god

450
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,820
 and lead the people to worship the false god,

451
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:11,820
 to leave the faith, the true faith of Yahweh.

452
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:17,860
 The good kings will turn around,

453
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,820
 turn around the whole nation

454
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,820
 and have the whole nation worship Yahweh, the true God,

455
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:28,100
 the one and only God, the creator God, the covenant God.

456
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:30,980
 So Hezekiah is one of them.

457
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:35,980
 And in fact, in the early reign of King Hezekiah,

458
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:38,300
 he exercised and implement

459
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:43,140
 some of the all nationwide religious reform.

460
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:46,460
 So he broke down all the false god shrines

461
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,620
 and false gods temples,

462
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,980
 some of the orders, rightful orders,

463
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:55,980
 he broke them all down.

464
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,420
 So he got all, you know,

465
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:05,100
 all encompassing policy implement in his reign.

466
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,100
 In the early time of his reign.

467
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:10,340
 So that was King Hezekiah.

468
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,180
 So there are many things the biblical author

469
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:13,660
 talks about this good king.

470
00:23:13,660 --> 00:23:18,940
 But one of the biggest crisis

471
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,100
 that Hezekiah faced when he became king

472
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:27,100
 was the incoming invasion of Assyrian empire.

473
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:35,580
 Now, back then, one of the superpowers in the whole earth

474
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,740
 is the Assyrian empire.

475
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,860
 Now, if you learn a little bit about Assyrian empire,

476
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:44,020
 you have never heard of, you know,

477
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:49,020
 some of the cruelest or the most militarized nation

478
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:52,020
 on earth, Assyrian empire.

479
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,660
 They go to different places to conquer different people

480
00:23:56,660 --> 00:24:01,260
 and to do some of the most evil things,

481
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,860
 you know, to oppress the conquered people

482
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:09,860
 and to destroy the cities and all the towns.

483
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,780
 And the Assyrian empire was growing

484
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,700
 in the time of Hezekiah.

485
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:18,460
 So one of the major crisis Hezekiah had

486
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:23,220
 was the growing Assyrian empire

487
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,820
 that would threaten the security

488
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,180
 of his small nation Judah.

489
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:33,380
 So he did many things, Hezekiah,

490
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:36,500
 in order to defend his country, all right?

491
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,420
 Now, facing, you know, a Goliath, right,

492
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:43,540
 Assyrian empire coming at your footstep,

493
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,180
 you know, you gotta do a lot

494
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,860
 because you're a small nation, right?

495
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,380
 You got to spend a lot of time and a lot of effort

496
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,780
 in your military defense, right?

497
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:56,620
 Jerusalem is a very small place.

498
00:24:56,620 --> 00:25:01,900
 Jerusalem is also not a land of,

499
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:05,420
 that has a lot of resources.

500
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:08,100
 So he did a lot of things, Hezekiah,

501
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,300
 in order to defend his country.

502
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,220
 And one of the things that we can retrace his steps

503
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,380
 is the Hezekiah tunnels.

504
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:20,100
 It is a almost 2000 feet long tunnel

505
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,020
 that brings water from the water source,

506
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,340
 the only water source in the city of Jerusalem,

507
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,020
 Gihon Spring, all the way,

508
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:31,300
 dug this tunnel 2000 feet underground

509
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,580
 into the mountain,

510
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:36,660
 all the way, bringing water from the Gihon Spring

511
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,620
 to the heart of the city, inside the city.

512
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,020
 You know, in the old days,

513
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:45,460
 usually the water source or the spring of the city

514
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,460
 is located outside or at the foothill of the town, right?

515
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,180
 The town, when we build a town in the ancient time,

516
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,420
 we want to build a town on top of the mountain

517
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,060
 for defense, right?

518
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,980
 But you know, there's always pros and cons.

519
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,540
 You build high, you don't get water, right?

520
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,220
 Where's the water?

521
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:09,100
 The water's coming from the underground water table, right?

522
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,900
 Have you ever dug well?

523
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,980
 Have you ever dug well?

524
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,500
 You dug deep, right?

525
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,660
 You dug deep into the ground.

526
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:18,500
 Why?

527
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,460
 Because the water table is underground, right?

528
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:25,540
 So you have to dug like 50 feet down, 20 feet down,

529
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:28,820
 in order to reach the water table in the limestone.

530
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,780
 Same case in Jerusalem.

531
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,460
 The water table is down there.

532
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:38,460
 So imagine, you know, you got a hill, right, or a ridge.

533
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,100
 City of Jerusalem, the city of David,

534
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:42,540
 is on top of the hill,

535
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:46,140
 and the water source is the Gihon Spring.

536
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,460
 It's right at the foothill.

537
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:54,180
 Now, how do you solve the problem of military defense, right?

538
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,620
 When the Assyrian Empire,

539
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:00,620
 when the Assyrian soldiers come to attack the city,

540
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:04,580
 they will surround the city, right?

541
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:09,580
 And they will tap into your water resource

542
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,180
 and won't let you use the water, right?

543
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:17,660
 So in the normal day, when there is no military attack,

544
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,300
 you can go out of the city wall, out of the city gate,

545
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:23,460
 and you go all the way down to the foothill,

546
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,900
 and then you have a bucket,

547
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:31,660
 and then you fetch water from the well, or from the spring,

548
00:27:31,660 --> 00:27:33,420
 and then you go back uphill, right?

549
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:38,060
 Now imagine, day by day, you have to do that, right?

550
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:41,380
 In the morning, because you gotta make coffee,

551
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:43,260
 so you gotta have some water, right?

552
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:46,620
 So early in the morning, usually the women do the job,

553
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,500
 all right, the men stay back on the lazy boy,

554
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,900
 and wait for the women to bring water to home.

555
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:58,820
 So in the morning, and probably in the evening,

556
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:02,100
 you know, the women are very busy going out of the city gate,

557
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,300
 out, you know, from the mountain top,

558
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,500
 go to the foothill to fetch water back home.

559
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,380
 In the normal day, you can do that, that's fine.

560
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,900
 But in order to prepare for the ongoing,

561
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:18,140
 or the upcoming Syrian attack,

562
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:21,860
 Hezekiah dug this tunnel, 2,000 feet long, is that long?

563
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:25,260
 Pretty long, right?

564
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,740
 All by human hands, can you imagine?

565
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,980
 All by human hands.

566
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,380
 And today, we can go to the Hezekiah tunnel,

567
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,700
 and I tell you, this is the highlight of the whole trip.

568
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,780
 Everyone thinks so, everyone thinks so.

569
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,540
 Unless you are claustrophobic, kind of,

570
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,100
 you know, you can't go in.

571
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,500
 We have a couple of members who cannot go in,

572
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,780
 so they decide not to go, which is good, which is good.

573
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,220
 If you get panicked in the tunnel,

574
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,940
 there's no way I can rescue you, right?

575
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,900
 There's no phone signal, there's no Wi-Fi in the tunnel,

576
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:03,220
 so you have to walk through the tunnel one way,

577
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:05,220
 you know, from the Gihon Spring.

578
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,540
 You walk in with your flashlight, right?

579
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,300
 You gotta bring your flashlight,

580
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,140
 and then the size of the tunnel,

581
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:17,140
 remember, I'm five nine, I have to duck most of the time.

582
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,620
 I have to duck.

583
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,180
 If you're really short, that's fine.

584
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:23,340
 I have to duck most of the time.

585
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,540
 And you have to walk through the tunnel

586
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:28,900
 from the starting point to the end point, 2,000 feet.

587
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:29,980
 How long does it take?

588
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,540
 In the water, you wait in the water.

589
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:36,340
 There's fresh water coming out of the Gihon Spring.

590
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,700
 It still works, the spring is still working today.

591
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,660
 You know, it's just amazing.

592
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:44,220
 For 3,000 years, it's fresh water

593
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,620
 coming out of the Gihon Spring.

594
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,700
 So we walk in the dark with a flashlight

595
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:54,180
 for almost 45 minutes, sometimes an hour,

596
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:58,500
 and sometimes longer because I stop,

597
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,580
 and I explain to the team right inside the tunnel.

598
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,100
 And think about it.

599
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:10,100
 You know, this Heisekai Tunnel was the greatest

600
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:17,580
 water engineering project in his day, in the entire world.

601
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:22,140
 You don't find anything like this

602
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,900
 in other parts of the country,

603
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:26,260
 or in other parts of the planet Earth.

604
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:31,260
 It's the greatest, smart, and genius idea.

605
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:35,140
 They have two teams dugging together,

606
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:39,020
 you know, trying to join each other inside the mountain.

607
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,820
 2,700 years ago.

608
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,540
 By what?

609
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:43,420
 By sound.

610
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:45,500
 When they dug in the limestone,

611
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,940
 that you can hear the other team, what they're doing,

612
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,140
 and are we coming closer?

613
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,260
 That's why the tunnel is not straight.

614
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,620
 It's going like S-shaped, you know,

615
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:57,140
 zigzag into the mountain.

616
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,420
 It's one of the greatest water projects

617
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:03,620
 in the world at Heisekai's time.

618
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:07,780
 So Heisekai did that in order to defend the city.

619
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:10,860
 Now back to the scripture.

620
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:15,220
 Did the scripture talk about it?

621
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,980
 Yes, it does.

622
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,700
 But right at the end, it's only one phrase.

623
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:23,460
 All the other events of Heisekai's reign,

624
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:26,740
 all his achievements, and he mentioned this.

625
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:30,860
 He made a water pool, and a water tunnel,

626
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,020
 and he brought water into the city from the Gihon Spring.

627
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,980
 Outside of the city, into the city,

628
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:38,580
 in order to prepare for the Assyrian siege.

629
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:45,420
 Now, for such a great water engineering project,

630
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:51,260
 it's very interesting, the Bible only has one statement.

631
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,020
 All the stories of Heisekai, recorded in the Bible,

632
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,180
 are not about his human effort.

633
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,740
 Because if you read the story,

634
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:07,740
 you understand eventually the Assyrians came

635
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,020
 and besieged the city.

636
00:32:09,020 --> 00:32:15,980
 And almost Jerusalem fell because of the Assyrians.

637
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:20,620
 But you read the record of King Heisekai,

638
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:27,220
 at the day of distress, he went to the temple.

639
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:32,100
 He went to the temple of Jerusalem to pray.

640
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,180
 To pray for deliverance.

641
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:39,460
 To pray that God would help him and to deliver him.

642
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,180
 Now what a contrast.

643
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:46,500
 Because tons of money and tons of effort

644
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,580
 go into ducking the water tunnel.

645
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:53,020
 Right, the greatest water project ever in his day.

646
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:57,860
 But even that system, even that water project

647
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,780
 did not save him, did not save his nation.

648
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:07,020
 And Heisekai's story is all about the salvation of God.

649
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,740
 Only God can save.

650
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,420
 Humans cannot save.

651
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,980
 Have you ever thought about it?

652
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,660
 Like the days of Heisekai, he spent tons of effort

653
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:24,660
 in order to defend himself, to prepare for coming crisis.

654
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:28,940
 We do that too, right?

655
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,740
 How much time have we invest, think about it.

656
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:36,860
 How much time have we invest into our 401k,

657
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:40,060
 into our pension, in thinking about our future?

658
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:43,740
 Thinking about how we prepare for, I don't know,

659
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:48,740
 retirement or days of distress, right?

660
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:53,820
 How to prepare for any crisis that we can think of.

661
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:58,100
 The medical insurance in the United States,

662
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,300
 it's such a mess, right?

663
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,980
 But we have to spend so much energy, so much worries

664
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:07,340
 in order to prepare for that, right?

665
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:09,860
 Human efforts.

666
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,460
 The story of Heisekai, the biblical record,

667
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:19,260
 give us another perspective.

668
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,900
 Yes, you should prepare.

669
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,620
 Yes, you should do all that you can

670
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:29,180
 in order to defend yourself.

671
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:32,300
 But ultimately, you should not forget,

672
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:37,140
 it is Yahweh who saves, it is Jesus who saves.

673
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,060
 I'll tell you the story and then I'm gonna end.

674
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,260
 Years ago, I was in Vancouver.

675
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:47,060
 I was a young pastor.

676
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:49,900
 And you know, sometimes we do a pastoral visit

677
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,060
 to different families and different people.

678
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:57,420
 I remember it was in the late '90s.

679
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,620
 And I was in Vancouver, and there were many rich people

680
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,460
 in Vancouver.

681
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:05,340
 Oh, they're so rich.

682
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:09,020
 You know, in fact, I was a young pastor

683
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,180
 and I was taking care of a youth group.

684
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:16,180
 And one of my students, he lives alone in a big mansion.

685
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:20,500
 It's bought by parents from Hong Kong,

686
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,660
 but they don't stay there.

687
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,340
 Only the kids stay there, right?

688
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:26,260
 17-year-old, 18-year-old, crazy.

689
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,100
 I went to his house.

690
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,500
 I really like to go to his house

691
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,780
 because you walk into his mansion,

692
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:36,140
 the huge living space is occupied by a snooker table.

693
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:39,820
 You know the billiard?

694
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,180
 The snooker table?

695
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,380
 You know the pool table?

696
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:47,220
 Pool that you have a stick and then you poke the ball.

697
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,300
 You know that table?

698
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:51,140
 But the huge size ones, right?

699
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,380
 The huge size.

700
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,500
 So we go to his house and we play snooker, right?

701
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,700
 We play billiard.

702
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,300
 It's just that rich, right?

703
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:02,980
 I remember one time I was arranged to go

704
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,900
 to one of the other businessmen.

705
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:08,380
 Went to visit him.

706
00:36:08,380 --> 00:36:13,380
 And we went to his house and talked to him about gospel

707
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:17,580
 to share with him what Jesus has done for us.

708
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,380
 You know how he look at me?

709
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,180
 I still remember how he respond to me

710
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,580
 because he's richer than me.

711
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:28,420
 He's probably, I guess he's more good looking than I am.

712
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:31,540
 He's successful.

713
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,940
 He got the family.

714
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,900
 He got all, everything intact, right?

715
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,940
 I mean, he said, "I have nothing to worry about.

716
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:42,140
 "Don't talk to me about death and stuff."

717
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,980
 Right?

718
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,540
 What Jesus has done for, to him, Jesus is a poor man.

719
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,380
 Right?

720
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:52,780
 To him, the gospel is, what, it sucks, right?

721
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,820
 It sucks.

722
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,940
 Because compared to him, he has the best of the world.

723
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,140
 Right?

724
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,780
 So I talked to him and kind of being looked down

725
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,380
 and kind of being, you know, he didn't yell at me

726
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:09,380
 but I can tell he's pretty, the despising tone and look.

727
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,540
 And I left, right?

728
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,380
 I left.

729
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:18,340
 And that was one of the worst moment in my ministry.

730
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:21,380
 You know, I have doubt, what am I doing here?

731
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:23,940
 (laughing)

732
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,980
 Some years later, some years later,

733
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:31,180
 you know, one of his family members called us and said,

734
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:34,060
 "Hey, can you visit my dad?"

735
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,260
 Which is that guy, the businessman.

736
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:40,940
 About three or four years later, I visited him again.

737
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:45,500
 He had cancer, last stage.

738
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,260
 We remembered the contrast.

739
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:53,860
 We remember the contrast, his tone and his look.

740
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:59,160
 Before, he was successful and despising.

741
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:04,580
 Two or three years later, because he had been diagnosed

742
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,740
 with last stage of cancer, liver cancer,

743
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,260
 his tone totally changed.

744
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,020
 His perspective totally changed.

745
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:17,020
 At that point, we explained to him the gospel.

746
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:20,620
 We explained to him what Jesus has done for us.

747
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:24,580
 We explained to him the hope that we have,

748
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,580
 beyond death, right?

749
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:30,740
 As you can tell, when crisis hit,

750
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:35,200
 you cannot be proud anymore, right?

751
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,380
 You cannot be prideful of your achievement,

752
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:42,280
 of your human effort, because someday we're gonna fade away.

753
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,460
 All we can do, the best we can do right now,

754
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,340
 is to delay our response.

755
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,020
 Don't think about it, right?

756
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:52,940
 Well, we don't have to think about it.

757
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,700
 Have you ever thought about tomorrow

758
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,660
 you're gonna be diagnosed with cancer?

759
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:58,620
 You won't, right?

760
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:02,780
 All you care about is, okay, today, tonight,

761
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,380
 we're gonna have a big feast, right?

762
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,460
 Yeah, we're gonna eat, and then we're gonna sleep well,

763
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,380
 and tomorrow we go to work, right?

764
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,780
 All we need to think about is this, right?

765
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:15,140
 To delay our response to the most important things

766
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:16,780
 in our lives.

767
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,260
 Do we have hope beyond death?

768
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:23,180
 Jesus saves, and only Jesus saves.

769
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,300
 That is what the story of Hezekiah is all about.

770
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,180
 You can spend all your budget in your military defense,

771
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:37,020
 in your health insurance, in your achievement.

772
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,900
 You can plan your education, you can plan everything, right?

773
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,440
 But only Yahweh saves.

774
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,240
 Don't forget about that.

775
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:50,300
 The salvation of Jesus Christ is so great of a salvation

776
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:53,180
 that we can have life beyond death,

777
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,540
 and this is eternal life.

778
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,820
 Right?

779
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,580
 Yes, we need to prepare, we need to go to work,

780
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,380
 but don't forget, we need to worship.

781
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,660
 We need to worship God and follow Him.

782
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,420
 We need to give thanks, right?

783
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,780
 We need to do the will of God, because we belong to Him,

784
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,740
 and we know only Jesus saves.

785
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:15,700
 All right, we're gonna end here,

786
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,740
 and we're gonna pray together.

787
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:20,580
 May this be a reminder to all of us

788
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,220
 how great a salvation that we have in Jesus.

789
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,060
 Let us all pray.

790
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:29,380
 Father God, we give you thanks for saving us,

791
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,380
 for redeeming us.

792
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:35,020
 Yes, all the human achievement that we can do,

793
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:40,460
 yes, we need to be responsible with our lives.

794
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,020
 We need to plan, we need to arrange,

795
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:47,020
 we need to implement our responsibilities,

796
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,020
 but ultimately, let us not forget that only you save.

797
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,860
 And thank you for your great love.

798
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,620
 Thank you for your grace.

799
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,060
 And be reminded that we are your people.

800
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:02,980
 Be reminded, we need to praise you.

801
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:06,740
 We need to give thanks to you, to follow you.

802
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:10,460
 Thank you for being our leader.

803
00:41:10,460 --> 00:41:12,940
 Thank you for being our Lord.

804
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,380
 And lead our life in the coming week.

805
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:20,380
 And let us not be forgetful that we can stand in your grace

806
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:25,420
 to relate to you in our family, in our campuses,

807
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,980
 in our work, we're gonna glorify you.

808
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:31,340
 In Christ's name, we pray.

809
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,500
 Well, thank you very much, and I wanna see you next week,

810
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:36,380
 and let's worship together.

811
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:38,420
 Let's worship God and serve him together.

812
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,380
 God bless you.
