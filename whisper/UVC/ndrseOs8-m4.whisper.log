[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.480]   acceptable in your sight in Christ and pray. Well if you have your Bible or Bible app
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.880]   please turn to the first very first book of the Bible the book of Genesis we're
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:17.400]   going to continue our Apostles Creek series and we come to the third section
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.920]   of the Apostles Creek I believe in the Holy Spirit. Now the first first
[00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.240]   occurrence or first appearance of this spirit can be found in the first book of
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:36.480]   the Bible the book of Genesis. Are you ready? Genesis 1. In the beginning not in
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.240]   the PowerPoint but in your Bible. In the beginning God created the heavens and
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.680]   the earth now the earth was formless and empty darkness was over the surface of
[00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:56.520]   the deep and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters. The Spirit of
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:02.400]   God is hovering over the water. That's the first encounter of the Holy Spirit. I
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:08.040]   think correctly translated to should be the Spirit of God instead of the wind of
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:16.440]   God. Hebrew sounds pretty interesting because the pronunciation
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.240]   gives you the meaning of the word sometimes. So in Hebrew spirit you have
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.520]   to repeat after me okay even you have your mask on even better if you have your mask on.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:37.360]   Spirit in Hebrew is "Ruach". Yeah exactly yeah exactly that is the Spirit that's the
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.040]   wind of God the life force of God. He was the first created agent of the entire
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.240]   universe. Last Tuesday there was a big news around the world. Have you ever
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:59.320]   heard of it? The James Webb Space Telescope sent back the first set of
[00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:05.840]   images from the deep space. You know how the story goes right in I think the end
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:14.200]   of 2021 NASA launched the James Webb Telescope into deep deep space and then
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:21.640]   travel for you know some time and then last Tuesday beaming back the first set
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:31.360]   of image and what we see in the images are lights probably the very first light
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:40.640]   since Big Bang. Those lights the James Webb Telescope captures probably
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:48.960]   travel already traveled 13 point some billion years to reach the telescope the
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.240]   camera so it was very very amazing it's just mind-blowing to think about how big
[00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:02.920]   the universe is. Hundred years ago we thought there was only one galaxy in the
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.360]   cosmos now we know there were so many so many so many others galaxies unnamed
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:19.920]   galaxies haven't seen before right this is how big and how vast the universe is
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.320]   and behind it is the Creator and behind it is the Spirit of God so we come to
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.360]   the third part the Holy Spirit so we have two two questions to tackle it
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.920]   says I believe in the Holy Spirit first question is who is the Holy Spirit
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.840]   second what does the Holy Spirit do in your life if you profess to be a
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:52.720]   question and you believe in God if you believe in Jesus the Holy Spirit is in
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:58.440]   you and it should be working in your life in your heart so first question is
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:05.320]   who is the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Trinity the
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.480]   third person of the Trinity now please understand the Bible is actually a
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:16.800]   library there were 66 books in this library the whole Bible is a huge
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.880]   library there are many different genres different types of literatures different
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:26.000]   stories and poetries and poem and genealogies and records of history and
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.520]   all that stuff all right so the Bible is actually a library from the first book
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:37.320]   Genesis to the last book that we have the book of Revelation in the New
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.880]   Testament all together there were so many different voices and as God
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:50.000]   unfolds his revelation to mankind to all of us it unfolds it progressively so in
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.800]   the Old Testament we don't know much about the Holy Spirit because it's not
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.040]   unfolded yet until we come to the New Testament and we see more clearly who
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:09.120]   Holy Spirit is all about and who he is now the clearest statement about the
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:16.000]   identity of Holy Spirit is found in John 14 as we read this passage I want you to
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.720]   answer this question how many persons how many persons are there in the
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:31.840]   passage right John 14 all right now now about the context okay what is what's
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.320]   going on here Jesus is speaking to his disciples it was the last Passover meal
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:44.800]   last dinner together the Jewish Passover before he goes to the cross and die on
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:52.320]   the cross for the sin of humankind and to give us the salvation right so before
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:59.400]   before the Good Friday he was speaking to the disciples around the table around
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.160]   the Passover table and he was about to leave and he was about to be crucified
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:13.600]   for our sins and will be arise again from the tomb and will be ascended to
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.680]   the Father reigning as the King of Kings so before all of this events Christ
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.400]   Jesus was speaking to his disciples teaching them what it means to follow
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.040]   him this is the last evening Jesus spent with disciples around table of Passover
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.200]   so preparing the disciples to continue his work once he left once he ascended
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.320]   to the Father and reign forever in heaven the work of mission has to be
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:47.240]   continued with his disciples his disciples need to pick up the baton and
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:56.000]   go on with what is left to be done about the mission of Jesus so 1415 here he
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.400]   says Jesus speaking to the disciples speaking to the church speaking to us if
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.840]   you love me you will keep my commandments and I will ask the Father
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:13.560]   and he will give you another helper to be with you forever even the spirit of
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:20.840]   truth whom the world cannot receive because it neither sees him nor knows
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:30.680]   him you know him for he dwells with you and will be in you now how many persons
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:40.280]   are there how many persons are there if you love me right speaking to the
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   disciples me being Jesus himself right and then the Father and he says I will
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:57.720]   send another helper and other assistant so to speak and other helper to be with
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:02.440]   you at least three persons are being spoken off here well right minus the
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:09.200]   disciples so the three personas three persons here now first of all I want to
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:18.480]   clarify love in the Bible is usually not a feeling love in the Bible usually is
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.880]   not a sentiment where our cultural script is teaching us love is all about
[00:08:23.880 --> 00:08:28.080]   you know how you feel about yourself how you feel about your lover or somebody
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:33.360]   else right it's always the emotional kind of you know feeling that is
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:41.000]   defining love right but love is not generally not a sentiment in the Bible
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:50.040]   and what is it the love in the biblical culture is the term love is often used
[00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:56.520]   between a great king and a smaller king when they make covenant together when
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:02.040]   they make treaty to treaties together or diplomatic relationship they enter into
[00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:05.800]   that relationship that agreement together and they sign some contracts
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.040]   right there were some terms in the covenant there's some terms in the
[00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:13.440]   international treaty and then you get a copy I get a copy you put your copy in
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.000]   the temple I put my copy in my temple and then the terms of the covenant
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:25.360]   often uses the term love that you have to love me and I have to love you now
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.400]   think about in political terms right if I'm the United States enter into some
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:34.440]   sort of international diplomatic relationship with another country right
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:41.440]   they're using the terms love right a king is loving another king and then a
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   king is loving back the other king you think love in this sort of relationship
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:54.240]   is about romantic feelings no right they never really fall in love with each
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:02.960]   other right but love means in this kind of context loyalty political alliance
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:10.040]   political allegiance it's kind of like when you when you sing national anthems
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:17.600]   right that's sort of you know sentiment it's a political allegiance so Jesus
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:22.920]   said if you love me doesn't mean oh I feel Jesus you know so warm and so
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:29.920]   comforting well of course that's one of the consequence right but mainly it's
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:39.080]   all about political alliance you are my ally and we're gonna work together you
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:45.320]   are my political partner and you got to pledge your allegiance to me and I'm
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.640]   faithful to you so if you love me you will keep my commandments and I will ask
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:56.880]   the Father he will give you an other helper to be with you forever now you
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:03.300]   notice there were at least three persons here and other helper speaking of the
[00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:09.400]   Spirit the Holy Spirit to be with you and the adjective describing the Spirit
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:16.320]   is Spirit of truth the biblical truth the gospel truth he will tells you he
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.760]   will tell you the truth of the gospel he will speak to you the truth of God
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:30.640]   whom the world cannot receive and he will remain with you and in you so here
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:38.120]   is one of the clearest statements about who the Holy Spirit is it's the third
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:43.600]   person of the Trinity with the Father and the Son and you all of a sudden you
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:51.320]   remember the song how great is our God Spirit comes second right right how does
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:59.200]   it go father spirit son right well you say that's not right right it should be
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:08.800]   father son spirit right shouldn't it what do you think did Chris Tomlin
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:14.080]   make a mistake no I think I think it's poetry right so
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:20.880]   spirit can come second in that song but in the Bible the unfolding revelation as
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:27.120]   the grand story unfolds we have the Father and the Son Jesus and then the
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:38.760]   Holy Spirit who came another clear statement is Matthew 28 Matthew 28 the
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   last word Jesus spoke to his disciples before he goes up into heaven in
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:49.960]   Ascension 28 18 Jesus came and said to the disciples all authority in heaven
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:54.920]   and on earth have been given to me go therefore and make disciples of all
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.600]   nations this is what the church should be doing all of us should be working
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:03.960]   together to bring people into a living relationship with Jesus who makes
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:09.080]   disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father the Son and
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.240]   the Holy Spirit in teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:20.480]   and behold I will be with you always to the end of the ages you see here name of
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:30.800]   the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit name is a singular or plural in Greek it
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:37.520]   should have been the names of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit here you
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:42.160]   know there's no textual variant or anything like that all the manuscripts
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:51.360]   are saying in the name singular of the Father Son and the Holy Spirit right so
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:58.040]   it's only one name but there are three persons being named the Father the Son
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:07.480]   and the Holy Spirit in the old days when you know people trying to try to
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:13.080]   understand what the Bible says they use special terms so one of the old terms
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:18.520]   going back to several hundred years ago they use the word God had you know God
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:27.440]   had God had doesn't mean God has a head God has the old theological term back in
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:32.560]   the days of John Wycliffe you heard about Wycliffe Bible Translation Society
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:37.920]   is still doing some translation work around the world so John Wycliffe was a
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.880]   guy in the 14th century several hundred years ago he came up with the term God
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:52.560]   had God had actually means theologically is the essence of God God himself the
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:59.120]   self of God God had and he was trying to use this term to try to capture what is
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:06.440]   going on here there is no grammatical errors in Greek however the statement
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:11.240]   there in the name singular of Father and Son the Holy Spirit is the theological
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:18.320]   statement speaking to us with just one God but there are three persons in that
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.960]   God had right not going back to Chris Tomlin song there's word God had right
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:29.520]   God have three in one do you realize that there was pretty strange to our
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:34.400]   contemporary language right we don't use God had anymore right we don't pray to
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.320]   the God had and and all the other stuff but you know you need to understand
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:44.800]   there's a theological background to it God had three in one so the name singular
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:52.520]   of the Father Son and Spirit so right here the concise statement of what the
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:16:01.080]   doctrine of Trinity is is this so you repeat after me the Father's God the Son
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:07.720]   is God the Spirit is God but the Father is not the Son the Son is not the Spirit
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:16.560]   and the Spirit is not the Father there's not three gods but one God but one God
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:23.680]   in three persons you got it all right let's do it together the Father's God
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:31.560]   the Son is God the Spirit is God and the Father is not the Son the Son is not the
[00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:39.200]   Spirit the Spirit is not the Father how many gods are there there's only one God
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:49.000]   however one God in three persons right one personal God and three different
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:55.240]   persons it's pretty hard to for us to understand because we're talking about
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:17:03.320]   the God had the self of God right God self is way beyond our rationality
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:11.880]   right it's not irrational it's trans-rational right it's beyond our
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:21.000]   intellect I think Augustine puts puts it pretty well he used a human analogy of
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.880]   love to explain the mystery of Trinity he's a thing about love right there are
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:37.200]   always at least three aspects of love the person who loves the person who is
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:46.080]   loved and love itself all right pretty interesting but no one is greater than
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:53.800]   another or the sum of the other two the lover the one being loved and the love
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:18:02.720]   itself right God is like a community right so he created us that's why we
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:10.360]   have community now who is the Holy Spirit is the third person of the
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:18.320]   Trinity now it comes to us what does he do what does it do in us now I think so
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.360]   often in our contemporary debate or a struggle with understanding who who the
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:29.280]   what the Spirit does sometimes we so bogged down into some sort of tunnel
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:37.360]   vision that the Spirit all he does or explicitly mainly what he does is to
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:44.400]   give us the gift some spiritual supernatural gift of speaking in tongues
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:49.080]   right have you ever heard of you know people who speak in tongues speaking in tongues
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:55.200]   being a sign who we do have okay all right that's cool someone pointing at
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:19:03.680]   you speaking in tongues meaning you know there was really such such such thing
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:09.440]   someone who is gifted to speak some of the languages maybe known language or
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:17.120]   unknown language back in the days when I was in seminary I had three roommates
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:23.080]   Korean roommates we are all in the same class same school I remember one of my
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:29.920]   friends he speaks tongue speaks in tongue he speaks in tongue every single
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:35.800]   morning when he does the devotion the quiet time so you know I know a little
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:40.880]   bit what Korean sounds like all right so definitely he was not speaking in
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:46.960]   Korean he was speaking in some non Korean language right not English right
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:54.320]   not Chinese not some other languages so so one day I'm not on the door and ask
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:20:00.720]   him what are you doing he said oh I'm having a communion with God right
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:05.440]   speaking in tongue speaking in some other mysterious language right some
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:12.000]   spiritual language now that could be one sign of the work of the Holy Spirit but
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   I think we are so truncated sometimes or we do all the works of the Holy Spirit
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:23.480]   into one thing right because it's so explicit so we center on it oh you have
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:26.600]   the Holy Spirit you have to speak in tongue I don't think that's that is
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:33.640]   really biblical teaching the work of the Holy Spirit is so embracing there were
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:40.880]   so many things we can experience the Holy Spirit in different ways and let's
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.760]   go back to the word about Holy Spirit when Jesus was speaking to his disciples
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.440]   he says I will send or the Father will give you and other helper
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:57.200]   procreators procreators it's being translated in many different ways helper
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:06.640]   counselor advisor strengthener encourager advocate or any other many
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:20.040]   different translation but what is clear is that the Spirit is he not it the
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:31.160]   Spirit is he as a person he speaks he relates and he must be obeyed he must be
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:37.320]   loved and we lay the back along with the Father and the Son now so often we think
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:45.920]   of the Word of God or the work of the Spirit we often think of it in some
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.480]   truncated way we always think that okay the Word of God is simply just you know
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:57.160]   sprinkling you know rose petals along the way and you know tells you every
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   single morning how great you are how wonderful you are and fearfully made you
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.040]   are and all that stuff and to comfort you and to be with you you know it's
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:10.960]   just repeating the same message message every every every single day now
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.040]   nothing wrong with that nothing wrong with that but you know if you think
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.520]   about it that's if that is what God does right if you reduce the work of God the
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:27.200]   work of Holy Spirit to just this tiny bit of praising you or uplifting you or
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:32.920]   building up yourself right you get numb after one or two days right have you
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.120]   ever relate to someone or your lover or your boyfriend or a girlfriend or your
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:44.480]   spouse every single morning we just praise you we just honor you and and
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.000]   tell you how good you are and how wonderful you are you know you get bored
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.800]   after a day or two right well give it a month or two you definitely get bored I
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:23:06.280]   think I think the Bible present to us the Holy Spirit God himself to be on the
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:16.520]   side of who you could become more than the side of who you are right now you
[00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:28.720]   want a God that is on the side of who you could become more so than who you
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:35.920]   are right now if you reduce what God does in your life simply frees you into
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:43.080]   what you are right now it will stunt your growth as a man or woman God
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.320]   doesn't want to do that the Spirit doesn't do that so we come down to what
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:55.760]   the Spirit really what what he really does in your life is to transform you to
[00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:03.960]   change you gradually sometimes radically to become who you could become not who
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:10.200]   you are right now so I want you to listen to the Spirit the Spirit is
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:16.120]   talking to us every single day we make in us every single day reminding us the
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:21.480]   biblical truth of the gospel reminding us the the word of the scriptures so
[00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:31.640]   that we can be growing into what we could become Ephesians 5 talking about
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:40.080]   this the work of the Spirit now listen carefully 515 look carefully how you
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:47.160]   walk not as unwise but as wise making the best use of time because the days
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:53.720]   are evil therefore do not be foolish but understand what the will of the Lord is
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:25:01.120]   do not get drunk with wine and beef but be filled with the Spirit talking to one
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:06.640]   another addressing to one another in Psalms in hymns in spiritual songs
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:11.360]   singing making melodies to the Lord with your heart giving thanks always and
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:17.360]   everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ what does the
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:28.680]   Spirit do it's an analogy between wine and the work of the Holy Spirit now we
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:37.160]   all get drunk at times right I mean we if you never maybe you will okay you
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:44.000]   know I'll get getting drunk is being under the heavy influence of alcohol of
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.840]   the wine you're not in control anymore or at least you are not primarily in
[00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:56.720]   control the alcohol is taking control over you that is getting drunk right how
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.960]   do you tell someone's getting drunk you know what is the biggest influence at
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:11.720]   that point for that person right is it wine or himself or herself the analogy
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:19.640]   is the work of the Holy Spirit is giving yielding to the control and influence of
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:26.440]   the Holy Spirit more and more in our lives when the Spirit reminds you
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:33.960]   something you yield to it you obey it that is getting drunk right getting
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:41.680]   influenced by the Spirit and that should be our Christian spiritual journey yes
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:48.240]   we've we walk and we stumble and we fall at times but you know in the long in a
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:53.840]   big scheme of things we should be giving more influence to the Spirit instead of
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:27:00.800]   our sinful self right have the Spirit has the Spirit talked to you recently I
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:06.400]   think the Spirit is very active reminding us right how to live a life
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:11.920]   that is pleasing to God how to live out the Christian character right more and
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:18.160]   more influence of the Holy Spirit on our lives and we walk walking with the
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:25.120]   Spirit right walking according to the will of the Spirit let me give you a
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:32.400]   note another analogy I was sitting here singing songs and and all that and I
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:41.560]   remember the first time I taught someone how to drive a stick shift how to drive
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:50.280]   a stick shift back in the more than 10 years ago I was in Israel and we got a
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:55.720]   rental car and most of the rental car back then was manual transmission so I
[00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:01.280]   was the only one who could drive it right so I was with my team members so
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:08.400]   we checked into a Airbnb hotel motel or whatever so we stayed there and then in
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.880]   the evening after sunset one of the one of the girls in my team everyone is is
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.720]   it everyone is a driver everyone has driver license everyone knows how to
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:27.440]   drive but only the automatic transmission right that sucks right so
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:33.000]   so the girl girl asked me hey you know what I want to learn how to drive a
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.440]   stick shift I said yeah sure because it's a rental car right you break it you
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:43.520]   know you can return it right so so I go out with her and some of the members and
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:50.480]   we just drive around in the parking lot first gear second gear first gear second
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.760]   gear and let's start the engine and start again start engine start again no
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:59.760]   over the entire process you know almost three hours I was circling in the
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:09.460]   parking lot so I'm gonna in parking lot and then uh you know the key for her to
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:20.080]   learn manual transmission what's the key it's to listen to me right just do
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:26.680]   exactly what I say right well there are times you know her no automatic
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:31.840]   transmission mind kicks in right she would drive the stick shift like an
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:36.920]   automatic transmission right I said no that's not right no you have to correct
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:42.880]   yourself right you can't think in a different way so in three hours I
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:50.320]   successfully I taught her how to drive a manual transmission - how wonderful I am
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:57.480]   right three hours right and then we came back from from Israel and then she
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:07.880]   actually brought a stick shift vehicle and she enjoys it right our relationship
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:15.240]   with the Holy Spirit it's pretty much the same listen to the Spirit teaching
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:23.440]   us correcting us guiding us changing us then our mindset will change our
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:31.400]   behavior will change our hands and our feet and our eyes coordination will
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:38.080]   change because the Spirit's voice is to condition us so that we can follow the
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:46.400]   goodwill of the Father so let's do that I have an ending prayer right here we're
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:51.600]   gonna end with this prayer together all right I want you to recite this prayer
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:58.400]   with me all right in your heart or verbally and let's do that then we'll
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:06.480]   close in prayer dear God fill us with all joy and peace as we believe in you

[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.000]   guiding our ways.
