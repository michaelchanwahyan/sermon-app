2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
 Hello, everyone! I'm Miss Rebecca. Welcome back to Family Sunday School.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 This time we're going to review what we talked about last time.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 Last time we talked about Last Supper.

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 And one of the points, one of the themes was "Jesus is the Bread of Life."

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
 Last time we talked about a lot of buns, right?

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
 Have you played the bun game?

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 Have you learned that there are many different cultures and people all over the world that need buns?

9
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:49,000
 I'll give you a book to read. It's a cover and there's a little bit of content in it.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 I'm using this book for my kids to read.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:59,000
 But you can also use other books in the library about buns or how to make buns.

12
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:07,000
 This book actually talks about a lot of different kinds of buns.

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:18,000
 If I give you a quick summary, you'll know how people need buns.

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 Why is the bun in Last Supper so important?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,000
 The symbolism of the bun is that it represents Jesus' body.

16
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 Jesus' body represents the bun.

17
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 Why?

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
 We need to look at Old Testament.

19
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:48,000
 In Old Testament, the God/Goddess was tied up by the Egyptians.

20
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 When they were slaves, they were God/Goddess.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
 They were taken out of Egypt.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 They were taken out of Egypt and they could leave Egypt.

23
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
 Leave slavery, flee Egypt.

24
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 They crossed the Red Sea. Moses crossed the Red Sea.

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
 God/Goddess walked across the Red Sea.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 They had to wait.

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
 Wait for when to make a promise.

28
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 What did they eat?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 God/Goddess said,

30
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 "It's better to be a slave. At least I have food. I'm starving."

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 God/Goddess heard them complain.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 If God/Goddess could bring you out of Egypt, what else couldn't God/Goddess do?

33
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 At that time, manna would fall from the sky.

34
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
 It's like a food bun falling from the sky.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 In Old Testament, we see that the bun, the manna,

36
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:59,000
 if you eat it, you will be full that day.

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 But it doesn't mean you won't die.

38
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,000
 Fast forward to the New Testament.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 The Savior has come.

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 Jesus is born.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:20,000
 If you eat the bun, you will live forever.

42
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 Very different, right?

43
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
 What kind of bun can live forever?

44
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 Pineapple bun? No.

45
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 Hamburger bun? No.

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 The rabbit bun? No.

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 The cow bun? No.

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 Only Jesus.

49
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 So why did Jesus tell the disciples,

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 "My body is like a bun.

51
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,000
 If you eat this bun, you will live forever."

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Because he knew the culture and the history of the bun.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,000
 He remembered to slowly connect with it.

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,000
 Okay, this is the bun.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 Next one.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
 The second point I mentioned last time is

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 Do you remember Judas left the group to betray Jesus?

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Remember? Jesus' family.

59
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
 I asked you last time,

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Why did Judas do that?

61
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 What will happen next?

62
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 Jesus knew.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Why did he do that?

64
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,000
 Why did he allow that?

65
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Remember?

66
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 This is the great saving plan.

67
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 God's great plan to save people.

68
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
 God's plan must be fulfilled.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 God said he would do it.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
 Jesus said it would happen.

71
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 It will happen.

72
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 But does it have to be so bad?

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 We will continue the story today.

74
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Answer a lot of different questions.

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 And refer to different points.

76
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 I will ask you questions too.

77
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
 But before we start, let's play a game.

78
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 Come with me.

79
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Hello, let's play a game.

80
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
 What am I?

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
 I will show you different photos.

82
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Ready?

83
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 Hmm, a wheel.

84
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Hmm, a screw.

85
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,000
 Hmm, what is this?

86
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Can you guess?

87
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 Let's start.

88
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
 Art rack.

89
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,000
 We need to dry our paintings in art class.

90
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 There are many art class teachers.

91
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 You can dry many paintings in this rack.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 You can open and close it.

93
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 Okay?

94
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
 Next one.

95
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
 What am I?

96
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 Focus.

97
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,000
 Hmm.

98
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,000
 Hmm.

99
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Can you guess?

100
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 Hmm, what is this?

101
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Hmm.

102
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 Hmm, what is this angle?

103
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 What angle is this?

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 Hmm.

105
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Can you guess?

106
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Hmm, a big circle.

107
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 What is this?

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 Let's start.

109
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 It's a stool.

110
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 Ha ha.

111
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Can you see?

112
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 This is the seat.

113
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 This is the angle.

114
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 This stool can be turned.

115
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
 This is the screw.

116
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 This is the plate.

117
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
 This is a foot.

118
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 Ha ha.

119
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 Okay, next one.

120
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 I guess you can guess.

121
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 Let's start.

122
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
 Hmm, what is this?

123
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 It looks old.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 Hmm.

125
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 This is the screw.

126
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 This is not the screw.

127
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 This is a nut.

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
 Hmm.

129
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 Hmm?

130
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 What is this?

131
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 What is the hint in this picture?

132
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
 This angle is a bit different.

133
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,000
 What is this?

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 Can you guess?

135
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Let's start.

136
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Maybe many children have not seen this.

137
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 Or adults, parents have seen it.

138
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
 Okay, let's start.

139
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
 Radiator.

140
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 It's a radiator.

141
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
 It's not a central air radiator.

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 There are many gadgets on the side.

143
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 This is the angle.

144
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 This is the coil.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
 This is the switch.

146
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 This is the big screw.

147
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Wow.

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 We have so many "What am I?"

149
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
 I want to remind you.

150
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 Hmm.

151
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 If you look at it from different angles,

152
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 you can't see the whole picture from every angle.

153
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 Right?

154
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 We think with this mentality.

155
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 We will talk about the Bible story.

156
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
 Perspective.

157
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
 Point of view.

158
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
 Angle.

159
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 Alright?

160
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,000
 Bible story time.

161
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
 Hi, it's story time.

162
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 Where did we leave off last time?

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:50,000
 Where did Jesus tell Judas,

164
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 "Do what you have to do."

165
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 What did Judas do?

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
 He betrayed Jesus.

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
 Telling others where Jesus is.

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
 Because many leaders don't want Jesus there.

169
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
 They want Jesus to leave.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But they can't find Jesus.

171
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 They are afraid.

172
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 Because the public loves Jesus.

173
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 They like him.

174
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 Because he did a lot of good things.

175
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 But they can't find out where he is.

176
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:21,000
 Only the people inside will know.

177
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Right?

178
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 In this video,

179
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:30,000
 Judas went to find Jesus.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 Jesus went outside.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 He called other leaders.

182
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 "The time is here."

183
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 "I will be caught."

184
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
 "You have to protect yourselves."

185
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 "Don't sleep."

186
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 "Pray to the Lord to help you."

187
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 "You can resist all the attacks."

188
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
 "All the temptations."

189
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 But they fell asleep.

190
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 Jesus started praying.

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
 He asked God,

192
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 "I know this plan must be fulfilled."

193
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 "But if it is possible, can we not do it?"

194
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 "But I know your will is my command."

195
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 "God, whatever you want."

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 He finished praying.

197
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 What happened next?

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:42,000
 Judas told the soldiers,

199
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,000
 "Hey, the one I love is Jesus."

200
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 Wow!

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 Let's see.

202
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 This is Judas.

203
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 The people next to him.

204
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 "I know this is Jesus."

205
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Not everyone has seen Jesus.

206
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,000
 Not everyone knows who to catch.

207
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
 Now he knows.

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 What happened next?

209
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,000
 Peter.

210
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
 Jesus said to Peter,

211
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 "Peter, you will deny me."

212
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,000
 "Pretend not to know."

213
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 "Deny."

214
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
 "You know me."

215
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 "You pretend not to know me."

216
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,000
 "Of course it's not me."

217
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
 "Never."

218
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 This is Peter.

219
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
 He picked up a sword.

220
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 Jesus said, "Protect yourselves."

221
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
 "Bring the swords."

222
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 "Because there will be an attack."

223
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,000
 Before, they went around with Jesus.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
 They talked to people.

225
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 They didn't need swords.

226
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Now they need them.

227
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
 Peter took out his sword.

228
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 What did he say?

229
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 He didn't say anything.

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:14,000
 He just cut open the soldier's ear.

231
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 First, was his aim good?

232
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Wow, he cut it open.

233
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 I don't think the soldier expected this.

234
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 But we know from Peter's perspective,

235
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 from his perspective,

236
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 he loves Jesus very much.

237
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
 He loves Jesus very much.

238
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 He is a good friend.

239
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
 He must defend Jesus.

240
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 No matter what, he will protect Jesus.

241
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 "Hiyah!"

242
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 What do you think of Jesus?

243
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:52,000
 What do you think of Jesus?

244
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,000
 "Put the sword down."

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 "Put the sword down, Peter."

246
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 The soldier's ear was cut off.

247
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
 Remember, he was bleeding.

248
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
 He was bleeding.

249
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
 Ouch, it hurts.

250
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 What does Jesus do?

251
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 He didn't take him to the hospital.

252
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
 He didn't need stitches.

253
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 He didn't need to do much.

254
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,000
 He just put his hand on the soldier's ear.

255
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Healed.

256
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 Right?

257
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 Right?

258
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 If Jesus can be blind,

259
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 he can also be able to see.

260
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 If he can cut off the soldier's ear,

261
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 he can also be able to see.

262
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Wow.

263
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 Jesus said,

264
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 "I have to go."

265
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 "This is part of the plan."

266
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
 "This has to happen."

267
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 "I just had last supper with you."

268
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 "I just had last supper with you."

269
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 "This has to happen."

270
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 "This has to happen."

271
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 Look, Jesus followed the soldier.

272
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 "Arrest."

273
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
 He arrested him.

274
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 We are in the modern world.

275
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 In the modern world,

276
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 what is "arrest"?

277
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 Right?

278
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Is it tying his hands?

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 Or using a rope?

280
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
 Or carrying him out?

281
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 No, no, no.

282
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
 The Bible says,

283
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 Jesus followed them.

284
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
 He allowed them to arrest him.

285
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 He allowed them to arrest him.

286
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Because if Jesus didn't allow it,

287
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 how could he do it?

288
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 He could cut off his ear

289
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 and touch it.

290
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
 He could do it.

291
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 He could do it.

292
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 But if he tied his hands,

293
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 tied his hands,

294
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 tied his hands,

295
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 he couldn't tie him up.

296
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
 Big point here.

297
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Right?

298
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 Hmm.

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 I wonder.

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 I wonder.

301
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 What are these two soldiers

302
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 thinking?

303
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 From their perspective,

304
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 what's happening?

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 What are they thinking of?

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 What are they thinking of?

307
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 From their perspective,

308
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 they are thinking,

309
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 "Hey, we are here to arrest you."

310
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 "By accident,

311
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 someone cut off your ear."

312
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 "The blood is flowing."

313
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 "But I want to arrest that person."

314
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 "Wow,

315
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 he is a fake."

316
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 "He is not a real son of God."

317
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
 "Why did he touch my ear

318
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 and it healed?"

319
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 Hmm.

320
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 We said

321
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 we should think from perspective.

322
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 Right?

323
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 I will give you some time.

324
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
 Let's talk about it.

325
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 This soldier

326
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
 was cut off his ear.

327
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 He was touched by Jesus.

328
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
 His ear healed.

329
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 But what about this soldier?

330
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 Remember,

331
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 this story is about

332
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 perspective.

333
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Angle.

334
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 Point of view.

335
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 From different angles,

336
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 we see the same thing.

337
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Just like the game.

338
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 We will understand

339
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 the whole story

340
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 more completely.

341
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 The Bible did not say

342
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 how this soldier

343
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 saw the story.

344
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 But we can think about it.

345
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 We can guess.

346
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 We can imagine.

347
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Right?

348
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 I will pause the video

349
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 with this question.

350
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 If you are

351
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
 this soldier,

352
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 you see so many things.

353
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 What is your perspective?

354
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 What is your story?

355
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
 What will you think?

356
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 What will you say to your wife

357
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 when you get home?

358
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 What will you say to your children

359
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 when you get home?

360
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
 What will you say to yourself?

361
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 Pause. Discuss.

362
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 I told you to pause.

363
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 Why did you pause?

364
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Pause. Discuss.

365
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 What will this soldier see?

366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 What angle?

367
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
 Perspective.

368
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 He has different perspective from Peter.

369
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 Different perspective from Judas.

370
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 Right?

371
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 I expect you paused.

372
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 I will discuss with you again.

373
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Here we go. Let's continue the story.

374
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Do you remember who said,

375
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 "Jesus, where are you going?

376
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I will follow you."

377
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 Do you remember who said that?

378
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
 Yes. Peter.

379
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 And do you remember

380
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 who said that?

381
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 When we first started talking about the story,

382
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 the story of Last Supper,

383
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 Jesus asked this soldier to set up a table

384
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 for the people to eat.

385
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 Who was that?

386
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 John.

387
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 John is often

388
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 the one

389
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 who loves the most

390
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 in the Bible.

391
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 The one who Jesus loved.

392
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
 That was John.

393
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 What will they do?

394
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 After all these things happened,

395
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 what will they do?

396
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 What will they do?

397
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 Can you see where they are?

398
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
 Look!

399
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 There is John.

400
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 He is the youngest

401
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 among the people.

402
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 Youngest.

403
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 Who is this?

404
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 Peter is holding a sword.

405
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 They are following him.

406
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 They are following him.

407
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Right?

408
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 His beloved Jesus was taken away.

409
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 But what are they forgetting?

410
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 What is he forgetting?

411
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 Who is this?

412
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Jesus!

413
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 Jesus was taken away

414
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 by them.

415
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Do you think Jesus will be in trouble?

416
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 Do you think

417
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 what will John and Peter

418
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 do next?

419
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 What are they thinking now?

420
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 Let's talk about this

421
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 when we debrief.

422
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 This is the end of the story.

423
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 We will continue next time.

424
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 We just finished

425
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 the story of the Bible.

426
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 Today's topic is

427
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 perspective.

428
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 Point of view.

429
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 Now, let's think about

430
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 the story just now.

431
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 If we look at it from different perspectives,

432
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 different perspectives,

433
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 different point of view,

434
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 from different perspectives,

435
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
 there are many different angles.

436
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 Do you remember our game?

437
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 We have many different perspectives

438
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 to build a comprehensive story.

439
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 to build a comprehensive story.

440
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 to build a comprehensive story.

441
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 If we don't have a comprehensive story

442
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 or we can't see it in detail,

443
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 we are not comprehensive enough.

444
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Right?

445
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 In the Bible,

446
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 when Jesus was taken away,

447
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 when Jesus prayed

448
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 in the garden,

449
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 there are many different accounts

450
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 in the Gospel.

451
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 In the Gospel,

452
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 we see

453
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 there is Luke,

454
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 John, Matthew, Mark.

455
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 But if we

456
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 can use our brain

457
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 to think from different angles,

458
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 what will we think?

459
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 Although

460
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 it is not necessarily mentioned in the Bible

461
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 that John has a perspective,

462
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 because John is

463
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 an author in the Gospel.

464
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 He is a writer.

465
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 We can also see

466
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 a little bit of Jesus' perspective

467
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 a little bit of Jesus' perspective

468
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 because he is in the garden.

469
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 Right?

470
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 We can imagine Peter's perspective.

471
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 We can imagine Peter's perspective.

472
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 We can also imagine

473
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Judas' perspective.

474
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 Judas' perspective.

475
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 Let's take some time

476
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 to think about it together.

477
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 First, we have

478
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Jesus.

479
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 So, pretend.

480
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
假設你是Jesus

481
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 Hello, my name is Jesus.

482
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 現在發生這件事,你會想什麼?

483
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 If you were Jesus,

484
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 what would your story be like?

485
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 如果你是耶穌的時候,

486
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,000
 你的故事會怎樣變?

487
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 你的角度會怎樣?

488
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 從Jesus的角度

489
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
 會怎樣看這個故事?

490
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:49,000
 Pause

491
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
 想一想

492
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
 再回來,我告訴你

493
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 One version of

494
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,000
 耶穌可能會有

495
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
 這樣的角度來看

496
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 第一個

497
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,000
 If I were Jesus

498
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 記得我們看到他在

499
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,000
 花園裏面嗎?

500
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 他還在祈禱

501
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
 他的角度就是

502
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 A bit of

503
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,000
 什麼?

504
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,000
 Exhausted

505
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 是不是? 很累喔

506
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 神啊

507
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,000
 如果你這個計劃

508
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 可以沒有這一部分

509
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,000
 可不可以呢?

510
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,000
 這麼辛苦,可不可以呢?

511
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:35,000
 其實,耶穌

512
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
 會不會真的很累?

513
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 他做了這麼多神蹟,救了這麼多人

514
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 但也有人

515
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
 要追殺他

516
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 還有門徒好像

517
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 怎麼說都不明白

518
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,000
 叫他不要睡覺

519
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 祈禱

520
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,000
 因為那些人會來抓我

521
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
 要保護自己

522
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 祈禱完,發生什麼事?

523
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
 睡不著

524
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
 他的角度,耶穌的角度

525
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
 會怎麼說這個故事呢?

526
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 我們想起

527
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
 Judas,即是出賣耶穌的那位

528
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 用錢來交換

529
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 告訴別人

530
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
 耶穌是誰的那位Judas

531
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 我們未必很清楚

532
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 當時的那一刻

533
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
 出賣耶穌

534
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 出賣耶穌之前,他在想什麼

535
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
 但我們可以幻想

536
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 我們可以想想

537
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 如果假設我們是Judas

538
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 我們會在想什麼呢?

539
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 我就帶他們去找耶穌

540
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 我親那口,那個男人

541
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 那個就是耶穌

542
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
 就是這麼多

543
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
 哇!

544
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
 剛剛親完他

545
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 彼得就去

546
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 把那個男人的耳朵切下來

547
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 不知道是不是很壞呢?

548
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
 耶穌還救回那個soldier

549
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 還弄好他的耳朵

550
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,000
 覺得很矛盾

551
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,000
 為了這麼少錢

552
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 出賣耶穌

553
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,000
 好像很壞

554
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 我們再想想

555
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,000
 如果從另一個角度來看

556
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
 另一個角度

557
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 第二個觀點

558
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,000
 彼得

559
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 彼得就是

560
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 把耳朵切下來的那個

561
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 記得他嗎?

562
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
 就是那個

563
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
 耶穌,你去到邊,我跟你去邊

564
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,000
 耶穌,你死,我跟你去死

565
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 我永遠是你的朋友

566
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,000
 我不會否認你的

567
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 I won't deny you

568
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,000
 我不會否認你的

569
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:05,000
 到這個地步

570
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 如果彼得要說這個故事

571
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,000
 他會怎麼說呢?

572
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 你們休息一下

573
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:13,000
 你們大家談吧

574
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
 如果我是彼得

575
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 我怎麼會說這個故事呢?

576
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 我怎麼重複給人聽呢?

577
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 If I were Peter

578
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 How would I tell the story?

579
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,000
 是啊

580
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,000
 耶穌就祈禱完

581
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 找我們滿堂

582
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,000
 但是很失望,我們又睡著了

583
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 他明明叫我們不要睡

584
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
 叫我們祈禱

585
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 但是,期期下,真的很累

586
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 我都不以為我會睡覺

587
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
 由這麼多人之中

588
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
 我當然要為了耶穌祈禱

589
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,000
 當然要為了大眾祈禱

590
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
 當然要為了大眾祈禱

591
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,000
 但是,又不是睡著了

592
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 之後,哇,大件事了

593
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,000
 之後,哇,大件事了

594
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,000
 朱迪斯來

595
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,000
 親了耶穌一口

596
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 帶了一些不知道什麼軍人來

597
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,000
 抓耶穌

598
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 哇,真是大件事

599
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
 但是呢

600
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
 我呢,就不會

601
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 站著不做事的

602
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
 生氣得我

603
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 拿著劍

604
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:15,000
 斬了那個軍人

605
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:17,000
 蘇州的議席下來

606
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 怎麼樣?生氣吧

607
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
 這樣對待耶穌

608
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 耶穌做了多少好事

609
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 耶穌愛多少人

610
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,000
 這樣對待他,不得了

611
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
 不行,我是不會容許的

612
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 對了

613
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 又是衰衝動

614
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 又是衰衝動

615
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:37,000
 又是衝動

616
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 耶穌就說,叫我放下劍

617
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
 這樣,很厲害

618
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 他一碰那個人的耳朵

619
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 哇,明明在那裡流血

620
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,000
 這樣碰一碰,好像

621
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 魔術

622
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 但是,耶穌不是魔術師

623
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,000
 耶穌是神的兒子,就是神

624
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
 當然可以治好,對吧?

625
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,000
 哇,治好了,叫我放下劍

626
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 那我當然

627
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
 聽聽話,放下劍

628
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,000
 但是,我還是不服

629
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 我也要跟蹤他們

630
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
 看他帶耶穌去哪裡

631
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 我會永遠跟著他

632
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
 永遠跟著耶穌

633
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 看他帶他去哪裡

634
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,000
 OK,現在有很多

635
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 不同的角度看,對吧?

636
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,000
 剩下誰?

637
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,000
 剩下誰?

638
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 John,是不是剩下約翰?

639
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 對了,John就是

640
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
 剛開始的故事

641
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 他幫人

642
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,000
 設置桌子,對吧?

643
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,000
 耶穌叫他擺好位置

644
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 我們要吃 Passover

645
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,000
 乖乖地,你知道John

646
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
 是全部

647
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
 門徒之中最小的

648
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 經常John寫

649
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:45,000
 福音的時候

650
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,000
 他說

651
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
 Jesus is most loved, Jesus is beloved

652
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
 就是耶穌最疼的那位

653
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,000
 其實我們看到他的故事

654
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 玩到

655
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 Love, and follow,對吧?

656
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
 那如果他

657
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 故事怎麼說呢?我們其實知道

658
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 因為聖經裡面

659
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 有John的帳號

660
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 我們可以讀,但是假設

661
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
 如果你是John

662
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
 你會怎麼看呢?

663
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
 關一鈊,你們聊聊

664
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
 回來

665
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 我給你我的版本

666
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
 我的版本給你聽

667
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,000
 但是我們有聖經可以看

668
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,000
 可以看John

669
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,000
 是有哪些細節有

670
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
 哪些細節沒有

671
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 如果我是John

672
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 If I were John

673
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 我會怎麼說這個故事呢?

674
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,000
 OK

675
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 耶穌祈禱完就出來

676
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 我就

677
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,000
 起了身

678
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,000
 我已經睡了

679
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
 然後很多事發生

680
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 明明

681
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 要跟隨耶穌

682
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,000
 去很多不同地方

683
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 為什麼有這麼多事發生?

684
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
 吃

685
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,000
 吃宵夜之前

686
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
 祂就每個人幫我們洗腳

687
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 哇

688
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 祂真的很疼我們

689
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
 之後又說了很多事

690
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 說祂要走

691
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
 說我們要吃祂的身體

692
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 要吃麵包

693
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 喝酒

694
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
 喝酒要吃祂的血

695
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 說著說著

696
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 都好像重複很多不同的東西

697
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,000
 但是又不是太清楚

698
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 祂想說什麼

699
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
 祂出來祈禱

700
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 不知道祂想說什麼

701
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,000
 貿貿然

702
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 來了一個Judas

703
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 Judas吃了他一口

704
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,000
 彼得又

705
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,000
 割了人家耳朵

706
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
 耶穌又救了他

707
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 又治好他

708
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:51,000
 然後耶穌就

709
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 跟著那兩個軍人走

710
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 只是這樣走

711
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,000
 跟著他們走

712
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 我就很愛耶穌

713
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 耶穌那麼疼我

714
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 我當然要跟蹤他們

715
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 看他們帶我和耶穌去哪裡

716
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,000
 我一定會在他們旁邊

717
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
 他們那麼疼我

718
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
 我一定會聽他們的話

719
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 他們一定有東西要告訴我們

720
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,000
 知道是什麼來的

721
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
 因為

722
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
 我們那麼愛他們

723
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
 他們那麼愛我們

724
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 一定要跟蹤他們

725
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 慢慢小心地跟蹤他們

726
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:33,000
 OK

727
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 我們回想起來

728
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
 有那麼多不同的角度的時候

729
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
 你覺不覺得這個故事

730
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,000
 這樣看是比較全面一點呢

731
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
 我們不會知道

732
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,000
 為什麼有某些部分

733
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
 聖經裏面沒有說

734
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 為什麼某些角度聖經沒有說

735
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
 但是我們作為人

736
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,000
 我們作為想到東西的人

737
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,000
 感覺到東西的人

738
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 其實可以幻想的

739
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
 我們讀其他故事書也是

740
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
 是不是

741
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,000
 如果讀Three Little Pigs

742
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 那我說

743
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,000
 如果一個狼說一個故事

744
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:09,000
 會怎麼說一個故事呢

745
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
 那變了是你可以

746
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,000
 不同的角度去看一個故事

747
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:15,000
 好像我們玩的遊戲一樣

748
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,000
 你反轉一個故事

749
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 來參考、來了解

750
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:21,000
 反轉看一個比較深入的細節

751
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:23,000
 你會看到些什麼呢

752
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,000
 看到很多不同的東西

753
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 我們可以求神

754
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
 祈禱說神啊

755
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 幫我們看到這個故事

756
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
 雖然很多次聽過這個故事

757
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
 但是如果用不同的角度來看

758
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,000
 可以

759
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,000
 多認識一些東西

760
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,000
 可以了解你多少呢

761
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,000
 求你幫我們

762
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,000
 謝謝耶穌

763
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 故事怎麼繼續

764
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
 耶穌跟了那兩個軍人去哪

765
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
 之後會發生什麼事

766
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 哇

767
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 下一集再說

768
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,000
 OK 大家準備好了嗎

769
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 中文時間

770
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,000
 我整個episode

771
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,000
 就講角度

772
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,000
 Perspective

773
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,000
 Angle

774
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:09,000
 其實中文角度

775
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
 即是甚麼意思呢

776
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,000
 其實就是

777
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
 角度

778
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 中文角度即是甚麼意思呢

779
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,000
 角

780
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,000
 角度即是角

781
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,000
 Corner

782
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
 度

783
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,000
 角度

784
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 你可以說

785
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
 一個triangle

786
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
 一個triangle

787
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
 三角形

788
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
 三

789
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 一二三

790
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
 三個角

791
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,000
 Three corners

792
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,000
 三個angle

793
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,000
 角度

794
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
 角度和

795
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 角

796
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
 同樣的

797
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,000
 周圍看看

798
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,000
 你周圍的東西

799
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,000
 哪些有角呢

800
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,000
 甚麼東西有角呢

801
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
 我就叫我兒子去找

802
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 你們可以

803
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,000
 拍住他

804
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
 OK

805
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 我叫我兒子去找東西有角

806
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,000
 甚麼東西有角呢

807
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,000
 你告訴別人

808
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,000
 你找到這本書的角在哪

809
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
 這裡

810
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
 即是corner

811
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,000
 這裡有角

812
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,000
 這本書的形狀

813
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:31,000
 是長方形

814
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:33,000
 長方形有多少個角呢

815
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 How many

816
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
 四個

817
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 你數吧

818
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
 一二三

819
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 四

820
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 四個角

821
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
 角又可以想corner

822
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
 角又可以找角度

823
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 angle

824
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 或者perspective

825
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 在我的可以

826
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,000
 例子就是在我的角度

827
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,000
 來看

828
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 我覺得

829
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
 應該日日吃雪糕

830
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,000
 So from my point of view

831
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
 From my angle

832
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,000
 I think everyday we should eat ice cream

833
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Who thumbs up

834
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 You agree

835
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,000
 但或者媽咪會講

836
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
 唔係喎

837
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
 從媽咪的角度來看

838
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
 日日食雪糕

839
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 唔健康喎

840
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
 媽咪says wait

841
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 From a mom's point of view

842
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 Eating ice cream everyday

843
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
 Isn't healthy

844
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,000
 Or

845
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
 Agree

846
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,000
 Disagree

847
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
 Or so so

848
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 我們可以有唔同個角度

849
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 Let's see

850
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
 What else is a 角

851
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
 Corner

852
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
 Street corner

853
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
 街角

854
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
 So when you say I'll meet you at the corner

855
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
 我喺街角等你啦

856
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,000
 Corner

857
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,000
 角

858
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,000
 Right

859
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
 And then when you go to the corner

860
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
 Stand in the corner

861
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,000
 Or put it at the corner

862
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
 角一頭都係有個角字

863
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
 Challenge

864
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
 If

865
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
 如果三角形

866
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
 Triangle

867
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 係叫三角形

868
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,000
 Hexagon

869
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
 係乜嘢

870
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
 中文hexagon

871
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 係點講

872
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
 下次你答我

873
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,000
 See you later

874
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,000
 Bye

875
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,000
 大家而家到返

876
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 At home extension

877
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:43,000
 喺屋企點樣可以深入啲

878
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,000
 講呢個故事俾小朋友聽呢

879
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 我就呼籲大家

880
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 攞返大型嘅成經

881
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
 Your Bible

882
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
 去返John 18

883
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
 約翰第十八章

884
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 讀返嗰度係講返Jesus is Arrest

885
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
 之前都可以睇返

886
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,000
 Last Supper 嗰啲

887
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 我就想你讀俾小朋友聽

888
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
 或者一齊讀都好

889
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,000
 讀完就想問你哋

890
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 睇下

891
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,000
 Miss Rebecca 做嗰個

892
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 edition, 嗰個 version

893
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 Of John 嘅角度

894
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,000
 同其實神想我哋讀John

895
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 嘅角度有啲咩出入

896
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
 有啲咩唔同呢

897
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
 點解

898
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,000
 One, Teacher Rebecca 係幻想

899
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,000
 但係喺

900
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
 聖經裏面嗰個 perspective

901
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
 嗰個角度 from John

902
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
 咁就我哋知

903
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
 亦都可以講俾小朋友聽

904
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
 其實福音, Gospel 有四個 account

905
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
 係咪?

906
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,000
 都係可以講緊 Last Supper

907
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
 都係可以講緊 Jesus is Arrest

908
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 都係可以講緊 Easter Story

909
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 點解要四個呢?

910
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
 有

911
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
 Matthew, Mark, Luke 同埋 John

912
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,000
 一個咪夠囉

913
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,000
 點解要咁多個?

914
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
 嗱, The Bible 唔會錯㗎嘛

915
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
 係咪?

916
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,000
 連 Easter Story 嘅 Gospel 都有四個 account

917
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
 證明

918
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
 神都想我哋睇唔同個角度嘅嘢

919
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:11,000
 係咪?

920
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,000
 抽出唔同嘢出嚟

921
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,000
 係一個 story 都可以抽出唔同嘅嘢

922
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 變咗點呀?

923
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
 嗰個 story 會有多啲意思, more meaning

924
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
 嗰個 story 會豐富啲, richer

925
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 [Music]

926
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 [Music]

927
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,000

928
