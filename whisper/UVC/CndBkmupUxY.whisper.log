[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   All right, I want to say thank you to Kelly for doing that really off the cuff, being
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.840]   able to speak directly from the scriptures there.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:22.040]   It's a long passage, it includes a number of different things, and you might think,
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.800]   I hope he's not going to talk about all of that as we're here today, and I'm not.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.720]   I thought maybe as I come, often when I am here, some of the illustrations I use will
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.360]   be of my family, and most of you maybe have never seen my family because I'm traveling
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.720]   to different churches, but I have ten children, three of them are now married, and I have
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.100]   two grandchildren, so this is my wife and my family.
[00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.520]   So when you hear my illustrations about big family and craziness of that, now you'll get
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.680]   a sense of that, and that's out on our front porch here in the West Suburb.
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.720]   So anyway, that was free, that wasn't really part of the sermon, just a little bit of back
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.040]   story on me so you'll know me a little bit better.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.720]   But I really want to come to you today and bring you greetings as my brothers and sisters
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.400]   in Christ who are here at Urban Voice.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:21.400]   I'm so glad to rejoin you today on this journey you're on, and to really encourage you from
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.600]   the Bible as fellow followers of Jesus Christ in Chicagoland.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.600]   I confess, though, that I am far less aware of you and what you're up to these days, as
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.000]   I have devoted much more of my time lately to the many new people that are being displaced
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.760]   here from places like Afghanistan, Ukraine, and now Venezuela and Colombia.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.460]   Though from being with you when you started as a church, I know that you're approaching
[00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:57.000]   an age when inertia begins to set in, an inertia that causes churches to focus more inward
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.560]   than outward, to be more concerned about maintaining than growing the church.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.000]   As a church grows older, it takes more and more people in the congregation to see one
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.360]   new follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:16.480]   And just like you and me, if your church is not growing, you're declining.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.800]   So this really begs two very crucial questions that I'd like to ask you today.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.920]   What does growth look like for your church?
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.380]   And number two, how can I keep my church growing?
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:35.400]   To begin to answer these very important questions, from almost 40 years of missionary experience
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.160]   that I've had here in Chicagoland, this is what I would say to you.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.160]   Hear me in this.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.600]   There are a lot of good things that you can do as a church, but you must keep your focus
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.240]   on the greats.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.680]   You must keep your focus on the greats.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.500]   Let me repeat that to you.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.840]   There are a lot of good things that you can do as a church, but you must keep your focus
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.400]   on the greats.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.400]   So what are the greats?
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.760]   Well, I'm referring to the great commandment and the great commission.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.920]   So let me just quote them for you so that both of them are in your mind here.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.200]   The great commandment is what we just heard from Luke chapter 10, and it's to love the
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.480]   Lord your God with all of your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.160]   And the second is likened to it, to love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.440]   The great commission is at the end of Jesus' time on earth as he is ascended to heaven,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.480]   and these are the last words that he has to say, "Go and make disciples of all nations,
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.120]   baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.480]   And lo, I'm with you always, even to the end."
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.460]   So I want you to notice with these two greats, the great commandment and the great commission,
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.660]   that there are two key words in them that begin with the letter N, the letter N, like
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.940]   M-N-O-P-N.
[00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:12.300]   And the Ns that are here, the two words that begin with N, are numbers and noses, which
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.260]   sometimes in church growth we kind of get into that.
[00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.260]   How many people did we have show up for service today?
[00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.260]   What does the number look like?
[00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.980]   But really what you see in these two greats is two other Ns, and that is the N of neighbor
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.060]   and the N of nations.
[00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.860]   So I want to start by talking a little bit about growing the church through neighbors
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.140]   and nations.
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.340]   Let me start with nations.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:44.260]   Focusing on nations seems like a pretty straightforward approach for a church, and maybe even a roadmap
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.740]   to try to track progress as a church.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.940]   It's almost like a continental approach of reaching others with each continent, like
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.260]   starting in Asia, America, Europe, and going to all of the continents.
[00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.340]   Well, maybe not Antarctica.
[00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.380]   I don't think we have really much mission work that needs to be done in Antarctica.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:10.620]   It does mean going after people in each country, though, to know Jesus when we take a nations
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.060]   approach.
[00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.780]   But here's what's interesting.
[00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.020]   Nations rise and fall.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.540]   Nations come and go.
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:23.020]   Sadly, we see that even with Ukraine recently as a country's trying to take it over and
[00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.260]   basically absorb it.
[00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:30.380]   So how do we fulfill our mission if we're looking at nations when that list of nations
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.020]   is changing constantly?
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.480]   The United States didn't even exist when the first church was born.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:44.520]   My point is this, how do we measure progress when our lists are ever-changing?
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.600]   To bring greater clarity to this, I believe it helps us to understand the meaning of nations
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.480]   in the Scriptures.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.440]   The phrase for nations is actually the phrase "ponta ta ethne," and it's a Greek word,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.640]   which, or Greek phrase, which means "people groups."
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:07.440]   So if you take the Great Commission, it's to go and make disciples of all people groups,
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:12.600]   all ponta ta ethne, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.880]   Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I've commanded you.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:23.280]   In Acts 2, we actually see one example of this as the church began.
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.800]   There's a list of people who heard the gospel at Pentecost, and it included this list that
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:40.560]   is given, Parthians, Medes, Elamites, Mesopotamians, Judeans, Cappodiceans, people of Pontus, people
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:49.960]   from provinces across Asia, Phrygians, Pamphylians, Egyptians, Libyans around Cyrene, visitors
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.200]   from Rome who were both Jews and converts to Judaism, Cretans, and Arabs.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.720]   Now that's probably the list I should have given Kelly to read, but then she would not
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.220]   have liked me anymore today after reading that list.
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:10.440]   So why such a comprehensive and particular list of the nations is given here?
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:15.720]   Here's the early church, the Spirit has come, and this group of people respond.
[00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.660]   It's just a group of people.
[00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:22.880]   But in the Scripture here, it's a particular list of particular people from particular
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:23.880]   places.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:29.800]   And that's because the church was birthed not just for the Jews in Jerusalem.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:35.840]   As the Spirit fell on the church, people groups speaking different languages heard the gospel
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.520]   in their own language.
[00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:42.960]   They repented, and it says that there were over 3,000 people who were added to the church
[00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:46.240]   that day, at least 3,000 people.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:51.360]   And then it says they all went back to their homelands to tell others what they had heard,
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.000]   and a multi-ethnic church spreads to other ethnicities and other people groups as the
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.360]   gospel goes to the ends of the earth.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.880]   You know, yet people groups might seem to you, too, like a moving target.
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.820]   Just as we talked about nations coming and going, people groups might seem like a moving
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.140]   target to you.
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.600]   But I want to assure you from Matthew's gospel that it is a finite work, meaning it has a
[00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.000]   start and a stop to it.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.080]   In Matthew chapter 24, verse 14, it says this, "And this gospel of the kingdom will
[00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:31.680]   be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all people, or all Pantetah
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.040]   ethnei, and then the end will come."
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:43.160]   So let me say this, one day our job will be done, and Christ will return to bring us to
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:49.440]   heaven to worship Him from all that have been reached by the church through the years.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:55.520]   And it says that they will be from all peoples, tribes, and tongues.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:01.480]   And this is given to us by a vision from John in the book of Revelation chapter 7, verse
[00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:02.480]   9.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.360]   I know I'm going to a lot of places in Scripture, so my apologies here, but then if you look
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:16.720]   in Acts 1735, you see that Paul tells the people of Athens how important proximity and
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.320]   purpose is to our mission.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:25.680]   He says, "From one man God created all nations, or Pantetah ethnei, of men and women, and
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.120]   determined the times and the places where they live."
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.640]   Why did He do that?
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:37.880]   It says, "So that they might know Him, though He's not very far from any one of us."
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.560]   So therefore, one key really to a growing church is keeping the nations in front of
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:48.360]   us, especially those nations who are in our own backyard.
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:53.480]   To help the nations know Him, and especially nations that are near us in global cities
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   like Jerusalem then and Chicago now, a church must have a clear vision that keeps nations
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:03.280]   as a priority in our work.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.480]   Think about it.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.920]   We even have states like Texas that are busing nations here regularly to us, over 500 over
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.320]   the past three weeks.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:19.480]   Could I ask you, is there a particular people group that God may be touching your heart
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.320]   to share and show the love of Christ to them?
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:28.760]   Could it be that together with brothers and sisters in Christ here that you do that?
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.040]   Nations will never know unless you go.
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:38.520]   Go and tell them about Jesus, and some of them are your people in your own backyard,
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   even your own neighbors.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.280]   So then I'd like us to go on to think a little bit about neighbors now.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.920]   I mentioned nations, I want to talk just a bit about neighbors.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:55.600]   The great commandment speaks to us of really having a sold-out kind of love, to love the
[00:10:55.600 --> 00:11:01.560]   Lord God with all of your heart, your soul, your mind, and your strength, and love your
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.080]   neighbors as yourself.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:09.480]   Well, I think we have a pretty good idea of how to love ourselves, but we don't always
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.440]   know who our neighbor is or how we're supposed to love them.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.600]   Jesus was asked this specific question, and his answer was quite telling in what we've
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:23.360]   seen here in Luke chapter 10 from our Bible reading today.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:31.040]   It's a story not of greats, but is a surprisingly interesting story of a good person, a good
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:34.960]   Samaritan who's normally despised by others.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:41.520]   Jesus tells the story to inform us who our neighbor is and how we might behave toward
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:44.920]   them, so pay attention here.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:51.360]   The broader context, which is why I had Kelly read the whole chapter, is the context of
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:53.060]   deployment.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.280]   Jesus is deploying his disciples at the beginning of chapter 10.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.440]   He's sending out a second wave of 72 followers in pairs.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:09.400]   Now that must be a growing church when you can send out 72 people and still be growing,
[00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.400]   right?
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:15.880]   But his purpose is so that they would go out to tell still others, so that they would believe,
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:18.800]   and he warns people who don't believe.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.300]   Then something really amazing happens here.
[00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:30.560]   As they go, it says that even the demons obeyed them, and Jesus says that he saw Satan fall
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:37.560]   like lightning at the power of Jesus in them as they went.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.560]   You get that?
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:44.460]   As they were going, as they were out doing the work, God's power was with them, and even
[00:12:44.460 --> 00:12:50.220]   Satan fell at the act of God's people on the move, people going.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:55.940]   So Jesus prays for them, and he's rejoicing in their childlike faith and the obedience
[00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:02.780]   that they have to change their neighbors and even to defeat Satan in those actions.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:07.820]   But it's not happening by people who are wise and clever by the world's standards.
[00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:13.700]   Jesus gives this parable then of the Good Samaritan as an example of what we're supposed
[00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.700]   to do.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.540]   Finally, the chapter ends with this story that seems unrelated about these sisters,
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.940]   Mary and Martha.
[00:13:21.940 --> 00:13:26.580]   We have four characters in the story, especially the Good Samaritan story.
[00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:33.020]   One of them is his own, a fellow Jew who's left for dead on the side of the road, and
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:39.620]   then there's this preoccupied pastor and deacon, that's my modern day descriptions of that,
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:40.620]   who are preoccupied.
[00:13:40.620 --> 00:13:44.660]   They've got way too many things to do to step into this situation.
[00:13:44.660 --> 00:13:52.240]   And then there is someone who is outside of their own beliefs, not one of their own, who's
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:57.860]   different in belief, and he's also different in culture from them, and he's even despised
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:02.020]   by them, but he proves helpful to this person.
[00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:08.500]   And only one of these four characters is described as good, the good neighbor.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:14.860]   The despised Samaritan is the only one who is described as a good neighbor in this story.
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:19.420]   And what does this good neighbor, this despised Samaritan do?
[00:14:19.420 --> 00:14:24.980]   Well, he really, I think, lays out four things that you see happening here if you just look
[00:14:24.980 --> 00:14:26.640]   at that passage.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.980]   It says that he felt compassion for the person that was hurting.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:37.400]   He saw a person on the side of the road nearly dead, and he felt compassion for him.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:41.900]   It says then he stepped into the world of that person to help them.
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.540]   He met their urgent needs for help and for healing, and then he made plans for their
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:50.180]   longer term needs.
[00:14:50.180 --> 00:14:52.460]   Sounds kind of familiar, doesn't it?
[00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.460]   Think about it.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:55.620]   What did Jesus do for us?
[00:14:55.620 --> 00:14:58.860]   He felt compassion for us hurting.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:01.680]   He stepped in our world to help.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:07.740]   He met urgent needs that we had, but he also made plans to address our longer term needs.
[00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:14.100]   Jesus describes himself as a good neighbor, and he gives us the example of a despised
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.700]   Samaritan also being a good neighbor.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:19.580]   Now why is he a good neighbor?
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:23.500]   In the story it says because he showed mercy.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:30.700]   He crossed culture and language and religion to even an enemy by stepping in to help instead
[00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.700]   of stepping away.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:38.380]   So maybe to be a good neighbor we just need to do the same thing, right?
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.300]   Not so easy, is it?
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:43.900]   It wasn't easy for the lawyer either who heard this.
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:48.860]   He asked the question, he said, not because he wanted an answer, but he wanted to justify
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:52.660]   himself.
[00:15:52.660 --> 00:15:54.500]   He already had given the correct answer.
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:58.820]   He had quoted the great commandment to love the Lord God with all your heart, soul, and
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:03.300]   mind, and love your neighbor as yourself, and he said that he had done this all of his
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.300]   life.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:09.180]   I've always loved the Lord God Almighty, and I've always loved my neighbor.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:15.460]   So Jesus obviously knew that he needed an illustration to make clear and more measurable
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.520]   where he was missing the mark.
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:24.340]   So Jesus told the parable of the good Samaritan to explain how to be a good neighbor.
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:31.420]   Then Luke follows with this seemingly unrelated story of sisters, Mary and Martha, as we close
[00:16:31.420 --> 00:16:37.060]   this chapter on deployment, on Jesus' disciples being deployed.
[00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:42.460]   It says that Jesus is present with the sisters, and he's showing ways that they responded
[00:16:42.460 --> 00:16:44.820]   to his presence with them.
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:50.220]   One is Martha, who welcomed Jesus, but then is more anxious about all the things that
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:55.740]   need to be done, all the things that need to be maintained.
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:00.260]   The other is Mary, and Mary's concerned about sitting at the feet of Jesus and learning
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:01.860]   from him.
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:09.580]   Jesus says Mary discovered the one thing worth being concerned about most, being with Jesus
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:12.540]   and learning from him.
[00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:14.660]   So now how does all this tie together?
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:20.340]   Well, what does all of this mean for you and I today?
[00:17:20.340 --> 00:17:27.780]   Well you see, loving neighbors and nations starts by remembering our first love, Jesus,
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:32.940]   and then listening to what Jesus tells us to do, even helping people that are different
[00:17:32.940 --> 00:17:36.060]   from ourselves living in our own neighborhoods.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:43.160]   Yes, we cannot lose sight of our first love, and it's because of our growing love for Jesus
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.740]   that we see the nations and the neighbors around us in a more compassionate way, worthy
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.180]   of his love too.
[00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:58.100]   We love because he first loved us, even when we were his enemies.
[00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:01.580]   So what is God saying to you today?
[00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:04.220]   Maybe your love has grown cold for Jesus.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:10.860]   Why don't you confess that to him and ask him to rekindle your love for him?
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.780]   He can do that.
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:18.580]   And if you love Jesus, then you should love your neighbor more, even those who are not
[00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.140]   like you.
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:27.300]   I believe God brought your church here together and put you where you are to grow here and
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:32.820]   not decline, to thrive and not just survive.
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:37.860]   Where do you see neglect of your neighbors and your nations around you?
[00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:43.580]   Where you see neglect of neighbors or where you see nations that are not being reached,
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:46.100]   maybe there's something you should do about it.
[00:18:46.100 --> 00:18:51.220]   Personally, I want to ask you, what is your next step?
[00:18:51.220 --> 00:18:52.980]   Let's pray.
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:57.460]   Father, thank you for the moments to be here.
[00:18:57.460 --> 00:19:05.880]   What is a very long passage but has some incredible meaning for all of us as followers of you
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:11.800]   that have been deployed beyond what happened in that town of Jerusalem to all of the ends
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.500]   of the earth.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:18.580]   Thank you, God, that the church then saw their neighbors, those who spoke different languages
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:22.300]   and had different backgrounds, and pursued them.
[00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:28.260]   And today we are beneficiaries of what the church did then to reach those beyond themselves,
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:32.140]   their neighbors and the nations that were in their midst.
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.640]   Show us how to do that today, God.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:39.580]   Give us a vision for what you would have us do that isn't just about how many people
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:45.380]   sit here in a seat, but about the neighbors that you put around us and the nations that
[00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:46.740]   need to know you.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:49.260]   And we pray these things in Jesus' name.
