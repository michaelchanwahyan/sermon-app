[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   - Good to see you all, and as Kelly mentioned,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.960]   many of us are sick, especially with little children.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.680]   It's been a very tough season, it's a flu season.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.440]   And this flu season is more severe than what we had,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.820]   what I had before.
[00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.560]   And even I got sick for quite a few days.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.680]   As you know, I went to New York for five days
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.760]   of family vacation, and then I got sick.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.200]   I went in the Christmas break,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.360]   so there were tons of people there on the street,
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.760]   and I could hardly move in Manhattan,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.260]   and that's what I expected.
[00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.920]   I would get sick, and I did, I did get sick.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.640]   So I came back and been sick for five days,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.960]   and my son and my daughter, they're all sick.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.040]   I think my wife got sick too.
[00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.440]   I think she got sick before we got sick.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.280]   Anyways, yeah, so we all got sick,
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.020]   and we just get in line to get sick.
[00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.200]   And some of our families are also not here
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.800]   because their children are sick,
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.520]   and Jinfan and Paul are not here
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.320]   because they are still, little Isaac,
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.000]   yeah, little Isaac is out of NICU,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.800]   and thank you for your prayer.
[00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.960]   And they need time to adjust,
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.800]   to get into a new routine.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.080]   And you can imagine how difficult it is,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.720]   and it's quite challenging, and keep them in prayer.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.640]   And as Kelly told us,
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.440]   remember the people in Los Angeles,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.240]   how many of you have friends and coworkers
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.320]   or relatives living in Los Angeles?
[00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.160]   How many of you?
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.000]   Oh, you do, okay, all right, yeah.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.520]   Make sure you call them and pray for them, yeah.
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.200]   I have some friends who live in Los Angeles,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.920]   and they got evacuated, yeah, and it's very difficult, yeah.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.600]   And you see news stories reporting,
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.880]   you know, the whole town got wiped out.
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.400]   It's just horrible, it's horrible.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.560]   May God have mercy on them.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.920]   So good to see you all, good to see you, good to see you.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.600]   (laughs)
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.520]   Anyways, we continue to worship God,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.240]   and with the number of people,
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.880]   we should get in circle, actually.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.480]   So that's what I've been thinking.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.880]   Maybe we should get into circle,
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.040]   and we can do a Bible study or something.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.240]   But, you know, not today, okay?
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.520]   In the future, all right, yeah.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.520]   And we are on this mini series on the 10 commandments,
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.320]   and we said these commandments are called 10 words.
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.240]   They are not being described as commandment
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.320]   in the Old Testament.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.040]   In the Hebrew Bible, never use the word commandment,
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.520]   something that you have to do or you shall not do
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.040]   to summarize.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.880]   There's 10 things, actually,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.880]   the word used by the Old Testament is actually words.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.800]   10 words.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.240]   So these are the 10 words, the 10 commandments,
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.840]   what we call, that God gave to the people of Israel
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.840]   when they are being constituted to be a new people of God,
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.080]   being saved out of Egypt by grace,
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.760]   and now they have a new identity.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760]   Being the people of God,
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.960]   they are given new principles to live by,
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.320]   a new lifestyle that says to God,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.200]   "Thank you for saving me, God."
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.760]   And now we have a new lifestyle,
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.960]   we embrace a new set of identity,
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.920]   a new set of value system,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.080]   and these value systems are being summarized
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.120]   by these 10 words.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.360]   So we went through the first three commandments,
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.360]   and now we come to the so-called commandment
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.920]   or word number four, the fourth principle.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.880]   And here it says, "Remember the Sabbath day
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.600]   "by keeping it holy six days,
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.840]   "you shall labor and do all your work,
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.140]   "but the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord your God.
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.560]   "On this day, the seventh day,
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.040]   "you shall not do any work,
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.800]   "neither you nor your son, nor your daughter,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.680]   "nor your manservant, nor maidservant, nor your animals,
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.760]   "nor the aliens, the foreigners within your gates.
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.760]   "For in six days, the Lord made the heavens and the earth,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.240]   "the sea and all that is in them,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.120]   "but he rested, God rested on the seventh day.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.840]   "Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.120]   "and made it holy."
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.280]   Now, you have to remember the first audience
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   who heard this word, this principle, were Israelites,
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.720]   and they have been living in Egypt for hundreds of years,
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.320]   for some generations.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.440]   So when the Israelites are being saved by God out of Egypt,
[00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:44.240]   all of them are actually 100% Egyptians.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.320]   You get my point, right?
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.480]   You get my point.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.400]   All of their clothing, all of the stuff
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.400]   that carry with them when they left Egypt in haste,
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.120]   everything is made in Egypt.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.400]   So actually the identity of Israelites
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.320]   was not very clear at this point
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.400]   because they just got out of Egypt
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.040]   and every one of them lived like Egyptian
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.960]   and think like Egyptian and lived like Egyptian before.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.400]   And what we know today is in ancient Egypt,
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.400]   slaves have a 10-day work week.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.440]   So you work 10 days and then you get one day off.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.000]   And then you work another 10 days
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.920]   and then one day off, perhaps, or sometimes not.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:35.000]   And then 10 days and then one day off, right?
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   So this is a typical ancient Egyptian slave work schedule,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.700]   10 days and then one day off.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.440]   The Sabbath lifestyle says something different.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.080]   Six days you shall work
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.800]   and then one day you shall take a break.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.880]   And you take a break by keeping it holy
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.580]   to worship God, to serve God.
[00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:02.360]   And you have to imagine, if you're the first audience
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.080]   out of Egypt, Israelite, you have been in Egypt
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.920]   working 10-day week for generations.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:12.120]   And then you come to the foot of Mount Sinai
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.720]   and Moses said, "This is what the Lord God has given us,
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.680]   "a new principle."
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:19.120]   Principle number four is six days you shall work.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.720]   And then one day you shall take a break to keep it holy.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.360]   And you're kind of like, "Wow, this is actually humane."
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.200]   Right?
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:32.220]   This is actually respecting human rights
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.220]   to take a break and to rest, not a workaholic.
[00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:41.720]   So you notice the scope of the principle
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:46.520]   is actually, it's encompassing the entire cosmos,
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.680]   the entire human society.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.320]   Look with me, who shall not work?
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.220]   You shall not work.
[00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.960]   Your son shall not work.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.320]   And in the original language, your daughter shall not work.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.600]   Your man servant, male servant, and the female servant,
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:07.360]   your female servant in the original language,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.080]   and then your animals, the cattle, the sheep
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.920]   that work the ground.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.960]   And then lastly, the alien, the foreigners
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:20.080]   within your gaze.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.120]   So seven categories encompassing the entire
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.200]   Israelite community, entire Israelite society.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.280]   And the principle reveals the character of God.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.280]   Who is God that would give this kind of principle?
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.840]   Because God is full of compassion.
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   God is full of compassion.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.480]   God is compassionate about especially slaves,
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   those who have no power.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.120]   Those who have no power to control the schedule.
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.640]   They're working under the Lord, the master,
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.160]   and they have to work.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.680]   And God, by giving this principle,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.240]   shows that his heart is full of compassion and love
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:02.360]   for those people who rest.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.240]   And this commandment also explains
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:08.240]   why you have to keep six days to work,
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.680]   and then one day wholly to take a break
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.680]   and keep it holy, keep it sacred.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:19.680]   For in six days, that's how the Lord God did his work.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:23.840]   Remember Genesis 1, there was six-day creation.
[00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:25.560]   Definitely not a scientific report,
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:29.160]   but it's an artistic representation of how God work.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:31.840]   God worked six days.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:34.160]   He set up the entire cosmos.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.160]   And then on the seventh day, Genesis 2, he rested.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:40.800]   He rested on this seventh day and blessed.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.600]   And because God worked this way,
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.320]   we, as the people of God, also need to work this way.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:52.120]   It's interesting when we read
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:54.560]   from the very beginning of this document,
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:56.080]   10 words, 10 commandments,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.840]   from commandment one to three and now to four,
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:03.280]   this is the first commandment that has to do with time.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.120]   And schedule.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.680]   Time and schedule.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.160]   You know, how many of you still use the paper calendar?
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.800]   In the beginning of the year,
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.560]   you have to buy a new calendar.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.520]   Only my wife.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.720]   Yeah, right?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.400]   So you guys use electronic?
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.840]   Google Calendar, something like that?
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:24.520]   Yeah, that's what I do, yeah.
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.120]   But you know, my wife is very old school,
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.720]   and we have to buy paper calendar every,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.560]   by the end of the year, we buy a new calendar.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.600]   So what I do is, every single year,
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.280]   it's one of my routine.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:39.560]   Toward the end of year, I will go to Amazon
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:44.000]   or the bookstore to buy those monthly calendar.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   You know, you have to flip,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.600]   and then there's a beautiful picture on top,
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.480]   and probably a quote here and there.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:52.000]   And then you have these boxes, right?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:54.880]   And toward the end of year, I always buy a new one.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.240]   And I always buy a Jewish calendar,
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.360]   because it has the lunar calendar in there.
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.120]   So the lunar calendar kind of falls
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:07.240]   in line with the Chinese or the Asian lunar calendar.
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:09.080]   So like the end of this year,
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:14.080]   end of this month is the new year for the lunar calendar.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.800]   So I look at the calendar,
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:20.280]   and I know what day it is in the Western calendar,
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.960]   and then in the lunar calendar.
[00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:23.840]   So that's what we do.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:25.680]   You know, it has to do with schedule.
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.920]   And I want to ask you a question.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:31.440]   You know, when you became a Christian,
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.720]   when you accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior,
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.120]   it has to do with, first of all, your time.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.960]   You know, Jesus kind of,
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:46.080]   kind of restructure and reconfigure your schedule.
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:51.520]   Before you came to Christ, you know,
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.280]   every single moment, every day,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.600]   you are the boss, you are in charge.
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:58.000]   But you came to Christ,
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.720]   it has to do with some schedule change, right?
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:06.480]   God modify our week schedule.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.160]   So six days, of course, we need to work.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.240]   But in general, in the general pattern,
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:16.080]   we take one day off to serve God, right?
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.800]   And that's why we gather.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:19.360]   That's why we keep on gathering.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.680]   Yeah, I know it's snowing today, right?
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.600]   The weather is not very nice,
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.360]   but we still keep it holy,
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.640]   because this is one of the commandments from God.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.920]   And this is one of the application we should have
[00:11:34.920 --> 00:11:38.560]   the beginning of the year,
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.640]   maybe it's our new year resolution.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:42.800]   You know, we keep it holy,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.680]   set it aside and put it in our calendar,
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.760]   put it in our schedule,
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:50.160]   that we are to keep it holy the Sabbath day,
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:52.320]   because God bless this time.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.520]   So we worship together.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.000]   Now, commandment number five, principle five,
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.360]   is honor your father and your mother
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.080]   so that you may live long in the land
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.720]   the Lord your God is giving you.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.560]   Now, today, when we imagine family
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.600]   in the Westernized society,
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.720]   now the son or the daughter,
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:17.600]   they get married and they probably move out
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.320]   and build their own family, right?
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:21.480]   Buy their own houses and live somewhere else
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:24.440]   or move out of town into somewhere else,
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.560]   because of job, because of different reality.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:30.520]   But in the near East, in the ancient time,
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:31.800]   in the Bible time,
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:34.520]   most of the families are multi-generational.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:35.880]   Multi-generational.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:38.840]   Now, how many of you still live in your family
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.880]   multi-generationally?
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:44.240]   With your grandpa and grandma?
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:45.080]   How many of you?
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:47.560]   No, right?
[00:12:47.560 --> 00:12:50.680]   Most of the people don't live together
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:52.080]   with different generations.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:56.880]   But in ancient Israel, it has always been the case.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:01.880]   You live with your parents and your grandparents,
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.520]   and then probably three generations
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:07.160]   or even fourth generation living under one roof.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:10.800]   And here it says, honor your father and your mother.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:11.960]   You know, in Hebrew,
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.360]   Hebrew is a very interesting language.
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:18.360]   It says honor, in English translation,
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:22.080]   it has the connotation of something that is heavy.
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:25.400]   You know, when something that is valuable,
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.480]   when something that has dignity,
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.040]   that has value, that has importance,
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:33.200]   you kind of see it as something weighty.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.680]   You know, it's like a dumbbell.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:38.560]   It's something that is heavy.
[00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.000]   So glory and honor are something that is with weight,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.760]   just like your backpack or your luggage or a suitcase.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.240]   You have to carry it around.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:53.920]   So in order to weight, to give weight to others,
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:57.400]   someone has to have the resources to do so,
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.960]   especially financial resources.
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.120]   In the ancient time, of course,
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.460]   they don't use electronic money.
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:08.460]   They use coins or silver or gold bar to do business.
[00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:14.920]   So something that has value has weight, right?
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.080]   You carry your silver around in the marketplace
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:21.120]   to buy stuff, and that's the sense here.
[00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:25.020]   Honor your father and mother is to give them the weight,
[00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:30.520]   give them the heaviness, because they need to be honored.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:34.280]   They need to have the resource.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.320]   In the ancient society, there was no hospice,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.320]   there was no assisted living or something like that.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:44.360]   Everyone lives in the house, right?
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.360]   Your home is the hospice.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.720]   Your home is the hospital.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:54.600]   And that's why life and death, especially death,
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:59.600]   it's not something foreign to the people in those times.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.960]   They always see life and death in their houses.
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.000]   Baby being born, and then the elderly got sick
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.480]   and passed away.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.000]   It's right in front of them.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.280]   So here the commandment speaks of a resourceful
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:18.680]   person, a proper, you know,
[00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:24.600]   narrowly defined, is a resourceful male.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.400]   He has to honor, give honor to his parents.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.800]   And you think about it, the essence of the principle
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.260]   has to do with your heart orientation.
[00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:40.040]   This new principle, this new value says
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.500]   that one should not be self-centered.
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:48.500]   But looking after other people, especially parents.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.300]   Because the parents have legitimate needs.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:15:56.140]   And one has to give resources, offer resources
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:00.140]   to fulfill it, to honor, to make it heavy,
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:03.620]   to make it honorable, so that you will live long
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.900]   in the land.
[00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:08.060]   Now you is not singular, you is plural.
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:13.020]   It's talking about a nation, talking about a people,
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:14.860]   a community as a whole.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.980]   So you can live long, you can continue longer
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.920]   from generation to generation in the land,
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.580]   so that you, your community, in this case,
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.300]   the Israelite community, their society,
[00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:30.980]   if they look after one another,
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.540]   if they take care of one another,
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:34.380]   they are not self-centered community,
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:36.580]   they always look after one another,
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:37.860]   care for one another.
[00:16:37.860 --> 00:16:39.780]   Their community will continue.
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.100]   Their community life will continue, enjoy longevity.
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:48.260]   That is the essence of the principle.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:52.280]   Number six, you shall not murder.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:54.000]   You shall not murder.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:57.600]   Now this is a great translation, you shall not murder,
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.920]   because the older translation in English
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.560]   is thou shall not kill.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:06.840]   Right, the Hebrew word here translated murder correctly,
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.500]   means taking innocent life.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.540]   Thou shall not take innocent life.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.260]   So that's why modern translation try to correct that,
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:19.780]   or try to connote that kind of sense.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.460]   You know, it has to do with murder.
[00:17:22.460 --> 00:17:26.620]   Because the big deal about murder is that,
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.620]   because the action will destroy an image of God.
[00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.060]   Because every man and woman is created
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.480]   in the very image of God.
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.580]   If you take an innocent life, shed innocent blood,
[00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:45.580]   means that you assault God's image and God himself.
[00:17:45.580 --> 00:17:48.480]   As Pastor Chi has already preaching,
[00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:50.260]   or going through the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.320]   I'm sure you know what that means.
[00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.160]   It's not about outward behavior.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:58.960]   In fact, the entire document of Ten Commandments
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:03.960]   has to do less with outward behavior.
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:07.140]   It has to do with our inner heart,
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.400]   our motive, our heart orientation.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:12.540]   So to hate a person is the root of murder.
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.240]   That's why that is the essence
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:17.780]   that the principle is trying to lay out.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:22.620]   The ten words have the inner, your heart orientation in mind.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.000]   They address our motive, our heart.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.380]   So we're called in this principle
[00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:31.640]   to treat other people with compassion, instead of hatred.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:37.980]   Principle number seven, thou shall not commit adultery.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.420]   Now in ancient Egypt, polygamy and adultery
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:45.380]   were very common and it's very much so
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:48.060]   in the patriarchal society,
[00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:53.060]   because the men would treat women as property and objects.
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:55.900]   Here you shall not commit adultery.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.940]   Again, the heart orientation,
[00:18:57.940 --> 00:19:02.220]   it's not so much like I don't do certain things.
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:03.860]   So I keep the commandment.
[00:19:03.860 --> 00:19:08.860]   The essence has to do with our orientation to do something,
[00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.300]   do our best to protect the family of other people,
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:17.300]   to protect the dignity of other people, including women.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.820]   Again, in the Sermon on the Mount,
[00:19:19.820 --> 00:19:24.540]   Jesus also talks about the spirit of the law,
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:29.300]   the commandment, has to do with ungodly, lustful desires
[00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:31.280]   that try to objectify other people
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.460]   and use other people to satisfy our own desire.
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:37.940]   So that is the essence of this principle.
[00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:40.980]   Again, again and again, we see that the heart orientation
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:42.540]   is to protect other people.
[00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.420]   We are out here to protect other people,
[00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:47.180]   to care for other people, to protect their right
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:49.660]   and protect their dignity and honor.
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:54.560]   Number eight, you shall not steal.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:59.560]   Now this principle assumes the right to own something,
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:03.460]   your property, your asset, your money,
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:07.180]   but it also sets a boundary for our possessions,
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.980]   for our desire to acquire things.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:15.300]   Yes, we can own stuff, we can own asset,
[00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:17.420]   we can have our own property,
[00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:20.940]   but ultimately God is the owner of all.
[00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:25.940]   And we are simply stewards, managers.
[00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.040]   We're just managers.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.700]   God bless us with different resources,
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:33.460]   financial resources and properties and all that,
[00:20:33.460 --> 00:20:37.300]   but God wants us to be honest with our relationship with him
[00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:40.960]   and our relationship with our things.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.200]   And there is a boundary there.
[00:20:43.200 --> 00:20:44.540]   Now if you want to shed some light
[00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:47.020]   on how to apply this principle,
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.160]   we can always look for other scriptures
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.380]   as what we did for other principles,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:53.460]   like thou shall not murder
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.260]   or thou shall not commit adultery.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:56.340]   You look for New Testament,
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:20:58.140]   look for other Old Testament passages,
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.840]   how they apply it so that you know how to live it.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:05.340]   One of the passages in the Old Testament,
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.180]   actually it's the last book of the Old Testament,
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:10.300]   the book of Malachi,
[00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:16.260]   actually the prophet is teaching the people of God
[00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:23.160]   and say, there was a debate here, 3/8,
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.160]   where a man robbed God, yet you robbed me.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.320]   Now who said that?
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.760]   God said this.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:33.800]   God said to his people, will someone rob God?
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.520]   Yet you guys, pointing to the Israelite people,
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:38.760]   you robbed me.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.760]   But then you ask, there's a debate,
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:47.760]   and the people, we but by saying, how do we rob you, God?
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.800]   We never robbed you, this is our stuff.
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.680]   And God answer through the prophet Malachi
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:55.000]   in tithes and offerings.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.720]   In your offerings, you keep it only to yourself
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   because there is a portion of it that belong to God.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:06.680]   If you do that, it is robbery, it is stealing.
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:11.160]   Again, it sets a healthy boundary for our possessions
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   so that we are not so absorbed by our materials.
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:20.740]   Materialism is not divine principle,
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:24.700]   but faithful stewardship is.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:28.660]   And that's what this principle is all about, principle eight.
[00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:33.120]   Principle nine, you shall not give false testimony
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:34.540]   against your neighbor.
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:39.560]   Now so often we read the service meaning of this verse,
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.160]   this principle, principle number nine,
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.040]   and it often has to do with, okay, don't lie, okay?
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:46.460]   You gotta tell the truth.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:51.000]   But you have to pick on the terms here.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   It has to do with the context of legal testimony
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.900]   in the court.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.400]   And in the ancient society, only the men
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.360]   have the social status and social power
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:07.000]   to be called upon by the court to give a legal testimony
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.360]   when a case is being processed, right?
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:11.580]   When someone is being prosecuted.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.260]   And in Israel, a man may be called to give evidence
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:16.780]   in a legal proceeding.
[00:23:16.780 --> 00:23:21.120]   So the principle says that you have to tell nothing
[00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:21.960]   but the truth.
[00:23:21.960 --> 00:23:26.840]   A false testimony, therefore, is an abuse of your power.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:32.440]   If you tell or you give a false testimony,
[00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:36.480]   you are engaging in character assassination.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:39.060]   You are trying to assassinate someone,
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:42.960]   someone who may not be guilty.
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   And here, the essence, it has to do with the use of power,
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:52.080]   use of our social status and our social means.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.920]   And the essence is to protect and defend
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:56.260]   your neighbor's character.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:00.020]   You shall not give a false testimony.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:04.100]   You should protect the other person's integrity.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:09.940]   Now, all of these principles, we come to number nine,
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.940]   all of them has a nature of revealing God's character.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.780]   So you take this principle and you read it,
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:20.740]   and you have to think about why this principle
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:24.780]   matter to God, because that has to do
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:26.220]   with the character of God.
[00:24:26.220 --> 00:24:29.480]   And here, number nine reveals the character of God
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:31.020]   being truthful.
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.860]   God is a God of truth.
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.540]   God is a God of justice.
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:41.900]   So it matters to him when your neighbor is being accused
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:45.260]   without someone who defend for him, right?
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.780]   So thou shall not give a false testimony
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.020]   against your neighbor in a court.
[00:24:52.020 --> 00:24:53.900]   You don't abuse your power.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:56.300]   You use your power, however, to protect
[00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:58.420]   and defend other people.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.700]   Again, from principle number one to nine,
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:06.700]   the orientation has to do with serving other people.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.940]   Protecting other people, uplifting other people.
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:14.700]   So you protect me and I protect you, right?
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.980]   We keep one another accountable,
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:21.060]   and we love one another in the covenant.
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:25.320]   Number 10, that's the last one.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.460]   Now, this is interesting one.
[00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.300]   It says you shall not covet your neighbor's house.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:33.680]   You shall not covet your neighbor's wife,
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:37.720]   men's servant, male servant, ox, donkey, the property,
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:40.360]   the stuff that your neighbor has,
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.940]   anything that belongs to your neighbor.
[00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.540]   Now again, in ancient Israel,
[00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:48.660]   when someone cannot pay a loan
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:53.140]   or because of disaster or because of sickness,
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.100]   he cannot pay a debt,
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.020]   the landlord has the power to take away
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:00.180]   pretty much everything.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.000]   So the rich will become richer,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:07.440]   and the poor can easily become poorer.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:13.480]   And this principle has to do with drawing boundaries.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.720]   Thou shall not covet.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:18.940]   Those things do not belong to you,
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:21.160]   and you shall not touch it.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.520]   So this commandment is kind of unique
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:30.720]   because it has nothing to do with our behavior, right?
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:33.500]   How can you enforce this?
[00:26:33.500 --> 00:26:35.860]   There's no way you can enforce this, right?
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.000]   Because your heart is coveting something.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   It's right here inside.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.980]   Nobody can seize it, right?
[00:26:42.980 --> 00:26:45.700]   Nobody can see it, and nobody can detect it
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.400]   until you do something, make your action reality.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   Coveting is your heart condition.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.280]   This commandment is unique.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.360]   You cannot enforce it.
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:03.360]   It go right into, straight to the heart of the matter.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.280]   It has to do with our greed.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:12.460]   Set boundary for our desire, our desire to possess,
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.180]   our desires to have more.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:18.560]   Now, the heart of the commandment, number 10,
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.600]   is contentment, right?
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:25.200]   You should be content with what you have.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:28.720]   You should be thankful for what you have
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.960]   instead of all day long you trying to seek to
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:36.600]   increase your wealth, even at the expense of other people.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:40.200]   Now, as you can see, all 10 commandments,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:43.760]   all 10 principles are not some kind of
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.060]   self-improvement moral code.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.800]   It is, however, a moral vision, right?
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:56.800]   You see, if every Israelite will take these principle
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:01.020]   and apply them in their daily life,
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:07.480]   what kind of society will it become?
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.320]   It will become a society that would love God.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:13.720]   It will be a community that would take care of one another.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.500]   Everyone is not taking care of themselves, not selfish.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.960]   It's not self-centered, but other-centered.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.040]   You come to the community,
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:24.040]   come to the community of people of God.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:28.060]   We seek to love God, right?
[00:28:28.060 --> 00:28:31.240]   Protect God's right to be worshiped.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.320]   And then love other people with all our hearts
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:37.860]   and love our neighbors as ourselves.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:42.240]   The 10 words actually challenge the people
[00:28:42.240 --> 00:28:47.240]   to use their power and we orient their resources
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.320]   toward other people, to serve other people.
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:57.500]   The direct audience of the 10 words are actually male,
[00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:02.760]   father, because they have sons and daughters.
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:05.460]   They are married.
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:08.960]   You shall not commit adultery.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.820]   They are pretty well-off because they are resourceful.
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:14.800]   Their parents are aging.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.640]   In this document, 10 commandments,
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:20.480]   if you read it carefully and critically,
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.080]   the direct audience, of course it applies
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.340]   to every person of God,
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:32.340]   every people of God, and every Israelite is applicable.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.200]   However, the direct audience,
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.360]   the first audience of the 10 words, the 10 commandments,
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.200]   are actually males, fathers, married people,
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:44.800]   and pretty well-off.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:48.320]   In today's term, probably middle-aged men,
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:54.020]   middle-aged men and being kind of successful,
[00:29:54.020 --> 00:29:59.340]   stable in our career, in our family life,
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.560]   in terms of our property,
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:05.760]   in terms of our social status,
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:07.540]   everything is pretty stable.
[00:30:07.540 --> 00:30:12.000]   These 10 words are actually addressing
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:13.700]   directly to these people.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.280]   In a way, it's addressing to all of us.
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:21.060]   We are all resourceful in our own ways.
[00:30:21.060 --> 00:30:27.360]   And we are blessed by God.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.120]   And the 10 principles are a reorientation
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.340]   of our value system.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.040]   When we come to God, when we come to know Him
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:39.760]   and follow Jesus, everything in our life,
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:42.580]   our time, our schedule, our resources,
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:47.500]   everything will be reconfigured, reconfigured.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.240]   I would like to use the analogy
[00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:54.920]   of what it means to come to Christ.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.420]   The analogy is kind of like, when you come to Christ,
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:01.420]   your operation system is different.
[00:31:01.420 --> 00:31:05.440]   Your operation system is totally different.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:09.520]   The value system is different.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:11.460]   The orientation is totally different.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:15.560]   You cannot use the old operation system to run your life.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.760]   You use the new one.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:21.080]   And here, the 10 words are the new kind of
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:24.040]   operation system for our lives.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:26.560]   We protect God's right to be worshiped.
[00:31:26.560 --> 00:31:28.880]   Only one God, no idol.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:31.280]   Sabbath, keep it holy.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.920]   We are called to reorient our heart
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:37.800]   to protect other people and to lift up other people
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.600]   with compassion and with care.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.640]   It is no wonder in the Israelite society,
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:47.040]   if you flip the pages of the Old Testament,
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.440]   especially the first five books of Moses,
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.360]   the what we call the Torah,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:56.360]   you don't find police in the Torah.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.800]   You have priests, you have prophets,
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.680]   you have teachers, you have farmers.
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.920]   You have totally different, many different roles
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:09.200]   in the moral world of the Torah.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:11.120]   But you do not find
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:18.120]   Israelite police department in the Torah.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.520]   You know why?
[00:32:19.520 --> 00:32:23.760]   Because if everyone observe and take to heart
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.160]   these principles, there's no need for law enforcement, right?
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:31.240]   In such kind of communities, such kind of society,
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.200]   everyone is out to protect other people.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.240]   Everyone is out there to care for other people.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.920]   And actually, this is what Jesus said, right?
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:44.040]   If you sum up the entire Torah, he gave two statements.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.640]   Love God with all your heart and all your mind
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:47.740]   and all your strength.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:53.160]   And second of all, is love your neighbors as yourself.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.320]   Now, if we as a church,
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.200]   if we will take it to our heart,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   what kind of community, what kind of fellowship can we build?
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:10.380]   It's not just we come here and consume something.
[00:33:10.380 --> 00:33:14.000]   We take something and we leave.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.040]   If we come here and to contribute,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.760]   to pray for other people, to care for other people,
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:22.880]   to love your neighbors, love your brothers and sisters
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:25.800]   as yourself and love God with all your heart
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.600]   and all your strength, what kind of fellowship?
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:34.160]   It will be a community pleasing to God, right?
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:35.680]   It will be a community totally different
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.640]   from all other communities and clubs out there,
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:41.160]   all other social associations out there
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:44.120]   because they're always born by their own common interest
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.120]   or by their own common benefit.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:53.000]   But the church, the people of God are called to be different.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:58.520]   Other-centered, love others,
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:00.360]   pray for others and care for others.
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.440]   And that's why in our weekly update,
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.760]   I have been doing something new starting this year.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:13.280]   I wanna do some weekly update in video format
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.680]   and send it out to the social media group.
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:17.880]   And I'll do one in Chinese, in Cantonese,
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.120]   and one in English.
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:25.120]   And I always wanna encourage people to not only get up today
[00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.000]   what's going on in our church, but to pray for.
[00:34:28.720 --> 00:34:32.120]   Our church, to care for other people, right?
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:36.720]   We come to church and ask not just how are you,
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:41.040]   not how are you doing, yeah, how can I pray for you?
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.480]   How can I care for you?
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:45.920]   How can I give so that I can make your life more abundant
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   to bless you, right?
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:51.080]   So we can bless each other.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.120]   Let's all do that, right?
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   In this coming week, take one of this principles,
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:05.040]   one of this 10 principles and apply it in your home
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:10.200]   and now church, whatever that is, try to apply it.
[00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:11.600]   Take it to heart.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.200]   Remember to love God with all your heart and all your soul
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.520]   and all your might and love neighbors,
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:19.160]   your neighbors as yourself.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:21.080]   Let's all pray.
[00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:25.040]   Father, you call us to be a different people
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:29.280]   because you are such a great and unique God
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:35.200]   and you save us by grace out of land of slavery,
[00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:39.200]   out of sin and out of death.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:45.160]   And now we are being called to take up this new identity,
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:51.000]   to have the honor to be called the people of God,
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.800]   your church, your followers.
[00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.560]   Help us, God.
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:01.600]   Help us to have this principle transform us from inside out.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:07.240]   Address our, we all ran our heart desires
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:10.120]   so that we are not just self-seeking.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:14.800]   And you call us to seek you
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:18.920]   and to love other people as ourselves.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:21.360]   Build our church in love.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:26.000]   Build up our community so that we can fellowship together,
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.320]   care for one another and pray for one another.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:31.640]   In this coming week, as we take some of these principles
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:35.480]   to apply in our home, in our church, in our lives,
[00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:37.360]   I pray that you grant us grace
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.480]   so that we will live as your people
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:43.800]   to honor your name in Christ name pray.
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:48.440]   Well, thank you very much for coming in the snow
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:52.040]   and there was a refreshment prepared by Kelly.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   Again, she's out here to serve us and we should appreciate.
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:01.320]   And please stay for a little bit for a time of fellowship
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:05.880]   and to enjoy the refreshment together.
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:07.320]   All right, see you next week.
