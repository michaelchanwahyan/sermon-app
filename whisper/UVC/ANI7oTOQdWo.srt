 And I love that a lot of the songs we sang this morning were centered around the glory

130
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:52,000

131
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And I love that a lot of the songs we sang this morning were centered around the glory

132
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:04,000
 of God, the glory of Jesus.

133
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And I love that a lot of the songs we sang this morning were centered around the glory

134
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 of God, the glory of Jesus.

135
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 Most minds of fiction on the planet can't even begin to comprehend or understand how

136
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 great things are going to be, how glorious our future is, our hope in heaven is, where

137
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:34,000
 our bodies and minds are perfected, the heavens and the earth perfect, perfect justice, perfect

138
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 peace, perfect love, utter perfection.

139
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And according to Paul, all of this is utterly glorious.

140
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,000
 And therefore, our present sufferings are nothing but a mere drop in an infinite ocean

141
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 of glory and perfection.

142
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 And so that right there is why he can endure suffering and why he can say it's only temporary

143
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 and it's only light, because he knows something is coming that is so much greater.

144
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 And then Paul continues.

145
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 He doesn't stop there, although he could, but he continues to explain how great this

146
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 future glory is that allows us to persevere through suffering.

147
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 The next two verses, Paul says this.

148
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 "For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.

149
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,000
 For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of

150
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 the one who subjected it in hope."

151
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:42,000
 So, Paul continues by painting this picture, he gives us this analogy that all of creation,

152
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the hills, the oceans, everything is waiting

153
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 for this coming moment in anticipation.

154
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 And the reason that it's waiting is because it has been subjected to frustration, it says.

155
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 And the reason that all of creation, as good as it is, has been subjected to frustration,

156
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 we see all the way back in the beginning, in the opening chapters of Genesis, when God

157
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 subjected creation.

158
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 You see that when the fall of man happened, when sin entered the world through Adam and

159
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 what him and Eve did in the garden, God not only cursed Adam and Eve, but he also cursed

160
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 the ground.

161
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
 He cursed creation.

162
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And the reality that creation has been subjected, it's evident everywhere you look in a lot

163
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 of different ways.

164
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:38,000
 Like I said before, our bodies are always breaking down, but the earth itself, all of

165
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 creation is also breaking down and things are not right, they're not as they should

166
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
 be.

167
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 And so you can think in creation, what examples of this do we see in nature?

168
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 Earthquakes and tsunamis that destroy so much.

169
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:58,000
 Forest fires and droughts where you have whole nations burning for days, weeks on end.

170
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:03,000
 Those things, we call them natural disasters, but they're not really natural.

171
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
 That's not the original way God created the earth.

172
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 That came when sin came, when God subjected the world.

173
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
 You can also see this, if any of you guys in here are like into physics, maybe you're

174
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,000
 a little bit nerdy like me, you know about the second law of thermodynamics?

175
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,000
 Anybody know what I'm talking about?

176
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 Okay, okay, I'll break it down for you guys, I'll break it down for you guys, okay?

177
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:34,000
 So the second law of thermodynamics, simply put is that everything is winding down.

178
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 Everything is going from a state of order to disorder.

179
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 So things are always breaking down.

180
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 As soon as you buy a car, you drive it off the lot, immediately loses its value.

181
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 You buy a house, over time it breaks down, the pipes, they're leaky, the roof needs

182
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 to be replaced, everything is always breaking down.

183
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:00,000
 And this is true even in our own lives, I'll give you guys a little bit of an example

184
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,000
 for myself, I'll be honest.

185
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,000
 As the years go by and I look back at pictures of myself from college or from high school,

186
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 I'll always ask my wife, Kiamia, just be honest with me, Kiamia, you know, look, is

187
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 my hairline falling back, okay?

188
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,000
 I have to wonder, because everything is winding down, eventually all these beautiful locks

189
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 will be gone.

190
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 My dad is bald, my grandpa's bald, it's coming for me one day.

191
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 That's just the reality, and it's goofy, it's kind of silly, but it's true.

192
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 Everything in creation is winding down.

193
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:38,000
 But even in this frustration, there is a hope.

194
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 Even for creation, there is a hope.

195
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,000
 And so what is that hope?

196
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Paul explains in the next verse.

197
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:52,000
 That the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into

198
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 the freedom and glory of the children of God.

199
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And so this hope, even for creation, is the emancipation of all creation from the bondage

200
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
 to corruption.

201
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,000
 That there is a certain glory that all of creation, like the children of God, will freely

202
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 receive when God makes all things new.

203
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 And it is this beautiful new creation that you can see in Revelation chapter 21, chapter

204
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 22, when the universe will no longer trend in the direction of death, disease, and decay.

205
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 There will be no more disorder.

206
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
 All things will be restored to perfect order.

207
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:38,000
 And this future is so great that Paul gives us this picture of all creation waiting, anticipating

208
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:44,000
 to see what is brought about when that glorious future comes to fruition.

209
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
 And again, Paul just continues building upon this picture, building this metaphor to underscore

210
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 the greatness of the glory to come.

211
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,000
 And I want to explain here the reason that Paul is doing this.

212
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 He's explaining how great it is and the glory to come and that creation is growing.

213
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 And because this is all building into that very first point of how we can deal with our

214
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 suffering is by looking to a future hope.

215
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 So I want you guys to kind of get a sense of this weight of the future glory, how awesome

216
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 it is.

217
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,000
 Paul really, really goes to great lengths to get his readers to understand how great

218
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,000
 it's going to be because that will help us deal with suffering.

219
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 And so he says in verse 22 and 23, "We know that the whole creation has been groaning as

220
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.

221
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 Not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit grown inwardly

222
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 as we wait eagerly for the adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies."

223
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 So Paul gives us this, and I think this is like the perfect metaphor for what he's teaching

224
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,000
 here about suffering, is the metaphor of childbirth.

225
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:58,000
 And as I mentioned before, my wife, 38 weeks pregnant, we've been doing these childbirth

226
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 education classes once a week.

227
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And we go to the class, and we have to learn how to prepare, what labor is like, how to

228
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 get ready, make sure your bag is packed, make sure you have the car seat in the car.

229
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:16,000
 And one of the things that I've had to watch is childbirth videos.

230
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,000
 And, okay, if there's any moms, fathers in here, even if you're not a mom or a father,

231
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 you know a mom, okay?

232
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 And so there's just something about childbirth that if I were to describe it, I would say

233
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 that it's not a quiet situation.

234
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 It's not the most peaceful, serene, quiet environment.

235
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
 It's kind of a noisy thing.

236
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 And a lot of these videos I've seen, these women when they're in labor, they're just

237
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 groaning is the best word you can say.

238
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 They're not really saying words.

239
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
 They're just groaning in anticipation.

240
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 And I was thinking that maybe I would give you an example, but I'm not going to do that.

241
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 I'm not going to, you know, that's loud.

242
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
 But you get the idea.

243
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 It's just this groaning and it's wordless, but they're just longing and waiting for this

244
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 baby to come into the world.

245
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:10,000
 And so we can learn from childbirth some beautiful truths about our own suffering.

246
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 And months and months of pain and sickness and suffering, it teaches us something that's

247
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
 true for everyone.

248
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 And so when we think about childbirth, we think about this beautiful way in which God

249
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:26,000
 has designed us to bring life into the world.

250
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 There's three things we can learn from this about our own suffering.

251
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 The first is that it is absolutely temporary.

252
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 So for all the moms out there, could you imagine living in a world where you did not know that

253
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 nine months was like the limit?

254
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 Imagine living in a world where you could be pregnant for nine months, but you could

255
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 also be pregnant for nine years, and you just didn't know.

256
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,000
 Okay?

257
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 You just did not know when it was going to come to an end.

258
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
 Imagine how hard that would be.

259
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Okay?

260
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 And as tough as those nine months are, you always have this thought in the back of your

261
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 head, "Okay, 40 weeks.

262
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 Okay, if I can get to 40 weeks, okay, I can handle it.

263
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 I got two weeks left.

264
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 I got one week left.

265
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,000
 I can do this."

266
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 Right?

267
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And so the fact that the suffering is temporary, it gives you some peace as you bear it.

268
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 It gives you some hope and some encouragement.

269
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 And the second thing is that suffering is absolutely purposeful.

270
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:28,000
 When a woman is pregnant, all that, the sickness and the aching and the pains, it's not pointless.

271
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 All of it is a part of God's beautiful process of bringing life into this world.

272
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
 And so all of that pain is purposeful.

273
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:42,000
 And so it just, it allows you to suffer it and bear it a little more because you know

274
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 God is using all of this for a beautiful and glorious purpose.

275
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
 And that none of my suffering is purposeless.

276
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:55,000
 And the last thing, and I think the most beautiful thing, is that all that suffering is absolutely

277
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 worth it.

278
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,000
 I've talked to so many moms over the past few months, getting advice and asking them

279
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,000
 about their experience.

280
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:05,000
 And the one thing they'll always tell me, well, two things.

281
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:09,000
 The first thing, they'll always agree that it is difficult, that it is not easy.

282
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:14,000
 But the second thing they always say is that that moment when they first saw their little

283
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:20,000
 baby girl, or they first held their baby boy to their chest, all the pain, all the suffering,

284
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,000
 it just melts away.

285
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
 It becomes one of the happiest moments of their life.

286
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 And the pain is replaced with pure joy, right?

287
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,000
 And so all of that suffering is absolutely worth it.

288
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 And so this is true in childbearing, but it's also true in creation.

289
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,000
 And it's true for us that suffering in this fallen world is only temporary and it's not

290
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:47,000
 purposeless, but it will be absolutely worth it.

291
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,000
 And so we can know confidently that this future day of glory is coming, not just for creation,

292
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,000
 but for us also.

293
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
 And we can know that, Paul says, because God has given us a guarantee.

294
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:04,000
 He has given us a down payment, and that's the Holy Spirit.

295
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 He says that the Holy Spirit is the first fruits.

296
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 And this is a concept we get from Scripture where when the produce came, when it was time

297
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:17,000
 for the harvest, the Israelites would give a first fruit offering to God, knowing that

298
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 He would make sure that their crops came in again during the next harvest and they had

299
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,000
 enough food to eat.

300
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 And so that first fruit offering, it was like this trusting in God, this guarantee of what

301
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,000
 is to come.

302
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 And so the Holy Spirit serves a similar purpose for us.

303
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
 He is a guaranteed down payment.

304
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,000
 He is a promised portion of a coming fullness.

305
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
 And again, that fullness, that glory, that future hope allows us to persevere when we

306
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
 suffer in this life.

307
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 Paul continues, verse 24 and 25, "For in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen

308
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
 is no hope at all.

309
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
 Who hopes for what they already have?

310
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
 But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently."

311
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 So we're hoping, we're waiting for this future glory.

312
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,000
 We may not have it yet.

313
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:13,000
 We may not see it yet, but we know it's coming and we have the confident assurance that it

314
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
 will come.

315
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,000
 And I want to make a point to explain that when you read in the Bible about hope, that

316
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:25,000
 biblical hope, true hope, as Paul is talking about here, it is not just like a regular

317
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 sense of hope.

318
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,000
 It's not like a kid who writes a Christmas letter and is hoping to get his favorite toy

319
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 and he might get it, but he might not.

320
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
 That's not the kind of hope we have.

321
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,000
 We have a hope that is grounded in the promises of God, a God who doesn't lie, who doesn't

322
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,000
 change his mind.

323
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
 And so we have a hope that is assured, that we know will come to pass.

324
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,000
 It's a confident assurance that we have.

325
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,000
 And it's because of that confident assurance of the future glory to come that we can eagerly

326
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:59,000
 and patiently wait through our sufferings.

327
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 So, all of that metaphor and analogy and word picture Paul gives us leads us to our first

328
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,000
 answer, our first answer to the question of suffering, how can we deal with suffering?

329
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:18,000
 It is by knowing and believing in this future hope to come, this glory that's unimaginable,

330
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,000
 that outweighs any suffering you can experience in this life.

331
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 That coming glory is so great we can bear under any suffering and difficult circumstances

332
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,000
 in this life.

333
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:36,000
 But Paul continues, and we're going to see now a second reason how we can endure suffering

334
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,000
 in this life.

335
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 Verses 26 to 27 says, "In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.

336
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through

337
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,000
 wordless groans.

338
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,000
 And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes

339
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
 for God's people in accordance with the will of God."

340
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 And the beautiful thing about this is that we do not suffer alone.

341
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 A lot of people have this, a lot of people in the world who reject the idea of God.

342
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 They say things like, "I just can't believe in a God who allows suffering.

343
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:18,000
 I can't believe in a God who just sits back and does nothing while people suffer."

344
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 And the truth is, I would not believe in that kind of God either, because that is not the

345
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,000
 kind of God we have.

346
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,000
 We have a God who, one, not only entered into the world to suffer as the world suffers,

347
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,000
 but we have a God who in the Holy Spirit is with us in our weakness, in the midst of our

348
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 suffering, so that we don't have to be alone.

349
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,000
 And even when we don't know why we suffer, even when we don't know quite what to pray

350
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:49,000
 for or how to respond to suffering, Paul says that the Holy Spirit knows what we need, and

351
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:54,000
 the Holy Spirit is going to God the Father, interceding on our behalf, because on one

352
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 hand, the Holy Spirit who's inside of us knows exactly what we need.

353
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,000
 On the other hand, the Holy Spirit knows the mind of God, and He knows the exact will of

354
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,000
 God, so we can be confident that even when we're in a moment of weakness and we don't

355
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:14,000
 know what to say to God, how to pray, what to do, the Holy Spirit who knows us and knows

356
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,000
 the Father's will goes to God on our behalf.

357
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:23,000
 And those things that we need, those requests taken to God, in His will, will be done.

358
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,000
 And so we have that confidence that God is with us, God is always working about His will,

359
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 and that's exactly what we need.

360
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:36,000
 A question that can arise that Paul's going to answer in this next verse, though, is what

361
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
 exactly is the will of God?

362
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
 If the Holy Spirit, when we don't know what to pray for, is interceding, working for us

363
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:48,000
 to achieve the will of God, what exactly is the will of God for us in the midst of our

364
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 suffering?

365
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,000
 Paul says in verse 28, "And we know that in all things, God works for the good of those

366
00:28:55,000 --> 00:29:01,000
 who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose."

367
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
 So God's will is our good.

368
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:10,000
 God is working all things out for our good.

369
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 And that can be difficult to imagine.

370
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
 Just think about it.

371
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 Do we truly believe that God is working all things for our good, that God is working cancers,

372
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
 criticism, rejection for our good?

373
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
 Just as much as He is working beautiful things, pleasurable, amazing things for our good,

374
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 God is working all things for our good.

375
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:41,000
 And therefore, even when we suffer, our suffering is not meaningless.

376
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:46,000
 It is not purposeless, because God is even using suffering for our good.

377
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:51,000
 And I think that's such a beautiful truth, that our suffering is not meaningless and

378
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:57,000
 is not purposeless, because take a second and think about a world in which there is

379
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 no God.

380
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And for many people on the planet, this is the world that they think they live in, a

381
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,000
 world with no God, no Creator, no ultimate meaning, no ultimate purpose, no right or

382
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,000
 wrong.

383
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 In that kind of a world, our suffering is totally meaningless.

384
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,000
 In that kind of a world, we're just creation, we're just accidents, not even created.

385
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:25,000
 That sometime in the past, there was just something that happened in the midst of nothingness

386
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
 and created the world, but there's no intended order or no design.

387
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,000
 And so we ultimately have no purpose, we have no Creator.

388
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,000
 And so when we suffer, we just suffer.

389
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
 It's not good, it's not bad, it just is what it is.

390
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 That kind of life is depressing and it's sad, but that is not the reality we have, because

391
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:49,000
 we do know there is a God in heaven, and He's sovereign, and He rules and reigns over

392
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
 everything and uses all things for our good.

393
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 So even when we suffer, there's a meaning, there's a purpose behind it, and we can be

394
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
 comforted because we know that meaning and purpose is for our good.

395
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
 One thing I do want to say about this verse, because it's a very popular verse, and it's

396
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
 easy to pull this verse out of its context, and it's easy to try to spin this verse into

397
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 a way Paul did not intend.

398
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
 So what Paul is not saying is that God is going to do whatever you think is good, that

399
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 God is going to give you whatever you think is good, and that if you think money and riches

400
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 and car and all success and every avenue of life is what's going to happen, that's not

401
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,000
 what Paul is saying, because Paul is somebody, again, he knew what it was like to suffer.

402
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:36,000
 He knew what it was like to be rejected, to be despised, to be hated, to be hungry, but

403
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 that's not because Paul was outside of God's will or disobedient to God.

404
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 He was obedient to God and still experienced those things.

405
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,000
 The truth of what God really wants for us, and that's not to say that He doesn't ever

406
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
 want us to have nice things and have good things.

407
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
 There are times when He does, but the ultimate good that God is working out, and what Paul

408
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,000
 is talking about here, is not exactly what the world may define good to be.

409
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
 Paul is going to define what that ultimate good is.

410
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,000
 In the very next verse, he says this, "For those God foreknew, He also predestined to

411
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:18,000
 be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers

412
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
 and sisters.

413
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,000
 And those He predestined, He also called.

414
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
 Those He called, He also justified.

415
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,000
 Those He justified, He also glorified."

416
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,000
 So you can see what Paul is saying here is that our ultimate good is to be conformed

417
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,000
 to Christ, is to become like Jesus Christ.

418
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:42,000
 That is the ultimate good that God always desires in every situation, and God uses everything,

419
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,000
 all things, every situation to that end, to make us like Jesus Christ.

420
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,000
 That is the ultimate goal of our lives, as followers of Jesus Christ, is not to get rich,

421
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:58,000
 is not to be the most popular, or the most well-liked and respected, but is to be like

422
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
 Jesus Christ.

423
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,000
 No matter what circumstances we find ourselves in, we should long to be like Christ, to think

424
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
 like Christ, to love like Christ.

425
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:12,000
 That is what God wants for our lives.

426
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,000
 And we see that not only do these verses reveal what God is working all things for in our

427
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:22,000
 lives, but it also reminds us the reason that we can be confident of these things, that

428
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,000
 we can be absolutely assured that God's got us, is because in this verse, in this passage,

429
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,000
 we see what, for generations, for centuries, the church has celebrated, and it's often

430
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,000
 called the golden chain of salvation.

431
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:46,000
 And it's the reason that we can be confident that God has us, and gives us assurance that

432
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:51,000
 he's holding us, he's keeping us safe, like an anchor who holds a boat down.

433
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 God has this, because Paul says, "Those whom God foreknew, he predestined to be conformed

434
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
 to the image of his Son.

435
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
 And those he predestined, he called.

436
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
 Those he called, he justified.

437
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
 Those he justified, he glorified."

438
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,000
 And Paul is writing these verbs here, called, predestined, justified, glorified.

439
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,000
 And even though that glory we know is a future glory, Paul's writing about these things as

440
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:24,000
 if they've already happened, as if it's a present reality that we already are glorified.

441
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:30,000
 And what Paul is doing is telling these readers that if you have been predestined by God,

442
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:35,000
 foreknown by God, which doesn't mean that he just knew of you, which is true of everyone.

443
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,000
 God knows everything, and therefore, from the beginning of time, God knew everyone.

444
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,000
 But those who God foreknew, he loved in a special way.

445
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
 He knew in a special, intimate way.

446
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
 And those who he foreknew, he predestined.

447
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,000
 Those he predestined, he called.

448
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,000
 Those he called, he justified.

449
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
 Those he justified, he glorified.

450
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
 That's a confident thing, that if you have been foreknown by God, it's already a done deal.

451
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:04,000
 You're glorified by God, as if it's already happened.

452
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,000
 And so that is how we can be so confident of these things.

453
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:13,000
 Even when we suffer, even when it seems like things are not going right, this right here

454
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,000
 gives us so much hope.

455
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,000
 And so we see here that second reason that we can suffer.

456
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
 One is because there's a future glory coming that is so great, no amount of suffering can

457
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
 even begin to compare.

458
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
 And number two is that we are never alone in our suffering.

459
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
 God's always with us.

460
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,000
 And he has been before the world was even created.

461
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:43,000
 And now the third reason we see here of why we can endure this suffering is because none

462
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
 of our suffering is meaningless.

463
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,000
 It all has a reason.

464
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
 It all has a purpose.

465
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:52,000
 And so those are three things that are just so encouraging in the midst of our suffering.

466
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,000
 God's working all things for our good, so our suffering, it is not meaningless.

467
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,000
 There's a reason behind it that is good for us, that's great for us.

468
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
 And that truth that many worldviews, many philosophies and religions don't have this

469
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:12,000
 hope in the midst of suffering that we have.

470
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,000
 Those three things that can keep us grounded in the midst of our suffering.

471
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,000
 And I think that there's a beautiful example of this all the way as far back as, again,

472
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,000
 the book of Genesis and the life of Joseph.

473
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:31,000
 We see these truths at play when Joseph, loved by his father but hated by his brothers, was

474
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:38,000
 betrayed, thrown into a pit, sold into slavery, goes into the land of Egypt, and then he's

475
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
 harassed and falsely accused by his master's wife.

476
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
 Then he's put in jail, and he's left in jail, and he helps these two guys who were formerly

477
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,000
 working in the house of Pharaoh.

478
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:52,000
 He helps one of them get back into Pharaoh's good graces.

479
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,000
 And Joseph tells this cupbearer of Pharaoh, "When you get back into Pharaoh's household,

480
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
 tell him about me so that I can get out."

481
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
 And when the man gets back into Pharaoh's household, he forgets about Joseph.

482
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:09,000
 And Joseph spends even more time falsely accused, wrongly imprisoned.

483
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:13,000
 All of this, through all this suffering, we see God is still with Joseph.

484
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,000
 God never leaves Joseph.

485
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,000
 God never lets Joseph suffer for no reason.

486
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,000
 We start to see that God is working in the midst of all this because the time comes when

487
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,000
 Joseph is called up.

488
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 He gets his chance.

489
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
 He goes before Pharaoh.

490
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
 He interprets Pharaoh's dream favorably.

491
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,000
 It comes to pass, and he gets elevated to the second most powerful position in Egypt,

492
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,000
 all because God was always working through his suffering.

493
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:47,000
 And a famine comes across all the land, and because Joseph, through God, saw it coming,

494
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,000
 he had stocked up grain and food.

495
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
 So when all the different peoples in the nations around Egypt have to come receive grain,

496
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,000
 his brothers, who set this whole thing in motion, throwing him in the pit, selling him into slavery,

497
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
 they come to him now to get help from him so they can live.

498
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
 And they don't really realize it's him.

499
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
 There's this kind of back and forth that occurs.

500
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:12,000
 But in the very end of this narrative, we see that he is kind of restored to them.

501
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 He accepts them.

502
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,000
 He reveals himself to them, to his father.

503
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
 There's joy.

504
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
 They're celebrating.

505
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,000
 But when their father, Jacob, dies, the brothers get scared, because now they think that Joseph

506
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,000
 is going to get revenge.

507
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:26,000
 There's no one to stop him.

508
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,000
 But when they come to him in fear, trembling, he tells them not to fear.

509
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,000
 And he gives this beautiful verse, I think sums up the story, the life of Joseph so perfectly,

510
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,000
 and it exemplifies what we're talking about in Romans chapter 8.

511
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,000
 Joseph tells them, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good, to accomplish

512
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:50,000
 what is now being done, the saving of many lives."

513
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
 So we see that God is sovereign over everything.

514
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:59,000
 And it's not that what his brothers intended for evil, God used for good, as if God had

515
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:05,000
 to create a plan B and scramble to figure out, "How can I turn this bad situation out for good?"

516
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,000
 What he says is that, "You intended to harm me.

517
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,000
 God intended it."

518
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:16,000
 So God was already sovereign over their decision, over their choices, using it for Joseph's good.

519
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
 That's exactly what Paul is bringing out in Romans chapter 8.

520
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,000
 That's the same thing God does for us.

521
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:30,000
 He's always working, he's always using all things, suffering included, for our good.

522
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:35,000
 So when we think about this beautiful truth, one, that God is using all things for our

523
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:39,000
 good, which means our suffering is never purposeless or meaningless.

524
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:45,000
 Two, the Holy Spirit is working on our behalf, always interceding, so that when we suffer,

525
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,000
 we're never alone.

526
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,000
 And three, when we suffer, we have on the other hand, this future glory that is so great,

527
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:56,000
 it makes all our suffering pale in comparison.

528
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
 Those three truths give us a new perspective on how to handle suffering in this life.

529
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:06,000
 And so when we suffer now, we don't need to ask the question, "Why me?

530
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:08,000
 Why am I suffering?

531
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
 How could I ever get through this?"

532
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,000
 We should ask ourselves, "What can I do now in my suffering with these beautiful truths,

533
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,000
 with what God has revealed?

534
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:23,000
 How can I apply them to my life to persevere through the suffering, or to encourage someone

535
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,000
 close to me who is also suffering?"

536
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,000
 So I want to leave you guys with three final questions and three final exhortations to

537
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:35,000
 take this word to heart, that we could all use it, be encouraged by it, and apply it

538
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
 in our lives to the glory of God.

539
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,000
 So, brothers and sisters, when you suffer, are you tempted to give up hope?

540
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:46,000
 Are you tempted to lose faith?

541
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
 Remember that your suffering is temporary.

542
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,000
 It will not last forever.

543
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,000
 It cannot last forever.

544
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,000
 And not only that, but the future glory to come, which will replace that suffering, is

545
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,000
 guaranteed to come, and it's so amazing.

546
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,000
 It's so great.

547
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,000
 It's perfect.

548
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
 It's glorious.

549
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:09,000
 And it totally outweighs any suffering you can face in this life.

550
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,000
 So look beyond your suffering.

551
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:18,000
 Fix your eyes on the glory that is to come, and keep your hope in that which is unseen.

552
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,000
 When you suffer, are you tempted to believe that you are alone, or that no one is there

553
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,000
 to help you?

554
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,000
 Are you inviting the Holy Spirit in the midst of your suffering and weakness to help you?

555
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:34,000
 Remember that even in your weakness, the Holy Spirit is there for you, interceding on your

556
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,000
 behalf, taking your needs to God, and the will of God will be done in your life.

557
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,000
 Rely on the Holy Spirit.

558
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:45,000
 Depend on His working in and through your weakness.

559
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,000
 Turn to Him when you suffer.

560
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:52,000
 And lastly, when you suffer, are you tempted to believe it's all for nothing?

561
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:58,000
 Do you truly believe that God works all things for your good, that your suffering is not

562
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,000
 meaningless?

563
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
 Remember that, as Paul says, the truth is that God does work all things for your good.

564
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:11,000
 For those who love God and have been called according to His purpose, and we saw that

565
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:15,000
 this purpose has been in play from before the foundation of time.

566
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:21,000
 And that's how you can be confident that God is and will work all things for your good.

567
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,000
 And this means that your suffering is never in vain.

568
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:31,000
 God's always working for you in eternal weight of future glory, even in the midst of your

569
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
 suffering.

570
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
 Know that your Heavenly Father is good.

571
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
 He's taking care of you.

572
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,000
 No matter what we go through in this life, God is there for us, and He's got us for all

573
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,000
 eternity.

574
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,000
 Trust in Him.

575
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
 Will you please pray with me?

576
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
 Heavenly Father, Lord our God, I just want to thank you.

577
00:42:53,000 --> 00:43:00,000
 Thank you that you have given us this perspective on suffering, that you have given us a future

578
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,000
 hope that we cannot even fully comprehend, but we know it is so great, so glorious.

579
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,000
 Any suffering we face in this life utterly pales in comparison.

580
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:18,000
 Thank you, God, that you do not leave us to suffer alone, but that you have given us your

581
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,000
 Holy Spirit who helps us in the midst of our weakness, who takes our request to our Father

582
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:30,000
 in Heaven, and that His will will be done in our life, that all things will be worked

583
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,000
 out for good.

584
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,000
 And we thank you, Father, that none of our suffering is meaningless, none of it is in

585
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:42,000
 vain or futile or purposeless, but that you are using it all for your good, which is our

586
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:43,000
 good.

587
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:48,000
 Help us, Father God, to in all things become more like Jesus Christ.

588
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,000
 Please take this word, hide it deep in our hearts so that when we suffer, we will know

589
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:57,000
 that we have hope, or when that someone near us is suffering, we will be able to share

590
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:59,000
 that hope with them.

591
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
 And please, Father God, put a burden in our hearts to take this good news, to take this

592
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,000
 gospel of hope to a world that desperately needs it, so that those who do not know about

593
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:15,000
 this hope, who don't know that there is purpose in all suffering, that all things can be worked

594
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
 for good, help us to take this gospel to them, Father God, that they would receive the blessings

595
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,000
 and the hope that is found in no other name than Jesus Christ.

596
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,000
 We thank you for this day.

597
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
 We thank you for this opportunity to be here to hear your word, Father God.

598
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:34,000
 Just pray that you would sanctify us by your word.

599
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,000
 And I ask all these things in Jesus' precious name.

600
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
 Amen.
