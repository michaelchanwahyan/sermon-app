1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 - Welcome everyone, and then Mark will take us further.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,880
 - Alright, thank you Kelly and Pastor J.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,520
 Welcome, good to see you.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,720
 And we're gonna pray for you at the end.

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:14,560
 Make sure we pray for Pastor J until he,

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,840
 I guess, you know, settle on a

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,560
 stable ministry in Korea, alright?

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,560
 So we're gonna pray for you and pray for your family.

9
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,320
 Alright, so why don't we take some time

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,640
 and say hi to your neighbor.

11
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:30,760
 You know, just wave your hands, you know, front and back.

12
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:31,600
 You know.

13
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:40,000
 We have been talking about the book of Revelation,

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,960
 the last book of the Bible, about end times,

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,120
 about the second coming of Jesus Christ.

16
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,040
 And before we go back to the book of Revelation,

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,360
 I think it would be a great idea to digress a little bit,

18
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,560
 you know, to study something outside of the book

19
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:59,560
 of Revelation to get some idea, some basic concept

20
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,200
 about what the end time is gonna be like.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,480
 So today, we're going to, not going to go to the book

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,920
 of Revelation today, but we're going to read

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,880
 and study Matthew 24.

24
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,640
 It is a famous passage, a famous well-known sermon

25
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,640
 given by Jesus called Oliver Discourse, Oliver's Sermon.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,360
 He gave this sermon on the top of Mount Olives

27
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
 facing Jerusalem.

28
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,480
 So we're gonna study a little bit, but as I said before,

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,560
 as I told you before, remember when you read the Bible,

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:42,800
 whatever passage you're reading, you need to understand

31
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,200
 the context, right?

32
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:47,160
 What goes before and what goes after.

33
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:52,160
 Matthew 24, if you go back a few chapter before Matthew 24

34
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:57,320
 to Matthew 21, it is the triumphant entry of Jesus Christ.

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:02,040
 He rise the donkey and enter the capital city

36
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,040
 of the Jewish nation.

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,800
 That was the Palm Sunday, so-called,

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,780
 the triumphant entry into Jerusalem.

39
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,680
 You know, Palm Sunday is coming up, right, next month,

40
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,480
 right, this Sunday before Easter Sunday is Palm Sunday.

41
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,320
 And then after Jesus enters Jerusalem,

42
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,200
 he cleansed the temple, right?

43
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,000
 It was a pretty, you know, angry Jesus, right?

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,360
 Not the typical gentle, soft-spoken Jesus

45
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,360
 that the culture has us to believe.

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,840
 But he cleansed the Jewish temple,

47
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,860
 and because of the corruption there,

48
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,160
 he turned the table and all that.

49
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,160
 And then he enter, Jesus enters into a series

50
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:49,040
 of controversies, a series of arguments,

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,160
 very heated debate with the religious authorities

52
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,080
 in Jerusalem, with the Pharisees and with the scribes

53
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,240
 and, you know, St. Joseph and all those people.

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:04,240
 So it's a very heated debate if you read Matthew 22 and 23.

55
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:08,800
 And then come to our passage today,

56
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,480
 Matthew 24, all of the discourse.

57
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,240
 So I want to remind you by going back

58
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,600
 a few chapters before 24,

59
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:22,020
 this is the last week of Jesus' life on earth,

60
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,160
 the last week.

61
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,440
 Remember Palm Sunday, and then cleansing the temple,

62
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,320
 couple of days debating and having controversies

63
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,000
 with the religious authorities in Jerusalem,

64
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,360
 and then come to Matthew 24, the all of the discourse,

65
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,600
 and Jesus is talking about his second coming.

66
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,960
 This is the last week of Jesus' life on earth.

67
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:49,960
 So let's look at this sort of a last hour sermon

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,540
 given by Jesus to his disciples.

69
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:57,760
 That is the context here.

70
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:02,320
 That is whatever being recorded in these chapters

71
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,240
 and following happened in the very last week,

72
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,000
 the last few days of Jesus' life on earth.

73
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,320
 And then he was crucified on the cross,

74
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,800
 died for our sins, and then on the third day,

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,400
 the next Sunday, he rose from the dead.

76
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,220
 All right?

77
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,920
 24, one.

78
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:24,640
 Jesus left the temple and was walking away

79
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,440
 when his disciples came up to him

80
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,160
 to call his attention to his buildings.

81
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:35,320
 Now this picture is taken on top of Mount of Olives.

82
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,440
 We are looking westward, as you can see,

83
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,480
 the old city of Jerusalem, and then beyond that,

84
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,320
 the high rise and the modern building,

85
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,400
 the modern Jerusalem, West Jerusalem, so-called.

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
 So this verse says,

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,700
 when they left the temple,

88
00:04:53,700 --> 00:05:00,820
 the disciples were astonished by the beautiful building,

89
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,800
 the magnificent building of the Jerusalem temple

90
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,640
 in Jesus' time.

91
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,640
 Of course, you cannot see it right now,

92
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,800
 but in this picture, you can see there's a rectangular

93
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,440
 platform, stone-built platform, it's still standing there.

94
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,320
 And this is what we call the Temple Mount.

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:24,320
 The Temple Mount equals to 25 American football fields,

96
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,200
 man-made, 2,000 years ago.

97
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,920
 So the foundation stone is still standing there,

98
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,580
 19 soccer fields.

99
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,820
 Can you see the corner on the left?

100
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,600
 All the way extend beyond this picture.

101
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
 25 football fields.

102
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,520
 I mean, it was a magnificent building.

103
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,360
 If you visit Israel with me,

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,200
 I'll bring you to the Western Wall Plaza,

105
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,280
 all right, as your best tour guide.

106
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,760
 I'll bring you to the so-called Waiting Wall.

107
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:01,600
 Now we usually call Western Wall Plaza.

108
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,320
 As you enter the plaza, it's an open-air synagogue.

109
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,320
 From the floor of the plaza,

110
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,080
 you count seven rows of stones.

111
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:14,520
 Seven rows of stone belong to 1st century,

112
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,200
 in times of Jesus.

113
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:19,660
 And above that, the blue arrow, later Middle Ages

114
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,340
 and beyond.

115
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,720
 So there are at least seven levels of stones

116
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,760
 are Herodian stones.

117
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:30,240
 This is kind of like a picture frame being dug out

118
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:33,080
 from natural stone, very beautiful.

119
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,160
 1st century still standing there after 2,000 years.

120
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,420
 In fact, there is a Western Wall tunnel

121
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:44,800
 beneath the Western Wall Plaza.

122
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,280
 You go down about 100 feet below the plaza,

123
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,440
 you can walk alongside the 1st century Western Wall,

124
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:57,920
 about 500 meter long.

125
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:00,760
 1600 feet, five city blocks.

126
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:07,780
 The biggest stone we find is 40 feet long

127
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:12,880
 and 13 feet wide and weight about 550 metric tons.

128
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:18,960
 That one stone in the yellow box there,

129
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,760
 I hope you can see it, there's the edge,

130
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,520
 and all the way to the lady taking picture there.

131
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,260
 One stone, one stone.

132
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,300
 500 to 600 metric tons.

133
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,280
 That is one stone.

134
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,440
 A male African elephant weighs about seven metric tons.

135
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,680
 So that one stone equals 78 elephants.

136
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:47,600
 How did the ancient people do that?

137
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:51,400
 How would they move the stone right there, right?

138
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:54,320
 It's a remarkable engineering work.

139
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,120
 That's why the disciples, they came from,

140
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:02,800
 if you remember, from the village of Upper Galilee,

141
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,260
 from simple villages.

142
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,920
 They came to the urban Jerusalem

143
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,240
 and they saw the Herodian Temple and they were astonished.

144
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,320
 Of course, Jesus had different reaction.

145
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,880
 Jesus said, "Do you see all these things,

146
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,600
 "the temple buildings and the retaining walls

147
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:26,040
 "and all the building and all the structure?

148
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,600
 "I tell you the truth.

149
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,960
 "Not one stone here will be left on another.

150
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,540
 "Everyone will be thrown down."

151
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:37,400
 Again, this picture is taken from the top of Mount Olives

152
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,440
 to our west, toward the old city of Jerusalem.

153
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,720
 The huge rectangular platform you can still see today,

154
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,880
 the Temple Mount, is an extraordinary claim that Jesus made.

155
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,880
 Jesus is talking about the destruction of Jerusalem

156
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,880
 and his temple in AD 70.

157
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:00,800
 About 40 years later, it did happen

158
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,560
 because the Roman armies came to the capital city

159
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,440
 and they stormed the city and burned the city

160
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,600
 and teared down almost every single one of the stones.

161
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,560
 Now, Matthew 24 is, with this background,

162
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,240
 is one of the passages that actually support

163
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:24,960
 the historical reliability of the words of Jesus.

164
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:29,120
 He spoke those words, Matthew 24, 40 years before AD 70,

165
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,720
 40 years before the historic destruction of Jerusalem.

166
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:39,320
 So, Matthew recorded the words of Jesus

167
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:43,840
 spoken before AD 70.

168
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,140
 It was a prophecy fulfilled.

169
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:53,360
 Now, some people will say, "This is not true

170
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,760
 "because it can be prophecy written after the event,

171
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,600
 "after the fact, after AD 70,

172
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,880
 "and the disciples, because they want to exalt Jesus

173
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,040
 "or they want to protect or defend Jesus,

174
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,440
 "so they made up a story."

175
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,360
 But this is not likely.

176
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,360
 Let me tell you why.

177
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,040
 This is historically not likely.

178
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,360
 Why?

179
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,520
 Because if Matthew 24 is prophecy written after the fact,

180
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:26,560
 then Matthew 24, as we read the passages,

181
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,880
 should be more precise.

182
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,040
 If it is prophecy written after the fact, after AD 70,

183
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,960
 it should be more precise because,

184
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,080
 as you can see, many of the stones

185
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,400
 were still left standing on others, right?

186
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,000
 If it's prophecy written after the fact,

187
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,240
 then if the disciples are trying to make up a story,

188
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,800
 then they probably won't put some of the words

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,800
 in the mouth of Jesus, right?

190
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,520
 If it's prophecy after the event, trying to prove Jesus,

191
00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:00,680
 they would have mentioned that the temple of Jerusalem

192
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:06,680
 was burned by fire, destroyed by fire,

193
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,760
 but none of those were in Matthew 24.

194
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:15,000
 So, as it stands, Matthew 24 is very likely historical.

195
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:22,000
 Words of Jesus spoken 40 years before AD 70,

196
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,080
 before the destruction of the temple.

197
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,760
 That is to say, Jesus did predict

198
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:32,520
 the destruction of the temple, and it did happen.

199
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:36,960
 Matthew, parallel passages of Matthew 24, Mark and Luke,

200
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,120
 faithfully reports the words of Jesus.

201
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,480
 And it came fulfilled.

202
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:46,980
 Now we're back to 24, we read verse three.

203
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:51,480
 As we go on, what is recorded here is that,

204
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,760
 as Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives,

205
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,000
 they exited Jerusalem and they climbed.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,880
 It's about 15 minutes walk from the Golden Dome.

207
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,440
 That marks the holy of holies

208
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,400
 of first and second temple, right there.

209
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,360
 You go down the valley of Kidron,

210
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,240
 and then you come back to where we took the picture,

211
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,560
 top of Mount of Olives.

212
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,480
 Sitting on the Mount of Olives,

213
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,480
 the disciples came to him privately,

214
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:23,320
 tell us, when would this happen?

215
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,360
 That is, the destruction of the temple.

216
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,800
 What would be the sign of your coming?

217
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,280
 What would be the sign of the end of the age?

218
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,520
 So the disciples are very curious.

219
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,200
 They came forward to Jesus and say,

220
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,480
 they ask two questions.

221
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,520
 When will the destruction of the temple happen?

222
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,240
 What would be the signs?

223
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,040
 And what would be the signs of the end time?

224
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,280
 What would happen before you come back?

225
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:55,400
 Now, Matthew 24, 25 and following,

226
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:58,080
 is Jesus' answer to those two questions.

227
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,320
 Signs of times.

228
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,040
 What will you see before 80, 70?

229
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,040
 Before the end of time.

230
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,600
 Now, as we talk about the last days, according to Jesus,

231
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,000
 we enter into a subject called eschatology.

232
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,280
 Now, eschatology sounds like a big word, right?

233
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:23,200
 But it's actually very simple in terms of what it says.

234
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,200
 It came from a Greek word, eschaton,

235
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:29,200
 meaning ending, end time.

236
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:32,520
 The destination, the end.

237
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:36,120
 So eschatology is the study of what the Bible says

238
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,200
 about end times, about the last days.

239
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,040
 Now, in New Testament terms,

240
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:47,200
 the last days is the final chapter of human history.

241
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,280
 Our history.

242
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:52,800
 Our timeline is the final period.

243
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,920
 That final period in New Testament terms

244
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,640
 is between the first coming of Jesus

245
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,640
 and the second coming of Jesus.

246
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,560
 And the Bible has a lot to say about the second coming,

247
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,120
 besides the book of Revelation.

248
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,280
 It's right here, 24, verse four and following in Matthew.

249
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:17,440
 Jesus answer, "Watch out, no one deceives you.

250
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,000
 "For many will come in my name, claiming I am the Christ,

251
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,920
 "and will deceive many.

252
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,480
 "You will hear wars and rumors of wars,

253
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,040
 "but see to it that you are not alone.

254
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,560
 "Such things must happen.

255
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,720
 "But the end, the telos or the eschaton, is still to come.

256
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:42,560
 "Nation will rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom.

257
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,240
 "There will be famines, there will be earthquakes

258
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,080
 "in various places.

259
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:50,760
 "All these are the beginning of birth pains."

260
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:55,880
 So Jesus goes on to talk about the signs of end times,

261
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,640
 signs of time before the temple was destroyed.

262
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,520
 Before the end of age.

263
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,960
 We're not going to read it word by word,

264
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,360
 but let me make a list here.

265
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,480
 These are the things that Jesus talk about.

266
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,400
 The signs of times, before the destruction

267
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,560
 of the Jerusalem temple, before the end of our history.

268
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,600
 False prophets, false messiahs.

269
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,440
 People would go on and say, "I'm the Christ,

270
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,000
 "I am the prophet."

271
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,400
 But they are false prophets.

272
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,640
 These guys will come out and say words

273
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,720
 that will deceive many, many people.

274
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,720
 Number two, wars and rumors of wars.

275
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,760
 Civil wars, military invasions.

276
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,040
 Three, earthquakes, disasters.

277
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:53,080
 With natural disaster, earthquakes, comes famines.

278
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:58,400
 Number five, persecutions of the church.

279
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:02,560
 Being a believer will be in a tougher and tougher time.

280
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:08,360
 Number six, the gospel will go to the end of the earth.

281
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,320
 Now intuitively, intuitively, when we read those words,

282
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,000
 when we read the signs of times,

283
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,160
 we naturally think that these things are happening

284
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,740
 in our time, right?

285
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:25,200
 Is that true?

286
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:30,040
 Famines, earthquakes, wars, and rumors of wars.

287
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:34,280
 Kind of like a checklist, right?

288
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,280
 Okay, earthquake, check.

289
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,760
 Famines, check.

290
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,520
 Wars, check, check, check, right?

291
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:43,720
 We have a signs of times checklist.

292
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:46,040
 So Jesus is coming any time.

293
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,720
 False prophets, false messiahs,

294
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,560
 false prophets, right?

295
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,000
 Check, right?

296
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,800
 Can you check that?

297
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,120
 Couple days ago, I received an email

298
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,700
 from one of my online students.

299
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:05,520
 So she sent this email to me and said,

300
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:10,160
 one of her friends sent her some YouTube video.

301
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,000
 It's actually one in English, one in Mandarin.

302
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:18,040
 So the YouTube videos are saying

303
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,280
 that Russia invading Ukraine right now

304
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:28,520
 is that a fulfillment of Bible prophecy.

305
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,280
 Is that true or not?

306
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,120
 And those videos claim that to be.

307
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,640
 What is going on right now in Ukraine

308
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,160
 is a fulfillment of biblical prophecy.

309
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,840
 Now, those videos are referring to a passage

310
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,900
 in Ezekiel 38 to 39.

311
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,180
 38 to 39.

312
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:53,220
 It's talking about the end time again

313
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,940
 in different context.

314
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:58,140
 And talking about Israel final enemy.

315
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:01,500
 And that final enemies, one of them,

316
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,660
 or the head of them, is called the Prince of Rosh Meshach.

317
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,680
 Rosh Meshach, okay?

318
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:13,600
 So some of those prophecy teachers out there

319
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:19,340
 have a lot of likes on YouTube and social media.

320
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,820
 They will interpret this phrase.

321
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:26,380
 The final enemy of Israel is called Prince of Rosh Meshach.

322
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:28,460
 Does that sound familiar?

323
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:32,240
 They will interpret Rosh as Rus,

324
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:37,780
 changing the vowels, Russia, Meshach,

325
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:43,940
 is changing the vowels, Moscow, okay?

326
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,980
 All right, you got Russia and Moscow.

327
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,140
 What is so interesting about this passage

328
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:54,700
 is that it's talking about the final enemy of,

329
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,420
 the end time enemy of Israel.

330
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,100
 They come from the far north of Israel.

331
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,380
 Now, if you know the map a little bit more,

332
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,500
 you understand if you draw a straight line from Israel,

333
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:10,000
 according to the YouTube prophecy teachers,

334
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:16,380
 if you draw a straight line from Jerusalem northward,

335
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,040
 you will hit Moscow.

336
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:23,780
 That depends on how you spin the sphere, right?

337
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:25,700
 How you spin the earth.

338
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:30,620
 But if you know the background a little bit,

339
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,620
 Meshach is a place name.

340
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,860
 Refer to Asia Minor.

341
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:38,020
 Today's Turkey.

342
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,540
 Rosh is not a place name, never a place name.

343
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:46,020
 In the Bible, outside of the Bible,

344
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,420
 Assyrian records, Near Eastern records, all that.

345
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,500
 Rosh, never a place name.

346
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:57,540
 In fact, the term, the modern term, Russia,

347
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,060
 did not appear until 11th century AD, after Christ.

348
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:06,780
 More than a thousand years after the first century.

349
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,180
 So this passage, no matter how you interpret it,

350
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:12,600
 has nothing to do with Russia, all right?

351
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:18,700
 So one more on our checklist, false teachers,

352
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:22,780
 false prophecies, false messiahs, false prophets.

353
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,820
 Exactly what Jesus said, right?

354
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:32,000
 That's why Jesus start his Olivet Discourse, his sermon,

355
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:37,300
 asking his disciples to watch out.

356
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,860
 No one deceives you, because there are many

357
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:44,340
 false prophets out there, nowadays,

358
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,260
 and back in the days of Jesus as well.

359
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,340
 Now if you want to read the Bible,

360
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:51,980
 I want you to read the Bible well, okay?

361
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,980
 I want you to read the Bible well.

362
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,060
 Back to this list, all right?

363
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,620
 So forget about Russia, okay?

364
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,580
 Forget about Russia, it's a tragedy, all right?

365
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:05,620
 We should pray for it, we should support it,

366
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,460
 support the Ukrainians, you know,

367
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,380
 you can send money to relief funds and all that.

368
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,820
 Nothing to do with biblical prophecies, okay?

369
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,900
 However, if you want to read the Bible well,

370
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:21,140
 we must begin with the first audience in mind.

371
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:24,340
 So as we read this list of signs,

372
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:28,740
 remember this list of signs are words

373
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,740
 spoken to the first disciples, not to us, right?

374
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:39,060
 The first audience is not us, okay?

375
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:42,460
 So we need to read the word of Jesus

376
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:45,940
 according to their context, not our own context.

377
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:48,940
 So don't do the newspaper theology, all right?

378
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,360
 Okay, you know what newspaper theology is?

379
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,940
 Okay, we look at the headline news,

380
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:57,180
 and then we try to match what the Bible says.

381
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,340
 Go to the book of Revelation, go to Matthew 24,

382
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,600
 and try to match, okay, what event looks like this,

383
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,700
 and what event looks like that, right?

384
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,340
 No.

385
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,500
 If you know a little bit more

386
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,460
 about the first century context,

387
00:22:09,460 --> 00:22:12,620
 you would know how to understand

388
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,420
 how the disciples understood the words of Jesus.

389
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:19,820
 Now back to this list of signs,

390
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:23,960
 Jesus is talking about the time before AD 70.

391
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:30,100
 I was in seminary for some years.

392
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:34,660
 I always wonder, you know, one seminary class,

393
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,780
 like New Testament studies,

394
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:40,760
 you are required to read about 3,000 to 4,000 pages

395
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,460
 of reading, academic reading.

396
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:45,620
 You read tons of things, right?

397
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:47,880
 You read tons of things, just for one class.

398
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:52,400
 When I was in seminary about 15, 20 years ago,

399
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,180
 I always wondered why we didn't spend much time

400
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:01,180
 on the literature outside of the New Testament, right?

401
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:06,700
 New Testament, of course, is a lot to read, right?

402
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,660
 27 books, but there are tons of things

403
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,260
 outside of the New Testament, extra-biblical writings,

404
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:17,940
 that should inform us about the immediate context,

405
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,580
 the first century context of New Testament.

406
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:25,340
 If you read the Jewish Wars, chapter five and six,

407
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:30,340
 by Josephus, a Jewish historian in Jesus' time.

408
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,500
 He was not a Christian,

409
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,180
 fairly trustworthy in general, a historian.

410
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,900
 He wrote tons of things,

411
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:42,900
 and Josephus talks so much about the time before AD 70,

412
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,980
 before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple

413
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,500
 by the Romans.

414
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:51,780
 He mentioned false prophets.

415
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:55,640
 Many people claimed to be the prophets.

416
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,340
 Josephus talks about wars, and rumors of wars.

417
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:06,200
 Earthquakes happening in Italy, in the land of Palestine,

418
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,820
 in Turkey, in today's Turkey, famines.

419
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:14,000
 So if you go with this list,

420
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,340
 you go to Josephus, Jewish War, chapter five and six,

421
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,220
 you actually can check off quite a bit from this list.

422
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,980
 Jesus was referring to his generation,

423
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,900
 AD 30 to AD 70, 40 years.

424
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,180
 What happened in their world?

425
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:31,940
 It was such a chaos, right?

426
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,580
 Of course, persecution of the church,

427
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,520
 Josephus did not mention much,

428
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,340
 but you can tell from just New Testament writings alone.

429
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:43,100
 Persecution of the church.

430
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:45,500
 So many of the things mentioned by Jesus

431
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,540
 happened in the first century.

432
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,420
 Josephus was one of the eyewitnesses.

433
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,620
 The first generations of Jewish Christians,

434
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,820
 they saw all of this.

435
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,920
 But how about gospel to the end of the earth?

436
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:04,420
 You ask the question, no way that happened

437
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,820
 in the first generation, right?

438
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,420
 We have internet, we have IG, we have social media,

439
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,860
 now we can do that, right?

440
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,320
 Back then, no way.

441
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,020
 Well, you check some other New Testament passages

442
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,940
 like Colossians 1, 5 to 6.

443
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:23,080
 Paul wrote the gospel that has come to you, Colossians.

444
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:28,760
 All over the world, this gospel is bearing fruit

445
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,760
 and growing.

446
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,500
 1, 23 and other passages in Romans also talk about

447
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,920
 this gospel has been proclaimed

448
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:41,020
 to every creature under heaven.

449
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,080
 So in some sense, in real sense,

450
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,280
 the gospel has already reached

451
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:55,480
 over, all over the known world of the apostles.

452
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,200
 In some sense, in some real sense,

453
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,560
 because all over the world can mean all sorts of people.

454
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,460
 When the Jewish Christians broke out of Jerusalem

455
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,720
 and spread the gospel everywhere they went,

456
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,280
 they bring the gospel with them.

457
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,520
 So all sorts of people are hearing the gospel.

458
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,840
 The Greco-Roman world, the non-Jewish world,

459
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,040
 they heard the gospel.

460
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:25,920
 So they have seen all the signs

461
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,400
 and they have the reasons to expect

462
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,840
 the second coming of Jesus happening anytime,

463
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,800
 especially when they saw the destruction

464
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,800
 of Jerusalem temple in 1870.

465
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:41,580
 Now, of course, there were many things in Matthew 24.

466
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,360
 Some of them are fulfilled in the first generation

467
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,920
 and some of them are pointing beyond 1870

468
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:50,080
 to the end of the age.

469
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,240
 We can go through more details next time,

470
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,360
 but in any case, I want to wrap up today's message

471
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,680
 by this timeline, this chart.

472
00:26:57,680 --> 00:27:01,720
 If you want to understand what Jesus,

473
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,960
 what the New Testament talks about end times,

474
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,980
 this is the chart.

475
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,920
 The bottom line is our age.

476
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,240
 It will come to the end and Jesus has come.

477
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,140
 The first coming of Jesus happened already.

478
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:23,000
 But when Jesus came, he came with power.

479
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:27,600
 He brings in the future age,

480
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,800
 the new heaven, new earth.

481
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,960
 In some sense, in a very real sense,

482
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,240
 because of first coming of Jesus,

483
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,920
 the next age, what we call heaven,

484
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,400
 but actually it's heaven and earth,

485
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,520
 new heaven and earth,

486
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:48,600
 has already been in breaking into our age.

487
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,340
 That is the top arrow right there.

488
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:55,580
 So right now, we are living in kind of in between,

489
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,040
 between first coming and second coming of Christ.

490
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:04,040
 The future age, in some sense, fundamentally,

491
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,920
 spiritually, in a very real sense,

492
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:09,920
 has already in breaking into our age.

493
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:14,080
 So we are in this in between time,

494
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:17,520
 we can call it already, but not yet.

495
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,520
 Already, meaning that the future age

496
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,360
 is no longer just in the future.

497
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,160
 It is now, the kingdom of God is now in our hearts,

498
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,600
 in our midst.

499
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,600
 The spirit is working in our hearts and our lives.

500
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:41,480
 The future age has come here,

501
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,520
 already been inaugurated,

502
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,480
 already been in breaking into our present age.

503
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:52,440
 Now, most of the signs have happened

504
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:55,320
 in the first coming of Jesus, as I told you, AD 70.

505
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:59,160
 But the end of our age,

506
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:02,760
 with the second coming of Christ, is not yet.

507
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:07,080
 Therefore, when you think of our time,

508
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:10,780
 we're living in this time in between.

509
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,400
 It's a already, but not yet.

510
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:19,060
 However, we are definitely getting closer and closer

511
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,640
 to the eschaton, to the second coming of Christ.

512
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,560
 That's why Jesus said,

513
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,880
 "You do not know when exactly I will come,

514
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,720
 "but I will come any time."

515
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,560
 Right?

516
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,280
 I will come any time.

517
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:36,280
 Now, this realization should affect how we live today.

518
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:44,320
 Already, meaning the future kingdom has made an in-breaking

519
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,920
 into your world, into your life.

520
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:51,200
 And you are no longer what you used to be,

521
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,960
 because the life of the kingdom of God

522
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,320
 has already been a reality in your life.

523
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,040
 However, not yet.

524
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:02,440
 On this side of heaven, we're not in heaven yet.

525
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:05,120
 We're not in heaven in new earth yet.

526
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,560
 But it will happen any time.

527
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,920
 Now, we modern people are very impatient.

528
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,160
 Right?

529
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:13,980
 Where are we?

530
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,840
 If you say, in Matthew 24, go through the checklist,

531
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,760
 the first generation of disciples,

532
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,280
 they understood all the signs have been fulfilled.

533
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:31,000
 In their generation, AD 30 to AD 70.

534
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,960
 That means, in hindsight, from our perspective now,

535
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,880
 the first generation of disciples,

536
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,980
 they were living in the beginning of the end time.

537
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,840
 How about us?

538
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:50,800
 We are living at the end of the end time.

539
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:55,840
 They were expecting the second coming of Jesus.

540
00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,760
 We are also expecting the coming of Jesus.

541
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,840
 Yeah, we say, why the delay, right?

542
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,520
 2,000 years, come on, man.

543
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,680
 If you come, please come, right?

544
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,480
 When are you coming?

545
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,640
 Well, let me remind you, we have one verse

546
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,480
 from 2 Peter 3.8.

547
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,840
 But do not forget this one thing, dear friends.

548
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,040
 With the Lord, a day is like 1,000 years.

549
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:28,840
 And 1,000 years are like a day.

550
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:32,440
 The Lord is not slow in keeping his promise,

551
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,880
 as some understand slowness.

552
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:39,040
 God is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish,

553
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,360
 but everyone to come to repentance.

554
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:47,400
 One day is like 1,000 years in God's sight.

555
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:50,440
 So if you remember this chart,

556
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:55,400
 so far in God's timing, it's only two days.

557
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,200
 Right?

558
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,960
 Remember what you did two days ago?

559
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,720
 Remember what you did yesterday?

560
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,160
 You may have forgotten, right?

561
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,920
 It's gone like that.

562
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:11,520
 In God's timing, two days only.

563
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,760
 However, Jesus keeps reminding us to wait patiently,

564
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:22,920
 and to wait and be alert, and be prepared, right?

565
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:26,400
 Be prepared for the coming of our Lord.

566
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,000
 Because we need to give an account of our lives.

567
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,160
 How do we use our time, our treasure, our talents?

568
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,000
 Right?

569
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,820
 The three Ts.

570
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,680
 How do we use our time and treasure,

571
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:41,160
 and our resources?

572
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,460
 Do we use it to extend and advance the gospel?

573
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,700
 To extend the kingdom?

574
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,200
 Or do we just bury it underground, right?

575
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:56,240
 We need to give an account, and we need to wait and prepare.

576
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:02,680
 Prepare for the coming of our Lord anytime, anytime soon.

577
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:07,720
 When I was a really young kid, all right?

578
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,800
 I was in Hong Kong back then.

579
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,040
 Sometimes my mom, in the afternoon,

580
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:17,780
 she would say to me, with some tone of warning,

581
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,200
 she would say to me, "Wait 'til your dad comes back."

582
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,880
 It's a very meaningful sentence.

583
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:29,520
 Now, you could have two different reactions, right?

584
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,400
 As a small kid, right?

585
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,900
 Wait 'til your dad comes back.

586
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:38,360
 The first reaction, of course, is you're afraid, right?

587
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,860
 You have done something wrong.

588
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:43,360
 And you should repent.

589
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,060
 And then you can wait in fear.

590
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,200
 That's your first reaction.

591
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,220
 The second reaction, as a small kid,

592
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:55,040
 wait 'til your dad comes back.

593
00:33:55,040 --> 00:34:00,120
 That you're excited for the coming of your dad,

594
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,960
 because you have done well.

595
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,800
 Well, as Asian, you have done well in school, right?

596
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,240
 And then you actually anticipate

597
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:12,100
 the coming of your father, right?

598
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:16,040
 Either or, either you're afraid,

599
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,580
 or you're anticipating the coming of the Lord.

600
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,840
 There's no time to waste, guys.

601
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:27,060
 We are living in the end of the end times, right?

602
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:31,480
 Now, I'm not suggesting, okay, please understand,

603
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,600
 I'm not suggesting, okay, let's quit our day job,

604
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,840
 and then we get together, we worship here, okay?

605
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,760
 Sell off all of your properties,

606
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,260
 you bought a new house, sell it, all right?

607
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:44,280
 If you have any stock, you can sell it, okay?

608
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,040
 We're gonna gather here, and then we'll wait

609
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:49,240
 for the alien to come, and something like that.

610
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,440
 I'm not suggesting that.

611
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,800
 And in fact, the first century Christians,

612
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,140
 they were eagerly expecting the second coming

613
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,200
 of Jesus Christ.

614
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,040
 They never done something like that, right?

615
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,300
 Only the occult, or the cults would do that, right?

616
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:03,200
 What did they do?

617
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,440
 First generation of Christians.

618
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,600
 They expect, they saw the signs.

619
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,560
 What did they do?

620
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,520
 They set the orientation of their life

621
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,820
 toward the future kingdom.

622
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:20,920
 No matter what they do, whether they are farmers,

623
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,920
 they are slaves, they are masters, they are businessmen,

624
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,200
 they orient their direction toward the kingdom,

625
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,360
 toward the second coming of Christ.

626
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,940
 We are living at the end of the age.

627
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:41,340
 Set your orientation, set your direction.

628
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:47,340
 Toward the coming kingdom, toward the coming Christ.

629
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:52,340
 If you are going to school, pray and be alert.

630
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,340
 Do your, go through your school with the wrong direction,

631
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,540
 with the general direction to glorify God, right?

632
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:07,540
 If you're working adults, do so to honor God

633
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:10,220
 with your three Ts, your time, your talent,

634
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:15,220
 and your treasure, to advance the kingdom of God, all right?

635
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:19,300
 So if you understand eschatology in the Bible,

636
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:23,900
 it doesn't do any sort of escape reality.

637
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,100
 It's not escape game, all right?

638
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,940
 It's not like we get together and then we wait

639
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:30,220
 for Jesus to come and then, okay,

640
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:32,500
 we'll be raptured out of this world, right?

641
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:35,740
 It's not escape, it's to engage.

642
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,820
 The New Testament eschatology tells you and me

643
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,460
 that we are future people.

644
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:46,300
 We are in some sense from the future

645
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:49,060
 because our home is in the future.

646
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:52,980
 Whatever characterize our future home,

647
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:57,980
 love, peace, righteousness, justice, we bring it over here.

648
00:36:57,980 --> 00:37:02,020
 We make it the reality.

649
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:06,860
 Now this is the life transforming idea.

650
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,540
 If we understand we are living at the end of the end time

651
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,580
 and Jesus is coming back anytime soon,

652
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:17,740
 we are called to change our orientation of our lives

653
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,060
 toward the new creation.

654
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,260
 That is the gospel.

655
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:24,420
 That is the gospel.

656
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,460
 I hope you and I are ready,

657
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,700
 ready for the second coming of Christ,

658
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:35,860
 ready to give an account to our master, to our Lord, right?

659
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:40,740
 You know, give what you have, right?

660
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,740
 Give what you have toward the kingdom.

661
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:46,580
 Be a good steward, biblical stewardship.

662
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:49,420
 How you manage your time, are you wasting your time?

663
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,240
 How you manage your resource, are you wasting your resource

664
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:56,220
 for something unrelated to the gospel,

665
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,600
 unrelated to the kingdom?

666
00:37:57,600 --> 00:38:00,140
 We repent and we change.

667
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,380
 And we yearn for the coming back of Jesus Christ.

668
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,580
 Let's all pray together.

669
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:10,140
 Dear God, we give you thanks

670
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:13,960
 for you are the master of history.

671
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:16,900
 You created us all.

672
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:19,860
 You are the creator and you are also the redeemer.

673
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,860
 You are the Lord of our history.

674
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:25,380
 Help us understand we are living in the end of the end times

675
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:27,500
 and we are expecting your coming.

676
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:29,980
 And we pray that we will anticipate your coming,

677
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,140
 not in fear, but in faith.

678
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:36,260
 Help us to use our resources to extend your kingdom,

679
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,300
 to worship you, to serve you.

680
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,700
 Use our time, our talents, our treasure to honor your name,

681
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,860
 to extend your gospel,

682
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:48,220
 to let your gospel reach to the end of the earth.

683
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,500
 There are so many people

684
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,060
 haven't heard of the name of Jesus.

685
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:53,540
 There are so many people who have not received the gospel.

686
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,980
 And we're gonna send our missionaries

687
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:58,880
 and we're gonna support the movement of the gospel.

688
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,580
 We're gonna build up your church

689
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,460
 so that your name will be glorified.

690
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:06,940
 And we pray that you will help us to be faithful stewards

691
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:10,620
 of the things that you have given to us.

692
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,220
 No matter we are in school, in work, in our family,

693
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,440
 in our marriage, we wanna do it to honor your name,

694
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:20,220
 to make your name famous.

695
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,420
 In Christ's name we pray.

696
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:24,340
 Amen, right?
