1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,160
 Well, why don't we say a happy new year

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:07,720
 to the neighbors next to you, in your own language.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,960
 All right?

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,460
 And then we'll begin our sermon series.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,300
 All right?

6
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:16,880
 Great, all right, all right.

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,160
 That's cool.

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,200
 We do have some refreshments out there, right?

9
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:23,960
 Yeah, I hope those guys won't devour everything.

10
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:24,880
 (laughs)

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,240
 And save some for us, all right?

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,360
 So it's very, very happy you come in.

13
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:32,120
 There's a photo booth you can use.

14
00:00:32,120 --> 00:00:33,940
 Right after service, you can take some pictures

15
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:37,020
 or some family pictures with your friends, okay?

16
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,020
 So happy to celebrate China's New Year with some of you.

17
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:46,620
 We will continue our sermon series on The Chosen,

18
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,480
 and this is part two.

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,480
 And I have picked episode two of season one.

20
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:57,180
 How many of you checked out The Chosen since last week?

21
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,040
 Please do, please do, all right?

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,980
 We will send out the link in the social media group,

23
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,660
 and you can watch it for free.

24
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:08,320
 And Josh remind me, not only all the episode

25
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,580
 have the captions for different languages,

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,920
 including Chinese or different languages,

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,300
 but also there's audio, right?

28
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,720
 There's audio for different languages as well.

29
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:23,180
 I'm not sure how I feel if Jesus speaks in Mandarin.

30
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:25,800
 Not quite sure, yeah.

31
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:30,560
 But anyways, but in Chosen, Jesus speaks English,

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,940
 which is kind of strange, right?

33
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:34,520
 Because the original language he spoke

34
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,920
 was Aramaic or Hebrew, right?

35
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:41,320
 In any case, it is a well-crafted TV series,

36
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,440
 and it's become so popular.

37
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:46,000
 No matter you like the episodes

38
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,280
 or you like how they craft the story or not,

39
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,040
 I think watching it will help you picture

40
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,460
 what life was like in times of Jesus,

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:58,320
 because all the scenes that they pick,

42
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,640
 all the, you know, the houses

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,520
 or the background they pick are pretty realistic.

44
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,080
 It's very realistic.

45
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,240
 If you understand history,

46
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,800
 you understand the historical background.

47
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,120
 They actually did a good job.

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,480
 So watch The Chosen and think about the Bible

49
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,940
 and your faith.

50
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:24,440
 Let's see, last time, we were at

51
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,740
 episode two, episode one.

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,780
 Now, episode two, let me give you a summary,

53
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,140
 just highlight.

54
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,580
 Now, remember episode one,

55
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,120
 it was Mary Madeline was tortured by many demons,

56
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,500
 and Jesus finally cast out all the demons

57
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,500
 and free her from the tyranny of Satan, of the demons.

58
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,500
 And then she is now free,

59
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,900
 and now Nicodemus, the respected rabbi,

60
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,980
 is trying to find out what happened to Mary Madeline,

61
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:58,160
 because remember, Nicodemus, the rabbi,

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,820
 was being called upon to minister to Mary Madeline

63
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:06,180
 when she was tortured and possessed by the demons,

64
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,100
 and Nicodemus failed to cast out all the demons.

65
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,340
 But that's how the story goes.

66
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:13,580
 It's not in the Bible, right?

67
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,100
 But it's kind of interesting.

68
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,540
 You try to creatively, you know,

69
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,640
 woven all the stories together.

70
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,300
 But in any case, Nicodemus failed,

71
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:26,380
 and he wanted to find out what happened to Mary Madeline,

72
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:30,660
 and who cast out the demons, which he could not.

73
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,400
 And now, back to Mary, in episode two,

74
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,900
 she prepares the first Shabbat meal,

75
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,740
 and she has invited some of her friends

76
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,940
 and those who are socially outcast,

77
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:47,800
 the blind, the disabled, and two of the disciples of Jesus,

78
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,900
 being invited to the home of Mary Madeline.

79
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:53,940
 And of course, at the end, the surprise guests show up

80
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:57,300
 at the first Shabbat of Mary Madeline, right?

81
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,880
 And that surprise guest is Jesus, right?

82
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,380
 Jesus show up at the end of the episode.

83
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,220
 Now, the key issue here I want you to think about

84
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,220
 is the Bible background.

85
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:15,240
 Why they were so concerned about casting out the demons,

86
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:20,900
 like miracles that is done by Jesus.

87
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:25,020
 Why did the Pharisees was so upset

88
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,860
 or so concerned about who is doing what,

89
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,560
 and why were there miracles?

90
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,460
 They want to authenticate all the miracles.

91
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,820
 No, you get that kind of sense

92
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,020
 in the opening chapters of all gospels.

93
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:41,140
 When Jesus came out publicly,

94
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,460
 he did a lot of miracles, signs and wonders,

95
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:47,620
 including casting out the demons.

96
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,900
 And then the Pharisees from Jerusalem

97
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:53,060
 came out to Jesus and challenged him.

98
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:58,240
 They are trying to authenticate in whose authority

99
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,100
 Jesus did all those things, right?

100
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,740
 Why did they so concerned about all of this miracles

101
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,180
 and they want to authenticate

102
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,660
 whether someone is using the authority of God,

103
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:11,200
 the name of God properly?

104
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,800
 Because the Jews in those days,

105
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,800
 they thought if true miracle happened in our time,

106
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:25,820
 that means the kingdom of God is finally here.

107
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,480
 It's finally here.

108
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,480
 Remember the Bible background before the New Testament,

109
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,800
 there was an Old Testament, right?

110
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,840
 Between the Old Testament and the New Testament,

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,000
 there were several hundred years

112
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,460
 that God seems to be silent.

113
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,740
 What we call the silence period.

114
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,500
 It's about three to 400 years.

115
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:50,500
 We call it intertestamental period between the old and new.

116
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,300
 And the Jewish people, they were waiting and yearning

117
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:57,880
 for God to come and to arrive.

118
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,020
 The king will arrive, finally will restore his kingdom,

119
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,300
 the long lost kingdom of David.

120
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,520
 And when the new Messiah,

121
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,320
 when the new king arrive at the scene,

122
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,560
 he will arrive with signs and wonders

123
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,180
 and casting out the demons.

124
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:18,280
 And that's why the New Testament opens

125
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,520
 with signs and wonders done by the Messiah, Jesus Christ.

126
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,240
 Now we were all in the Bible study, right?

127
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,000
 The gospel of Mark.

128
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,400
 We just finished chapter nine, right?

129
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,120
 We just finished chapter nine.

130
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,880
 And the first eight chapters were all about the signs

131
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,160
 and miracles that done by Jesus.

132
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,620
 And, you know, reading between the line,

133
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:45,120
 you see the Pharisees and the authorities from Jerusalem

134
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,800
 is trying to check them out, right?

135
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:51,720
 To challenge Jesus and to ask Jesus by who's the authority,

136
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,400
 you are doing all of this, right?

137
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:58,400
 And of course, for those who are unbelieving, they resist.

138
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,760
 They resist to acknowledge the divine authority Jesus had.

139
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:08,240
 And they try to blame him for casting out demons

140
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,400
 with some other power, maybe demonic power, right?

141
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:17,400
 In fact, in chapter 11 of the gospel of Luke,

142
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,200
 Jesus said, after he cast out demons,

143
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,140
 and the authorities, the Pharisees,

144
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,040
 the religious teachers from Jerusalem challenged him,

145
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,240
 by whose power you're doing this, Jesus said,

146
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:33,200
 but if I am casting out demons by the power of God,

147
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:37,040
 then the kingdom of God has arrived among you.

148
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:41,600
 Jesus speaks here, he says, you know,

149
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:45,700
 because I'm casting out demons with the authority of God,

150
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,760
 you know, the kingship of God has already arrived.

151
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,020
 And because of me, when you see me work,

152
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:57,600
 when you see me saying things and teaching and preaching,

153
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:02,480
 you know the power of God has already arrived in our midst.

154
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,120
 And that's what he said here.

155
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,360
 The kingdom of God has already arrived.

156
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,800
 Pay attention to the tense here.

157
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,120
 It's not a past tense, it's not future tense,

158
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,600
 it's a present perfect tense, right?

159
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,280
 Has already arrived among you.

160
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,000
 And you better acknowledge that because of power of Jesus.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,720
 Now this episode, try to, you know, intervere,

162
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,680
 interconnect all the stories together

163
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,440
 and talking about the first Shabbat

164
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,700
 prepared by Mary Madeline, all right?

165
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:37,920
 Of course that is not in the Bible.

166
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,600
 The Bible never recorded, you know,

167
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,760
 Mary Madeline preparing for Shabbat,

168
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,420
 preparing for a meal on the seventh day of the week.

169
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,440
 But we know that is the background

170
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,480
 because it's Jewish people.

171
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:53,640
 For them, the most important thing is the Shabbat meal.

172
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,480
 The most important thing.

173
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,880
 Even today, modern Israelis,

174
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,720
 they will celebrate Shabbat

175
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,360
 and they will take it very, very seriously, right?

176
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,480
 It's kind of like those of you

177
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:11,480
 who have Chinese heritage, right?

178
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:15,800
 You have Chinese heritage

179
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,320
 and you have that cultural background

180
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,600
 and you want to celebrate Chinese New Year, right?

181
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,120
 Some of you do, right?

182
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,400
 We don't.

183
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,520
 I don't.

184
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,440
 Because we just too lazy.

185
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,880
 So my son is back for the weekend

186
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,400
 and all we did is that we went out for lunch yesterday

187
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:38,480
 and we found a restaurant that is less crowded.

188
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,320
 So we had lunch, right?

189
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,920
 And that's all, right?

190
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,120
 I don't give them money.

191
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,760
 I wish they can give me money.

192
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:51,120
 But we lost kind of the Chinese heritage.

193
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,640
 But for many of you, because of the cultural background,

194
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,160
 you still take it seriously, right?

195
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,240
 And that's why you've got some refreshment out there.

196
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,200
 That's why you've got some, you know,

197
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,280
 decoration or the red color, right?

198
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,120
 That you have.

199
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,120
 This is only red shirt, kind of red shirt that I have.

200
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,040
 So I save it for Chinese New Year.

201
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,520
 But you know, for the Jewish people,

202
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,040
 Shabbat meal or the Shabbat

203
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,600
 is a super important sign and ritual.

204
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,760
 And where does it come from?

205
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,920
 It comes from the second book of the Old Testament.

206
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,320
 Remember the first book is Genesis.

207
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,120
 Second book is Exodus.

208
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,600
 Exodus chapter 20, here this entire passage

209
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,200
 is the 10 commandments.

210
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,640
 Now, why there were 10 commandments?

211
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,640
 Because when God saved the Israelites out of Egypt,

212
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,240
 the land of slavery,

213
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,800
 he redeemed them and saved them by grace

214
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,440
 and saved his people and out of Egypt,

215
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,840
 they passed through wilderness and finally they came

216
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,840
 to the first most important mountain called Mount Sinai.

217
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:08,520
 And they were there and God show up in clouds and thunders,

218
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:12,840
 clouds and thunders and lightning and fire

219
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,720
 at the top of the mountain.

220
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,640
 And at the foot of the mountain,

221
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:20,240
 the people of God just redeemed.

222
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,920
 And God spoke to them because I save you by grace.

223
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,920
 I led you out of the land of slavery, land of sin.

224
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:34,200
 Now you become my people and I give you the principles

225
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:39,200
 to live by because you have a new identity as my people,

226
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:43,200
 as the new people, that's why you live differently.

227
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,200
 And God spoke the 10 words, the 10 principles,

228
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,720
 what we call the 10 commandments.

229
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:53,480
 And those commandments are the basic constitutional

230
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:58,480
 principles lived by the new people of God.

231
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,040
 And in the fourth commandment,

232
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:07,280
 it speaks of the Shabbat or the Sabbath.

233
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,180
 Now this is super important.

234
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:12,560
 Chapter 20, verse eight and following.

235
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,920
 It says, God said to the new people of God,

236
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:20,920
 remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.

237
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:27,080
 You have six days each week for your ordinary work,

238
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:32,080
 but the seventh day is a Shabbat day or Sabbath day of rest,

239
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,600
 dedicated to the Lord your God.

240
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,000
 On that day, no one in your household may do any work.

241
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,760
 This includes you, your sons and daughters,

242
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:46,080
 your male and female servants, your livestock,

243
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,280
 any foreigners living among you.

244
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:52,760
 For in six days, the Lord God made the heavens,

245
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,760
 the earth, the sea and everything in them.

246
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,560
 But on the seventh day, he rested.

247
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,760
 That is why the Lord God plus the Sabbath day,

248
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,980
 the Shabbat day and set it apart as holy.

249
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,400
 Now this is very interesting.

250
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,120
 Let me point out something here.

251
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:16,120
 The Shabbat, what is interesting, the Sabbath is time.

252
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,920
 It's time.

253
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,600
 All right.

254
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,280
 From a particular time to another particular time.

255
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:30,760
 You know, time is being set apart here, being set aside

256
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,240
 and being seen as something more important

257
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,160
 than all those times, the ordinary time.

258
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,360
 That's very interesting.

259
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:44,400
 Right, the first thing God told the people of God,

260
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,440
 God said to them, God said to us,

261
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,840
 there was certain time period of the week

262
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,240
 that you have to see it differently

263
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,560
 from all those other times, right?

264
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,160
 Monday night, Tuesday night, Wednesday afternoon,

265
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,040
 those are ordinary time.

266
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,360
 And there's a special time during the week

267
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,600
 that God sees it as important.

268
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,540
 And he said, remember to keep that holy.

269
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:21,020
 Now people of God are to refrain from working,

270
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:25,720
 the normal, ordinary work, right?

271
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,640
 And then on the seventh day, what we call Shabbat, right?

272
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,160
 They stop working and set it aside

273
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:38,720
 and keep that apart from all the other time.

274
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,040
 Now what does the word Shabbat or Sabbath mean?

275
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,960
 What does it mean?

276
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:49,120
 It means stop, right?

277
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:53,080
 Cease, ceasing, ceasing to do something

278
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,160
 you have already done.

279
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,160
 Just stop doing this and then you do something else.

280
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,000
 Well, as I said, modern Israelis

281
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,440
 would take Shabbat seriously,

282
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:09,000
 especially those who are on the orthodox side,

283
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,600
 and they will stay home and they would rest.

284
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,300
 They would go to synagogue to worship,

285
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,000
 and they will have, of course, the Shabbat meal

286
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,680
 as their family time, they enjoy it.

287
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:27,200
 You go to modern Israel on the Shabbat day,

288
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:32,200
 which begins on Friday at sundown,

289
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,320
 the streets are suddenly quiet,

290
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:41,600
 no cars traveling, no one driving,

291
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,540
 no one on the street.

292
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,020
 Those people you usually find on the street,

293
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:49,200
 they are on the way to somewhere else.

294
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,320
 They may go to a synagogue,

295
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:56,320
 they may go to a Western wall to pray, to worship, right?

296
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,600
 So what an interesting social phenomenon, right?

297
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,320
 On Shabbat, they just cease everything

298
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,100
 and go to synagogue and stay home for Shabbat meal.

299
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:14,860
 Now the Sabbath is important because it is the sign,

300
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:17,980
 the indication of who you are.

301
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:21,260
 And for the people of God in Israel,

302
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,580
 for the Old Testament people,

303
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,060
 as the people of God, Shabbat, Sabbath,

304
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:32,260
 is a special sign of their relationship with God

305
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:36,180
 because God has entered a covenant,

306
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:38,920
 sort of a serious agreement with them.

307
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,260
 God, Yahweh, and the people of God,

308
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:44,240
 and between them, there's a covenant,

309
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,900
 there's a relationship.

310
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,700
 And God said, "One of the signs that you show the world,

311
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,860
 "you show yourself, is to stop working

312
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,700
 "and you come to worship me.

313
00:16:56,700 --> 00:17:00,940
 "You rest so that I can work," right?

314
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,540
 To acknowledge my kingship,

315
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,380
 to acknowledge that you are in control

316
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,500
 and I am not in control.

317
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,060
 That is the most important sign in the Bible.

318
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,220
 And according to Jewish tradition,

319
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,060
 Shabbat begins a few minutes before sundown.

320
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:20,300
 There was some rabbis in Jesus' day,

321
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,460
 they said, "How do you know how to tell time?"

322
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:26,380
 Today we have the Apple Watch, we have the clock, right?

323
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,660
 We have the internet to tell us the world clock, right?

324
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,780
 What time it is right now.

325
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:33,580
 But for those people in Jesus' day,

326
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,900
 they didn't have a watch,

327
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,820
 so those rabbis were discussing

328
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:41,100
 when exactly does the Shabbat begin?

329
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:43,740
 And some of the literature tells us

330
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,540
 the exact time to begin Shabbat

331
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:50,300
 is when three stars appear in the night sky.

332
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:54,200
 So they observe the stars and the moon, right?

333
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:58,180
 They find three stars appearing in the sky.

334
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,820
 That's when Shabbat begins.

335
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,420
 And you see it's working.

336
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:07,140
 Remember, Shabbat or Sabbath means stop, right?

337
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,100
 And they just drop everything, right?

338
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,900
 They don't even cook.

339
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,980
 They don't even cook, right?

340
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:17,980
 One of the most interesting experience

341
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,820
 that we have when we go to Israel,

342
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:22,180
 when I lead church groups to Israel,

343
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:24,580
 is that sometimes we'd stay in the hotel, right?

344
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,180
 And Friday night, when Friday night comes,

345
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:33,260
 and all through Saturday for 24 hours,

346
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:37,100
 the hotel kitchen is closed, right?

347
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:39,620
 So what are we gonna eat, right?

348
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,620
 What are we gonna eat?

349
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,600
 We eat the leftover.

350
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:49,820
 Because what they do is that they leave the steamer on,

351
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:55,520
 and all those trays of food are being heat up, right?

352
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,060
 So they don't do any work in Shabbat, right?

353
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,060
 Because starting a fire or electricity is considered work.

354
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,980
 So they turn it on on Friday and leave it on for 24 hours,

355
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,500
 and that's all you eat, right?

356
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,420
 So Thursday night, whatever you eat,

357
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,980
 you probably will eat the same thing Friday night, right?

358
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,980
 And then Friday breakfast becomes Saturday breakfast,

359
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,880
 because they take this seriously.

360
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:30,880
 And in the entire Bible, anyone in the nation of Israel,

361
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,600
 if they fail to observe Shabbat,

362
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,880
 if they fail to observe Shabbat,

363
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:42,440
 that will show that this thing or this respect

364
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:47,300
 for the special relationship between God and Israel.

365
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:51,480
 Like for married couples, right?

366
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,760
 Some of us are married couples.

367
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,960
 If one side, with one person,

368
00:19:55,960 --> 00:20:02,500
 trash some of the symbols of the relationship,

369
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:08,220
 trash it, not losing it, not unintentionally,

370
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,420
 but if you trash it, some of the symbols,

371
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:15,420
 like wedding ring, certificate, right?

372
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:18,400
 Or something that is important between the two people,

373
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,920
 if you intentionally trash it,

374
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,360
 that means you show disdain toward that relationship

375
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,320
 and toward the person in that relationship.

376
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,720
 And that is what Shabbat becomes.

377
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,400
 It becomes a sign to tell you,

378
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,320
 that tell ourselves and tell the world

379
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,640
 that God is important, right?

380
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,160
 God is important.

381
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:45,160
 So the Jewish people have already respected this tradition

382
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,320
 throughout the history,

383
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,060
 because they understand it's not just a commandment.

384
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,240
 And this commandment rests on

385
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:58,240
 how God order the entire universe.

386
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:02,680
 Now we read this passage, Exodus chapter 20.

387
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:06,000
 It says you have to remember this day,

388
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 to observe this day, and then guard it, to keep it holy.

389
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,240
 You know, I like that word, guarding.

390
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,920
 You know, guarding is actually used for military context.

391
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,860
 It's like a soldier trying to watch out

392
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:23,740
 for enemies approaching, standing on the watchtower.

393
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,780
 You know, you're always ready and self-disciplined, right?

394
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,400
 It's not a come and go.

395
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,540
 You guard it and you keep it,

396
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,020
 because it's so important, right?

397
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,900
 It's not by accident.

398
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:40,580
 To guard the day.

399
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,580
 Now this passage is based on how God work, right?

400
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:49,260
 Verse 10, seven day, right?

401
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,040
 Seven day, or six days each week for your ordinary work,

402
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,400
 but seven day is the Shabbat day of rest,

403
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,200
 dedicated to Yahweh, the Lord your God.

404
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,600
 On that day, no one in your household may do any work.

405
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,460
 Now it's actually referring to the book of Genesis,

406
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,360
 the first chapter.

407
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:16,600
 The first chapter of Genesis from verse,

408
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:20,300
 chapter one, verse one to chapter two, verse three.

409
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,140
 We recorded how God work in the entire week.

410
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:28,460
 Let me read this passage, chapter two, verse one.

411
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,860
 So the creation of the heavens and the earth

412
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:34,300
 and everything in them was completed.

413
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:38,540
 On the seventh day, God had finished his work of creation,

414
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,460
 and so he rested from all his work.

415
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:47,100
 And God blessed the seventh day and declare it holy,

416
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:51,100
 because it was on this day, on the day when he rested

417
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,540
 from all his work of creation.

418
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,040
 Now this entire creation week being recorded

419
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:02,020
 and being narrated from Genesis 1, 1,

420
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,680
 all the way up to chapter two, verse three.

421
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:08,340
 Now, of course the Bible is not interested

422
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,100
 in scientific stuff, right?

423
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,100
 Moses or people in those days,

424
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,300
 they didn't have iPhone, right?

425
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,340
 They didn't have iPad,

426
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,460
 they didn't have all these modern technology.

427
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:22,620
 They didn't even have electricity back then.

428
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:26,020
 So the creation week is not a scientific account.

429
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:29,460
 It is a spiritual account.

430
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:32,700
 It is a theological writing.

431
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,220
 It's more interested in theology.

432
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,020
 It's more interested to tell you who God is

433
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:42,380
 and who we are if we relate to God.

434
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:47,380
 So God's act of creation is being presented as one week,

435
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:51,340
 the work of one week, what we call six-day creation.

436
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:53,600
 Now, if you remember chapter one,

437
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,340
 day after day, day after day,

438
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,660
 talking about how God set up the cosmos.

439
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,300
 He set up the entire universe,

440
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,220
 and after six day of work, God rested from all his work.

441
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,500
 He rested on the seventh day.

442
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,780
 Now, we modern readers, we come before the Bible and say,

443
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,420
 "God rested."

444
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,980
 That's interesting, right?

445
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:19,340
 The eternal God would rest?

446
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,900
 Does it mean he is getting tired, right?

447
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,660
 Just like we get tired, right?

448
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,140
 After all day of studying, writing paper,

449
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:30,340
 or going to work, geez, we are so tired,

450
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:35,340
 and we just sit on our lazy boy, right?

451
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:38,740
 And sip a cup of wine or something,

452
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,980
 and then we want to rest, right?

453
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:44,540
 Now, in the ancient time,

454
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:48,620
 when people talked about God resting,

455
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:52,380
 it does not mean God is exhausted.

456
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,220
 It does not mean God is tired like we get tired.

457
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:00,000
 No, when the ancient people, the Bible people,

458
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
 when they talk about resting, God resting,

459
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:07,080
 they said, what they meant was,

460
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 God enter into his temple, and he started to rule.

461
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:18,600
 It's actually going up and be seated on his throne.

462
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,780
 That is the meaning of God resting.

463
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,200
 So it's not because God is tired.

464
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,720
 God is going into his house, the temple,

465
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,520
 and inside the temple, there is one part in the temple,

466
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,080
 the very center of the temple, called Holy of Holies.

467
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,920
 And there you find the Ark of the Covenant.

468
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:43,400
 And the Ark of the Covenant is actually God's throne,

469
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,960
 God's own seat, his kingly seat.

470
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,800
 And he was sitting there, and that is what it meant,

471
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,360
 what it meant, God rested.

472
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,640
 So God rested means God enter into Holy of Holies,

473
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,680
 and God is in charge.

474
00:25:58,680 --> 00:25:59,800
 God is now the king.

475
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,120
 He runs the entire universe.

476
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:04,080
 So God is in control.

477
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,760
 A modern analogy is that,

478
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:09,820
 how many of you have recently purchased a new computer?

479
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,640
 A new computer?

480
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:18,660
 There are some on sale in Costco, gaming PC, right?

481
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,940
 You can check it out.

482
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:23,880
 I mean, you buy a PC, or you buy a computer,

483
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:27,680
 and you move it to your house, right?

484
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,320
 And you open the box, right?

485
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,400
 You get the tower, and you get the monitor,

486
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,520
 you get the stand, and keyboard, and all that stuff, right?

487
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,120
 And then you plug in all the cables,

488
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,760
 and all the connections,

489
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,200
 and whatever would make the computer work.

490
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:47,880
 So you work a whole day in order to set up your workspace,

491
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,840
 right, to set up your work computer.

492
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,400
 And after you set them all up,

493
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,480
 plug in all the cables with electricity,

494
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:57,240
 and all that stuff, what do you do?

495
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,040
 Do you go to bed?

496
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:00,980
 No, you don't.

497
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:04,440
 You turn it on, right?

498
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:08,200
 And that's when you start to rule, right?

499
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:10,040
 You control it.

500
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:12,800
 And that's what it means when God enters

501
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,040
 His holy of holies.

502
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,360
 God rested.

503
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,880
 It means He controls everything.

504
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:23,600
 The entire universe, your life, your family,

505
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,580
 your career, your work, everything.

506
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,720
 So that's what this Shabbat commandment mean.

507
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,960
 It means honor the day.

508
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:41,700
 Honor this 24 hours.

509
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,480
 Keep that holy to worship God.

510
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:49,100
 What it means is that God is the one who is in control,

511
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,820
 not me.

512
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,340
 God is operating my life.

513
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,220
 God is orchestrating everything around me.

514
00:27:57,220 --> 00:27:59,860
 God is in control every single thing

515
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,540
 from the greatest to the least.

516
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,900
 God is the king, God is the Lord.

517
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,820
 And after six days of labor, I've done enough.

518
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,100
 The Shabbat is telling you enough is enough.

519
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,120
 This is time for you to stop

520
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,380
 and come before the presence of God to worship Him.

521
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,980
 Because you know, ultimately,

522
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,020
 God is the one who controls everything,

523
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,340
 not you and not me.

524
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,460
 Do you ever find it interesting

525
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,020
 in the entire week of creation,

526
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,020
 God never set apart some things as holy.

527
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:39,220
 The entire creation of Genesis,

528
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:44,180
 God did not sanctify or set aside a tool

529
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:48,900
 or a vessel or a building or a piece of land.

530
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,740
 God never did that.

531
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,740
 In the entire creation week, God set aside time.

532
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,700
 God set aside time to be holy, to sanctify it.

533
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,940
 What is it?

534
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,940
 It's a period of time during the week.

535
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:12,260
 Now what it reminds us is that how we use our time

536
00:29:12,260 --> 00:29:14,380
 tell us who we are.

537
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,340
 How we use our time, how we manage our time,

538
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:23,340
 tell ourselves and other people who our true God is.

539
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,260
 You know, we human beings, we live in time and space,

540
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,020
 concrete time and space, right?

541
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:33,540
 We watch the clock, right?

542
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,460
 We follow the clock.

543
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:38,180
 Sometimes we have to clock in and clock out for our work.

544
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,020
 Right?

545
00:29:39,020 --> 00:29:40,140
 We live in time.

546
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,980
 And sometimes we are busy, right?

547
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,540
 Probably most of the time we are busy, right?

548
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,540
 And we don't have time to do this or to do that.

549
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:56,580
 But if we say we don't have time to worship God,

550
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:00,900
 to serve God, what it really means is that

551
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,740
 it's not that we don't have time.

552
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:06,300
 Because God is so very fair.

553
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:09,100
 Each one of us gets 24 hours a day, right?

554
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,460
 Nobody gets 26 hours, right?

555
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,540
 Nobody get more, nobody get less.

556
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:18,140
 The matter is whether we have time or not,

557
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:20,020
 it's not the matter.

558
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,860
 It's whether we have the priority right, right?

559
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,900
 What it really means when we say we don't have time

560
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,660
 is that we don't have the priority, right?

561
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:34,500
 Such and such does not have my priority, right?

562
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,220
 It's not number one.

563
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,860
 That's why we say we don't have time.

564
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,180
 Actually, we do have time.

565
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:44,540
 What goes wrong is our life priority.

566
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:49,420
 And Genesis 2 tells us, with Exodus 20,

567
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,220
 is that God is most important.

568
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:55,420
 God is most important.

569
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,820
 We rest and we come before God to worship Him.

570
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:03,260
 Now when we came to Christ, our view of time,

571
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:08,260
 or our perspective on time should change,

572
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:12,420
 should be modified, should be reconfigured

573
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,900
 in such a way that we will honor and keep that holy

574
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,380
 one day a week.

575
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,580
 And realize, because we realize that time

576
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,340
 is a gift of God, right?

577
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,340
 Don't you realize that?

578
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,820
 Some weeks ago, one of the guest speakers talks about

579
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:34,260
 young people, or relatively young people passed away,

580
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:37,380
 right, because of cancer, because of some terminal disease.

581
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,780
 This is tragic, right?

582
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,620
 And life is not in our control.

583
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,180
 Time is not in our control, right?

584
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,740
 And that's why the Bible tells us we have to value time

585
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:53,780
 because time is gifted by God.

586
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,220
 It's a sheer gift.

587
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:01,020
 And time is entrusted to us as treasure, and as money.

588
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:04,580
 Just like money, just like our investment,

589
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,220
 that we need to take care of it,

590
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,060
 and we need to manage it well.

591
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:12,540
 And the Bible, entire Bible, from the first page

592
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:16,060
 to the last page, it says, if God redeem us,

593
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,980
 if we know Christ is our Lord and Savior,

594
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:21,980
 then we are called to faithful management

595
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:24,660
 of all those good things God has given to us,

596
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:26,700
 and that includes time.

597
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,380
 How we manage our time, right?

598
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,940
 Now, with the resurrection of Jesus,

599
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,940
 of course, the calendar for Christians has changed.

600
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,140
 It's shifted from the seventh day to the first day.

601
00:32:39,140 --> 00:32:39,980
 And why?

602
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:43,860
 Gospel of John, chapter 20, it says,

603
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,860
 early on the first day of the week,

604
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,980
 Mary Mellon found the empty tomb.

605
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:53,460
 On the first day of the week, Jesus rose from the dead.

606
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,300
 And the New Testament tells us,

607
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:59,220
 because Christ came and Christ is true Shabbat.

608
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,060
 Christ is a Shabbat.

609
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:04,100
 In Him, we find rest.

610
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:06,420
 In Him, we find the kinship of God

611
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,260
 because Jesus died on the cross,

612
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,220
 and He redeemed us from sin.

613
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:12,260
 And He was buried in the tomb for three days,

614
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:15,340
 and on the third day, He rose from the dead, right?

615
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:19,260
 He rose from the dead to give us new life and new hope.

616
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,140
 And that's what we have in Jesus.

617
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:24,020
 So the day of Shabbat gradually

618
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:26,780
 shift from the seventh day to the first day.

619
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:29,740
 And that's why we gather here, right?

620
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:32,500
 Right, whether it rains or it shines,

621
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,300
 we gather here because we acknowledge

622
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:36,780
 that only Jesus is our King.

623
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:42,700
 Shabbat, faithful management of time, right?

624
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,900
 Now, my questions toward the conclusion is,

625
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,780
 are these, there are some evaluation questions

626
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:53,140
 we need to ask ourselves.

627
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:59,260
 How often do I use Sunday, today,

628
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:04,380
 the day of worship, as an extension of six days of work?

629
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,020
 Right, from Monday to Saturday,

630
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,900
 oh, I got so much to do, right?

631
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:14,420
 That's okay, I'll use Sunday as the extension, right?

632
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:17,140
 I'll keep on doing stuff, right,

633
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,740
 to do my own thing on the day of rest,

634
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:24,460
 or on the day, the worst day of worship.

635
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,500
 How often do we do that?

636
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:28,020
 Yeah, we do that all the time, you know,

637
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,300
 including myself, right?

638
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,060
 Now, that does not mean we just don't do anything

639
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:36,420
 and sit on the sofa for 24 hours, right?

640
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:39,620
 But today, the day, the time of Shabbat

641
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,860
 is to be set aside, and the first priority

642
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,700
 is to worship God and to serve Him, right?

643
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,780
 To serve Him.

644
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:48,340
 To rest and to read scripture, to pray,

645
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:51,020
 to reflect on the past week,

646
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,420
 and to chart the course for the next week,

647
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:54,500
 for the coming week.

648
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,220
 And that's what Shabbat should be like.

649
00:34:58,220 --> 00:35:01,100
 But how often do we use it as an extension

650
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,220
 of the six days of work, right?

651
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:06,380
 Let us repent and let us change.

652
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,100
 You pick up the Bible today,

653
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:13,220
 you know, think about God in a more deep way,

654
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,980
 to reflect on His word,

655
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,700
 to reflect on what God has done in our lives.

656
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,860
 And how do I honor the lost day in action?

657
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,580
 Question number two.

658
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,460
 How do I honor it, right?

659
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,620
 I show up to worship God, no matter what.

660
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,700
 To serve Him, no matter what.

661
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,260
 And how should I plan ahead the lost day

662
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:39,500
 so I can truly worship God, right?

663
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,580
 Remember what I said, the Jewish people,

664
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:46,580
 they would take time to prepare for Shabbat, right?

665
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,820
 It's not like, okay, I wake up this morning,

666
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,820
 I find out, oh, it's time to go to worship.

667
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,780
 Oh man, I didn't plan for it.

668
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,380
 But okay, let's go, right?

669
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,140
 Or I don't go.

670
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,820
 It just happened incidentally to us, right?

671
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,820
 No, Shabbat has to be prepared.

672
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,220
 Observe and keep it holy.

673
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,020
 That means we take action to guard it,

674
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:12,860
 to plan ahead, so that my time worshiping God

675
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:15,100
 will be pleasing to Him.

676
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,180
 Let us all do that.

677
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,660
 Why don't we close in prayer?

678
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:25,260
 And just remember that God is the King of the universe

679
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,860
 and He controls my life.

680
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,300
 And how should I honor Him with my time?

681
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,140
 Let's pray.

682
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,180
 Father, we give you thanks

683
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,580
 because you are the God of creation.

684
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,660
 Everything is in your hand,

685
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:45,580
 including all the details in our lives.

686
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:49,740
 We can rest in you because you rested.

687
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,140
 You rested in your holy of holies.

688
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,360
 You are ruling the entire universe.

689
00:36:56,360 --> 00:36:59,980
 You are managing every details of our lives.

690
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,500
 So we rest in you.

691
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,220
 We don't have to over worry about things in our lives.

692
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:08,060
 We don't have to overwork

693
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,900
 because we know you are in control

694
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,180
 when things don't seem to be in control.

695
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,820
 We know that you can calm the storm,

696
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,820
 even though our life can be going through

697
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:23,500
 some stormy period of time.

698
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:25,140
 We know that you are our King.

699
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:27,440
 And thank you, Jesus, for loving us.

700
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:32,120
 And today we come before you and honor your kingship

701
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,160
 to worship and to serve you.

702
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:37,280
 And I pray that you will bless us the rest of the week,

703
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,760
 that we'll continue with our labor of six days,

704
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,400
 but we'll worship you in our attitude,

705
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,800
 worship you in our heart.

706
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:50,360
 And when we honor and observe the Shabbat,

707
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,000
 we know that you are always in control

708
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:58,000
 and you are indeed worthy of our praises and our worship.

709
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,020
 Thank you for calling us to be your people

710
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:06,280
 and help us to have wisdom how to manage our time well,

711
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,880
 because you are a good God.

712
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,800
 In Christ's name we pray.

713
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:14,460
 Well, God bless you all and happy new year to all of you.

714
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:17,260
 And hopefully I'll see you next week.

715
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,300
 All right, make sure if you have time,

716
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,300
 join our Super Bowl party tonight.

717
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,640
 You can just bring some stuff

718
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,920
 and we can enjoy our time together.
