1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,800
 Good morning family and welcome. I'm glad and excited that we get to open God's

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:10,080
 Word together again this morning. I want to remind you as always that we'd love

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,120
 to hear from you. We'd love for you to connect with us. You can reach out, send

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:18,840
 us an email at info@urbanvoicechurch.com. If there's any way that we can pray for

5
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,800
 you and encourage you, we'd love to know that. Or if you just have comments or

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,320
 questions, we'd love to hear those as well. So please reach out to us. We'd love

7
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,800
 to hear from you. This morning we're going to be looking at Matthew chapter

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:37,520
 7 verses 13 and 14. These are really significant verses in the Sermon on the

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,980
 Mount and really significant verses in our lives and in our faith and our

10
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:46,520
 journey as followers of Jesus. And they're important in understanding the

11
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,080
 application of the values of the kingdom to our lives. So I want us to examine

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,960
 these closely today and to really see what God has to say to us this morning.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,080
 Let's read these together. Matthew chapter 7 verses 13 and 14. "Enter by the

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:06,640
 narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction.

15
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,040
 And those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:19,160
 that leads to life. And those who find it are few." Now what is Jesus saying here?

17
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:24,560
 What's going on in this passage? The metaphor is pretty obvious here. He's

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,640
 talking about two paths that are very different. One that is narrow and

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:36,320
 challenging. Another one that is broad and wide and easy. And Jesus is pointing

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,200
 us to an important truth about what it means to be a follower of Jesus, to be a

21
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,240
 subject of the kingdom, and to live out the values of the kingdom. At this point

22
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,200
 in the Sermon on the Mount, this is towards the end, Jesus is beginning to

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,040
 kind of wrap up the sermon and he's giving us some application. So this

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:58,280
 section, these verses, are really speaking to what it looks like for us to begin to

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,120
 live out the values of the kingdom that he's already been speaking about for the

26
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:08,720
 last almost three chapters of the book of Matthew here. And Jesus is giving us a

27
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,960
 description in this metaphor and it's almost a warning of what it looks like

28
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,840
 to live out the values of the kingdom in our world. That it's not going to be easy,

29
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,960
 it's not going to be simple, it's not even always going to feel great. And Jesus is

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:25,680
 telling us that. And I think it's important to understand that Jesus is

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,480
 telling us that up front because Jesus was never trying to talk us into doing

32
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,080
 something. Jesus was never trying to pull a bait-and-switch. The gospel has always

33
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,840
 been up front about the commitment that is involved. And sometimes us, Christians,

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:47,960
 believers, followers of Jesus in the church, when we share the gospel, we

35
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:52,800
 kind of want to hide that. We kind of want to obscure that and make it seem

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,680
 really easy to people and say, "Hey, it's going to be great. You'll get everything

37
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,520
 you ever want." And that is true. The rewards of the gospel are indescribable.

38
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,640
 They truly are. But that doesn't mean that it's easy. There is very real

39
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,480
 commitment involved and there's often suffering involved. And that's what Jesus

40
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,760
 is telling us here. Jesus is being very honest, very direct, very up front with us

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,360
 about what it means to live out the values of the kingdom in our broken

42
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,680
 world. And that it's not going to be easy. It's not going to be simple. And Jesus is

43
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,040
 telling us some hard truths here. And I love that Jesus does that. There's so

44
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,960
 many beautiful things that Jesus tells us. So many beautiful things in the

45
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:35,320
 Gospels. So many beautiful things right here in the Sermon on the Mount that

46
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:40,280
 Jesus tells us and describes for us. But Jesus doesn't just tell us the good

47
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:44,640
 stuff. He also tells us the challenging things. Jesus also says to us what we

48
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,800
 need to hear but don't want to hear. Jesus tells us the hard truths and I

49
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,640
 love that. And that's what he's doing in these verses. You know God's Word is

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,920
 oftentimes encouraging and comforting to us. But it's also oftentimes challenging

51
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,400
 to us. Sometimes it's both at once. And this is one of those passages that is

52
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920
 challenging. There is comfort and encouragement in it as well. We'll see

53
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,840
 that today. But it's challenging. It is really challenging. So in these verses I

54
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,800
 think there's some important things for us to understand that Jesus is

55
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,080
 communicating. And first of all I want us to consider the fact that Jesus is

56
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:24,080
 telling us the narrow way is not easy. That's what Jesus is saying. The narrow

57
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,000
 way is not an easy way. You know part of the reason the narrow way is not

58
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:35,080
 easy is that it's in opposition to our natural desires and selfishness. Following

59
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,520
 Jesus, living out the values of the kingdom, is really in opposition to the

60
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,440
 things that we naturally want to do. We've been talking about this for so

61
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,160
 long now as we study these values of the kingdom. But living a life of humility, of

62
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,240
 poverty of spirit, that's in opposition to our natural desires which are

63
00:04:52,240 --> 00:05:00,840
 towards pride and self inflation and self promotion. Things like that. Being

64
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,480
 humble and living out poverty of spirit is in opposition to our selfish desires.

65
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:10,720
 So many of the values of the kingdom really oppose our natural desires and

66
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,280
 for that reason it is not easy to walk in the narrow way. It is not easy to live

67
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,440
 out the values of the kingdom. And the reality is that this verse communicates

68
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,120
 that there are times when when the narrow way feels closed in. It feels

69
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,920
 tight. It feels difficult to maneuver through. In verse 13 this word for narrow

70
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:39,560
 the Greek word gives us this this idea of narrow or straight. And narrow or

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,560
 straight because there are obstacles on the sides. It's kind of you can think of

72
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:50,600
 like a narrow corridor through a stone passageway in a castle or something like

73
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,200
 that. Or you can think of maybe walking on a trail. I don't know if you've ever

74
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,720
 hiked a trail like this but I've hiked on some trails where you're walking

75
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,440
 through cliffs kind of and you're on a trail where it's just straight wall on

76
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,120
 this side and straight wall up on that side. It's very narrow and very closed in.

77
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,400
 And that's part of what the Greek word in verse 13 is communicating. That there

78
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,640
 are times when it's gonna feel tight. It's gonna feel difficult to navigate.

79
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,840
 It's gonna feel difficult to go on through because it's not necessarily

80
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,400
 easy. And Jesus is telling us that. He's being up front with us about that. And

81
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,400
 this concept of the narrow way also communicates the fact that there is

82
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,600
 suffering involved. In verse 14 where it says for the gate is narrow. That's

83
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:42,280
 actually a completely different Greek word from the word in verse 13. And the

84
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,680
 word in verse 14 is a word that communicates suffering. It's a word that

85
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,240
 is translated in other parts of the New Testament as affliction or as trouble or

86
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,040
 as suffering tribulation. And so it's saying that this gate is not just

87
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:05,560
 narrow. It's difficult. That there's suffering involved. This path is

88
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:10,640
 challenging to travel. It's hard to travel at times. Just like verse 14 says

89
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,560
 the way is hard. It's not easy. And Jesus is being up front with us and telling us

90
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:20,760
 that. That if we are going to commit to live out the values of the kingdom. If

91
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:24,360
 we're gonna commit to really being a follower of Jesus. If we're gonna commit

92
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:29,960
 to really being serious about obeying him in our life. Then it's not always

93
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:34,000
 gonna be easy. It's gonna be in opposition to our own natural desires.

94
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 And there are times when it's gonna feel tight and closed in. And we're gonna

95
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,720
 feel like it's hard to push on through. But there's also times when it's gonna

96
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,160
 involve suffering. And when it's not gonna feel good in the moment. And when

97
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:51,200
 it's going to hurt. And it's going to involve affliction. That word in

98
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:58,720
 verse 14. The Greek word as also carries this idea of being pressed. Just like

99
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,560
 grapes were pressed to extract the grape juice. It's a word that gives us

100
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,320
 that word picture of being pressed. So that something is gonna be extracted.

101
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,880
 And sometimes that's what following Jesus means. God lets us go through

102
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:21,720
 difficulty and challenges and affliction. So that he can extract impurities and

103
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,920
 things that are not healthy from our life. And fill us with goodness. So

104
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:31,060
 that he can refine us. And there is this concept of suffering that's carried in

105
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:35,320
 these words and in these verses. Another thing we see in these verses is that

106
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:40,800
 this is a narrow gate and a narrow way. And that's important for us to

107
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,560
 understand. Because sometimes we might think of following Jesus as like a

108
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:51,160
 funnel kind of. Or maybe as an uphill climb. And we might think of it as it's

109
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,520
 wide open and easy in the beginning. And everything's great. And then as we get to

110
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,840
 more advanced levels it gets a little bit tougher. Or that's when it gets

111
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:05,320
 challenging. And it is an uphill climb. The journey of faith. Of following Jesus.

112
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:10,320
 So that's not necessarily a bad metaphor. But we need to understand that it's

113
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:17,120
 narrow and straight from beginning to end. And Jesus is letting us know that in

114
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,200
 this verse. That there's only one way to heaven. Jesus himself said that he is the

115
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,320
 only way to the Father. He's the way the truth and the life. It's narrow in the

116
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:32,600
 beginning. It's narrow to get in. It's only by God's grace and by faith in

117
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,920
 Jesus that we can come into salvation. It's a narrow way. It's pretty

118
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:42,440
 exclusive to get in that narrow gate. But then as we travel on it, it's still

119
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:48,120
 narrow. It's not something that as we grow more advanced then maybe we'll

120
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,960
 have an experience of challenge or affliction or trouble. No. God wants to

121
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:58,320
 grow us from the very beginning. And he's gonna allow adversity in our lives to

122
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,600
 stretch us and to grow us from the very beginning. And so we may say, "Well I

123
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,200
 wasn't expecting this. I wasn't ready for this. Sure I thought maybe someday in my

124
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,040
 journey of following Jesus that I'd have to deal with something challenging or

125
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,360
 something difficult. Or God would let me face something that was was difficult.

126
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,320
 But I wasn't expecting this right now because I'm young or I haven't been a

127
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,920
 believer very long." But it's not a funnel. It's something that from the beginning

128
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,120
 God wants to grow us. And God wants to challenge us. And God wants to stretch us.

129
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:32,760
 And we need to understand that. And it doesn't have moments in the middle where

130
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,960
 we just say, "Okay I've been on the narrow way for a while so now I get to just

131
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:43,080
 take some time off and float." And that's not there. It's always going to be a

132
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:47,160
 narrow way beginning to end. Now that doesn't mean that it's not full of

133
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:51,720
 blessing and reward and joy because it is. We're gonna discuss that a little bit

134
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:56,000
 later on. So don't get the wrong idea that following Jesus is just some type

135
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,480
 of difficult drudgery and it's always just sad and hard. That's not the

136
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:06,000
 reality of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. But understand that

137
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,720
 the way is narrow and it is from beginning to end. You know it requires

138
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,720
 commitment. And that's why Jesus is telling us this up front. Why he's

139
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,000
 telling us this in the beginning is that it requires commitment for us to step

140
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,920
 onto the narrow way, to choose to follow him, and to stay on the narrow way. To

141
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,400
 continue to follow him. Jesus is speaking to people that were very familiar with

142
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,880
 faith, very familiar with the Old Testament, very familiar with God. But

143
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,920
 they weren't necessarily familiar with the values of the kingdom that he was

144
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,000
 giving them. And he was being honest with them up front and saying, "If you want to

145
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,440
 step into this life, if you want to begin to live out these values and

146
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:50,280
 follow God in the way that I'm calling you to, it requires commitment. And you've

147
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:54,280
 got to understand that." And that's just as true for us. We need to understand

148
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:59,840
 that there's a commitment required to enter the narrow gate and to walk on

149
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:03,920
 the narrow way. And that brings us to the next thing I want us to consider. And

150
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:09,440
 that is that the narrow way requires intentional pursuit. The narrow way

151
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,160
 requires intentional pursuit. Now this is an obvious point and it's not something

152
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:21,640
 that I need to belabor or explain a lot because it's pretty clear. But I just

153
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:26,120
 want to bring it out for us and remind us that if you are not intentionally

154
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,680
 staying on a narrow path, then you're off the path. I think a good illustration is

155
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,840
 if you think of maybe being on a small path in the forest that's not real well

156
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,080
 marked. I've done a lot of hiking. I love to hike with my family and we do that a

157
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:47,040
 lot. And we've hiked a lot of different types of trails. And some trails you hike

158
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,240
 on that are pretty wide and maybe they're even a gravel trail or they're

159
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,080
 partially paved. It's really easy to see where the trail is and stay on it. But

160
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,440
 some trails you hike that are not well traveled and they're not well marked,

161
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,880
 they may be a very small path. It's not very wide. Just a little footpath through

162
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,360
 the woods. And if there's been leaves blowing around and branches that have

163
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:15,320
 fallen and things like that, it's easy to lose the path. Sometimes trails like that

164
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:20,200
 are marked on, they have little marks of paint on the tree or something else on a

165
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,160
 tree to let you know where the path is. But the point is you have to be

166
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:28,640
 intentionally pursuing that path to stay on it. You have to be looking at the path

167
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:34,320
 to know where it's going and you have to even be looking at the trees and

168
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,520
 other things around you for markers of where that path is. And if you're not paying

169
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,640
 attention, if you're not being intentional, you will get off the path.

170
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:46,560
 And that's just as true in our journey of following Jesus. There are so many

171
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,040
 distractions from the narrow way. There are so many temptations that the devil

172
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,480
 puts in front of us to try to pull us off of the narrow way. There are so many

173
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,040
 off-ramps that the devil puts in front of us and says, "Hey, here's an easy way to

174
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:05,800
 just get off the narrow way and start traveling on the broad way." And the

175
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:11,080
 narrow way requires intentional pursuit. We have to be intentional about staying

176
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:14,920
 on it. Be paying attention. We have to be intentional about our relationship with

177
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:18,640
 God and keeping it healthy and our connection to Him and staying in His

178
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:23,040
 Word and praying and staying connected with other believers in the church and

179
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,160
 checking all of our beliefs against Scripture and against God's truth so

180
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:30,280
 that we don't start to believe erroneous things or things that are going to hurt

181
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,520
 us or hurt someone else. We've got to be intentional about all that stuff because

182
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:39,120
 if we're not intentional about staying on the path, then we're going to be off

183
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,480
 the path. It's just as simple as that. Another thing that's really important

184
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:49,920
 for us to understand, especially for us as younger people that live in our

185
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,960
 modern culture, is that the narrow way is deeply countercultural. The narrow way is

186
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:01,320
 deeply countercultural and that's reflected in these verses. Jesus says in

187
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:08,640
 verse 13, "The gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction and those

188
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:14,440
 who enter by it are many." Those words, the word for wide means that it's broad,

189
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:19,320
 it's flat, it's easy to travel on, and the word for easy means that it's

190
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:25,760
 spacious, there's lots of room, it looks really nice. And there's a lot of

191
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,520
 people on this path. Verse 13 is very clear about that. That means the narrow

192
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:37,040
 way is not popular. It's not a path that is going to be crowded and it's probably

193
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,400
 not the path that many of your friends and acquaintances and co-workers and

194
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:45,960
 classmates and the people around you are going to be on. And it's probably not the

195
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:50,600
 path that your friends and classmates and co-workers and acquaintances and

196
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,200
 maybe even family members, the people around you, it's probably not the path

197
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:57,640
 that they're going to encourage you to go towards. It's probably not the path

198
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,400
 that they're going to support you in walking in. If anything, they're probably

199
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:07,960
 going to try to pull you away from the narrow way and encourage you to walk on

200
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:12,720
 the Broadway because it seems so much easier, right? They say, "Hey, this road is

201
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,560
 flat and easy to travel. It doesn't have the challenges. It doesn't oppose your

202
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:22,440
 selfish desires. On the Broadway, you do whatever you want. If you feel like

203
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,880
 doing something, you do it. If you feel like gratifying yourself in some way,

204
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:32,380
 then you engage in that activity. It's easy. And look, there's so many people on

205
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:36,640
 the Broadway and we're having a great time and this is where you want to be.

206
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:41,960
 It's great over here. All the cool kids are here. So come here. Come to

207
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:47,320
 this way. Don't try to walk on that narrow, difficult path." That's the

208
00:16:47,320 --> 00:16:52,160
 metaphor that Jesus is putting in front of us. And if we're honest, that's the

209
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:57,480
 world that we live in. Most of the people around us are not on the narrow way.

210
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,440
 They're on the broad path and they are calling to us, sometimes implicitly, but

211
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,680
 sometimes explicitly in things that they say to us. They're calling to us to leave

212
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:14,320
 the narrow way and to come walk on the broad path. The narrow way is not

213
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,260
 supported by our culture and by the values of our culture. The values of the

214
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,720
 kingdom are upside down and backwards to the values of our culture. And so our

215
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,400
 culture does not encourage us to live out and walk in the values of the

216
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:33,160
 kingdom. That's just the reality. If you don't believe me, let's just take a

217
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,460
 second and go through some of the kingdom values that we've been talking

218
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,920
 about. Let's just look at the Beatitudes themselves. Think about these.

219
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,800
 The very first one, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of

220
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:49,760
 heaven." Think about that. If you say, "Okay, I'm ready to start a humility club at my

221
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,160
 school or at my job and I'm going to say, 'Hey, this club is all about poverty of

222
00:17:55,160 --> 00:18:00,080
 spirit and humility. Let's sign up. Let's do this.'" How many people

223
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,840
 do you think are going to be excited about joining the humility club? No one.

224
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:09,360
 That's not a value of our culture. If you want to start a club to promote

225
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,720
 yourself, then probably a lot of people would be interested in learning about

226
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,800
 that. But humility is not a value of our culture. What about purity of heart? Is

227
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:22,080
 that a value of our culture? Is that a value that your friends are going to

228
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,560
 encourage you to walk in and to live out? No, it's not. These things that Jesus

229
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:32,800
 talks about in the Beatitudes are really upside down and backwards to what we

230
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:37,840
 live out and practice in our culture. What about being meek and gentle? Is that

231
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,720
 a cultural value? It's not. What about hungering and thirsting after

232
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:47,600
 righteousness? Is that a cultural value? What about being a peacemaker? In our

233
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:55,040
 modern moment of turbulence and anger and frustration and division, everywhere

234
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:59,140
 you look, it is not a cultural value to be a peacemaker. And if you try to be a

235
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:02,780
 peacemaker, some people are going to be very upset at you and very angry at you.

236
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:07,800
 Look at what's going on in our politics and in our society here in the

237
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:12,600
 United States. People make money. People fundraise. People get votes and get

238
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:17,800
 elected off of division and fear. And so if you're spreading peace, people don't

239
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,240
 want to see that. People in power want others to experience division and fear

240
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,520
 because that keeps them in power. And so if you're a peacemaker, that's not going

241
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,440
 to be a popular value. What about these values later on in Matthew chapter 5

242
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,800
 where Jesus talks about loving our enemies and turning the other cheek to

243
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:42,480
 someone who has wronged us? Are those popular values? Do you think you can get

244
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:47,160
 those off the ground with anybody in our culture? No. No one wants to hear that.

245
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:51,480
 Certainly no one wants to practice it. But people don't even want to hear that

246
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:57,080
 expressed. People oftentimes don't even want to hear forgiveness expressed in

247
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:02,200
 our culture because we are a culture that wants to take revenge and seek

248
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,520
 retribution anytime that we've been wronged. No one wants to hear someone say,

249
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:11,000
 "Hey, Jesus calls us to forgive." No one wants to hear that value in our

250
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,920
 culture. What about in Matthew chapter 6 later on where Jesus talks about

251
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:21,080
 storing up treasures in heaven? Do you think that's a value in our culture? Do you

252
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:23,400
 think that's something that people are going to be excited about and encourage

253
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,920
 you to live out? Is making decisions on earth with your finances that have

254
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:34,280
 eternity in mind? Is anyone going to think that's a good idea? No. People are

255
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,280
 going to say, "Hey, this is for you. You use this to take care of you. You

256
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,440
 don't use this to store up treasures in heaven. That doesn't make any sense."

257
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:46,400
 What about in Matthew chapter 5 when Jesus talks about anger and lust and he

258
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,160
 says, "Hey, you should not even entertain these thoughts in your mind because

259
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,840
 that's sinning." What if you try to live those out? Think about that. Young people

260
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:58,520
 think about that. If you have a conversation with your friend and you

261
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:04,600
 explain to them, "Hey, I'm trying to even avoid sexual sin in my mind, to not even

262
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,280
 have thoughts of lust in my mind because I feel like that's sinful. And so because

263
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,360
 of that I want to avoid pornography or because of that I'm really careful about

264
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:18,680
 the situations I put myself in." That's something that people will make fun of

265
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:23,080
 you for. I've had those conversations. I've been made fun of that. If you say,

266
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:30,000
 "Hey, I want my sexuality to honor God and because of that I'm only going to have

267
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,160
 certain types of relationships or I'm going to wait until I'm married to

268
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:38,600
 engage in sexual activity." That's something that people will mock you for.

269
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,680
 That is not a cultural value and we need to understand that. If we are serious

270
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:47,400
 about living out the values of the kingdom, the culture around us does not

271
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,240
 share those values and is not going to support them and it's not going to

272
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:55,000
 encourage them and a lot of times will oppose them and mock them. And that's a

273
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:02,640
 part of walking on the narrow way and we need to be ready for that. The narrow way

274
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,840
 often leads to persecution. Jesus told us that in Matthew 5 verses 11 and 12

275
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,880
 when he said that we were going to experience persecution. And here he's

276
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,560
 expanding on that and letting us know why. Because we're walking on a way that

277
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:20,720
 doesn't make sense to people who don't know God. We're walking on a way that is

278
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:26,600
 narrow and difficult and everyone else is on the broad and easy way. Another

279
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:30,080
 thing I want us to see here in these verses is that Jesus only describes two

280
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,000
 paths. He says there's the narrow way and the broad way and he doesn't describe

281
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,040
 anything else. And that's important for us to understand as well. There is no

282
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:42,400
 middle way. Sometimes we think, "Well I can kind of keep a foot in both worlds. I

283
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:47,640
 can kind of do both. I can kind of be involved in following Jesus and

284
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,600
 in living out kingdom values a little bit. But I can also be involved in

285
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:54,800
 living out the values of the world around me." But there is no middle way and

286
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,920
 Jesus has already talked to us about that in the Beatitudes when he told us

287
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:02,360
 no one can serve two masters. So that's not really an option even though we

288
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:06,080
 want it to be an option. It's not. Jesus doesn't give us that option. He only

289
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:11,000
 talks about two paths and he's clear that only one path leads to life. One

290
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,600
 path leads to destruction and there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Jesus makes it

291
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:21,240
 clear the broad way, even though it's easy and popular and seems great, it

292
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:28,480
 leads to destruction both in this life and in eternity. And the only way that

293
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,520
 leads to life is the narrow way. And that's what I want us to see as we close

294
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:39,060
 this out. That there is a reward to the narrow way. Now so far the things we've

295
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:43,280
 talked about can seem discouraging and burdensome like, "Wow this sounds so tough

296
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:48,000
 and I don't know if I want to be on the narrow way because it just sounds really

297
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,360
 grim and it's something that I really want to live out." But we need to

298
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,600
 understand that there is a reward to the narrow way and it's an amazing and

299
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,200
 indescribable reward. Now first of all there's a reward of everlasting life.

300
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:12,800
 Jesus says that the narrow way leads to life and that word has multiple

301
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,040
 connotations here and so it means everlasting life. Scripture is clear

302
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,440
 about that. If you think about John 3 16, it says Jesus is the way to eternal life.

303
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:27,120
 John 5 24, where Jesus says that eternal life comes through believing in

304
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,400
 him. There's many other verses that talk about Jesus being the way to eternal

305
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,120
 life. But that is a part of the reward. That when our earthly life is over and

306
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,600
 our body dies, our soul will not die but will go into the presence of God in

307
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,880
 heaven and live eternally in a perfectly beautiful place with no sin, no

308
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,960
 injustice, no disease, no tears. All the terrible things that we experience in

309
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,360
 this life will be gone and we'll have eternal life in the presence of God. That

310
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,600
 in and of itself would be reward enough even if life was full of suffering and

311
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,640
 challenges to achieve that. It would be reward enough. But that's not the only

312
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:13,560
 reward. Jesus is clear that there is life in this life that is a reward here. Like

313
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:17,440
 I said, this word that the narrow way leads to life has multiple

314
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,240
 connotations and it refers to our life in the here and now as well. In John 10

315
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,920
 10, Jesus talks about that. How he came so that we could have abundant life. That

316
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:31,760
 word abundant means have life to the full and we could experience what we

317
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:36,880
 were truly created to experience. And that is a part of the reward of the

318
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:42,000
 narrow way that we get to experience and live out if we follow God and live out

319
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:48,000
 kingdom values. We experience that in this life. Life to the full. The life that

320
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,540
 we were created for. A life of perfect and healthy fellowship with the God who

321
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:58,000
 made us and a life of healthy fellowship with the people around us. And that's

322
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,640
 something significant because what truly gives meaning to life? Is it the food we

323
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:09,640
 eat? Is it the money we make? Is it the things that we go do? I think all of us

324
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:14,840
 if we examine for very long we can see that what truly gives meaning to our

325
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,160
 life is the relationships that we have. That's why we enjoy the food if we're

326
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,880
 enjoying it with with people that are important to us. That's why we enjoy the

327
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,960
 experiences and the concerts and the events that we go to is if we're doing

328
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:31,640
 them with people that we love. That's what makes life meaningful is those

329
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:37,720
 relationships and the narrow way living out the values of the kingdom gives us

330
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:43,440
 the opportunity to experience truly healthy relationships. Like we talked

331
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,240
 about last week a truly healthy relationship with God the one who made

332
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:51,760
 us as we love him first and out of that we can start to live the golden rule and

333
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:55,360
 truly love the people around us and experience truly healthy relationships

334
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,680
 in our marriages, in our families, in our communities, in our cities, in our world.

335
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:09,200
 So this promise of life is for the here and now as well and it also gives us

336
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,760
 something significant in the suffering and adversity that we face and that is a

337
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,440
 purpose. The reality is everyone experiences suffering and adversity in

338
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:22,240
 this world because our world is broken by sin. Even if you're not a follower of

339
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,960
 Jesus you're gonna go through some difficult times and if you are not a

340
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:30,000
 follower of Jesus if you're not living out the values of the kingdom then it's

341
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,560
 so difficult to find the meaning and the purpose in that suffering. It feels like

342
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:36,840
 there is no meaning and purpose in it. Why does this even happen? And that's

343
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:41,840
 why so many people can end up angry at God and say, "God why would you allow evil

344
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,000
 to be in our world? Why does this stuff happen? Why do you let any of these bad

345
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,320
 things take place?" But for a follower of Jesus, for someone who's living out the

346
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,320
 values of the kingdom, we can see that God is using that adversity and that

347
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,520
 suffering in our lives to grow us and to stretch us and to make us more like

348
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:03,160
 Jesus and to make us more able to love God and to love others. And so that gives

349
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:07,960
 purpose even in the challenging difficult moments of our life and that's

350
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,080
 a huge part of the blessing of walking in the narrow way. It's not that the

351
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:18,640
 narrow way is easy, it's challenging, but we see the meaning in the challenges. We

352
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:23,720
 see the purpose in the challenges that God brings into our life and it gives us

353
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:28,000
 that sense of shalom that we talked about last week. It's so powerful that

354
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,880
 God desires for us to have that sense of wholeness and that sense of

355
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:38,200
 health and prosperity and peace and justice and of permanence in our

356
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,280
 life because that only comes through right relationship with God and through

357
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:47,280
 seeking to live out the values of the kingdom. And I want us to see this, I

358
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,600
 don't want us to miss this because this is really big. We are not alone on the

359
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:57,520
 narrow way. Verses 13 and 14 tell us that there are many people on the broad

360
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,600
 way and sometimes when we read that and then read the words that follow we just

361
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,840
 assume that well I guess the narrow way means you're by yourself. It doesn't say

362
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:12,960
 that. It says those who find it are few. It doesn't say that those who find it

363
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,560
 are alone. And so even though there are times when the narrow way can feel

364
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:23,280
 lonely because it is countercultural and we're not encouraged to

365
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,600
 walk on that way by many of the people around us, we are not alone. First of all

366
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,920
 we have that relationship with God that strengthens us and sustains us and keeps

367
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:36,880
 us going. But secondly God through his body, through the church, through the

368
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:41,840
 the family of God as the New Testament calls us, puts all these people around us

369
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,160
 who love us and care for us and support us that we can fellowship with, that we

370
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:50,320
 can be encouraged by, that we can be cared for by, and that we can in turn

371
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,280
 care for them and encourage them and serve them and help them. We are not

372
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,840
 alone on the narrow way and that's encouraging to us in the times of

373
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:04,440
 challenge and it also is a part of that that abundant life. Life to the full is

374
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,440
 experiencing those truly healthy relationships that God gives us in in

375
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,280
 the family of God and the church. And then we have the opportunity to truly

376
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:18,240
 love the world around us. We talked about that last week when we were discussing

377
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:22,440
 the golden rule that it's so hard for us as humans to love and care for anyone

378
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:28,280
 else in a truly unselfish way. We always have some type of selfish motivation at

379
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:32,880
 the heart of what we do but through the work of Jesus in our heart and the power

380
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:37,600
 of the Holy Spirit in our lives we can actually be a conduit of God's love to

381
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,960
 others and we really can love the people around us, the people who don't know

382
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,160
 Jesus. We really can love and serve them in a truly unselfish and loving way and

383
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,280
 have life-giving relationships with people who are outside the church and

384
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,440
 that's a part of that life to the full. So there is great reward to walking in

385
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,840
 the narrow way. It is totally worth it and God calls us to it. We need to

386
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,360
 understand that it's not easy. We need to understand that there's commitment

387
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,840
 required. We need to understand that there's intentionality required that we

388
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,640
 have to pay attention and stay focused to stay on that path. We need to

389
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,120
 understand that it's countercultural and that we are not going to be encouraged

390
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:22,680
 in the narrow way by most of the people around us but we need to understand that

391
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:28,240
 it is full of reward and beauty and goodness because God loves us and he is

392
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:32,680
 full of grace and he's extending that grace to us even as he calls us to walk

393
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:38,880
 on the narrow way. Let's pray. God thank you for this truth and just for how

394
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,320
 clearly and directly you lay it out in this passage that you call us to walk on

395
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,560
 the narrow way. It's not an easy way. It requires commitment. It requires

396
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:55,280
 intentional pursuit. We have to follow after you and God it is full of

397
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:01,080
 challenges. There's a lot of difficulties in life but there is so much reward and

398
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:05,080
 so God I pray that we would not be surprised by the challenges or the

399
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:08,920
 adversity of our life. We would see what you're saying here and understand that

400
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:13,040
 that it's going to be challenging at times and we would understand the

401
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,300
 commitment and the intentionality that's required and we would

402
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,780
 dedicate ourselves to having that commitment and living that out

403
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:25,560
 intentionally and God as we do I pray that we would experience your reward in

404
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:29,560
 our lives. That we would really begin to be so saturated with the values of the

405
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:33,720
 kingdom that they're flowing out of our life in a life-giving way to others. That

406
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,080
 we would live out these values of the kingdom that when it's difficult, when

407
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,520
 we're made fun of, or when people don't understand or oppose us that it would

408
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:44,480
 not stop us from living out the values of the kingdom and God that we would

409
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,120
 experience your life to the full. We know we'll experience that one day in heaven but

410
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,600
 even now in this life that we would experience it to the full. That we would

411
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:58,040
 live in healthy relationship to you. That you would just pour your love and your

412
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:03,000
 life into us and that we would be a conduit of your love and your life to

413
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,680
 others. That we would be able to to have healthy and life-giving relationships

414
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,680
 with those around us. God in Jesus name, Amen.
