[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   and I'm so glad to be invited back again.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.160]   Last time I talked about art and beauty
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.760]   and took far too long.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.560]   And this time, I know I'm supposed to stay
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.760]   within 25 minutes.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.860]   So I'm gonna do that.
[00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.640]   That's why I have notes and now I have a clock
[00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.160]   and I have all these things to help me stay on time.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.000]   All right.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.040]   So it's always a pleasure to be here and a delight.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.680]   Today, I'm gonna be talking about the power of storytelling.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.920]   But before we begin, I wanna make sure
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.400]   that we talk just a minute
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.400]   about why stories are so compelling.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.700]   So what do we get out of stories?
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.920]   What's the purpose?
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.840]   What purpose do they serve?
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.680]   So, one is that it's for enjoyment.
[00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.560]   So it entertains us.
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.280]   It lets us escape from our day-to-day stresses.
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.440]   Like this book, "Harry Potter,"
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.080]   which maybe some of you have read or read the sequels,
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.600]   watched all the films, went to the theme park,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.080]   bought an owl and are like crazy fans.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.640]   But pure fun and entertainment.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.120]   You didn't buy an owl?
[00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.160]   Oh yeah, me too, me too.
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.720]   And then like a little wand and everything
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.060]   and a lightning tattoo.
[00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.580]   (audience member laughing)
[00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.180]   So other times, stories are there to educate us
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.940]   so we can learn something new that can improve our lives.
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.980]   One book that's been on the New York Times bestseller list
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.100]   is this one by Oprah Winfrey.
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.540]   So anything by Oprah Winfrey
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.980]   usually gets on a bestseller list.
[00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.660]   This book is about trauma and how it lives in our body
[00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.860]   and how we can heal from it.
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.420]   Another reason we love stories
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.020]   is that stories connect us with other people.
[00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.540]   So it helps us engage,
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:05.060]   has like an emotional attachment to it.
[00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.620]   Perhaps in reading someone else's story,
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.860]   we can see a mirror to ourselves
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.100]   and know that we're not alone.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.660]   This book is called "Crying in H Mart,"
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:15.940]   and it's about a daughter
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.340]   who takes care of her really sick mom
[00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.060]   and is really overwhelmed.
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.500]   And one day while grocery shopping,
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.140]   can't hold it in anymore.
[00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.540]   So for those of us who have been there,
[00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.700]   we know that when we're so stressed,
[00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.720]   even the most mundane task of grocery shopping
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.680]   can feel very daunting or triggering.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.900]   So here we have all these compelling reasons
[00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.220]   to love stories, to read stories, to listen to stories.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.440]   But why, Rebecca, are you here talking about stories?
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.400]   So you've been asked to come,
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.500]   and as a guest speaker,
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.560]   I feel like it's really important
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.760]   that I talk about things that I know.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.620]   And Pastor Mark talks about things that he knows.
[00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.380]   And I know a lot about stories
[00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.020]   because I'm an author and I self-published my book.
[00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.300]   And through that process,
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.180]   I learned a lot about editing,
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.540]   what it means to tell a story well.
[00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.620]   And I wear a lot of different hats professionally.
[00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.980]   So as an educator, as a workshop facilitator,
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.160]   if I think about it, story is really the common denominator.
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.920]   And everything we do,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:26.800]   when there's a story attached to it,
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.000]   we learn so much better,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.200]   and the lesson is far more meaningful.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.160]   And I've witnessed when people,
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:38.560]   listeners are glued to a storyteller
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.000]   because they're just so good.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.360]   And that's just like human-made stories, right?
[00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.340]   Like stories that we write as humans.
[00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.560]   So imagine how much better it could be
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.440]   when it's a God-made story.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.900]   And that's what we're gonna talk about today.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.400]   So today, the goal is really to see
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.080]   the power of storytelling through Jesus, who's the goat.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.440]   So if you don't know what goat means,
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.380]   it means greatest of all time.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:11.300]   And if you don't think Jesus is the goat storyteller,
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.400]   we're gonna go through it,
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:13.400]   and hopefully by the end,
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.140]   you're gonna see why he is the greatest of all time.
[00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.500]   So today's story is the parable of the lost sheep.
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.300]   Maybe it's familiar to you, maybe it's not.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.920]   Regardless, I hope that you'll see
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.860]   that through this simple story,
[00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:32.200]   that Jesus is really compelling all of us
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.060]   to listen well and to learn.
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:37.740]   So a parable in its definition is a short story
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.780]   that teaches us a spiritual truth.
[00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.900]   So parable rhymes with fable.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.380]   It's similar to a fable.
[00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.780]   Maybe you've read it or heard the story
[00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:52.080]   of the tortoise and the hare or the lion and the mouse.
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.180]   These teach a moral.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.180]   In a parable, it teaches through a metaphor, usually,
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.260]   and it's to apply to our spiritual lives.
[00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.940]   So if you can turn to your Bibles if you have them,
[00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.980]   or on your phone, or read along with me,
[00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.300]   we're in Luke chapter 15, verses one through seven.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.660]   This is the NIV translation.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.460]   Now the tax collectors and sinners
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.900]   were all gathering around to hear Jesus,
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.820]   but the Pharisees and the teachers of the law muttered,
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.780]   which means that they're grumbling,
[00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.760]   this man welcomes sinners and eats with them.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.980]   Then Jesus told this parable,
[00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:40.820]   suppose one of you had 100 sheep and loses one of them.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.020]   Doesn't he leave the 99 in the open country
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.060]   and go after the lost sheep until he finds it?
[00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.660]   And when he finds it, he joyfully puts it on his shoulders
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.500]   and goes home.
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.980]   Then he calls his friends and neighbors together
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:03.260]   and says, rejoice with me, I found my lost sheep.
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.460]   I tell you, in the same way,
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:11.140]   there will be more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.740]   who repents over 99 righteous persons
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.980]   who don't need to repent.
[00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:18.380]   So in some translations,
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:22.060]   the word parable means picture story,
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:25.780]   sort of like a comic book or a graphic novel in modern time.
[00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.660]   So I'm gonna lead you through a picture story
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.940]   of this very parable.
[00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.020]   So here we have, right, here's a pasture, grassy field,
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.980]   here's the setting, and then the owner of the sheep goes,
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.660]   hey, go eat some grass.
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.980]   Sheep go graze.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.140]   They go graze, they walk around, they roam around,
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.820]   they come upon maybe some trees.
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.660]   The owner doesn't count, sort of like on a field trip.
[00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.040]   Oh no, one is missing.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.180]   Where's that one?
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:56.540]   Maybe that one is scared, but I also have to leave the 99
[00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:58.980]   in order to find that one or I can't.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.940]   (laughs)
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.400]   Maybe the sheep is calling for the owner.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.720]   The owner finally finds the sheep,
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.520]   puts it on his shoulders, is so happy,
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.920]   and says, hey everyone, I found my lost sheep.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.760]   Everyone, let's go party.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.160]   So that's my retelling of the story in pictures.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.840]   Now if we think about stories,
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.440]   I want us to look at this quote.
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:27.040]   It says, the best stories are the stories
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.440]   that any and everyone can understand and relate to.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:34.240]   So it's a quote from a pretty smart person,
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.360]   and that person was my editor for my book that I wrote.
[00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.920]   It's called Moving in Forever,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.660]   and it's a picture book about hospice care.
[00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:46.800]   So it's a heavy topic, and this is what she would tell me
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.880]   all the time when we were working on my book,
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:53.400]   because it's a book that's very personal to me
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.360]   about my college roommate who died.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.580]   So I wanted to write every single detail down
[00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:02.040]   from my perspective, 'cause I felt that was necessary.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:03.760]   And of course, my perspective
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.140]   and all those details are really valid,
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.380]   but if I'm to publish this book to make it meaningful
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.260]   for other people, other families, other children,
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:14.620]   I have to edit it.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:17.820]   I have to make it so that any and everyone
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.160]   can understand it and relate to it,
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.240]   'cause otherwise, the impact will not be there.
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.860]   So this is what we're gonna do today.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:30.660]   We're gonna do a Bible study on this parable,
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.660]   but through the lens and eyes of an editor/publisher/writer.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.660]   So we're gonna decide as editors,
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:43.380]   if this story is up to snuff, is it gonna be a hit?
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.880]   Is it gonna be a New York Times bestseller or not?
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:52.320]   And how you do this is you have to look at it
[00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:56.700]   with some level of scrutiny.
[00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.780]   So when my editor looked at my manuscript,
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.560]   she made sure that I was okay
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.620]   with whatever she's gonna say to me.
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.980]   We have to look at it with some level of inspection,
[00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:09.300]   just like your writing teachers at school
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.620]   might be looking at your essays
[00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:12.260]   and your papers with inspection.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:15.900]   What do they look for?
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.380]   What do editors and publishers look for?
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.740]   First, it's like the structure.
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.660]   Does it have good bones to a well-written story,
[00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.780]   beginning, middle, and end, and everything in between?
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.760]   And does it have the components of a well-written story?
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.300]   And it's those two parts that give you
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.280]   a story that's good enough, a good story.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.520]   But we're not here in the Bible to look at good stories.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.420]   We're here to look at great stories.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:45.740]   We're here to be compelled and convicted.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.040]   So these stories need powerful storytelling,
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:52.180]   good and strong storytelling,
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.560]   so that it's powerful.
[00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:57.420]   Otherwise, it's just good enough.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:00.760]   And Jesus was never just good enough.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.860]   So let's look.
[00:10:02.860 --> 00:10:06.380]   Let's see if this parable of the lost sheep
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:09.780]   survives our inspection.
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:13.460]   So does it have a structure?
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:14.860]   Does it have the bones?
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.460]   Okay, yes, as a beginning,
[00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.660]   we are oriented to the setting where we are.
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.240]   The sheep are grazing.
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:24.840]   There is an owner or a shepherd.
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:27.960]   And in every great story, there's a problem.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:31.880]   The problem is, oh no, one goes missing.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.940]   We don't leave the problem hanging.
[00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.780]   We have to do something about it.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:37.340]   There has to be an action.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.980]   What are the characters gonna do?
[00:10:38.980 --> 00:10:42.200]   In this case, they're gonna leave the 99
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.560]   and go find that one.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.040]   You keep finding, you keep finding.
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.240]   And as listeners and readers, we want a resolution.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.400]   Is there one?
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:54.880]   Yes, finally found the lost sheep.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.200]   Yay!
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.080]   And what is the ending about?
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:10:59.320]   It's what do the characters do
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.400]   after the problem's been fixed?
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.160]   So now everyone celebrates with the party.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.480]   Okay, the bones are there, check.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.160]   Are the components there in the parable of the lost sheep?
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.680]   Is it a good story?
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:16.400]   Well, we have the characters, got that.
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.320]   And then we have the setting.
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.400]   The main plot really is the lost is found.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:25.040]   Classic, straightforward, and the message is
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.720]   the lost matters even if it's only one.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.560]   And the voice that Jesus uses
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.580]   within this parable of the sheep is pretty firm.
[00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.500]   And diction is just a fancy word to say
[00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.920]   the choice of words that the writer
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.360]   or the author chooses to use, or the storyteller.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.360]   So in this case, Jesus uses suppose one of you.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:50.680]   Well, doesn't he?
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:53.160]   And joyfully finds a lost sheep.
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.320]   So he chooses these specific words
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.640]   to tell this specific story to this specific audience.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.040]   So we got the structure, we got the components,
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.160]   but do we have good storytelling?
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:09.480]   Or else it's just maybe B plus, right?
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.880]   And our Jesus is not a B plus student.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.640]   He's like A plus, plus extra credit,
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.760]   plus like principles, that's like
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.680]   everything valedictorian, right?
[00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:20.080]   So we have to have, and those of us who are Asian here
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.180]   and felt that academic pressure, you would understand.
[00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:28.700]   Good storytelling, as my editor has told me,
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:32.440]   and what she has learned from the entire industry
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:37.240]   and profession of copywriters, are these aspects,
[00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.480]   these areas.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:41.200]   So you have to have a trusted teller.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.720]   So whether it's the writer, the author,
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:45.120]   or the person speaking, do people care
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.720]   about what this person's saying?
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:49.800]   Is this person worthwhile, right?
[00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:52.520]   If Oprah Winfrey were to tell you a story,
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.920]   I'm sure it'd be packed.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:56.280]   But I don't know, maybe not.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.180]   If it were someone else, I don't know.
[00:12:58.180 --> 00:13:01.400]   Then is there enough drama?
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.980]   'Cause if there's not enough drama,
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:06.140]   we're not gonna be captivated, we won't be invested.
[00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.440]   We actually like the up and down of all the emotions.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:13.440]   Is it relatable?
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.840]   Can I identify with it?
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:17.360]   Does it matter to me personally?
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.760]   And does it matter to anybody else?
[00:13:19.760 --> 00:13:23.280]   Is it simple?
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.880]   So the most powerful stories
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.620]   are the simplest stories, actually.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:32.800]   And every word and every sentence progresses the narrative.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.120]   So we don't waste time, we don't waste space.
[00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.840]   Agency.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.640]   Agency is, does the reader or the listener
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.100]   have the power and freedom to make meaning on their own?
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.200]   So when I was trained to be a teacher
[00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:53.560]   for elementary education, in class, in grad school,
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:58.560]   I was told, "He who does the work does the learning."
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:01.920]   So I could teach children all they need to know.
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:04.340]   I can tell them exactly what they need to know.
[00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:07.340]   And they only need to memorize it and regurgitate it.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.960]   But that type of meaning, that type of learning
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.080]   is not meaningful to them.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.660]   It's much better when they connect the dots,
[00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:17.760]   when they can make meaning out of it,
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:19.760]   when they can have a personal connection
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.400]   to whatever we're learning.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:23.440]   Okay, so now we're gonna see,
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:28.440]   does the parable fit good storytelling aspects
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:31.600]   as we see it in the copywriting world?
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.540]   All right, so, trusted teller.
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:36.760]   Well, yeah, it's Jesus.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.780]   People are lining up to listen to this man, right?
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.160]   God in human form.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.420]   Yes, we trust this teller.
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.100]   We care what he says.
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.940]   Check.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.800]   Drama, lost and found, lots of emotion.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:53.000]   Fear, joy, worry, celebration.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.300]   That's a lot.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.540]   Is it relatable?
[00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:00.540]   Now back then, herding sheep is pretty common knowledge,
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:04.140]   but just in case it's not, to these Pharisees,
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.380]   actually in the rest of the chapter in Luke,
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:11.840]   Jesus tells other lost and found stories,
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:13.580]   like the parable of the lost coin.
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.460]   Have you ever lost money?
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:17.860]   The parable of the prodigal son.
[00:15:17.860 --> 00:15:20.020]   Have you ever lost a child?
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:24.080]   So there is a lot of relatability here already.
[00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:25.440]   And is it simple?
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:28.460]   It's, I don't, if you count the lines,
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:30.460]   it's maybe four to five lines of the story,
[00:15:30.460 --> 00:15:32.160]   you can't get simpler than that.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.180]   And every single piece moves the narrative.
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:38.140]   And is there agency?
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:41.740]   So here is kind of tricky, because in the Bible,
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:45.700]   we don't know if, what these Pharisees
[00:15:45.700 --> 00:15:47.880]   or these religious leaders said
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.540]   after listening to the story.
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:51.800]   The Bible doesn't say, necessarily.
[00:15:51.800 --> 00:15:54.740]   They didn't say if they stood up and clapped,
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:56.220]   or they stood up and left.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:57.500]   It doesn't say.
[00:15:57.500 --> 00:16:02.100]   But that's the beauty of agency, isn't it, for us,
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.000]   because we have the ability to make meaning
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.520]   out of it for ourselves.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:12.380]   So, looks like, check, check, check, we have it all.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.280]   Now I'm gonna share with you another quote
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.120]   from a very wise person.
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:22.720]   "Sometimes we need to zoom out a bit
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.560]   "to see the bigger picture.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.340]   "Perhaps this is a story within a larger story."
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:31.780]   You might be thinking, wow, what a wise thing to say.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:34.220]   And you're wondering, who said it?
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.620]   Well, I said it.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.140]   I say it to my kids all the time,
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.620]   'cause as you know, I'm a teacher, I'm an artist,
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:45.540]   I'm an author, so I'm pretty much like a teacher nerd mom
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:48.620]   to my children, and I wanted to show you
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:52.560]   how we at home read the Bible and read stories
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:54.860]   and look at it with inspection.
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:17:00.880]   So on the left here, you'll see a picture of our bookshelf.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:05.720]   And it has just a collection of Bible stories.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:09.360]   And these are like one book of one story,
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.120]   all designed for kids.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.860]   And on the right, you'll see a stack
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:15.720]   of what I call the Bible Bibles.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.540]   So it's not that the other ones aren't real,
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.280]   but these are the Bible Bibles we use
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:22.920]   for reference and quiet time.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:26.600]   And the very top one is mine, and I tell the kids
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:29.160]   that that's what adults read.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:31.520]   There's no pictures in it, there's lots of footnotes
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.880]   and lots of words and really tiny text.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.400]   And then I say that, but then actually I read
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.960]   all of the other ones way more frequently
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:40.920]   than I read my own.
[00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:45.960]   And what we do, let's say for example,
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:49.340]   on the left side, I pull out a Noah's Ark story,
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:52.580]   and I have a few copies of them from different authors,
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:56.560]   different publishers, to see how the story changes
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.200]   based on who's telling it.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.040]   The crux of the story is the same,
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:02.440]   but maybe one is only pictures.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:06.860]   Another one, maybe they take out a little bit,
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:10.560]   but we don't know that until we go to the right
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.760]   and pull out a Bible Bible and look at
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.960]   what is the bigger story, what is the bigger picture?
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.040]   'Cause these are not standalone stories,
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.380]   is what I wanted to make sure my kids understood.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:25.840]   Noah's Ark is not a standalone story.
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:28.640]   Easter is not a standalone story.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:31.320]   They all fit into a larger context,
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:35.240]   a larger story inside the Bible itself.
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:40.240]   And it's the same for this parable of the lost sheep.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.720]   So it's part of a larger story,
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:48.400]   but it really depends on how far you zoom out.
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.560]   So we have the parable of the lost sheep.
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:55.080]   If we zoom out maybe 25%,
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.220]   there's actually another story that's being told
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:00.360]   of Jesus teaching.
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.800]   It's Jesus's teaching story.
[00:19:02.800 --> 00:19:05.040]   And if we zoom out even more,
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:08.380]   all of Jesus's teaching story are in the New Testament.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:12.680]   We zoom out even more, well, it's really
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.400]   the huge story of the Bible from creation
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.260]   all the way to redemption and us reuniting with God.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:23.760]   But how far do we zoom out?
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.240]   For today, we're just gonna zoom out like 25%.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.600]   We're just gonna zoom out to Jesus teaching
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:31.440]   just a little bit, right?
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.400]   So if we zoom out, we'll see
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:40.200]   that the lost sheep parable here
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:45.200]   doesn't essentially change, but how he tells it changes.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.980]   So these are the components of the parable
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:49.240]   of the lost sheep, right?
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:50.780]   We already talked about this.
[00:19:50.780 --> 00:19:54.460]   And if you look outside,
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.700]   like before he starts telling the parable in Luke,
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:02.380]   there's actually more characters to this story.
[00:20:02.380 --> 00:20:03.940]   There are religious leaders, there are sinners,
[00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:05.340]   there's lots of people here.
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:11.120]   And as the setting and other components add on,
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:14.020]   you'll see this metaphor built up.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.100]   It's not just about lost and found.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:19.940]   It's about addressing the leader's biases.
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:23.860]   It's about saying not just one sheep matters.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.220]   It's saying, hey, we don't need
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:31.420]   to have a person look a certain way, be a certain way
[00:20:31.420 --> 00:20:33.700]   to be able to enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:37.340]   All we need is belief and repentance.
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:42.340]   Now, even though within the parable of the lost sheep,
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:48.060]   Jesus' voice is firm, I wanna say that outside of that,
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.700]   that storyline above it,
[00:20:50.700 --> 00:20:53.700]   he's actually pretty clever and witty.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:58.500]   So the Pharisees and the religious leaders
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.740]   are basically grumbling.
[00:20:59.740 --> 00:21:01.780]   They're like, oh my goodness, look at that Jesus.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.660]   He's like talking to sinners and like eating with them.
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:06.740]   Basically, ew, gross, right?
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.680]   Like how horrible, dirty.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:15.020]   Jesus doesn't really like respond to that directly,
[00:21:15.020 --> 00:21:18.680]   but you can see by the words he chooses.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.020]   He just tells them a story.
[00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.460]   He's like, well, there's just gonna be more rejoicing
[00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:25.100]   for that one sinner who repents
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:30.100]   than all 99 righteous people who don't need to repent.
[00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:33.860]   Link, link, like who are these 99 righteous people?
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.380]   And I found that really genius
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.060]   because he didn't really have to say anything.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.580]   And it's like, mic drop.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:44.420]   And it reminds me of my grandma
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.700]   'cause she used to do that to me.
[00:21:46.700 --> 00:21:50.440]   So she used to tell me these stories
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.480]   in order to get me to do or not do something.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:58.700]   A typical story is, it's all in Chinese,
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.800]   but in English it goes,
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:04.000]   once there was a child who swallowed a watermelon
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.120]   and swallowed all the watermelon seeds.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:09.200]   And two days later, a watermelon grew out of his head,
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.540]   period.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.280]   And this is what she would tell me often
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:17.780]   whenever I'm eating watermelon or anything that has seeds.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:23.860]   But she would change this story ever so slightly.
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.180]   So she'll change it like this.
[00:22:26.180 --> 00:22:28.760]   There once was a little child
[00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:31.500]   who swallowed so many watermelon seeds
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:34.500]   that a watermelon grew inside of her.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:38.060]   So there's no more room in her stomach for other food.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.880]   Oh, and by the way, I made noodles.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:46.520]   This is a response, an indirect response to my question of,
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:47.940]   can I have more watermelon?
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:54.180]   So I just find Jesus here, not exactly like my grandma,
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:58.620]   but just so clever in how he answers
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:00.980]   where I'm sitting there as a child thinking,
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:03.540]   oh no, I should not have the watermelon anymore
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:04.980]   'cause I want the noodles.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:09.980]   So I wanna say that Jesus takes these stories
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.580]   and kinda changes them,
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:17.060]   but maybe not exactly like my grandmother
[00:23:17.060 --> 00:23:20.420]   who's just getting me to not eat more watermelon.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.780]   And these stories are true
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:26.180]   'cause I've swallowed some seeds
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.600]   and when the watermelon doesn't grow,
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   I realize the story's fake.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.980]   But I want you to see how Jesus tells the same parable,
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.140]   but in a different way,
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:38.460]   and if you can spot the difference.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:41.860]   So we're gonna go to Matthew chapter 18,
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.200]   verses one through six in IV.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:47.580]   I am going to read them and you can read along with me.
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:53.260]   So at the time, the disciples came to Jesus and asked,
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:58.540]   who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:01.420]   He called a little child to him
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:03.360]   and placed the child among them.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:05.300]   And he said, truly I tell you,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:08.220]   unless you change and become like little children,
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.660]   you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.
[00:24:10.660 --> 00:24:14.400]   Therefore, whoever takes a lowly position of this child
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:17.380]   is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.440]   And whoever welcomes one such child in my name welcomes me.
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:25.380]   If anyone causes one of these little ones,
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:26.920]   those who believe in me to stumble,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.620]   it will be better for them to have a large millstone
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.020]   hung around their neck
[00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.300]   and be drowned in the depths of the sea.
[00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.580]   I don't know if Jesus actually said it like that,
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:37.880]   but that's how I hear it.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.280]   Skipped a few verses, Matthew 18, 10 to 13.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:48.100]   See that you do not despise one of these little ones,
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.260]   for I tell you, their angels in heaven
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:55.100]   always see the face of my Father in heaven.
[00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:56.540]   What do you think?
[00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.820]   If a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away,
[00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.820]   will he not leave the 99 on the hills
[00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:06.500]   and go to look for that one that wandered off?
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:09.820]   And if he finds it, truly I tell you,
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:12.340]   he's happier about the one sheep
[00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:16.580]   than about the 99 that did not wander off.
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:20.260]   In the same way, your Father in heaven
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:24.900]   is not willing that any of these little ones should perish.
[00:25:24.900 --> 00:25:27.120]   So I'm getting the message here.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:30.480]   And I've never even tended sheep.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.100]   I don't even enjoy touching them.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.780]   But I'll tell you as a parent,
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:39.280]   losing a child is one of the worst possible nightmares.
[00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:41.900]   And when my family were in seminary,
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.900]   we lived in graduate housing,
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:46.380]   I thought I lost my eldest son, Tyson.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:48.660]   He was only not yet even three years old
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:51.860]   and we're out in the back, up on a hill playing.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.700]   I turned around, picked up my younger son, Ethan,
[00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:57.700]   who was barely one at the time.
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:26:01.100]   And in a split second, Tyson was gone.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.780]   I could not see him anywhere.
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:07.220]   And this is in Deerfield.
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.580]   It's not like there's like crowds and like buildings.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:12.420]   This is like Deerfield, suburban Chicago.
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:13.660]   But he's nowhere to be seen
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.620]   and it felt like time stood still forever.
[00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:19.220]   And I could hear my heart beating so fast
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:21.460]   and it was like coming out of my body.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:26.140]   So I had to decide, do I leave Ethan to go find Tyson?
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:28.660]   Which is hard to do 'cause he's barely one.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:31.940]   So I left him with other children
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:34.380]   and told the children to watch him like a hawk
[00:26:34.380 --> 00:26:36.820]   while I look for Tyson.
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:38.720]   And I'm screaming and screaming.
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:43.700]   And I'm so loud that all the other seminary students
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:46.620]   drop their books, come out of their dormitories,
[00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:48.820]   into the field going, what's going on?
[00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:50.660]   I lost Tyson.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:52.640]   And then everyone's looking for Tyson.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.940]   We're at the soccer field, the football field,
[00:26:54.940 --> 00:26:57.420]   the playground, inside the slides, in the tunnels,
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:27:00.420]   in the forest, everywhere, in the crosswalk,
[00:27:00.420 --> 00:27:02.940]   everywhere, no sign of him.
[00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.140]   I am starting to panic.
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.060]   The worst like comes to mind.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.620]   Oh my goodness, he was abducted.
[00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.300]   I don't know by what, a coyote?
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.260]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.540]   But in my head, it was like worst possible thing.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.380]   I go around the apartment building and I see him there.
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:23.060]   He's just sitting on the step waiting for me.
[00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.340]   I run to him and I grab him
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:28.180]   and I'm rejoicing inside to tears.
[00:27:28.180 --> 00:27:31.060]   I pick him up and I just run around everywhere.
[00:27:31.060 --> 00:27:32.660]   I found him, I found him, I found him.
[00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.780]   And everyone is celebrating with me.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.880]   So if you ask me, was I glad and happy
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:43.620]   that Ethan didn't wander off?
[00:27:43.620 --> 00:27:45.220]   Of course.
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:48.460]   But was I happier that I found Tyson?
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:50.740]   Most definitely, right?
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:52.580]   So even though I've never heard a sheep,
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:55.820]   a tended sheep or even one touch them,
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:28:00.420]   this story I get, I can relate to it.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:01.780]   I identify.
[00:28:01.780 --> 00:28:06.020]   Because you see, the parable of the lost sheep,
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.460]   as told in Luke, did not do that to me.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.740]   I didn't think of that.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.260]   Because there was not that whole section
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.220]   about Jesus talking about how important children are.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:16.100]   Right?
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.920]   It didn't hit me in the same way.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.120]   So if we look at this,
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.920]   the components within the components of Mark,
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   you'll see that he actually uses a different voice
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.560]   because his disciples are basically bickering.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:31.640]   Who's better?
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.680]   And I experience that all the time with my children.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:34.520]   Who's better?
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:35.340]   I'm better, I'm better.
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:36.180]   No, I'm better.
[00:28:36.180 --> 00:28:37.000]   No, you're not.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:37.840]   Yes, I am.
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:41.160]   The point is, there's a bigger plot.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.580]   He's settling the rivalry between them with this parable.
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:48.500]   And he's saying, all you need to do is be like children.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.060]   But I wanna also highlight,
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:55.260]   he's pretty casual when he tells the parable,
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:57.380]   but he's pretty disciplinary
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.520]   when he tells them about children.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:01.700]   And here's like the tone,
[00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.860]   unless you change, you're not gonna get this.
[00:29:04.860 --> 00:29:07.360]   And it's about my father and your father.
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:11.260]   In Luke, Jesus didn't do that.
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:12.100]   Right?
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.140]   He didn't say your father, my father.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:15.360]   He used heavens.
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:17.460]   There was no personal relationship there.
[00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:21.140]   And also in Luke, he says,
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:24.300]   suppose one of you owned a hundred sheep.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:27.220]   In this one, he said, suppose a man.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:28.200]   Well, why?
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.460]   Why are there these differences?
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.500]   Because it's a different audience.
[00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:35.260]   The disciples are not wealthy people.
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.940]   They would never own a hundred sheep, right?
[00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:39.420]   But why does that matter?
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:42.860]   It matters a lot because within that context,
[00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:46.660]   it tells a storyteller how to modify the story
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:49.920]   to make it impactful for whoever's listening.
[00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.760]   Right?
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:55.620]   And then later he was also saying,
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:59.420]   you just have to be, you just have to be like children.
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.320]   So in that context,
[00:30:02.320 --> 00:30:07.320]   I don't think that Jesus is particularly condemning,
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:12.400]   but really teaching.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.740]   So if we take a look at those two zoomed out storylines,
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:19.680]   side by side, let's compare them.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:23.360]   And I wanna focus a lot on the audience.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:26.360]   So we've talked about a bunch of these already before,
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.200]   but I wanna focus on the audience.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:33.160]   In Luke, there's these Pharisees
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.880]   and these religious leaders, right?
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.520]   And as much as he's being clever and witty,
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:41.540]   kind of tongue in cheek,
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.520]   he's basically trying to show them
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:44.920]   that the gates of heaven are welcome
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.240]   to people they don't expect.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:49.920]   And the leaders wanna gatekeep it,
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:53.280]   but Jesus is saying, no, as long as there's repentance,
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:55.080]   there's acceptance.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:57.240]   And for some of us here,
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:00.840]   maybe we're grumbling about someone or something.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.840]   I know I sure am a lot of times
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:08.160]   when I think those people can't have access
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.560]   to the kingdom of heaven.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:12.580]   Those people, the conniving people,
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:15.980]   the self-righteous people, the rude people,
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:20.460]   the exclusive people.
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:22.620]   And then I'm thinking, oh, wait a minute.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.260]   Am I being exclusive here?
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:26.820]   So there's a compelling moment
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.380]   and you're convicted, right?
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:33.220]   Now in Mark, even though Jesus is directly talking
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:38.220]   to the disciples and teaching them, disciplining them,
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:42.360]   he told them to be like children,
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.880]   even though they were acting like kids, ironically.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.680]   But I don't think he was condemning his disciples either,
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:50.640]   but really helping them to solve their problem
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.480]   and their debate.
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.640]   And it's subtle, but actually not so subtle.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.180]   If they're just like children,
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.320]   their father's not gonna let any of them perish.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.820]   They're just chill out.
[00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.320]   And for some of us,
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.240]   maybe we think someone else is not deserving
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:07.540]   or we're competing with those around us.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:13.440]   Because after all, that's what society tells us to do.
[00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.040]   But I wanna mark that actually,
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:20.040]   that in Mark, Jesus is also talking to children
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.680]   'cause he invites a child in their midst.
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:27.680]   So the children might not be the active, direct listeners,
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:29.160]   but they're listening.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.840]   As you know, if you ever have kids,
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:32.960]   you can say one thing and they hear it
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.880]   and they'll repeat it.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.480]   But you'll say 10,000 other things
[00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.500]   that you want them to say and they won't.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.780]   Unless that's just my kids.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.140]   And I wonder when these children are listening
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:47.220]   to what Jesus is saying to the disciples,
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.860]   if they feel comforted.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.660]   Because as children, they have no power.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.060]   They have no choice.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.140]   But what Jesus is saying is,
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:57.860]   they're so important that all of you need to be like them.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:02.340]   And maybe some of us,
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:05.380]   we don't relate to judging Pharisees.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:09.880]   We don't relate to maybe disciples who are quarreling.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.840]   Do we relate to children?
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:14.560]   Do we feel helpless?
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.120]   Do we feel confused?
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.280]   Do we feel lost?
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:19.480]   Do we feel inexperienced?
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:22.560]   But yet, our God tells us
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.020]   that children are the most beautiful thing.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:31.380]   And what we see here is that bottom row, agency.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.640]   We get to have that agency to look at these stories
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:36.960]   in a zoomed out way.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:41.580]   So if we're to be like Jesus here on earth,
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.860]   healing the sick, finding the lost,
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:48.740]   how does this story look to us today?
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:53.500]   So who is the audience today reading this story
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.860]   and the story outside the story?
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:00.400]   The audience, meaning you and I here right now.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:05.840]   So ask yourselves, what context are you currently in?
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:11.640]   Are you in a place of a lot of turmoil, decision, chaos?
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.860]   Are you in a state of jealousy or unforgiveness?
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.640]   How does that affect how you hear the story?
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.640]   We're not just one of these sets of audiences forever.
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:26.400]   We can be all of them at different times in our lives.
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:30.280]   So maybe there is a lost sheep in your life.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.280]   Maybe there's a need to reconcile that.
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:39.580]   Or maybe you think you deserve more than that person.
[00:34:39.580 --> 00:34:41.680]   Or could that lost sheep be actually you?
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:46.720]   Are you feeling lonely and scared or helpless?
[00:34:46.720 --> 00:34:51.520]   But remind yourself of what the parable says,
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:53.640]   regardless of audience and context,
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:56.160]   that each one matters.
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:35:01.160]   Every single one, you, me, every single one of us matter.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:05.080]   So in summary, the goal was to help you know
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.000]   the power of storytelling, which I hope I made that point,
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:11.760]   and that you realize that Jesus is the goat.
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.760]   If not anything else, Jesus is the goat.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:19.600]   But I also want you to know that this is one story.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.320]   This is the lost sheep, one story,
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:27.320]   that is inside like a zoomed out story, right?
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:31.520]   That is inside an even bigger story.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:34.640]   So I am really excited and looking forward
[00:35:34.640 --> 00:35:38.840]   to continuing diving into these stories with you
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:39.880]   as we move along.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.040]   Next week, I'll be here.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.600]   We'll talk about another story.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:48.320]   And so far, that's the end for me today.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:51.720]   But if you have any stories you wanna share with me,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.200]   you wanna hear more of my stories,
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:55.360]   feel free to find me and contact me.
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.160]   But that's all I have for you today.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
