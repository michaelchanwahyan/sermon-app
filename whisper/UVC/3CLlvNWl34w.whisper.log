[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.000]  (音樂)
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]  Happy Easter
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  各位 福祉快樂
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]  我們可否給桌上的人
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000]  給他們一個High Five
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.000]  Happy Easter
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  (音樂)
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  如果你們記得在星期五
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]  星期五
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  OK
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]  兩三天前
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000]  耶穌死亡的最可怕的死亡
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000]  是基督的死亡
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000]  祂被懲罰
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]  被判刑
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000]  祂的身體被困在黑暗的寶寶墓
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  所有的希望都失去了
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  而是 邪惡的 死亡 都獲得了勝利
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  在今天第三天
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000]  早上非常早
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]  女性 女性的徒弟們
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000]  他們去到耶穌的寶寶墓
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000]  他們想參觀祂的身體
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]  他們來到寶寶墓
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000]  他們發現寶寶墓已經打開
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]  寶寶墓已經空了
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]  耶穌已經不在了
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  別害怕 聖經說
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  祂不在了
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]  祂已經從死亡中出生了
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]  在這時
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]  女性們記得
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  耶穌已經告訴她們
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  很久以前 重複地說
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  祂會被祭祀
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  祂會從死亡中出生
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]  在第三天
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]  記得這一點
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]  女性徒弟們去告訴
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  在藏身的徒弟們
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]  他們告訴他們好消息
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000]  耶穌出現了
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  祂的徒弟們 祂的家人
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]  並且顯示了 祂已經從死亡中出生了
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]  耶穌呼喚了祂的徒弟們
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]  以及所有的世代的教會
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]  來祈求生命的希望
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  耶穌已經擊敗了死亡
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]  耶穌已經擊敗了邪惡
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]  耶穌已經擊敗了一切
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]  祂就是勝利
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  這就是所有的世代的信息
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]  他們都在祈求
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]  在聖誕節我們也在慶祝這個事實
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]  我們也在活著這個呼喚
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]  我們被神呼喚
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  去到外面 去告訴一個完全不同的故事
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  去看到一件完全不同的事
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  去看到一件完全不同的事
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]  去看到現實 去看到我們的生活
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000]  上週 巴黎發生了大火
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]  納德達教堂也被火燒了
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]  這令人心痛
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]  整個世界都在悲傷
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  這令人特別痛苦
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]  因為上週 本來是聖誕節
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  聖誕節是在聖誕節中
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]  聖誕節是在聖誕節中 讓整個基督教世界都記得受苦
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000]  和耶穌的痛苦
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  看到大火燒掉了教堂
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]  我們都感到憂慮
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]  失去了文明
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  失去了所有的文明和建築
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]  失去了歷史
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]  我們都看到大火和毀滅
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]  我們都感到不朽
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]  我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]  我們都感到不朽
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]  我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  我們都感到不朽
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]  我們都感到不朽
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]  我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]  我們都感到不朽
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]  我們都看到大火 和毀滅了教堂
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  我們都感到不朽
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  我們都感到不朽
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:17.000]  Everything is gone and destructed. All you see is smoke and ash of destruction. But behind this is a golden cross.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:27.000]  This is how a good photographer can tell a totally different story, a totally different perspective to see reality.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000]  High above the order, high above the ash of destruction is a powerful reminder of Christian hope.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]  This is the hope that we have with the empty tomb of Christ.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:46.000]  And this is the hope we can see and experience in the midst of destruction, in the midst of ash of fire.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:00.000]  Our hope is on the empty cross. Christ is not there. He died on Friday. He was buried. He was in the tomb. And His tomb is empty.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000]  Our hope is on the empty cross to raise in Christ. And please don't forward this picture and say this is a miracle.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000]  So gold has a much higher melting point than wood. This is not a miracle.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:20.000]  But however, this is a totally different way to see reality.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]  Easter Sunday calls us to see reality with a different lens.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.000]  Put on a different eye glasses. Put on a different lens, a spiritual lens to see life.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.000]  If life is just here and now, death and destruction have triumphed.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000]  This is what you get. Ash of destruction, forces of evil, death and Satan.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:51.000]  But it shows us a higher reality, a different way, a totally alternative way to see reality.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:02.000]  And that is the eternal lens. With Jesus' resurrection, the forces of evil, evil authorities, death and Satan have been defeated.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:09.000]  With Jesus' resurrection, new creation, the Bible says, is set in motion.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:17.000]  All in Christ, all people who put their trust in Christ, will share the same victory of Jesus.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:24.000]  1 Corinthians 15.20. It says, "But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:29.000]  He is the first of great harvest of those who have died in Christ.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  Christ's resurrection is the first fruits."
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]  That's an interesting term. It's a farming term.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:45.000]  It means joy and hope with the first harvest.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]  And Jesus' resurrection is the first harvest, filled with joy and gratefulness.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]  You know, you look around our world, it's filled with sin and suffering and death.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]  You probably caught the news story in Sri Lanka this morning.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]  There was a series of bombing of Christian churches as they celebrated Easter Sunday.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  More than 100 people died. Hundreds of people are wounded.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000]  This is our world. As of destructions.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]  But Easter Sunday marks a totally different way to see the world.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]  It celebrates a new beginning.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.000]  The first fruits of the harvest will guarantee the rest of the field.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000]  There will be harvest. There will be a new beginning.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]  So you come to Christ today. You put your trust in Him.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  With the resurrection, you have new hope.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  And you are new. New beginning and new creation.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]  Our church launched three years ago on Easter Sunday.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]  With the same conviction, same hope that we have in the raising Christ.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]  We launched this church and this new mission.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  Why we do that? Because we know the tomb of Jesus was empty.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.000]  There is hope in resurrection. There is a totally different new way to see our lives.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]  And because of the hope of resurrection, we have a new mission.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]  We are new people.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:27.000]  So I pray that may the resurrection of Jesus encourage us all to continue to build the church.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]  To plant the church. To extend the mission of God. To continue in our faith.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  He said in the book of Acts 15, verse 20, "But Christ is already in death."
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  And Christ's resurrection is the beginning of the people who have been sown.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  Who said the people who have been sown?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]  It must be the church at that time. A new church.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000]  Some people are suffering. Some families have left this world.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000]  But they are the people in the tomb. They have left the world.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  What are they doing? They are in despair.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000]  Paul wrote this letter to teach them.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]  We still have despair. Because we have a desire for resurrection in Christ.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.000]  Paul said a lot of things about the fact of the resurrection of Christ.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:23.000]  He came to this chapter and said, "The resurrection of Christ is like the fruit of the first ripening."
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]  It is a word of the agricultural field.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  You know, at this time, in spring, the weather in Barcelona,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]  This is the time of the ripening of wheat.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:42.000]  It is the first batch of ripening. The first batch of fruit will not be produced.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  As the first batch of ripening, the first ripe fruit,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]  There must be a lot of joy and gratitude.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.000]  Because after the rainy season, there are several months of very cold rainy season.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]  At this time, it starts to be messy, just like Chicago.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  It was snowing last week.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]  This is the time of the first batch of ripening.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]  People will be full of hope and gratitude.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]  And what does the first ripe fruit say?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]  It is the reason for despair.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]  Why can there be a reason for despair?
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]  Because without the first batch of ripening, the rest of your crops will be ripened.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:30.000]  If there is no first batch of ripening, there is no guarantee that the rest of your crops will be ripened.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  Jesus Christ is the first real ripening.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000]  The first ripe fruit.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]  Really resurrected from death and will not die again.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000]  He has completely won over death.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:51.000]  Jesus's resurrection is also a guarantee that all of us who believe in Jesus and rely on Jesus to the end.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  We will have eternal hope in the future.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  The main purpose of the second batch of ripening is to ask us to look at the world with a completely different perspective.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]  Look at our life.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  Because of the resurrection, God will show a more real existence.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]  This is heaven.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]  This is God's kingdom.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  The picture you just saw is the one from the St. Martin's Cathedral in Paris last week.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]  People all over the world are very sad.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  Lost a lot of history and heritage.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]  Of course, it doesn't matter to some people.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]  The most important thing is that they are rich.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]  They don't appreciate culture, art, or history.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  But there are many reasons for the destruction of heritage.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]  What everyone sees is just ashes and fire.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]  We think it's helpless.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000]  We think there's only some destruction.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  But a good photographer,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]  When using a different lens to see the truth,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]  There is a completely new concept.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]  This picture is after the fire.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]  A photographer went to the scene and took the first picture.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]  A good photographer uses a different lens to see the truth.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]  What he sees is not what ordinary people see.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]  What ordinary people see is just ashes and fire.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:19.000]  But he saw a cross behind.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  If you can understand English, I have already mentioned it.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  Please don't say this is a miracle.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]  Or you will be laughed at.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]  Because the melting temperature of gold is higher than that of wood.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  So it's not hard to burn the gold cross.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  It's very reasonable.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000]  But this picture shows that we can see our real life from a new perspective.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]  What does the resurrection ceremony do?
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  The empty tomb is actually to shake us.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]  To re-examine how we see the world.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  Change a superhuman eye to a superhuman lens.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]  Change another pair of lenses to let you see God and God.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  A spiritual lens.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  The 15th chapter of the Gospel of John
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  Proposes a lot of evidence of resurrection.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  Paul said that if there is no resurrection of the dead,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  If there is no resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]  Our life is just a closed system.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  There will be no external things.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  It's a dead end.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]  It's a dead end.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]  The last thing we will see is the end.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  Because the last thing we will see is the final enemy.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000]  That is death.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]  He said we only have this life of hope.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.000]  But we are so poor.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  This is the special thing about the Christian faith.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000]  If you pay attention to the Christian faith,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  The special thing is that it is built in a historical event.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]  It's not a theory of abstract.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  It's not a very solid philosophical thought.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  The Bible never provides a very solid philosophical thought.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]  But the Bible tells us that the Christian faith
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]  Is built in a historical event.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]  The death of Jesus Christ on Friday.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]  The resurrection of Jesus Christ today
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  Is a historical event.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]  This is the most unique thing.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]  Because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]  We can see this world clearly.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:23.000]  It's not just a closed system.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:28.000]  The resurrection day forces us to realize that our life needs to be changed.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000]  There is a higher reality.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]  God really exists.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]  He created the world.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  And loves us.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]  He entered our world and saved us.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000]  These sinners.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.000]  Because the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  Think about it.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]  Life, human life, the last one who speaks in the final stage of salvation,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  Is no longer death.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.000]  It's resurrection.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  It's despair.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]  It's love.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  It's God.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]  It's not an evil regime.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  It's eternal life.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.000]  So the resurrection of Jesus Christ from death
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:07.000]  Brings a lot of changes to many people's lives.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  From the first generation of believers,
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:12.000]  Those followers were greedy and afraid of death.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  Then they were willing to dare to come out and spread the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]  All of them believed to death.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000]  Another follower,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]  Changed 180 degrees,
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]  Is Paul.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]  He was originally a person who persecuted the church.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]  Now he is willing to
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  Because he saw the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000]  He understood this and he is no longer afraid of authority.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:39.000]  Then he went to all over the world to build a church and spread the gospel.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  Today, in your life,
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]  You may encounter different difficulties.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]  I want you to bring the desire of the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  Into your life.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:57.000]  God can direct you to show his own work.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.000]  You are the one who brings the resurrection of Jesus Christ into your life.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000]  You can tell people
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  This world and life can be completely different.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]  We will pray later.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:17.000]  We will pray for the brothers and sisters who are in trouble.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.000]  We will pray for our friends and brothers and sisters.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]  We will pray for each of us.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  We have a mission.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.000]  We have the desire to bring the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  We go back to our home.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.000]  Go back to our life.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  Go back to the place where you work.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]  You can see the place where you don't know Jesus Christ.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  You can tell people that Jesus Christ is really resurrected.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]  How to be resurrected?
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  Not only a historical fact, but also an experience in your life.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]  Your attitude is completely different.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  This is your mission.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]  We also pray for the church.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]  Our church says that today is the third year of the baptism.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.000]  We are still very young.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.000]  We still have a lot of needs.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]  We still have a lot of places to be filled.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.000]  But the desire to be resurrected pushes us forward.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  Let us know that what we have done is of eternal value.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  We will not hate this.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]  We are going to pray together.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]  Pray for those who are weak.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]  We know there are many friends around us.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]  Brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000]  They are facing some struggles.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  We are going to remember them.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.000]  In our prayers.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]  We also pray for the church.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]  This church is found on the hope and faith of Jesus' resurrection.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:47.000]  We want to pray for the church because we want the same hope to motivate us.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000]  So that we can go back to our home, our workplaces, our neighborhood.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]  To witness and to testify the living hope of Jesus Christ.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:00.000]  Let us all pray together.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.000]  我們請司見上來帶領我們祈禱。
