[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   All right, good morning, everybody.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.040]   Let's quickly pray with me.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.120]   Heavenly Father, I just pray now that you would use this time, use this word.
[00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:22.400]   Let it not be a man's words, but let it be your word for your people and for your glory.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.120]   So I pray that you would speak through me, speak to each of our hearts, Father God, to
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.960]   make us more like the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.120]   And I pray this in his name, amen.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:45.680]   So in December of 2003, a man named Gary Ridgway was sentenced by a Seattle judge to 48 life
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.680]   sentences.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.140]   In addition to this, he was sentenced 10 years for every one of those life sentences.
[00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:03.280]   So he was facing 480-year sentence on top of 48 consecutive life sentences.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:09.640]   And it may seem extreme, but legally speaking, the sentence, this punishment was well-deserved
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:15.080]   because Gary Ridgway is more commonly known as the Green River Killer.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.480]   And he is the second most prolific serial killer in the history of the United States
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.560]   of America.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:32.080]   And while he was standing before the judge on trial for these 48 murders, he was stone-faced.
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.200]   He had no emotion.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.900]   And he had actually confessed to killing over 70 women throughout Washington state, although
[00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.360]   he was only tried for 48 of them.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.640]   And through the entire sentencing process, he was stone-faced, he was emotionless.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.360]   And in the court proceedings, the judge had invited family members of these victims to
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.020]   come and speak before the court.
[00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.920]   And so these families came up, and they bared their soul, they poured out their grief, their
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.520]   heartbreak, their rage towards this man who had taken everything from them—mothers,
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.520]   daughters, wives, sisters—all lost to this man who sat in the very same courtroom as
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.720]   them, absolutely remorseless.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.360]   And I got a few quotes here of some of the things that these families said, some mocking
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.060]   Gary Ridgway, some condemning this man for what he did to their families.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.080]   And so a few of the things that they said I have here.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.680]   "He's an animal.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:46.440]   I wish for him to have a long, suffering, cruel death."
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.480]   One woman said, "He's going to go to hell, and that's exactly where he belongs."
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.760]   Through all these statements and many more just like them, Ridgway remained emotionless.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.600]   But that is until one man took the podium, a father whose daughter had her life snatched
[00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   away by this man.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.360]   And the father took the podium, and to everyone's surprise, this is what he said.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.360]   "Mr. Ridgway, there are people here that hate you.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.360]   I am not one of them.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.320]   You've made it difficult to live up to what I believe, and that is what God says to do,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.200]   which is to forgive."
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.680]   And at that moment, the entire courtroom was stunned in silence as he said this next sentence.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.320]   "You are forgiven, sir."
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.000]   And at that, that shocking display of mercy and forgiveness, for the first time in months
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.440]   of court proceedings, Gary Ridgway broke down in tears, and he cried.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.880]   And there's a clip of this on YouTube.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.360]   If you look it up, you can search "The Power of Forgiveness, Gary Ridgway."
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.280]   And every time I watch that clip, I find it difficult not to myself tear up because it's
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   just so powerful.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.080]   It's so full of emotion on display in the courtroom.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.400]   The heartbreak, the pain, the anger of those families who've just lost a piece of themselves,
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.720]   their desire for vengeance.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:25.720]   And then one man among many stands up and offers, extends forgiveness and mercy to a
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.960]   guilty murderer, a serial killer.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:34.840]   And when I see that, I feel a tug at my own heart, a tug of conviction, a conviction that
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.160]   asks me, "What would I do in that same position if it was my mother or my sister, my wife
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   or my child?
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.180]   Would I be able to forgive like that?
[00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.600]   Could I forgive like that?
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.760]   Should I even forgive something so egregious, something so terrible?
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.460]   Does a murderer like that, does he deserve that forgiveness?
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:58.420]   How could that father have forgiven him?
[00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.460]   How could he do that?
[00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.960]   Why would he do that?"
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.720]   And so today we'll be reading a portion of teachings from the Lord Jesus Christ that
[00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.880]   answers those very questions and it answers our questions when we find ourselves struggling
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.840]   to forgive, not wanting to forgive.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:22.460]   And so my passage I'll be reading from today is Matthew chapter 18, verses 21 through 35.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.460]   And before I get into the passage, I kind of want to explain and set up a little bit
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:31.240]   what is going on in the context of this teaching Jesus gives.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:37.240]   And so prior to this, Jesus had just taught his disciples his way of forgiveness, how
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.280]   when a brother or sister sins against them, how are they to respond?
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.000]   And what he tells them is when a brother or sister sins against you, you go to them and
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.600]   you tell them what they've done in hopes that they will repent and you will forgive them
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.480]   and you'll be restored, reconciled together.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.720]   But if they refuse to repent, you go and take two or three witnesses with you and together
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:04.000]   you'll go to this brother or sister who is in sin against you with the hope that you'll
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.400]   be restored and reconciled to them, that they will repent and you will forgive them.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.600]   But if they still refuse to repent, then you take the matter before the entire church with
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.880]   the hopes that the weight of the whole body of believers will cause this person to repent
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:23.960]   and then you forgive them and be reconciled and restored in brotherhood.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.560]   But if even then they repent, Jesus says to treat them, deal with them as a pagan, as
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:33.000]   a tax collector, as an outsider.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.800]   And so this is what Jesus is now responding to in this passage.
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:43.780]   And after teaching these steps to his disciples, how they are to forgive a brother who sins
[00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:51.600]   against them, Peter comes up, he comes to the Lord and he asks him this question, "Lord,
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:55.900]   how often will my brother sin against me and I forgive him?
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.520]   As many as seven times?"
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:03.000]   Which is a pretty good question Peter asks here, because if we're honest with ourselves
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.160]   we would probably have a similar question.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.480]   "Well, how many times Lord should I forgive?
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.520]   Yes, I know that you want me to forgive."
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:14.000]   And we generally agree that extending forgiveness is a good thing.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.240]   And we certainly know how good it feels to be forgiven.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:23.020]   But I think we all kind of think to ourselves, "There must be a limit, right?
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.560]   You don't expect me to forgive unconditionally if they keep hurting me or sinning against
[00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.560]   me.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.280]   My mercy, my patience, my forgiveness, it can only go so far.
[00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:36.620]   I don't have to keep forgiving, right?"
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:41.760]   And according to the Jewish rabbinical tradition of that day, of that time period, you were
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.240]   obligated to forgive three times.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.000]   So if a brother sinned against you, you forgave him.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:52.040]   And after the third time of extending that forgiveness, you were to show them no more
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.040]   forgiveness.
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:55.640]   There was no fourth chance.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.200]   And it's kind of similar even 2,000 years later to our culture, to our day and age,
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.440]   and the world's approach on forgiveness is pretty similar.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.340]   And so I have a few sayings here that maybe you've heard of.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:10.020]   Maybe you've said it before or had it said to you.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:13.900]   "I'll only give you three chances.
[00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.820]   That's one.
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.820]   That's two.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.320]   Don't let me get to three or else."
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.560]   Life is like baseball.
[00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:23.580]   Three strikes and you're out.
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:24.580]   Or maybe this one.
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:26.860]   "Fool me once, shame on me.
[00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:29.140]   Fool me twice, shame on you."
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.820]   And you see the idea behind that is you're not going to fool me.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.780]   You're not going to cross me or offend me a third time.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.000]   I won't give you the chance.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.100]   And that's exactly how it was for the Jews in Jesus' day and age.
[00:08:40.100 --> 00:08:41.100]   And Peter knew this.
[00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:47.220]   And so he asked Jesus, "Should he forgive up to seven times a brother who sins against
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.220]   him?"
[00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.140]   And so you can imagine the reaction that may have come from those who were around him.
[00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:57.500]   Hearing Peter say, "Should I forgive seven times?
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   Seven times?
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.500]   Are you kidding me?"
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:01.220]   This guy, Peter, he's so forgiving.
[00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:02.620]   He's so merciful.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:04.420]   No one else is forgiving seven times.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:07.020]   Not even the rabbis are forgiving seven times.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.780]   This guy, Peter, is something special.
[00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:13.720]   But surely Jesus doesn't expect me to forgive seven times, right?
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.700]   No one else is doing that.
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:21.740]   And so if Peter's question was surprising to those who were around at the time, Jesus'
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:25.980]   response to Peter would have been even more surprising.
[00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:31.020]   And I think it's, to an extent, even surprising to us when we think about the implication.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:39.140]   And so Jesus answers Peter and says to him, "I do not say to you seven times, but seventy-seven
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.580]   times."
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.580]   Seventy-seven times.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:49.940]   Remember, the Jewish rabbis, the holy men of the day, they taught three times is enough.
[00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:53.180]   And Jesus says, "No, not seven, but seventy-seven."
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:57.420]   And actually, depending on how you take the Greek that's behind this, how you translate
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:05.380]   it, it could be translated as seventy times seven, which is even a greater number of forgiveness.
[00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.140]   But whether it's seventy-seven or seventy times seven, that's not exactly the point,
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:16.020]   because Jesus is not giving a specific number to teach the people, okay, you keep track.
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:20.060]   And once they've sinned against you seventy-eight times, that's it.
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.880]   Once they've crossed this certain number of times sinning against you, offending you,
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.120]   then you cut them off.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.480]   You offer them no forgiveness and you hold that against them.
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:30.480]   That's not what He's saying.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:35.040]   He's not literally saying, "Only to forgive seventy-seven times," and that's it.
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:36.820]   That defeats the purpose of what He's saying.
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:43.060]   What He's really teaching them is that for the followers of Christ, there is no count.
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:47.380]   There is no number of times you forgive and then you're off the hook.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.560]   But He wants you to go out there and continue to forgive.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.380]   Don't keep track, don't keep score, you just forgive, and they sin against you, and you
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:56.380]   forgive.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.180]   They sin against you again, and you forgive again.
[00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.500]   It's an innumerable forgiveness.
[00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.380]   That's what Christ is teaching His followers to do.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.060]   Not to keep score, not to get even.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:14.620]   And it's likely that the answer Jesus gives is actually a reference to a passage of the
[00:11:14.620 --> 00:11:20.300]   Old Testament Scriptures from the book of Genesis chapter four, where we see a descendant
[00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:28.620]   of Cain by the name Lamech, who is singing this song, so to speak, to his two wives.
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:33.980]   And it's a song of revenge that demonstrates how great his vengeance is against those who
[00:11:33.980 --> 00:11:34.980]   sin against him.
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:42.820]   And so this is what he says, "Ada and Zillah, listen to me, wives of Lamech, hear my words.
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:48.140]   I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for injuring me.
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:54.680]   If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech seventy-seven times.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:59.940]   And sometimes, if we're being honest, this is how we feel.
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.100]   Someone hurts us, they're in for it.
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:04.220]   They're going to get it.
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:08.220]   Whatever you do to me, I'm going to get you back with everything you gave me and then
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.740]   some, because I want revenge.
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:10.780]   I want to get even.
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.500]   I want to make you feel how bad you made me feel.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.100]   I'll teach you a lesson.
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.060]   But for the followers of Jesus Christ, this is, it shouldn't be this way.
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.620]   As a matter of fact, it cannot be this way for those of us who follow Jesus, because
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:31.720]   Jesus flips this entirely on its head.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:37.500]   So it's not that when you are sinned against, offended, or hurt, that's an opportunity to
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.540]   display vengeance and to get revenge.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:47.700]   For us, when we're sinned against, it's an opportunity to extend mercy and to forgive.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:52.820]   And see, that is the standard of forgiveness, which Christ holds all those who call on His
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   name.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:58.260]   And this level of forgiveness, for some, for many, it is shocking.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:13:03.300]   And for some people in our modern sensibilities, it's even offensive.
[00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:09.020]   Think about the story I opened with, this serial killer, this murder, just talking about
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:10.020]   that.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.500]   Some of us just have a reaction where we're repulsed.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.940]   And if you put yourself in the place of those families, it's very difficult to say that
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:22.380]   you would stand up and forgive someone who took the life of a loved one from you.
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:27.300]   It's offensive to suggest that you should forgive him, that you must forgive him.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:33.740]   And so for many people in our world today, this level of forgiveness is extremely offensive.
[00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.740]   And I'm speaking from personal experience.
[00:13:35.740 --> 00:13:41.900]   I recall a time around 2018, 2019, there was a case in the news of a black man, his name
[00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.740]   was Botham Jean.
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:47.480]   And he was sitting in his apartment on the couch eating ice cream, and a white police
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.520]   officer opened the door and came in and shot him and killed him.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:55.980]   She claims she lived in the same building, that she thought she was entering her apartment
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.540]   that he was an intruder.
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.460]   That was her defense.
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:00.740]   At the time, I didn't care.
[00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:02.060]   I didn't care what she said.
[00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:08.340]   She, in my brain, was a murderer and needed justice, because what took place was terrible.
[00:14:08.340 --> 00:14:14.540]   So, during the court case, when the judge gave the family of this slain man a chance
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:19.240]   to speak to his killer, what happened surprised me.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.000]   His only brother stood up to the judge and when allowed to speak, he looked at this killer
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.780]   and he told the police officer, "I forgive you."
[00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:33.260]   And he went so far as to ask the judge, "Can I come from behind the stand and can I give
[00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:34.700]   her a hug?"
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.300]   And when I saw that, I was angry.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:43.940]   I could not understand how you could forgive and embrace your brother's killer.
[00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:49.280]   And when I went to my dad about this, and we saw it on the news, he told me that what
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:54.860]   had taken place was actually beautiful, and that what the family did was the right thing.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:15:01.020]   And at the time, I could not come to grips with that, that my dad, a black man, did not
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:04.420]   have that same anger I had at what took place.
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.900]   That forgiveness made no sense to me.
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.020]   And the truth is that at that time, I was not a Christian.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:15.620]   I did not understand, I could not understand the forgiveness of Jesus Christ.
[00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.100]   It was offensive to me.
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:18.420]   It was infuriating to me.
[00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.760]   It baffled me.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:24.700]   And this radical call to forgive still baffles many people today.
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:26.780]   And so, we want to know why.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:27.780]   Why Jesus?
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:29.900]   Why such a high standard?
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:36.560]   Why is it so important that we forgive, that followers of Christ have to forgive like this?
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.620]   And this is a question that would have been on the minds of all those around that day
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:43.480]   who heard Jesus' answer given to Peter.
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:45.420]   Not seven, but 77.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:46.420]   "Why, Jesus?
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:48.100]   Why is that so important?
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.380]   How could I possibly forgive that much?"
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:56.500]   And so, it's Jesus follows us up with a parable, explaining, giving an answer to those questions
[00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.380]   that we sometimes have.
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:04.340]   This is what he says, "Therefore, the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.700]   to settle accounts with his servants.
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:12.380]   When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him 10,000 talents.
[00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:17.380]   And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold with his wife and children
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:21.020]   and all that he had, and payment to be made.
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.140]   So the servant fell on his knees imploring him, 'Have patience with me.
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:27.260]   I will pay you everything.'
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:34.100]   And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave the debt."
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:39.700]   And so, what just happened here in this parable is unthinkable, especially to the people of
[00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:42.420]   that day who Jesus was speaking to.
[00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.980]   Utterly unthinkable.
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:50.520]   This large amount of debt that the servant owed to his master was uncountable.
[00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:52.680]   It was 10,000 talents.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.700]   In that day and age in the Roman world, the talent was the largest denomination of money.
[00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.180]   You couldn't go any higher than that.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.340]   Talents was, you can almost think of it in this way, talent, that amount of money was
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:09.220]   how you paid kings, how you dealt with prices of entire kingdoms.
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:13.660]   And the number, 10,000, was the largest number employed in the day.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:18.220]   You couldn't think of, you couldn't write a higher number than 10,000.
[00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:23.580]   The Greek word for 10,000 is myrias, which I say that because that's where we get the
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:28.780]   word myriad, which is an incountable, innumerable amount.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:34.120]   And so that's how much this servant owed his king, owed his master.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:39.620]   And so to put it in kind of common terms, modern terms for us to understand, imagine
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:47.460]   a low-level worker who owed the CEO and founder of a Fortune 500 company, Google, Microsoft,
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.500]   Tesla.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:51.700]   He owed him a billion dollars.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:56.780]   We might use the word gajillion or bazillion, right?
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.060]   It's nonsense because it's so much money, there's no way in the world you could pay
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.220]   it back.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:06.860]   And that's the debt that this servant had to his king.
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:12.300]   And because he owed him such an incredibly unpayable amount, the king's response was,
[00:18:12.300 --> 00:18:16.820]   we'll sell all you have and we'll sell you and your family into servitude.
[00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:23.420]   And at least I can regain a small fraction of a fraction of a fraction of a fraction
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:26.300]   of what you owe me.
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:31.340]   But in a move of total and utter desperation, the servant throws himself before the king
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:38.160]   and begs and pleads for mercy, claiming that, give me time, I'll pay everything back, which
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.660]   both he and the king knew was impossible.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:48.540]   There's no way in the world that man could ever have enough time and do enough labor
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:53.060]   to pay back a debt of 10,000 talents.
[00:18:53.060 --> 00:18:54.860]   The king knew this.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:00.700]   Yet for some reason, he was moved to pity this man and the king released the servant.
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:07.040]   And not only did he release the servant, but he took that enormous incalculable debt and
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:10.500]   erased it completely.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:16.300]   This servant, this lowly servant, forgiven by a king, the servant who did nothing to
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:23.180]   earn this mercy, this incomprehensible debt, it's unheard of for that kind of thing to
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:24.420]   happen.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:30.740]   And so for Jesus' audience, hearing that from Jesus, it would have been shocking.
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:34.540]   And then what happens next in the parable would have been just as shocking.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:36.840]   So Jesus continues in the parable.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:41.300]   But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:48.140]   hundred denarii and seizing him, he began to choke him saying, "Pay what you owe."
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:52.180]   So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, "Have patience with me and I will
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.420]   pay you."
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:20:00.060]   He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:07.860]   Despite the complete mercy, the grace, the forgiveness that this servant had just received,
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:12.860]   he refused to give that same mercy to someone else who was in the same position that he
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.860]   was just in.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:20.380]   Now it's worth noting that this hundred denarii is equivalent to about a hundred days' worth
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:21.380]   of wages.
[00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.160]   So the debt owed to the servant, it was not insignificant.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.180]   That's a significant amount of money.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.860]   But it is payable.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:34.180]   And in comparison to ten thousand talents that were owed to the king, this one hundred
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:37.500]   denarii debt was, is not even worth comparing.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.500]   Right?
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:41.860]   Ten thousand talents pales in comparison to a hundred denarii.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:47.940]   But despite this, despite the fact that it was repayable, the mercy who had just received
[00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:54.980]   immense mercy and forgiveness, the servant punished the man, refused to pay him.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:21:00.840]   And that reaction from the servant, it demonstrated that his heart was full of unforgiveness and
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.280]   full of wickedness.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:07.860]   And so the scene actually plays out almost exactly parallel to the first.
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.720]   The man, the servant is brought before the one he owed the debt to.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.820]   He pleads for mercy.
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:16.780]   But the difference is, he receives none.
[00:21:16.780 --> 00:21:20.100]   The servant is merciless to him.
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:23.980]   Even though the debt was way less, even though the debt could have been paid off, it didn't
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:28.780]   matter to the servant, who drags the man, throws him into prison.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.860]   Jesus continues, "When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:39.660]   distressed and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place."
[00:21:39.660 --> 00:21:45.940]   And so the servant's mistreatment and lack of mercy to his fellow servant, it was appalling
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.600]   and it was offensive.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:51.360]   So much so that the other servants knew that what happened was wrong.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:55.660]   And so their first response was to go straight to the king and tell the king what had just
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:56.660]   taken place.
[00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:02.620]   And we're going to see the king's response shows that he was just as deeply disturbed,
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.620]   even angered, by what took place.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:07.060]   And so here's what happens next.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:13.420]   "Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant, I forgave you
[00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.060]   all that debt because you pleaded with me.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:21.560]   And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant as I had mercy on you?'
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:28.740]   And in anger, his master delivered him to the jailers until he should pay all his debt.
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.400]   So the master rebukes him.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.880]   He calls him wicked and delivers him over to the jailers where he will be tortured until
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.520]   his debt is paid off.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:45.840]   Although he was at first abundantly merciful and forgiving the servant, now we see he has
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:52.560]   nothing left for the unforgiving servant but condemnation, contempt, justice.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:58.320]   And the reason the king gives is that this servant did not demonstrate the same mercy
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.240]   he had just refused, received.
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:06.080]   And in doing that, in refusing to show that mercy, it's almost as if the servant holds
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:09.180]   in contempt the mercy he had just received.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:12.440]   As if he is too good to show mercy.
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.760]   Better than the king was because the king showed mercy.
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:22.960]   And so Jesus warns his followers that just like this servant was brought before the king,
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:29.600]   rebuked, sent off to the jailers, Jesus warns his followers that it will be no different
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:34.480]   for them if they act as the unforgiving servant acted.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:40.360]   And Jesus gives this very stark, very serious warning and it's a warning that extends to
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:42.120]   all of us today.
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:48.600]   He ends this passage by saying this, "So also my heavenly father will do to every one of
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:54.180]   you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart."
[00:23:54.180 --> 00:23:59.820]   Exactly what happens in the parable to the unforgiving servant, Jesus says that is exactly
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:05.480]   what will happen to you from God if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters from
[00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.320]   your heart.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:12.200]   And so now Peter has his answer and now we also have ours.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.080]   Why should we forgive?
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:20.340]   Why should we forgive those who hurt us, who offend us, who abuse or mistreat or misspeak
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.240]   about us?
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:28.360]   Is it not because we, like the servant, have been greatly forgiven by God?
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.520]   That is the entire point of Jesus' parable.
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:34.600]   And so you see, when you look at the parable, what does it all mean?
[00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:36.560]   What does it represent?
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.160]   We are the servant.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:42.760]   We owe an unimaginable debt to God.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   Scripture teaches that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:51.520]   And that the wages of sin is death.
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:58.280]   So there's nothing we could ever hope to do, given all of time and eternity, to pay off
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:04.480]   our debt of sin to God, a righteous, holy, infinitely holy and good God.
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.840]   There's nothing we could do, no amount of good deeds, good works we could ever do to
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.680]   pay off that debt.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:15.540]   Scripture teaches there's no one righteous, no not one.
[00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:17.120]   No one understands.
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.520]   No one seeks for God.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.440]   All have turned aside.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.280]   Together they have become worthless.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:28.240]   No one does good, not even one.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:34.080]   Elsewhere we see the prophet Isaiah writes that all our righteous deeds are like filthy
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:35.960]   rags.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   Nothing we could ever do could pay off our debt to God.
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:49.400]   But God is rich in mercy, abounding in steadfast love.
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:56.640]   He has forgiven us completely the debt of our sin at the high price, the high cost,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:01.520]   not of denarii, not of talents, not of silver, not of gold, but of the precious blood of
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.440]   Jesus Christ, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:12.360]   So therefore, though our sins be as scarlet, they shall be white as snow.
[00:26:12.360 --> 00:26:16.320]   That is the forgiveness we receive from God in Jesus Christ.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.160]   Our debt to God entirely wiped out.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:26.520]   How then could we who know this mercy, we who have received this forgiveness, we who
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:33.160]   have believed in this Son, and we who profess this truth, how then could we turn around
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:39.840]   and withhold forgiveness from someone else, especially another brother or sister in the
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:44.480]   Lord?
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:49.960]   Remember that the debt that was owed towards the servant from his fellow servant, it wasn't
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   insignificant.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   It was a sizable debt.
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:57.080]   And likewise, there are times when we are sinned against, when we are offended, and
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.000]   it is not insignificant.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.800]   It does hurt us.
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.160]   It does cause issues.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.320]   It's not a light thing, but God understands that.
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:14.440]   God understands our pain, our hurt, our feelings of betrayal when we are hurt like this.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:21.200]   But you see, God in the person of Jesus Christ has experienced the same pain, the same hurt,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.520]   the same betrayal.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:27.960]   And so He can empathize with us, and He can give us the grace and the strength to show
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:32.600]   mercy to those people who hurt us.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:39.160]   An important thing to note here too, and this is a very, can be a hard pill to swallow.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.800]   It could be a difficult truth, but it is true nonetheless.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:49.080]   No matter what anyone on this earth does to you, no matter how terrible their sin against
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:58.280]   you may be, it will never come close to how offensive and egregious your sin, my sin,
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.400]   our sin is to God.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:07.040]   Because God is infinitely holy and pure and just and righteous.
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.400]   And so our sin against Him, way worse, incomparably.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:18.240]   To try to compare the sin that we have towards God with the sin that someone has against
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:21.000]   us, it's pointless.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.360]   Our sin against a holy God is both incalculable and incomparable.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:30.940]   Yet in Jesus Christ, we have complete forgiveness.
[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:32.440]   That is why we must forgive.
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.480]   It's because we have been greatly forgiven.
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.200]   It has been said that there is never a time you are more like God than when you forgive.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:46.680]   Well, then the negative of that must also be true.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:52.960]   There is never a time you are less like God than when you refuse to forgive, especially
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:57.380]   if you know that you have been forgiven by God.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:02.280]   How many times have we all said this while reciting the Lord's Prayer, "Forgive us
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:07.160]   our sins as we forgive those who sin against us."
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:11.780]   That should be more than a few words we recite from memory here and there.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.040]   It should be, for us, a way of life.
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.520]   It's more than a prayer.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.220]   According to Jesus, it's a command.
[00:29:19.220 --> 00:29:25.360]   You know, we all know how good it feels to be forgiven when we have wronged someone.
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.040]   Even more than that, we know how great it is to be forgiven by God.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:33.960]   So why would we withhold that forgiveness from a brother or sister who sins against
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   us?
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:38.000]   Why would we hold a grudge?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.400]   When you ask yourself, when you're honest, think about it this way.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:43.740]   What has holding a grudge ever done for you?
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:47.820]   Has anyone ever held a grudge and it solved the problem?
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:53.720]   Has anyone ever held a grudge and it went back in time and it righted the wrong?
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:54.720]   It never does.
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:56.540]   It never helps.
[00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:01.760]   And although it might initially feel good, if we're honest, to be angry and to stir
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:06.040]   in that anger and think thoughts of revenge, of how I'm going to get back and how I'm
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:10.120]   going to hurt you because you hurted me, in the end, it only hurts us.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.280]   It only makes us feel worse.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:16.220]   I was here at Summit on Friday speaking with the middle school and high school students
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:22.660]   and I told them that holding a grudge against somebody, withholding that forgiveness, harboring
[00:30:22.660 --> 00:30:29.280]   that anger towards them, is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.280]   It's ridiculous.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.200]   It's totally ridiculous.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:39.520]   How much more ridiculous is it then for us, those who have been greatly forgiven by God,
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:44.920]   forgiven more than anyone else in the world, to refuse to forgive someone else, especially
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:47.760]   a brother or sister in the Lord?
[00:30:47.760 --> 00:30:52.240]   Not only is it ridiculous, but according to Jesus, it is wicked.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:58.360]   And what we see the King in this parable do is exactly what we know that God will do to
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:03.560]   those who refuse to forgive their brother or sister.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:11.160]   It's true, God is a God of great mercy, forgiveness, patience, love.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:14.800]   He is also a God of great justice.
[00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:21.440]   Hebrews chapter 10 verse 13 tells us this, "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:23.960]   of the living God.
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:28.840]   Yet those who have received the forgiveness found only in Jesus Christ have no need to
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:29.840]   fear.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:37.160]   We should never forget, as Jesus teaches in Matthew 6, 15, "If you do not forgive men
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:42.480]   their sins, neither will your Father forgive yours."
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.280]   Brothers and sisters, if you leave here today and you only remember one thing that I say
[00:31:47.280 --> 00:31:51.160]   this entire morning, please let it be this.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:58.420]   If we refuse to extend forgiveness to others, we should not expect God to extend forgiveness
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:31:59.440]   to us.
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.800]   Jesus speaks very clearly and forcefully on this matter.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:06.320]   There's no ifs, ands, or buts about it.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:12.480]   For the followers of Jesus Christ, forgiveness is not optional.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.600]   It can't be.
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:21.160]   Now that's not to say, and don't take this to mean that our forgiveness is earning us
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.720]   God's forgiveness and that if we forgive, we earn God's forgiveness.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.320]   That's not how it works.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:31.440]   That's a misunderstanding and a misordering of forgiveness.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:36.240]   But what it is is that if we truly have been forgiven by God, if we understand and believe
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:43.600]   all that Jesus Christ has done for us to earn our forgiveness, we would then, knowing that,
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.560]   be moved to forgive those who sin against us.
[00:32:46.560 --> 00:32:51.960]   We would have a new heart transformed by the Holy Spirit, which understands how much we've
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:57.120]   been forgiven and is quick to forgive those who sin against us.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:05.320]   Yet if we refuse to forgive others, that may be a sign that we have not truly understood
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:10.360]   and believed the forgiveness of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:13.420]   And that is a very dangerous place to be.
[00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:17.600]   So brothers and sisters, I plea with you, search your heart.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.200]   Be honest with yourself.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.800]   Be honest before God.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:26.800]   Is there someone in your life who you cannot bring yourself to forgive, that you are not
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.480]   willing to forgive for some wrong they've done against you, some way they've hurt you,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:37.080]   whether recently or in the past, whether it's a family member or a friend, a co-worker,
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:38.720]   a neighbor, a stranger?
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.840]   Is there someone that you cannot forgive?
[00:33:40.840 --> 00:33:44.280]   Now is the time to forgive them.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:49.680]   And the chances are, for some of us, if not all of us in this room, there is some real
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:54.760]   serious pain and hurt that we've experienced, trauma we've been through.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.620]   Give that pain to God.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:57.620]   Give that pain to God.
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:33:59.280]   He understands it.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:02.440]   He can bear that pain for you.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:06.400]   And maybe you're like me and you think, "Well, I'm not the type to hold grudges.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:07.640]   I don't do grudges.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:08.640]   I don't hold grudges.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:09.640]   I forgive people."
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:13.800]   Okay, but I challenge you to ask yourself, are you the kind of person who's quick to
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:14.800]   get angry?
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.860]   Yeah, maybe you're quick to forgive, but are you quick to get angry?
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:22.240]   Are you quick to have a bad mood because someone offended you at work, at home?
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:26.600]   Are you quick to become upset with a spouse for something they said or did or didn't do
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.200]   that you didn't like?
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:35.240]   Are you quick to have an attitude against them and think how you'll get back at them?
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.640]   Maybe it could be a stranger in traffic that cut you off and your first thought is, "Okay,
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:40.360]   I'm going to get around you and cut you off.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.480]   I'm going to get in front of you now and see how you like it."
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:45.300]   Is that your disposition?
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.300]   Sometimes that's me.
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.300]   I'll be honest.
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:49.480]   That's a heart of unforgiveness.
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:56.080]   I don't hold grudges, but I ought to be quick to forgive because you see, God does not do
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:57.400]   that with us.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.800]   He doesn't hold those sins against us and think about how to get back.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:04.700]   So we should be quick to forgive because God is quick to forgive.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.820]   When God forgives us, He forgives quickly.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.360]   He forgives completely.
[00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.360]   He doesn't keep a record.
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:16.200]   "Okay, I forgive you this time, but next time I'll remember it because next time maybe there
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.280]   won't be a next time.
[00:35:17.280 --> 00:35:18.820]   We should not be like that."
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:24.560]   Because God forgives quickly and completely and without keeping a record of wrongdoing,
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.620]   so should we.
[00:35:27.620 --> 00:35:33.220]   So remember, all that Jesus Christ has done to forgive you your sin, remember how great
[00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:38.960]   your debt of sin is in the eyes of God and praise God that He has forgiven you.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:45.940]   Praise the Lord Jesus Christ that He has shed His life's blood to purchase your forgiveness
[00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:52.480]   and in giving Him the glory for that forgiveness, for that changed life, that changed heart,
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.460]   forgive others.
[00:35:55.460 --> 00:35:57.740]   Please pray with me.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:04.740]   Father, forgive us our sins as we forgive those who have sinned against us.
[00:36:04.740 --> 00:36:05.620]   Amen.
