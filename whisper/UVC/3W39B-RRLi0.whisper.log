[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800]   Thank you, James, for giving us a short announcement.
[00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:07.140]   Today, we're going to continue with our series,
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.800]   and there are some questions I want you to do together.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.300]   There will be some riddle to solve, okay?
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.840]   All right, so it's coming up, all right?
[00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.900]   So, at the Apostles' Creek,
[00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.240]   we are talking about this ancient statement of faith.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.960]   It's been around for more than 1,500 years,
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:28.820]   almost 2,000 years, to give us a world map
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.160]   of what it means to follow Jesus Christ.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.040]   We are coming to, I don't know,
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.360]   statement number one, two, three, four,
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.200]   maybe four or five.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.720]   It talks about Jesus.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.560]   Remember, the center of the entire Apostles' Creek
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.000]   is on Jesus Christ himself,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.360]   what he has done and who he is.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.720]   So, right here, we have a statement that says
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.880]   he was crucified, he died,
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.600]   and was buried, and he descended to the dead.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.760]   That means he really died, right?
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.080]   Was crucified.
[00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.240]   All right, that is a technical phrase in the first century.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.600]   Now, who is being crucified in the first century?
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.120]   Political criminals.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.680]   They will be crucified.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.580]   In fact, Jesus was not the only one
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.200]   being crucified in the first century.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.480]   I think, as I prepared this message,
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.480]   I remember it was back in the 1970s.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.020]   Yeah, '70s.
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.520]   Before you were born, right?
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.960]   Wait, I was born, okay.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.580]   I was born.
[00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.840]   There in Jerusalem, they dug out a tomb,
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.420]   and in the tomb, they found some human bones.
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.500]   One of the bone pieces is
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.680]   a heel bone of a man, all right?
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.040]   Heel bone of a man.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.720]   You can see on the left.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.840]   There is still a Roman nail going through it.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.760]   We guess that maybe in,
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.080]   somebody being crucified,
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.200]   that man being crucified, the victim of crucifixion,
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.360]   and he was buried, and then as they try to bury him,
[00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.160]   because there was a big nail going through his heel bone.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.000]   You know where the heel bone is?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.240]   Yeah?
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.400]   Going through it, professionally,
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.560]   going through the entire heel bone without breaking it.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.920]   And then when they buried the guy,
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.680]   they could not take the nail out,
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.920]   probably because the nail was bent or something like that.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.480]   So as you can see from this heel bone,
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.000]   you can reconstruct kind of what it would look like
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.840]   for a crucifix victim.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.280]   So,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:02.440]   both the feet being nailed to the vertical wood beam,
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.680]   and then
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:09.640]   hands and arms extended.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.440]   Usually, the nail would go through your wrist.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.200]   So this reconstruction does not show it.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.280]   However, sometimes, a crucifix victim
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.060]   would be nailed to the cross by four nails,
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.720]   just like what the gospel have described.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.560]   All right?
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.560]   The nailed hand, right?
[00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.600]   Both hands.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.940]   And then, nailed feet, right?
[00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:40.440]   So this is something historical.
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.040]   We are looking at what's crucified, this face.
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.460]   Only the political criminals,
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:52.880]   political rebels, they were being hunt down
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.080]   by the Roman authorities, the Roman Empire police.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.500]   And then they would crucify these people.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.520]   Now, as mentioned, crucifixion is a political penalty
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:12.120]   for all those who have committed treason
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.200]   against the Roman Empire.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.520]   Now, with this picture, we can see that, actually,
[00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.940]   when Jesus died on the cross,
[00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.560]   he let us see
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.280]   there was a political side to the kingdom of God.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:36.760]   By dying on the cross, by suffering from crucifixion,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:40.920]   he's actually showing us there was a different reality,
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.480]   different kingdom, different political reality.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.640]   And we, as Christ followers, we have to see that.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:54.800]   Just happened today is the happy independence day,
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.480]   well, tomorrow, right?
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:58.740]   The happy July 4th weekend.
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:04.840]   Many Americans are celebrating nationalism, right?
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:07.040]   Patriotism.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.080]   There's nothing wrong with loving our country,
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:14.320]   but that can never trump our allegiance
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.480]   to the kingdom of God.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:19.680]   Because followers of Jesus Christ,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.600]   we are proclaiming a totally different reality.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:26.320]   And Jesus, by dying on the cross,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.920]   he proclaims a totally different world order,
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.840]   a totally different order of power,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.100]   reconfiguring our whole life.
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:41.400]   When Jesus came to your life, when Jesus came to my life,
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.360]   there should be some reconfiguration of powers,
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.860]   reconfiguration of functions in our lives.
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.240]   Jesus died on the cross, he sacrificed himself,
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.760]   he laid down his own right.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.600]   That is a different reality, isn't it?
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.480]   Right, crucifixion, Jesus died on the cross,
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:05.720]   it's other center, he died on the cross
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.920]   so that we can be saved.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.340]   He did not grasp his own right in heaven,
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.680]   but he laid down his own right.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.840]   That's why the Bible consistently emphasizes one fact,
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:23.360]   is that Jesus is the servant king.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:29.060]   And that is the status for all church communities.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:34.200]   We follow Jesus, we profess his faith,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.960]   we believe in him, as the apostle of Crete says,
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.380]   we believe that he was crucified, he died.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:45.640]   And that is the example of Jesus.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.060]   Let me read a passage from Philippians 2.
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:54.760]   It says, "Your attitude, your mindset,
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   "should be the same as that of Christ Jesus."
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:02.920]   And then he goes on, "Jesus, being in the nature of God,
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.960]   "very nature of God, did not consider equality with God
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:12.120]   "something to be grasped, but made himself nothing."
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.260]   Those of us who are versed in English grammar,
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:20.120]   you should know something called reflexive pronoun.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.360]   You know what reflexive pronoun is?
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.360]   No?
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:27.600]   Those who are teachers, students,
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.760]   reflexive pronoun means something that you do to yourself.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:33.580]   Right?
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:37.360]   Something that you do to yourself.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.120]   That is reflexive pronoun.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:43.280]   Can you find a reflexive pronoun here?
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.920]   Made himself nothing.
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:51.680]   Nobody forced him to do that, but he chose to do that.
[00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.680]   He made himself nothing.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.880]   This is the example of Jesus.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.400]   And we have to ask one more question.
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.760]   Why did Paul write 2-5, right, Philippians?
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.920]   There was something before 2-5, which is 2-1-4, right?
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:11.680]   Actually, Paul is actually teaching the Christians
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:14.440]   in Philippi, the small group churches,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:16.940]   maybe five, 10 people a group.
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:21.480]   10, 15 people is called a church community
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.040]   in the city of Philippi.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:24.920]   And he is trying to teach them
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.760]   what it means to live as a church.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.320]   What it means to be the church.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.520]   And church is a community where we lay aside
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.400]   our own interests.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:38.480]   We come into the church, we gather with our,
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.400]   with the Bible study group or college Bible study group
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.320]   or high school group, or coming to worship.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.320]   No matter where we gather,
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:49.360]   if we gather in the name of Christ,
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   if we gather in the name of Jesus,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.520]   first presupposition is to lay down your own rights,
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.560]   your own priority, your own interest.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:02.920]   Working for the interest of others.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:05.120]   That is the community of church.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.160]   That is what Christ has called us to be.
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:11.680]   Now many people today, when we come to church,
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.180]   sometimes we forgot to check our attitude.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:20.320]   We come here to be entertained, right?
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.840]   Have you ever noticed the worship team
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.840]   played some wrong notes?
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:26.760]   Probably they did, right?
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.640]   You walk out the church and would you give five star
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.560]   to the worship experience?
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.920]   Probably not, right?
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.640]   Probably not.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.080]   But if we do that, if we do that,
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:41.800]   we miss the whole point.
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.240]   We are not experiencing the presence of God.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:47.040]   We are not experiencing the presence of Jesus.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:49.400]   We come here not as a customer.
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.560]   We come here as a community of Jesus Christ himself.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.920]   And what did he do?
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.640]   He laid down his own rights.
[00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.440]   He made himself nothing.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.400]   That is the church.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.080]   That is what the church is all about.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.800]   One more example.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.240]   We can quote other passages from the Bible
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.880]   talking about the church being a different order
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:13.800]   from the world, totally different from our culture
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.760]   because the culture, there is a culture script out there.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.680]   The American culture, happy July 4th,
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.920]   we celebrate individualism.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.080]   That is the meta-narrative of our culture, of our world.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:32.760]   And it's constantly brainwashing us to tell you
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:34.760]   that if you follow this meta-narrative,
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.880]   this big narrative, this cultural script,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.200]   you'll be great.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:44.360]   You define yourself by individualistic choices, right?
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.440]   I make my own choices.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:51.880]   I want to define myself the way I want to.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.160]   That is the meta-narrative out there.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.760]   But when we come before Christ,
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:02.040]   it's a totally different ballgame, isn't it?
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   We lay down our own rights.
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.440]   It's no longer individualism.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.040]   It is other-centered community.
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.480]   We lay down our own rights.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.720]   We lay down our own status.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:20.600]   I think of some other passages from the Bible
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.760]   that also proclaims this kind of different order of power.
[00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:32.000]   Remember that there were some passages in the Bible,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.320]   in the New Testament.
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.160]   It sounds funny to us as modern readers.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.280]   I'll give you an example.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:41.040]   One of the example is 1 Timothy 2.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:46.120]   Paul there is teaching the women in the church
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.320]   not to dress up to go to church, but to dress down.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:58.200]   Have you ever noticed that?
[00:11:58.200 --> 00:12:00.720]   No jewelry, Paul is saying,
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.080]   "Don't come here with nice clothing.
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:06.000]   "I see that you are not coming with very nice clothing.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.840]   "That's good."
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:08.000]   All right?
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.160]   And why did Paul do that?
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:12.000]   Why did Paul do that?
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.080]   You think your clothing is nice?
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.240]   Well, anyways.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:18.040]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.800]   Well, you know, you picked that this morning?
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.640]   Cool.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.720]   (audience laughing)
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.800]   Anyways, 1 Timothy 2.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:29.360]   If you have time, go back home and read that passage.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.800]   Paul is actually doing something very funny to us.
[00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:36.040]   He said, "Don't dress up when you come to church.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.440]   "You dress down."
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:41.560]   Now the question is why?
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.120]   Because in the Roman Empire,
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.960]   the social order so often is defined by
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.720]   how you wear, right?
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:53.640]   Now it's funny to us because we no longer do that, right?
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:56.760]   We no longer emphasize so much on this, right?
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.800]   I'm a CEO of a big company.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.220]   They can give a presentation,
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:06.920]   a formal presentation with jeans, right?
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:09.000]   I mean, we don't do that anymore, do we?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.040]   We don't.
[00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.120]   I remember in the old days, in the '80s, in the '90s,
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.480]   when we go to church,
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:18.560]   sometimes we are required to put on suit and tie.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   Well, unspoken rule.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.760]   I remember one time we were still in college.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.320]   We were going with some friends to Los Angeles.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.600]   So we were driving down from Northern California.
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:35.480]   I was in Sacramento at that point.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.200]   And then we drove down to Los Angeles for vacation.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:42.240]   So some of our friends, we went to Hollywood,
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:43.080]   we went to
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.720]   Universal Studio and all those stuff, right?
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.880]   The fun stuff.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.480]   So on Sunday, we found a church.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:54.320]   See, we have good Christians, right?
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:56.720]   We still find a church to go to.
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.680]   So Sunday morning, we drove to one of the churches
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:01.680]   in the area.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.680]   So we walk into the church, right?
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:07.360]   So we were young and fun people.
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:13.120]   I remember one of my friends was wearing shorts.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.680]   As a group, we walk into the church.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.760]   And then we were stopped by a deacon.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.280]   And the deacon stopped us,
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.440]   but not stopped me because I was wearing pants, right?
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.440]   Long pants.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.720]   Stopped the guy wearing shorts.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:31.840]   And started yelling at him
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.920]   that you don't come to the sanctuary with shorts.
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.160]   I mean, is that crazy?
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.200]   That's kind of crazy, right?
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.640]   That's kind of crazy.
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:45.760]   I still remember some of the churches
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.600]   back in my generation,
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.720]   they have ties
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.560]   at the door.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.320]   And whenever they pick,
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:58.200]   they find a guy without wearing a tie,
[00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:00.600]   you can borrow a tie, don't worry.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.280]   You can borrow a tie and tie it around your neck
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:07.440]   and you come to the holy sanctuary to worship God, right?
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:10.360]   Do you want to do that?
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:12.080]   No, right?
[00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:15.960]   I find it funny.
[00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:16.880]   I find it funny.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.120]   Now I've grown
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.440]   after all these years.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.400]   And I find it funny because
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:29.000]   the New Testament actually tells us
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.160]   to dress down.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.440]   In the Roman order of things,
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:35.520]   you dress up
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:40.000]   to focus on your social status, right?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.960]   That's why the wealthy woman
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.200]   would dress up when they go to church.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.400]   And when they dress up to go to church,
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.400]   they will emphasize their own high status in the society.
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:53.560]   So that other poor people also come to the church,
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:56.760]   then there is a contrast, right?
[00:15:56.760 --> 00:15:57.840]   Now, poor is,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   poor is not trying to censor their clothing
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.120]   or what they wear.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.840]   Poor is trying to say in the community of the church,
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.000]   we don't emphasize our social economic differences
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.440]   because the ground around the cross is level.
[00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:19.000]   At the foot of the cross, we are all sinners
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.840]   and we only justify by grace.
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:23.560]   And that's the spirit, right?
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:26.060]   That is what the church means.
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:31.480]   We come as a community to focus on others, not ourselves.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:35.200]   Great example, right?
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:39.560]   If you take a look at the previous context of 2-5,
[00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:41.480]   you know, the hymn for Christ,
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.840]   how he made himself nothing,
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:46.840]   how he died on the cross as a slave.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:52.160]   Paul was actually teaching the Christians
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:56.520]   how to be together, how to form a community together.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:58.480]   He said, if you have any encouragement
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.980]   from being united with Christ,
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.080]   with any comfort from his love,
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.200]   any fellowship with the spirit,
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.320]   any tenderness and compassion,
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.600]   then make my joys, Paul says, complete
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:16.120]   by being like-minded, having the same love,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.800]   being one in spirit and purpose.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.160]   Do nothing out of selfish ambition.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.920]   In humility, consider others better than yourselves.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:28.560]   Each of you should look not only to your own interests,
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:31.560]   but also to the interests of others.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:36.720]   Jesus was crucified and died as a political victim.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:43.600]   That is the example of servanthood.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.760]   We follow Jesus, we do the same.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:51.260]   Now, the apostles continue with the phrase
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:54.560]   "under Pontius Pilate."
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.480]   You know who that guy is?
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.720]   Pontius Pilate?
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:01.360]   Pontius Pilate.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.640]   Now, under the Roman occupation at the time,
[00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.060]   Rome will send a local governor, a Roman,
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.100]   to rule over conquered cities,
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.760]   like Palestine, the land of Israel
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:23.160]   at that time in the first century.
[00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:27.320]   So, the Roman governor would rule over the Jewish people,
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:33.960]   and of course, the Jewish people would hate the governor.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:38.280]   So, there's a huge political disconnection there.
[00:18:38.280 --> 00:18:41.400]   There's a huge political tension between Pontius Pilate,
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.140]   who ruled Palestine at the time, AD 26 to 36,
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:50.060]   against the Roman population.
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:54.120]   There was story after story outside the Bible
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:58.440]   talking about people rebelling against the authorities,
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.520]   protesting, and all that stuff.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.440]   And Pilate was a crafty politician.
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:09.200]   Remember, the Jewish authorities trying to persecute Jesus
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.440]   and crucify him and crucify him, they yell,
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:16.640]   and then they bring Jesus to Pilate, the governor,
[00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:19.920]   because as local authorities, the Jerusalemites,
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.080]   they could not impose a death penalty.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.880]   So, they bring him to Pilate.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.200]   As the Roman governor at the time,
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.360]   Pilate wanted to keep the peace, to please the people.
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:37.680]   That's why he had Jesus crucified.
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:40.120]   So, Pilate was a crafty politician.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:42.280]   It's like today, right?
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:45.520]   You hear about who you should vote for,
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:49.360]   someone's going to try to win your vote, right?
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.760]   Don't get into the trap,
[00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:55.020]   because they are all politicians, right?
[00:19:56.020 --> 00:19:58.620]   They are all politicians.
[00:19:58.620 --> 00:20:02.700]   No political party can represent the kingdom of God.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.380]   The kingdom of God is so big,
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:08.380]   bigger than left or right or center.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:13.260]   A different reality, different order of things.
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:15.180]   Now, here's the riddle.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:18.140]   As we talk about the Apostles' Creed,
[00:20:18.140 --> 00:20:20.140]   under Pontius Pilate, that's very interesting,
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:23.660]   because there's a bad guy in this Apostles' Creed, right?
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:27.740]   It's supposed to be something really pure, right?
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:31.980]   Document, talking about the Christian faith.
[00:20:31.980 --> 00:20:35.700]   Why did they put Pontius Pilate there, right?
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.260]   A bad politician there.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:41.220]   Well, this is a historical note, right?
[00:20:41.220 --> 00:20:44.020]   Christianity is historic.
[00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:47.340]   Something that happened in real time and space, right?
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:49.760]   It's not some mythic stories.
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:54.820]   It's not some fictional stuff that we believe in,
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:57.180]   but something that actually happened
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:20:59.060]   in real time and space.
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.220]   Pontius Pilate, governor of Palestine, AD 26 to 36, right?
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:07.500]   If you check the Roman history,
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:11.580]   or the history of the eastern Mediterranean area,
[00:21:11.580 --> 00:21:16.900]   you would find this name show up
[00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:20.160]   on other different historical documents.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.420]   Many years ago, there was a city in the land of Palestine
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:29.220]   called Caesarea Militima.
[00:21:29.220 --> 00:21:33.420]   It's a harbor.
[00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:35.760]   It's a huge man-made harbor.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:41.220]   People were digging there, and they found a piece of stone
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:45.100]   being reused later time in a Roman theater.
[00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.860]   And on that stone, there were some inscriptions.
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.780]   Now, the riddle is, can you find the name Pilate
[00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:54.440]   on the inscriptions?
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.460]   Can you find it?
[00:21:57.460 --> 00:21:59.140]   Can you make it out?
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:01.060]   Where is it?
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:06.180]   Can you find P-I-L-A-T-U-S, or V-S?
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:10.840]   Can you find it?
[00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:15.900]   Where is it?
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.980]   The first line says Tiberium, right?
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:25.140]   Tiberius was also the Roman emperor at the time, Tiberius.
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:30.580]   So there's a Tiberium, some sort of temple,
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.000]   dedicated to the boss, right?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.180]   The CEO of the entire Roman Empire, right?
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.700]   Tiberium, so this kind of a dedication inscription
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:43.540]   for a temple in Caesarea Militima.
[00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:46.120]   Can you find Pilate?
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.400]   Can you see that?
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:52.820]   Yeah, Pontus Pilate, right?
[00:22:52.820 --> 00:22:58.380]   Pontus Pilate, and the prefect of Judea, right?
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:05.660]   So Pilate is this historical thing,
[00:23:05.660 --> 00:23:08.020]   he's a historical figure, right?
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:09.700]   When they unearthed this thing,
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.660]   they finally find something in the stone
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:16.060]   that says Pilate was a real guy.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:19.460]   Of course, Jesus was a real guy, right?
[00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:23.620]   As the Creed says, he was crucified on the third day,
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:29.100]   and then he rose again, ascended into heaven,
[00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:31.860]   and is now seated at the right hand of the Father.
[00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:35.780]   He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.500]   The empty tomb is being affirmed
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:41.460]   as an other historical fact.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.720]   The tomb of Jesus is empty.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.880]   Point blank, telling you, the tomb of Christ is empty.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:54.840]   But how do you explain the empty tomb?
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.680]   I want to close today's message with a pretty long quote.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:01.760]   I find this book is one of the best books
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.520]   on the reality of the empty tomb.
[00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:09.160]   This guy is an Israeli archaeologist,
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:13.040]   Israeli historian, Shimon Gibson.
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:15.960]   Now I find this book pretty interesting
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.680]   because he's, you know, Gibson is not,
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:21.600]   he's not a Christian, obviously.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:23.180]   He's a Israeli Jew.
[00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:28.640]   He's a historian, and he has written this pretty good book,
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:34.320]   'cause this book begins with some sort of presuppositions.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   The presupposition is that the four gospel,
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.820]   Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.200]   are quite reliable documents.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.440]   So he started to investigate what is being told
[00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.360]   by the four gospels.
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.240]   Are they really eyewitnesses?
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:58.840]   Are they really historical accounts, reliable?
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.860]   We can trace back to the time of Jesus,
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:03.840]   and then he's tried to unearth other stuff
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.520]   and to match the evidence.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.520]   Toward the end, he says,
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.800]   "There were different strange theories
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:16.960]   "having been put forward to explain away the empty tomb."
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.420]   But Gibson said, "They are all based on nonsense.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:26.720]   "Archaeology and history cannot prove or disprove
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.120]   "the possibility that Jesus' body was smuggled out
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:33.280]   "by persons unknown, but this is a matter of speculation."
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:37.220]   Now here's the important point.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:41.220]   The reality is there is no historical explanation
[00:25:41.220 --> 00:25:43.060]   for the empty tomb.
[00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:47.480]   Other than, now if you try to come up with different theories
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:51.700]   different ways to explain away the empty tomb,
[00:25:51.700 --> 00:25:54.700]   Gibson is saying, there's no way you can do that.
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:59.180]   Because there's no historical scientific explanation
[00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.760]   for the empty tomb.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:05.680]   Unless you adopt the biblical reason.
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.160]   The biblical reason.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:11.640]   The theological explanation.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.480]   Which says, the resurrection.
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.480]   And he says, "I leave it up to the reader
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:20.900]   "to make up your mind."
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:24.380]   I find this very interesting conclusion, right?
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:26.800]   You can do historical inquiry
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:30.760]   of why the tomb is empty.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.100]   Somebody stole the body,
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:36.160]   or maybe the disciple went to a wrong tomb,
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:38.180]   or something like that, right?
[00:26:38.180 --> 00:26:40.380]   You can explain away the empty tomb,
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.540]   but ultimately, there's no historical scientific ways
[00:26:44.540 --> 00:26:50.380]   to explain why the tomb was empty.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.300]   There's no way.
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.420]   Because that goes beyond historical inquiry.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:00.580]   That goes beyond all scientific knowledge can tell you.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:04.680]   At the end of the day, you can only conclude
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.060]   that the tomb is actually empty.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.460]   But why?
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:12.200]   When you talk about the reason,
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.540]   there's only one reason given by the Bible.
[00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:17.300]   Whether you accept it or not.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:19.260]   It's a theological reason.
[00:27:19.260 --> 00:27:23.020]   That God raised Jesus from the dead, right?
[00:27:23.020 --> 00:27:24.380]   God raised Jesus from the dead.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:26.360]   It's a miracle.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.860]   It's something only God can do.
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.020]   But to accept that reason,
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:34.380]   you cannot stay in your own order of things.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:38.660]   You cannot maintain your own worldview, so to speak.
[00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:41.880]   All right, you have to change your own worldview radically
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:46.260]   in order to accept that biblical theological reason
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:50.340]   that God did something to the body of Jesus,
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.140]   raised him from the dead.
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:54.900]   And that worldview transformation
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:01.240]   is to say that, okay, I don't maintain my own
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.240]   closed universe, closed system kind of worldview.
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:11.720]   Reality is not just here, now, and something I can touch.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:13.200]   Right, I can sense.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.600]   It's not just that.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:18.760]   There's a reality higher than the order of things
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:20.000]   that I can see.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.880]   And that is a supernatural metaphysical reality.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:30.560]   I think Gibson, I have to agree with Simone Gibson.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:34.800]   You have to make up your mind
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:38.840]   whether you accept the theological reason or not.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:43.000]   Now, I want to close today's message by quoting this verse.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.060]   Galatians chapter two, verse 20.
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:51.400]   Paul says, "I have been crucified, the old self."
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:53.920]   Paul is talking about his old self.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:55.680]   "I have been crucified with Christ,
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:29:00.200]   "and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me."
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.640]   The new self.
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.840]   When you accept Jesus, there should be
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.080]   a fundamental change in our lives.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.420]   Our attitude, our worldview,
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:14.560]   our perspective on order of things.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.140]   Christ lives in me.
[00:29:16.140 --> 00:29:19.840]   The life I live, the new life I live in the body,
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:22.680]   I live by faith in the Son of God.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:27.620]   And He loved me and gave Himself for me.
[00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:33.120]   This is no longer something out there,
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:36.640]   some objective fact or something that happened
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.280]   in the world, in time and space.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.080]   Yes, that's true, historical fact,
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.680]   and Pontius Pilate, Jesus, the real guy,
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.760]   and all that stuff, empty tomb.
[00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.760]   It becomes a subjective experience.
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.080]   It becomes your own personal experience.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:57.920]   Christianity, biblical faith, it's all about relationship.
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.640]   It is your relationship with Christ.
[00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:04.040]   But please understand, this sort of relationship
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.680]   is not just, "Oh, you know, patting my back,
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.420]   "and you'll be okay."
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:12.800]   It's a radical transformation, how we see the world,
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.960]   and how we see ourselves.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.280]   Well, I want to recite the Apostles' Creed together,
[00:30:17.280 --> 00:30:19.700]   and then we'll pray together.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.160]   That's all we recite together.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.320]   You all stand.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:29.480]   Apostles' Creed.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.600]   Let's recite together.
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.720]   I believe in God, the God Almighty,
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.560]   creator of heaven and earth.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.120]   I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.360]   He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:44.360]   and born of the Virgin Mary.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.480]   He suffered under Pontius Pilate,
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:49.440]   was crucified, died, and was buried.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:51.240]   He descended to the dead.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:53.160]   On the third day, He rose again.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.960]   He ascended into heaven,
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.920]   and is now seated at the right hand of the Father.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.640]   He will come again to judge the living and the dead.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:04.280]   I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy universal church,
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.120]   the communion of saints, the covenants of sin.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.320]   Let's all pray.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:17.600]   Father, I give you thanks for breaking into our reality,
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.720]   breaking into our world,
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.140]   to tell us that you are real,
[00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:27.240]   to tell us that you have done something mighty,
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:30.280]   something that is beyond our explanation
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:32.800]   in real time and real space.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.760]   In history, you have come,
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:38.800]   and you die on the cross for our sins,
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:40.400]   and you rose from the dead
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.760]   to give us new hope and eternal life.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.440]   Father, this new reality, may you help us to be reminded
[00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:50.020]   and to stand on it,
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:55.560]   to base our whole life on this foundation,
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:59.000]   knowing that your kingdom is eternal,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.480]   and your kingdom will come.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.560]   And we pray that your kingdom will come into our lives,
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:06.160]   change us gradually,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:11.760]   radically transform us into the image of your Son.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:14.240]   And thank you for the relationship that we have
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.960]   at the foot of the cross.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:20.240]   Thank you for saving us and changing our identity.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.320]   And we are your children.
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.280]   We are your sons and daughters.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.000]   And may you use us, may you continue to change us
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:30.840]   into your Son's image.
[00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:35.160]   In Christ's name we pray, amen.
