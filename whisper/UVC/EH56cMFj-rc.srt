1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,360
 Okay, it works.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,360
 That's good.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,980
 Looks like people are doing well.

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:24,560
 As always, it is a great privilege, an incredible privilege to be here to see you all this morning.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,540
 So let me first open us in a word of prayer.

7
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:33,560
 If you would bow your heads with me, let's pray.

8
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:41,620
 Heavenly Father, our God and our Father, what is man that we can stand before you in this

9
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,420
 moment that you would hear us?

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:53,160
 Only by your son, Lord, can we stand before you righteous and justified, seen not as enemies

11
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,920
 but as friends and as children, as heirs of your kingdom.

12
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,340
 And so, God, I ask in this moment that you would be with us, that you would make your

13
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:09,020
 presence known to your people here, that you would magnify yourself.

14
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,380
 Would you guard them against anything I say that might not be of you?

15
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:18,640
 Would you use what I say and help us see your word as you have spoken it to your people,

16
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,640
 Lord?

17
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,640
 This time is yours.

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,520
 These people are yours and we pray all this in Jesus' name.

19
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,520
 Amen.

20
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,520
 Okay.

21
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:32,640
 So, as many of you are aware, just looking at the slide, we have been in the book of

22
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:37,280
 James and we will be continuing our reading of the book of James, which is a letter from

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,880
 James to the Jewish Christians of dispersion.

24
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:48,560
 And what we find in James is that the theme of James is followers of Jesus are to be affected

25
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:55,800
 by their faith, not just hearers of the word of God, but also doers of the word of God.

26
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,200
 And this is James' call for his brothers and sisters, for them to live wise lives, lives

27
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,920
 that are reflective of the gospel that they have received.

28
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,520
 Last time, we saw James address the way in which the Jewish Christians were to treat

29
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,960
 the poor and the needy that come into the midst of their gathering, how they are not

30
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:22,120
 to make distinctions among themselves based on outward appearance or seek to curry favor

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,720
 of those who are rich in the eyes of the world.

32
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:32,680
 Instead, they are to show mercy and compassion, to love their neighbors just as God had loved

33
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,880
 them in their need.

34
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:40,400
 Rather than seek favor from man, they are to look to God and God alone for their needs.

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,320
 You see, the apostle James doesn't want God's people to live double lives.

36
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:51,320
 He wants them to be whole, perfect, and complete, to be rid of the flaws in character that come

37
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,640
 from keeping parts of themselves separate from the effects of the gospel, and in doing

38
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,400
 so become more and more like Jesus.

39
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,440
 Yet James' instructions, okay, his instructions are not just given because he wants you to

40
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,440
 be more Christ-like.

41
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,840
 That is incredibly important, but not just that.

42
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:15,800
 He gives them because it is a matter of life and death.

43
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,920
 Having said that, let's look at today's passage.

44
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:25,200
 If you have your Bibles with you, I invite you to turn with me to James chapter 2, verses

45
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,200
 14 to 26.

46
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:34,440
 Again, that is the book of James, its second chapter from verse 14 to the end of verse

47
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,680
 26.

48
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,800
 It's on the slide here, and I'll just read it for you guys, okay?

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
 Here we are.

50
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,920
 James chapter 2, verses 14 to 26.

51
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,560
 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no

52
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,720
 deeds?

53
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,320
 Can such a faith save them?

54
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,120
 Suppose a brother or a sister is without clothes and daily food.

55
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,540
 If one of you says to them, "Go in peace, keep warm and well-fed," but does nothing

56
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,040
 about their physical needs, what good is it?

57
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:13,840
 In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.

58
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,960
 But someone will say, "You have faith, I have deeds.

59
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:22,580
 Show me your faith without deeds, and I will show you my faith by my deeds.

60
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,020
 You believe that there is one God, good.

61
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,580
 Even the demons believe that, and shudder.

62
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,940
 You foolish person, do you want evidence that faith without deeds is useless?

63
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,420
 Was not our father Abraham considered righteous for what he did when he offered his son Isaac

64
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,120
 on the altar?

65
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:42,720
 You see that his faith and his actions were working together, and his faith was made complete

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,140
 by what he did.

67
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,120
 And a scripture was fulfilled that said, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as

68
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,580
 righteousness, and he was called God's friend."

69
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:57,880
 You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.

70
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,040
 In the same way, was not even Rahab the prostitute considered righteous for what she did when

71
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:08,120
 she gave lodging to the spies and sent them off in a different direction?

72
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:15,340
 As the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without deeds is dead.

73
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,440
 We start here.

74
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,680
 We start here in verse 14, with this question placed right before you.

75
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,520
 What good is it?

76
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:31,480
 What good is it for someone to claim faith but exhibit no deeds?

77
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:36,960
 The scenario is given here, where there is someone who needs clothes and food.

78
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,920
 James asks his audience, he asks them this question, "What good is it to pray and give

79
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,920
 blessing, right?

80
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:51,820
 Go in peace, keep warm and well fed without providing food or clothes.

81
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:52,820
 What good is it?"

82
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,700
 And so the implication here is that it is of no good.

83
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,420
 It is not enough.

84
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,900
 Before the blessing was pronounced, the person was in need of clothing and food, and after

85
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,040
 the blessing, that person is still in need of clothing and food.

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,240
 The need is unfulfilled.

87
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,140
 This is, to James, something that is significantly wrong.

88
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:19,560
 Something is incredibly wrong with the faith of someone who only says, "Go in peace, keep

89
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,480
 warm and well fed," and does not provide clothes or food.

90
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:27,120
 You can see for yourself just how wrong James considers it.

91
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:32,800
 If you look at verse 14 with me, in the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied

92
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,600
 by action, is dead.

93
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,160
 James calls this faith dead, useless and dead.

94
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:48,000
 No, it is of no good if someone claims to have faith but has no deeds.

95
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,340
 Their faith is dead.

96
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,680
 We see here in verses 14 to 17 a warning.

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,920
 Do not confuse faith professed with faith practiced.

98
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:04,200
 In other words, don't mistake just saying, "I have faith," with faith that results in

99
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
 action.

100
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,680
 By itself, faith professed does not save.

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:14,800
 For the person who says, "I have faith," will also be moved by their faith.

102
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,800
 They will not just be hearers of the Word of God, they will be doers of the Word of

103
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
 God.

104
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,480
 And this is something James understands.

105
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:26,080
 Something that you and I need to understand.

106
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,120
 It is a living faith that saves.

107
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,720
 Okay, let me repeat that for you.

108
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,200
 It is a living faith that saves.

109
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,820
 Let's not miss this frightening statement from verse 14.

110
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
 You see this one?

111
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,720
 The one pretending to be a question?

112
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,520
 What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone claims to have faith but has no

113
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,580
 deeds?

114
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,600
 Can such a faith save them?

115
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,440
 A faith that makes claims but is without deeds, can that faith save?

116
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,440
 Again, it's implied, right?

117
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,440
 It's implied.

118
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,180
 No, that faith cannot save.

119
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,480
 Faith without action is dead.

120
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,040
 And a dead faith cannot and will not save you.

121
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,160
 This I'll repeat for you as well.

122
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,840
 Faith without action is dead.

123
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,440
 And a dead faith cannot and will not save you.

124
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:25,240
 17 to 19.

125
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:31,100
 We see here that James quickly moves into an exchange between himself and a person who

126
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:33,200
 is disagreeing with him.

127
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:38,760
 The disagreeing man tells him, "You have your deeds, I have my faith."

128
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,360
 And what is being said here is, "Will your deeds save you or will my faith save me?"

129
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,680
 He's challenging him.

130
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,120
 And this is a very real situation, right?

131
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,520
 Because you, you having come to faith, having received your salvation, you didn't receive

132
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:57,620
 it because you earned it, right?

133
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,600
 This is an absolutely true thing.

134
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,360
 And James does not dispute this fact.

135
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,040
 You having come to Christ did not receive your salvation because you earned it.

136
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:12,380
 He does not dispute that salvation is in fact a supernatural work of God.

137
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,840
 But James does dispute something.

138
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,080
 Look at his response with me, okay?

139
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:23,820
 "Show me your faith without deeds and I will show you my faith by my deeds.

140
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,500
 You believe that there is one God, good.

141
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:28,960
 Even the demons believe that and shudder."

142
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:40,000
 Firstly, faith is not just knowledge of what is and is not true.

143
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,960
 It goes further than that.

144
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:45,640
 Just knowing something isn't enough to save you.

145
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,480
 Believing that there is one God does not save you.

146
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:56,040
 In fact, look, James makes it clear that demons know even more than you do that the God of

147
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:00,760
 the Bible is the God of heaven and earth and this knowledge does not save them.

148
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,880
 In fact, it makes them shudder.

149
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,600
 They tremble in fear because their knowledge does not change their behavior.

150
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,480
 All right.

151
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,680
 Secondly, looking at this, there's an error in this argument that's being made against

152
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:15,680
 James.

153
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,720
 The error made against James is separating faith and works.

154
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:26,520
 The error is thinking that saving faith can be divorced from merciful works.

155
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:31,420
 Action and works aren't something additional to living faith.

156
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,540
 Let me ask you a quick question, okay?

157
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:36,360
 You guys will ace this.

158
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,200
 How many of you right now are breathing?

159
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,360
 Right?

160
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,360
 All of you.

161
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,880
 Everyone here is breathing.

162
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,920
 And so is your breathing an addition to your living?

163
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:51,640
 Is breathing something extra that you are doing?

164
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,800
 No, right?

165
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,800
 No.

166
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,720
 Breathing is a function of living.

167
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,840
 If you want to continue to live, you need to continue to breathe.

168
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:06,140
 And so when we look at works the way that James looks at works, we see that works are

169
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:10,740
 as breath to those that follow Christ Jesus.

170
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,400
 The action following faith proves that it is a living faith.

171
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,560
 And this is not a new reality about faith.

172
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,360
 This is the way that God has ordained living faith since the very beginning.

173
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:33,960
 If you look with me to verses 20 to 24, you'll see that James begins to talk about someone

174
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:39,760
 named Abraham, the father Abraham, who is the patriarch of these Jewish Christians,

175
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,560
 all right, from the line of faith.

176
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:50,600
 And we find that Abraham is considered righteous for what he did because of his interaction,

177
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,040
 because of the interaction between his faith and his actions.

178
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,540
 Abraham's faith was alive.

179
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:04,000
 It led him to obey God, to offer his son Isaac on the mountain where God's goodness and grace

180
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,080
 provided a substitute in Isaac's place.

181
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:13,520
 And through this cooperation of his faith and his works, Abraham's faith was made complete.

182
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:18,840
 It was able to fulfill its purpose.

183
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,960
 Living faith is shown by its very nature.

184
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,480
 Living faith is demonstrated through action.

185
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,960
 When James writes in verse 24, look at verse 24 with me, he says like, he says something

186
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,360
 here, not by, oh, is 24 on the screen?

187
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
 No, it's not.

188
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:42,120
 Let me, yes, okay, there we go.

189
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,520
 He says something here.

190
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,800
 You see that a person is considered righteous by what they do and not by faith alone.

191
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:54,280
 This faith that he talks about, that he refers to, is a faith that is dead with no ability

192
00:12:54,280 --> 00:13:01,140
 to save because it's a living faith that saves, a living faith that takes action.

193
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:07,320
 Verse 25, just like Abraham, Rahab the prostitute was considered righteous because of her faith

194
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,640
 and her actions.

195
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,280
 These figures that find themselves in the honored line of David stand before God through

196
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,760
 a living faith.

197
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,240
 It wasn't a faith without action that saved them.

198
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,480
 It was a faith completed by action.

199
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:27,860
 And in the same way, faith without action cannot save you.

200
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:32,500
 You can't just say, I believe in Jesus' death and resurrection and then carry on with

201
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:36,860
 your life as if nothing has changed.

202
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,620
 Action apart from faith cannot save you.

203
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,820
 You know this to be true.

204
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,780
 You cannot earn your way to heaven.

205
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:49,300
 Your actions that come out of a personal standard of righteousness will always fall short of

206
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,500
 God's perfection.

207
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:58,300
 Only a faith accompanied by action, a living faith, can save.

208
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:02,700
 Having said all that, like this brings us to an incredibly important question that you

209
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,080
 must answer.

210
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:12,820
 Do you have a living faith, a faith that compels you to not just be hearers of the Word of

211
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,220
 God but also doers of the Word?

212
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:22,340
 Do you have this faith that can and will save you, a faith that lives?

213
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:28,600
 Consider this carefully because you are not meant to be dead.

214
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,860
 My brothers and sisters in Christ, you are meant to be alive.

215
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,660
 Your body is not without a spirit.

216
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,300
 You are meant to be the dwelling place of the spirit of the living God.

217
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:45,180
 While you and I were still enemies of Christ, He looked and He saw you.

218
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:50,580
 He saw you in your disregard and opposition to Him and still He reached out to you.

219
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:56,340
 While you and I were dead in our sin, the Word of God who was with God and was God,

220
00:14:56,340 --> 00:15:02,220
 Jesus Christ, embraced death so that He could pull you out of death and into life.

221
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:07,460
 On a wooden cross, Jesus placed Himself under the punishment you rightfully deserved and

222
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:11,100
 bought forgiveness for all your wrongdoing.

223
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:17,700
 Every sin you have and will ever commit, in glory, Jesus rose from the grave to give you

224
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:21,100
 life in abundance.

225
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,460
 Do you see?

226
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,640
 Do you see here?

227
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:28,700
 You aren't supposed to be like you were before.

228
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,940
 You can't be like you were before.

229
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:36,180
 Only the dead are comfortable in their coffins.

230
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:42,940
 You are meant to be living children of God with a living faith.

231
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,900
 And James tells you up front how this is supposed to look.

232
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:52,100
 The book of James, right, as we've been going through it, it gives instruction after instruction

233
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,500
 on the way that Christians are supposed to live, the way that Christians should relate

234
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,300
 to those that are around them.

235
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:04,140
 The verses right before today's passage spoke on how the Jewish Christians were to treat

236
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:08,340
 the poor and the needy that came into the midst of their gathering, how they were not

237
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:14,500
 to make distinctions based on outward appearance or to seek favor from those who are rich in

238
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,420
 the eyes of the world.

239
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:22,580
 So we see in James that works of mercy are the natural and fullest expression of living

240
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:23,980
 faith.

241
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:28,420
 Acts of love, of goodness, of charity, acts that provide.

242
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:34,400
 This is James's understanding of living faith.

243
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:42,920
 In this crowd, are you a husband, a wife, a father, a mother, a son, or a daughter?

244
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:49,900
 If that's you, then be merciful, compassionate to your mother, your father, your son, your

245
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,880
 daughter, your neighbors.

246
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,500
 Be compassionate and merciful.

247
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,180
 I understand that none of this is easy.

248
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:06,300
 It is not easy to be merciful or compassionate because we are not an easily lovable people.

249
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:13,220
 Because our unmet needs, they cause the cracks and the flaws in our character to widen, and

250
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:17,020
 then out of that comes sin.

251
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:25,060
 So as we close up our time here, continue to fix your eyes on Jesus and remember what

252
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:30,980
 he has done for you, how he loved you to make you lovable, and how he redeemed you from

253
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,260
 the pit.

254
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:39,780
 In that same way, look upon your neighbor, those that God has placed around you, and

255
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,340
 be both hearers and doers of the word of God.

256
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,860
 Live as a living children of God with a living faith.

257
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,020
 Be whole and complete.

258
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,020
 Let me close us in a word of prayer.
