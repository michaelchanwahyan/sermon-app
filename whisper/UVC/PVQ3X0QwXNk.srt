1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
 Thank you very much for coming,

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,400
 and we're gonna worship God together,

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,760
 and we're gonna turn to our series,

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,320
 which is the festivals,

5
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,200
 the important days in the Old Testament.

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,600
 So we talk about the Sukkot, Tabernacle.

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,700
 We talk about Shabbat.

8
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,520
 Then today, we talk about another important festival

9
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,080
 that talks about in the Bible.

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,520
 So let's see.

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:28,160
 Let me start with these questions, okay?

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,320
 Now, we often know there's a relation or association

13
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,780
 with some festival or holidays with some food, right?

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,560
 When you think of some holidays or some festivals,

15
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,040
 you always think of some sort of food, right?

16
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,660
 Food items related to the festival.

17
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,200
 Thanksgiving, what do you think of?

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,200
 - Turkey.

19
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,240
 - Yeah, turkey, right?

20
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,080
 - Hot pot.

21
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,760
 - Hot pot, yes, hot pot, yeah.

22
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:57,300
 So when Thanksgiving comes,

23
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,880
 and you're gonna prepare some food

24
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,000
 that is related to the festival,

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,640
 Christmas, what do you eat?

26
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,560
 - Hot pot.

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,960
 - Hot pot, yes, hot pot, yeah.

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,760
 How about the New Year's?

29
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,600
 How about the New Year's?

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,440
 - Hot pot.

31
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,040
 (congregation laughing)

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,320
 - How about the Chinese New Year?

33
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,160
 - Dumplings.

34
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,560
 - Dumplings, yes, dumplings.

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,360
 Okay, finally, something other than hot pot.

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,480
 How about Valentine's Day?

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,520
 I asked my wife, what do we eat on Valentine's Day?

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,400
 - Steak.

39
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,160
 - Steak, oh, okay.

40
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,640
 I thought you were gonna say hot pot.

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,060
 (laughing)

42
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,740
 All right, so the food items related to the festival

43
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:47,300
 or the holidays of the calendar,

44
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:50,840
 and we think about what the Bible says about Passover,

45
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:51,840
 what do you think of?

46
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,680
 Food item.

47
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,480
 What food items are related to Passover?

48
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,720
 Yeah, unleavened bread, yeah.

49
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,600
 And lamb, yes, the lamb, right?

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,160
 In fact, one of those big items

51
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,960
 that they will prepare for Passover,

52
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,260
 at least for the Old Testament time,

53
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,360
 the ancient Israelites,

54
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,360
 they will do prepare lamb, Passover lamb, right?

55
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,160
 So one family will take one lamb,

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,600
 and they will consume it,

57
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,760
 and they will offer the rest of it to God.

58
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,400
 And this is right at the first Passover,

59
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,520
 right at the eve when they leave Egypt,

60
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,240
 when God is going to judge the nation,

61
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,120
 judge the nation of Egypt,

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,960
 to destroy Pharaoh and his empire.

63
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:44,280
 So judgment of God will come.

64
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,520
 And then right before it comes,

65
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,640
 the 10th plague, plague number 10,

66
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:52,760
 which is judging the firstborn sons

67
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:56,600
 of Egypt, right before the divine judgment

68
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,320
 comes to the land of Egypt,

69
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:02,800
 God said, "You're gonna prepare a meal,

70
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:06,000
 "because you're gonna go, you're gonna go in a hurry.

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,180
 "You're gonna go in a hurry in the time of judgment,

72
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:11,960
 "and I'm gonna save you out of death and of judgment."

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:16,400
 So it says in Exodus chapter 12,

74
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,160
 "And now the whole community of Israel,

75
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,000
 "when they were still living in the land of bondage,

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,360
 "in the land of slavery in Egypt,

77
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,920
 "on the 10th day of this month,

78
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,680
 "each family, you would choose a lamb,

79
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,880
 "young goat, for a sacrifice,

80
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,560
 "one animal for each household."

81
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,320
 And this is the instruction.

82
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:39,320
 Be fully prepared, fully dressed,

83
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:44,320
 wear your sandals, carry your walking stick in your hand.

84
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,720
 Now, that's interesting,

85
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,220
 because the ancient Israelites,

86
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,640
 they go into someone's home,

87
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:54,040
 they will take off their shoes, just like us, right?

88
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,720
 Most of the Asians, we come to someone's house,

89
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,240
 or go back to your home,

90
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:03,360
 you take off your sandals, you take off your shoes.

91
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,880
 Here, when they eat inside the home,

92
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,820
 they need to put on their shoes, right?

93
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,840
 They need to get prepared,

94
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,900
 and dress themselves, fully dressed,

95
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,720
 so that they are ready to go.

96
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,280
 They are eating in a hurry, with urgency,

97
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,320
 because that night is gonna be the Passover of the Lord.

98
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,480
 Now, what does it mean?

99
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,480
 They would kill the lamb,

100
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,400
 and then they would take some blood,

101
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,400
 and smear on the doorpost, or the lintel of the door.

102
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,560
 And then, when the angel of judgment

103
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,380
 passes through the entire land of Egypt,

104
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:45,160
 it will see the doorpost,

105
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,440
 it will smear with blood, and it will pass over,

106
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,260
 it will skip that house.

107
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,700
 And that is the story of salvation.

108
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:58,400
 In times of judgment, the angel of the Lord,

109
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,360
 the judgment of God, come to the land,

110
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,680
 and they will be safe, the Israelites will be safe.

111
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,040
 So it talks about blood, talks about judgment,

112
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:13,240
 talks about protection, talks about redemption.

113
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,040
 God's gonna save his people

114
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,840
 out of the land of darkness, out of the land of slavery.

115
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,520
 So they get prepared.

116
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,400
 So this is the first Passover,

117
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,600
 and then year after year,

118
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,520
 they're gonna celebrate this festival,

119
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,260
 which is one of the most important festivals

120
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:31,000
 of all other holidays,

121
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,960
 because it marks the most important acts of God,

122
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,040
 that they are being saved from slavery, from bondage,

123
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,000
 and they are being redeemed.

124
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,680
 So year after year, Jews,

125
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,120
 wherever they live, in diaspora,

126
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,920
 in different parts of the world,

127
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,560
 they will go back to Jerusalem,

128
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,880
 go back to the temple, especially in Jesus' time.

129
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,360
 It was one of the highest holiday of the year,

130
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,440
 and right about the time of spring,

131
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,500
 March and April,

132
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:09,560
 and they will come to Jerusalem for a week to celebrate.

133
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,720
 And in that week, the population of Jerusalem

134
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,720
 will skyrocket two times or three times of their population.

135
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,780
 And they will come around the city,

136
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,120
 and then they will go into the city,

137
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,080
 and they will arrange a big meal,

138
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,840
 which is the Passover meal, sacrificial lamb.

139
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,320
 They're gonna remember what God had done

140
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,400
 in their history, in their life.

141
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,160
 Now, we talk about the Passover,

142
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,400
 thinking of food item being the sacrificial lamb.

143
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,760
 But the Jews, the Israelites,

144
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:45,700
 when they think about the Passover,

145
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,640
 they think about what God had done in their lives.

146
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,200
 It's not just the lamb.

147
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,240
 They think about the whole package,

148
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,320
 the whole package of God's redemption.

149
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,960
 So let's do some review.

150
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,440
 When you think of the book of Exodus,

151
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,440
 when the Israelites came out of Egypt,

152
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:06,320
 what are the events follow after Passover?

153
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,800
 What are the events?

154
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,620
 Think about it.

155
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,680
 Huh?

156
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,520
 - Crossing the Red Sea.

157
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,400
 - Yeah, crossing the Red Sea.

158
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,500
 Crossing the Red Sea, and then after what?

159
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,200
 What happened?

160
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:19,960
 Crossing the Red Sea, where did they go?

161
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,120
 Did they go to Chicago?

162
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,960
 - The wilderness.

163
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,480
 - The wilderness, yes.

164
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,320
 We have a Buddhist student here.

165
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,520
 We got all the answers.

166
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,560
 So after crossing the Red Sea, God split the Red Sea.

167
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,760
 There's a water miracle,

168
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,280
 and then they go into the wilderness for 40 years, right?

169
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,560
 And then they receive the Ten Commandments

170
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,080
 and all that stuff.

171
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,400
 And then in the wilderness,

172
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,720
 who is going to provide for them?

173
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,240
 What do they eat?

174
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,720
 There's nothing in the wilderness.

175
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,560
 What do they eat?

176
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,400
 - Manna.

177
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,840
 - They eat, yeah, they eat manna, right?

178
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,760
 Manna.

179
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,400
 So when they think about the Passover,

180
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,280
 they think about the story of Exodus,

181
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,040
 they don't just think about just one lamb and that's it.

182
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,800
 They think about a whole series of events,

183
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,160
 the entire process that God will bring about

184
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:08,400
 the salvation to his people from the start to the end.

185
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,960
 So from the start, Moses is gonna come, right?

186
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,360
 And lead the nation as a shepherd,

187
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:18,520
 and lead the entire people out of Egypt.

188
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,360
 Sacrificial lamb, we talk about it.

189
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,440
 And then for one week,

190
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,760
 they will celebrate with unleavened bread, right?

191
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,720
 Because you're in a hurry, right?

192
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,640
 You don't have time to wait for the yeast

193
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,200
 to take the effect, right?

194
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,960
 So they're gonna eat unleavened bread.

195
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
 And the,

196
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:43,880
 you know, if you have baked bread before, right?

197
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:47,040
 You know how many hours or how much time you have to wait

198
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,600
 for the yeast to take effect, right?

199
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,400
 The dough, you know?

200
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,640
 It's very time consuming.

201
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,080
 So when they are leaving Egypt in a hurry,

202
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,240
 God is saying to them,

203
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,840
 "You're gonna eat unleavened bread.

204
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,360
 "Don't wait, you gotta go.

205
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,080
 "You gotta go by my command."

206
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,920
 And then they go to the shore of Red Sea,

207
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:10,760
 and then God split the water, conquered the water,

208
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,160
 and they go through it on dry ground,

209
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,240
 going to the wilderness,

210
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,320
 and the people grumble,

211
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,640
 complain about,

212
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,720
 "Hey, is God gonna provide for us what we need?"

213
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,560
 Right?

214
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,560
 And then through Moses,

215
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,560
 God sent food from heaven, manna, right?

216
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,400
 What's manna?

217
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,240
 What is it?

218
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,920
 Now, according to the description in the Bible,

219
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,200
 in the book of Exodus,

220
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,760
 it's something like a round stuff, you know?

221
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,000
 It's like a biscuit or something, right?

222
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,960
 Well, the point is we don't know.

223
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,840
 We just don't know what it is, right?

224
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,440
 In fact, the biblical story talk about the manna.

225
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:57,240
 The Israelite did not know what it is.

226
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:00,240
 So when the first time, the very first time,

227
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,240
 very first day, God sent the manna to the field,

228
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:10,000
 they go collect the manna,

229
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 what did they say?

230
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 They say, "Ma set, ma set."

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,480
 Ma set is in Hebrew.

232
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,080
 It means what it is.

233
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,120
 Ma is what.

234
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,480
 Set is this.

235
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,840
 And what the heck is this?

236
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,240
 So that's why you got the name manna, right?

237
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,360
 Ma set, manna, manna, all right?

238
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,360
 So the most important point is we just don't know what it is.

239
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,440
 But when they grumble, when they complain about it,

240
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,720
 God gives them food, rain from heaven,

241
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,520
 raining down from heaven, manna from heaven.

242
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,480
 And then as the story goes from the Old Testament,

243
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,600
 you know, go back all the way to Exodus

244
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,320
 and all the way down to the kingdoms

245
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,160
 and all the way down to the time of Jesus.

246
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,280
 And then the Jews, the ancient Israelites,

247
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:59,240
 will think about and remember Passover

248
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,440
 and adding a lot of stories to it.

249
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,600
 And one of the interesting stories they add

250
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,040
 around the time of Jesus is that they,

251
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,920
 because according to the story of the Old Testament,

252
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,280
 when they went through the wilderness for 40 years,

253
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,360
 God gave them manna day after day, right?

254
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,640
 And then right after they crossed the River Jordan,

255
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,480
 they entered into the promised land.

256
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:26,560
 In the book of Joshua, it says, there's no more manna.

257
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,180
 It stopped raining from heaven, no more manna,

258
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,980
 because they're gonna eat the produce

259
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,720
 from the land of Canaan.

260
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,680
 So some of the Jews around the time of Jesus,

261
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,680
 they would say, you know, because the manna stopped,

262
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:49,080
 because there was a bank, there was a treasury in heaven,

263
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,160
 raining down manna to all of them.

264
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,700
 And when they entered the land of Canaan,

265
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:01,200
 the bank is closed, the treasury, the storage is closed.

266
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,120
 And who closed it?

267
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,480
 Who has the power to close it?

268
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,320
 Moses.

269
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,840
 Moses has the key.

270
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:13,840
 So he opened the treasury for 40 years,

271
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:19,000
 raining down manna to the people of Israel in the wilderness

272
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,160
 for 40 years.

273
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,660
 After they entered Canaan, Moses closed it.

274
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:25,620
 So they eat the produce of the land.

275
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,400
 So when the Jews thinking about the story,

276
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,040
 they have the legend, they have a legendary telling

277
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:37,040
 that someday in the future, when God's salvation

278
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:41,240
 is gonna be fulfilled ultimately,

279
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:44,920
 then Moses will come again and open that bank.

280
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,120
 It's like an ATM, open it again,

281
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,000
 and manna will come from heaven again.

282
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,920
 Now you think about the whole story,

283
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,840
 you can tie different things together,

284
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:03,600
 and you can think of some of the description

285
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,520
 that the gospel talks about Jesus.

286
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,040
 Talk about Passover, talk about what Jesus

287
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,880
 will ultimately do to fulfill the salvation.

288
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,720
 Now let's take a look.

289
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,080
 The gospel of John, John chapter six.

290
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:25,240
 Now remember what I said about what we thought about

291
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,640
 the entire Passover, the entire Exodus story,

292
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,040
 the entire package, the manna and all that stuff.

293
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,640
 Read the story, you will read it in new light.

294
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,680
 The gospel of John chapter six.

295
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,480
 It was nearly the time for the Jewish Passover celebration.

296
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:44,720
 And Jesus saw a big crowd of people

297
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,040
 coming to look for him.

298
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:51,680
 And then he said to Philip, one of his 12 disciples,

299
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,960
 "Where can we buy food for them?

300
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:58,480
 "How do we feed these people?"

301
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,200
 There's so many of them.

302
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,560
 So you know how the story goes,

303
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,280
 it's the five loaves and two fish.

304
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,920
 Five loaves and two fish.

305
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,920
 It's one of the most well-known Jesus miracles of all.

306
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,840
 Because all four gospel, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John,

307
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,520
 talk about this story, five loaves and two fish.

308
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,320
 We think about this little story,

309
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,640
 five loaves and two fish, it's a very nice story,

310
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,100
 it's a very nice children's story, kid's story.

311
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,920
 I'm sure they all heard of it in our Sunday school.

312
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:32,160
 And we think about the provision of God,

313
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,960
 God provides and Jesus provides.

314
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,800
 But here, there's something very interesting.

315
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:44,640
 Sixth four, John at the statement,

316
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:49,440
 Matthew, Mark and Luke did not record the story

317
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,560
 the same way.

318
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:55,000
 John, at one special statement,

319
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,680
 it was the time of Passover.

320
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,720
 It was the time of Passover that the five loaves

321
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,400
 and two fish story happened.

322
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,220
 Now in the gospel of John, all the great deeds,

323
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:08,660
 all the great acts of Jesus are signs.

324
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,920
 John called them signs.

325
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:13,920
 Now what is a sign?

326
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,120
 What is a sign?

327
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,160
 When you're driving on highway, for example,

328
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,040
 you drive on the highway and on the right side,

329
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,560
 you see a sign, Chicago, 21 miles.

330
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,320
 The sign is not Chicago.

331
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,920
 So you don't hit the sign.

332
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,920
 The sign is pointing you to the reality in the future.

333
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,520
 The sign is pointing you to something else

334
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,920
 because signs is always pointing beyond itself.

335
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:48,920
 So all the great acts of Jesus are actually signs

336
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,200
 and telling you there was some deeper meaning to it.

337
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:55,240
 There was some reality the sign is pointing to.

338
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,000
 You go to a restaurant, you pick up a menu,

339
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,640
 you see picture of fish.

340
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,960
 You don't eat the menu.

341
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:06,340
 You see the menu is the sign.

342
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,640
 The menu is the sign for the reality.

343
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,240
 You eat the fish that is cooked by the restaurant.

344
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,960
 The reality comes to your table and then you partake it.

345
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,600
 You take it, you take it in.

346
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,880
 Menu is set aside.

347
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,040
 Now this is what John is doing.

348
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,120
 John is recording this story in a special way

349
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,520
 to tell you what it means.

350
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:32,960
 So if you look at the entire chapter six of the gospel of

351
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,200
 John, it's a very long chapter.

352
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,080
 We're not going to study it verse by verse.

353
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,880
 But I'll give you the outline here.

354
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,760
 This is John six.

355
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,880
 There are a few things that you need to understand.

356
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,960
 There were a couple of stories.

357
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:51,200
 And then there were a bunch of things that recorded

358
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,680
 about the dialogues or the debate between the Jews

359
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,520
 and Jesus and then finally his disciples.

360
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,400
 Now what kind of stories are being recorded here?

361
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,960
 Of course the five loaves and two fish, right?

362
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,920
 Jesus feeds 5,000 people.

363
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,520
 Nice story.

364
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:11,840
 But following this story,

365
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:16,680
 John recorded that Jesus calms the sea of Galilee.

366
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,480
 There was a storm story.

367
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,080
 Now why put it in such a way, you know, back,

368
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,680
 front and back, you know, together?

369
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,040
 Remember Exodus.

370
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:30,280
 Remember the Passover, the whole package.

371
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:33,560
 What kind of miracles are being recorded?

372
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,160
 The Red Sea miracle.

373
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,200
 God controlled the sea.

374
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:42,040
 God conquered the sea so that his people are safe.

375
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:42,880
 What a miracle.

376
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,920
 And then feeding the 5,000,

377
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:47,640
 feeding the people in wilderness.

378
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,960
 The Exodus story is all about, you know,

379
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,080
 raining down manna.

380
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,160
 God is going to provide for them in the wilderness.

381
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,320
 Even they complain about it, even they grumble about it.

382
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,080
 For 40 years, God is going to give them breath from heaven.

383
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,160
 So John's putting different things together.

384
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,680
 It's like a TV show producer, you know,

385
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,280
 orchestrate everything, different stories,

386
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,080
 pack it together so that you know who Jesus really is

387
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,240
 and what Jesus has done for you.

388
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,200
 The food miracle.

389
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,080
 And then the water miracle.

390
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,080
 So Jesus is doing something that the Jews,

391
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,960
 when they heard about this story,

392
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,440
 they understand what it means.

393
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:38,080
 There are different things here, feeding 5,000,

394
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,040
 the water miracle, people grumbling.

395
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:46,000
 Now, you can see part three, four, and five

396
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,800
 are all about talking.

397
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,680
 There's so much talking.

398
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,120
 You know, first time I confess, I read John 6.

399
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,800
 I just don't know what the heck are you talking about?

400
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,040
 They ask Jesus some questions,

401
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,760
 they debate about the meaning,

402
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,360
 and then Jesus taught them different things.

403
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,600
 You know, but the entire John 6

404
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,600
 is all about in the wilderness

405
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,280
 when people are grumbling, complaining.

406
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:17,760
 In fact, some of the Jews heard about what Jesus said,

407
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,040
 they left.

408
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,840
 Originally, they were disciples.

409
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,280
 They follow Jesus, but when they heard about

410
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,320
 some of the teachings of Jesus in chapter six of John,

411
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,840
 they didn't understand and they were confused.

412
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:31,800
 That's why at the end of the story, they left.

413
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:34,000
 They complained and then they left.

414
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,160
 Then toward the end, Jesus round up the whole thing

415
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,080
 and asked the 12 disciples, "Are you gonna leave too?"

416
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,200
 Remember one of the disciples, Simon Peter?

417
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,960
 He said, "You have the eternal word of God.

418
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,960
 "Who shall we follow?

419
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,240
 "Who else shall we follow?

420
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,520
 "We're gonna follow you."

421
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,040
 Now, let's take a look at some of the verses

422
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,960
 and see what the story means about Jesus.

423
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
 627.

424
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,800
 Now, when they're talking about the food,

425
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:14,680
 remember the first story, Jesus fed 5,000.

426
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,360
 Some of the people are following,

427
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,840
 big crowd are following him.

428
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,720
 Try to use your imagination.

429
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,720
 If you're one of those who experienced

430
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,480
 the feeding of 5,000,

431
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,440
 what would be your immediate response?

432
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:32,640
 If you go to a restaurant with your friend

433
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,400
 and your friend pay for your dinner,

434
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,000
 he said, "It's gonna be free.

435
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,200
 "I'm gonna pay for you."

436
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:43,240
 What would be your immediate response?

437
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,720
 Wow, okay, wow.

438
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,120
 The next day, what would be your immediate response?

439
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,960
 You're gonna call your friend,

440
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,040
 "Hey, let's go out for dinner again."

441
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,920
 Yeah, right?

442
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,520
 'Cause every meal, you're gonna pay for it, right?

443
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,680
 So this is how the people react.

444
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,720
 So they were looking for Jesus

445
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,240
 after the 5,000 feeding miracle.

446
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,080
 They were looking for Jesus,

447
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,320
 just disappear and on the other side of the sea.

448
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,640
 So they ride on the boat and then they come to Jesus

449
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:10,240
 and say, "Hey, can you give me more?

450
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,480
 "Can you give me more?

451
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,120
 "'Cause you just gave me one day of the daily bread.

452
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,880
 "Okay, that's good, all right?

453
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,280
 "How about tomorrow's dinner?

454
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,360
 "Or the dinner's after tomorrow, right?"

455
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,440
 So Jesus was telling them,

456
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,560
 "Do not be so concerned

457
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,120
 "about perishable things like food.

458
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,320
 "Spend your energy seeking the eternal life

459
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,120
 "the Son of Man can give you."

460
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:37,080
 Perishable food.

461
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:42,800
 Don't be so concerned about things that perish.

462
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,880
 Now think about the Exodus story.

463
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,840
 When man came, the first week,

464
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,400
 some of the ancient Israelites, as the story goes,

465
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,480
 they collect more than they need.

466
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:57,400
 And they put it back into their tent in their home.

467
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,240
 And then the next day, it mowed.

468
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:01,120
 It mowed.

469
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:04,480
 They didn't trust God.

470
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,560
 They didn't trust God enough for daily bread.

471
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:09,320
 So they collect maybe two days, three days, right?

472
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:12,400
 Just like going out with your generous friend,

473
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
 you're gonna order more.

474
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,560
 And then as we talk, you're gonna put it in your to-go box.

475
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,840
 But it mowed and it rot.

476
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,920
 Perishable things.

477
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,480
 Jesus said, "Don't be so concerned."

478
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,840
 Yes, you need to plan, you need to be responsible,

479
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:29,880
 you need to work.

480
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,760
 However, don't be so concerned about perishable things.

481
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,000
 Aren't we all do that?

482
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,200
 Aren't we all like that?

483
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:45,040
 We're too concerned about things that will perish, right?

484
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,480
 You're gonna store up your money, store up your food,

485
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,720
 because we worry, right?

486
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:55,880
 Many of us, Chinese heritage,

487
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:00,720
 food is so important to us, right?

488
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,360
 Food is too important for us.

489
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,720
 Jesus says something is more important.

490
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,240
 Seek the life, seek the food

491
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,680
 that the Son of Man can give to us.

492
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:17,840
 34, the crowd said to Jesus,

493
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,960
 "Sir, give us that bread."

494
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,640
 How about every day, all right?

495
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,520
 Pay for our dinner every day, all right?

496
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,120
 So we don't have to work for it.

497
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:30,080
 Thinking about Moses, opening the treasury.

498
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,360
 Hey, can you be that Moses?

499
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,800
 Can you just be that Moses,

500
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:38,560
 and every day we're gonna have bread on the field,

501
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,080
 we don't have to work for it.

502
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,040
 And Jesus said, "Don't be so concerned about it,

503
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:46,040
 "because I'm gonna give you food that will last,

504
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,960
 "that will not perish."

505
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,840
 35, Jesus replied, "I am the bread of life.

506
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,880
 "Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again.

507
00:23:55,880 --> 00:24:00,160
 "Whoever believes me will never be thirsty."

508
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,120
 Jesus is saying, "I'm not just giving you food."

509
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,720
 He said, "I am the food."

510
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,080
 That's kind of astonishing, right?

511
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
 When you have dinner with your friend,

512
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,280
 your generous friend,

513
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:20,120
 your generous friend, all of a sudden, if he say to you,

514
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,520
 "I am not the dish in front of you, I am the dish."

515
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,200
 You say, "This guy's nuts."

516
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,560
 Give you a plate of fish, I give you fish,

517
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,560
 however, I am the fish, man.

518
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,480
 What are you gonna say?

519
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,480
 You say, "Jesus, what are you talking about?"

520
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,240
 In fact, that's what the people react.

521
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,960
 They say, "That's crazy."

522
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,200
 Now, of course, the language is metaphor, right?

523
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,000
 When Jesus said, "I am the bread of life,

524
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,200
 "you believe in me, you will be safe,

525
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,440
 "you have eternal life."

526
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:06,520
 It's metaphor, because we eat bread and we drink water.

527
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,600
 We don't believe in bread, we don't believe in water.

528
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,800
 It's metaphorical.

529
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,640
 The bread is Jesus himself, right?

530
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,040
 As the story goes, 51, he said, "I am the bread of life."

531
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,880
 Jesus said, "I am the bread of life

532
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:28,120
 "who came down from heaven, from the treasury of heaven.

533
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:30,600
 "I'm not just the one, I'm not like Moses

534
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:35,000
 "with the key open the depository in heaven,

535
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,800
 "treasure in heaven to rain down food for you.

536
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,560
 "I am the food, I'm the living bread,

537
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,000
 "came down from heaven, anyone who eats this bread

538
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,640
 "will live forever."

539
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,840
 Now, what is this bread?

540
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,960
 My flesh.

541
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:53,440
 We cannot take a bite of your arm or something.

542
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,840
 It's a metaphor.

543
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,520
 Now, people in the ancient days,

544
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:03,640
 especially in the agricultural world,

545
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,040
 where you have to farm and you have to harvest,

546
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,360
 you get your food.

547
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,000
 People understand almost everything they eat

548
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:16,000
 is something that has died, right?

549
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,160
 You think about it, even today,

550
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:23,160
 when you go to a fast food restaurant,

551
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,600
 you get a hamburger,

552
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:30,920
 you eat something that has died, right?

553
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:35,400
 What has died in order to serve you the hamburger?

554
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:40,960
 Wheat and barley made into flour,

555
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,440
 and flour baked into bread, right?

556
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,840
 The lettuce, tomato, pickles, the plants,

557
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,200
 somehow they die being harvested.

558
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:58,360
 Serve within the hamburger, the patty.

559
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,800
 The animal die so that you can protect the flesh,

560
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,160
 and you get the hamburger, right?

561
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,640
 Unless you're eating a hamburger totally engineered,

562
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:18,520
 you know, genetically, you know, like a McDonald, right?

563
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,920
 Even the flies gonna eat it.

564
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:25,160
 Everything that we eat entails some death.

565
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:30,480
 Something has died in order to serve us food

566
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,480
 to keep us going, and people understood it.

567
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:39,720
 If we continue to live, other living things need to die.

568
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,400
 If those things don't die, what will happen?

569
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,400
 You die.

570
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,280
 You gotta have something else die for you

571
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,680
 so that you can live, right?

572
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,840
 Jesus is using this metaphor.

573
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:54,680
 He said, "I am the Passover lamb.

574
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,440
 "I am the manna.

575
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,240
 "I am the water.

576
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,920
 "I die so that you can live."

577
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:09,600
 Our daily bread needs, you know, daily things to die.

578
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:15,920
 Eternal bread give us eternal life.

579
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,400
 It's not just daily life, eternal life.

580
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,320
 Jesus is the Passover.

581
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,360
 He died so that we can have life,

582
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:30,080
 and that's why almost all the songs that we sing in worship

583
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,680
 have to do with the death of Jesus,

584
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,520
 His sacrifice, His sacrificial act, the Passover.

585
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,000
 He sacrificed Himself so that we can live.

586
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,760
 He died on the cross, and He shed His blood

587
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,840
 so that we can live, we can have eternal life.

588
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,000
 Well, we're going to observe the communion today.

589
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,240
 I want you to understand all the things

590
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,760
 that we talk about about the Passover

591
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:06,880
 are signs pointing to the reality.

592
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:11,480
 The Son of God died on the cross because He loves you.

593
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:16,400
 He loves me so that we can be redeemed.

594
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,800
 We can live forever.

595
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:23,640
 As we take the cup and the bread, the communion,

596
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,080
 there are also signs pointing to the reality.

597
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,120
 If we partake it, if we take the bread,

598
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,080
 that means we're receiving Jesus, we believe in Jesus.

599
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,440
 We're going to have eternal life.

600
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:44,440
 That's going to change the whole world for you.

601
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:48,680
 Whatever we work for, wherever we are,

602
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:53,360
 we're going to change because our identity change.

603
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,280
 We are the sons and daughters of God.

604
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:58,960
 We belong to the kingdom.

605
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,520
 We belong to that big story,

606
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,000
 you know, from creation to redemption

607
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,280
 to all the way to new heaven and new earth.

608
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,000
 We are just a little story.

609
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,840
 Be part of that big story.

610
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:14,360
 Partake Jesus, and we're going to enjoy

611
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,680
 the eternal relationship with our Father.

612
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,520
 Let us all pray together and prepare ourselves

613
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,200
 as we take the communion.

614
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,720
 All right.

615
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:29,720
 Father, we thank you for the death of your Son,

616
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,480
 for His sacrifice, for what He has done on the cross.

617
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,360
 Yes, because of His sacrifice,

618
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,000
 because of the Passover lamb,

619
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,720
 that we have the eternal life.

620
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:48,120
 And let us hear your word again.

621
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:51,560
 I am the bread of life.

622
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,120
 We will not go hungry eternally because we partake in you,

623
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,760
 because we believe in you.

624
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,400
 And thank you for your sacrifice.

625
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,880
 Thank you for your grace that we can become your children.

626
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:11,120
 As we take the bread and take the cup,

627
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,880
 remind us our relationship with you.

628
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,800
 Remind us your so great of a salvation,

629
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,600
 the eternal life that we have.

630
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:24,640
 And help us orient ourselves toward you

631
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,640
 so that we are not too concerned about our daily bread,

632
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:33,240
 but we are more concerned about your kingdom,

633
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,000
 our relationship with you.

634
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,160
 In Christ's name, pray.

635
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:40,680
 All right, if you're ready, you can go back, I guess, right?
