00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 Today, we're going to go through our preaching series,

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,200
 our sermon series, and if you have your Bible,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,480
 please turn to the last book of the Bible,

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,200
 the book of Revelation, all right?

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,100
 Book of Revelation.

6
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:14,800
 We are in this series called,

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,320
 "What Christ Thinks of the Church."

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,320
 What does Jesus think of our church?

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,720
 You know, just imagine, if Jesus is gonna write us an email,

10
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,600
 if he's going to text us,

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,680
 if he's gonna write a letter to us,

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,040
 and to each and every one of us,

13
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,920
 what will the letter be saying?

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,520
 You know, imagine, you know,

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,640
 if Jesus write a letter to all of us, to our church,

16
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,640
 what does he think of our church?

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,640
 So that is the whole idea of this sermon series

18
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,000
 on the seven letters to the seven churches

19
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,240
 in the first century,

20
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:56,240
 and we caught it in the book of Revelation.

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,720
 And as I said before, this seven letters

22
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:00,600
 were sent to seven churches

23
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,160
 located in today's Western Turkey, right?

24
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,440
 Did I mention to you I wanna organize a New Testament tour

25
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,040
 to Turkey and Greece?

26
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,040
 Did I, did I say that?

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,080
 Yeah, I did, right?

28
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,320
 I did.

29
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,400
 Last week, I did, yeah.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,280
 And, you know, because of the war there,

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,100
 because of the instability there,

32
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:20,320
 we could not go this year.

33
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,800
 But I usually go to the Middle East once a year

34
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,360
 to lead some church group and to visit different sites.

35
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,720
 Hopefully, next year, we're gonna have a New Testament tour

36
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,440
 for the first step of Paul,

37
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,900
 and we're gonna visit Turkey and Greece.

38
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:39,440
 And anyways, this seven churches

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,780
 in the book of Revelation, the first few chapters,

40
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,160
 we caught a seven letters written by Jesus,

41
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:48,680
 the head of the church, to all the churches,

42
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,120
 to seven churches.

43
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,180
 And we went through the letter to,

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,420
 Ephesus, and then Smyrna.

45
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,780
 And today, we are at the third city.

46
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:02,620
 You follow that line,

47
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:07,620
 possibly a postal delivery route of the day.

48
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:11,260
 And the seven churches are written to these seven cities

49
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,220
 where there were whole churches in there.

50
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,640
 And today, we are in the third city, Pergamon, Pergamon.

51
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,700
 Now, back in the first century,

52
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,000
 Pergamon was a thriving city.

53
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,500
 And listen to this.

54
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,180
 According to different estimation,

55
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:32,180
 Pergamon had a population of 150,000 people.

56
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,460
 And that considered a big city in the first century.

57
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,860
 It's a huge city, huge population.

58
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,140
 150,000, it's a thriving city.

59
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,120
 And today, when we go there,

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,460
 you see a Roman theater on the left,

61
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:53,460
 and the Roman theater can seat more than 10,000 audience.

62
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,160
 And then on the right, you can see the aerial picture.

63
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,400
 And then down there, you see the modern city of Pergamon.

64
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,400
 And this letter, Jesus is writing to the church in Pergamon.

65
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,960
 Let's take a look.

66
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,440
 212, 212 of Revelation.

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,720
 "To the angel of the church in Pergamon write,

68
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,720
 "these are the words of him who has a sharp double-edged sword."

69
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,220
 Now, as I said, in all three, all seven letters,

70
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:26,840
 Jesus introduced himself in a special way

71
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,300
 that is relevant to the city, to the Christians,

72
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,940
 to the church in that particular city.

73
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,540
 And writing to the church,

74
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,940
 writing to the Christians in Pergamon,

75
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,800
 Jesus introduced himself as having

76
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,780
 the sharp double-edged sword.

77
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,340
 Now, this kind of sword,

78
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:47,580
 archeologists have dug up so many of them in Roman sites

79
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,540
 in the Mediterranean world in the first century.

80
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,500
 It is a well-known weapon of the Roman Empire.

81
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,500
 It is symbol of political might, military might.

82
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,580
 And politics in today and back in the first century

83
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:08,980
 was a highly debated topic, right?

84
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:13,980
 Because politic is the greatest power on earth, right?

85
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:20,660
 The country, whoever is the boss in the Roman Empire.

86
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,140
 And it was a highly debated topic,

87
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:25,940
 and everyone is so concerned about it.

88
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,660
 Just like today, we are very concerned

89
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,740
 about the upcoming presidential election.

90
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,980
 It's a very important subject,

91
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,660
 and politics is usually a very relevant subject

92
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:36,500
 in the first century.

93
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:41,260
 And the Roman emperor and governors of the province,

94
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,020
 including the governor of the city of Pergamon,

95
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:49,780
 often carry this kind of double-edged sword, you know?

96
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,060
 This kind of double-edged sword.

97
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:55,300
 It's about probably more than 18 inch long.

98
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,260
 It's a double-edged sword to symbolize their power.

99
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,980
 They have the power to execute the Roman authorities.

100
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:05,420
 They have power to punish criminals

101
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,540
 and anyone against the order of the empire.

102
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,100
 You remember in the Gospel of John

103
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,860
 when Jesus was standing on trial before Pilate,

104
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:18,540
 the Roman governor in Palestine, in Israel.

105
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:21,980
 And you remember in the Gospel of John

106
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:26,380
 recorded the conversation between Jesus and Pilate.

107
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,220
 This is what they talk about.

108
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,380
 John 19, 10.

109
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:34,140
 Now, Pilate, the governor,

110
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,460
 representing the power of the Roman empire,

111
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,980
 he said to Jesus, "Don't you realize I have power

112
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:43,740
 "either to free you or to crucify you?"

113
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,740
 And then Jesus said, and that's amazing what he said.

114
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:51,960
 He said to Pilate, "You will have no power over me

115
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,100
 "if it were not given to you from above."

116
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:56,940
 Right?

117
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,180
 It's a subversive challenge to the Roman authority.

118
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:06,860
 You have power to crucify me and to penalize me

119
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,980
 because there is a power above you.

120
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:09,980
 There's a bigger power.

121
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:14,020
 There's a greatest power above you who is God himself.

122
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,580
 So Jesus is essentially saying, "Sorry, Pilate.

123
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,260
 "I know you're gonna have the power

124
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:22,420
 "to crucify me or to free me,

125
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:26,820
 "but I and my God have the power above you."

126
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,660
 Right?

127
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,500
 And essentially, that's what Jesus is saying

128
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,300
 in this letter to Pogomon.

129
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:37,300
 Jesus said, "I am the only one who has the double-edged sword.

130
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,660
 "I have the political power, the power above."

131
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:46,200
 In chapter one, we see that Jesus holds the seven stars.

132
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,040
 Right?

133
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:49,540
 Just like the Roman emperor would hold seven stars

134
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,620
 in his hand.

135
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,540
 Right?

136
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:54,580
 In chapter one, we also see that Jesus,

137
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,580
 out of his mouth came a sharp, double-edged sword.

138
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,940
 And what does it mean?

139
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,860
 It means Jesus has a weapon,

140
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,940
 but this is not a physical weapon.

141
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,060
 This is not guns and tanks.

142
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,460
 It is the word of truth, the word of the gospel,

143
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,340
 and the gospel can conquer the Roman power.

144
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:23,020
 The gospel can conquer death and Satan and evil.

145
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:25,300
 That's essentially what Jesus is saying.

146
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,400
 Right?

147
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,380
 Because Jesus rose from the dead.

148
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:32,500
 He conquered death, the greatest power of all.

149
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:33,340
 Right?

150
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,220
 In fact, the New Testament reminds us

151
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,540
 death is the final enemy for each and every one of us.

152
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,740
 You will die.

153
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,340
 I will die.

154
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,380
 Death is the final enemy,

155
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,720
 but Jesus has conquered this final enemy.

156
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,740
 And Jesus is saying he has all the power.

157
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,620
 He has the power from above.

158
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,940
 So the Bible is proclaiming that,

159
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:01,280
 yeah, of course we need to concern about the earthly politics

160
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,220
 but we are not isolating ourselves, of course.

161
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,060
 Right?

162
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,420
 We need to concern about what is happening in the world,

163
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:12,420
 but we must be occupied most of all

164
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,060
 in our conversation, in our thoughts, in our actions,

165
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:20,060
 by the real power, the highest power, the real king.

166
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,220
 Jesus himself, right?

167
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,700
 He has the double-edged sword,

168
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:27,020
 not the Roman guys, right?

169
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,660
 Not the United States president.

170
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:33,340
 Jesus has the real double-edged sword.

171
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,980
 And we must be concerned about that power,

172
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,620
 concerned about the gospel,

173
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,500
 concerned about preaching the word of truth,

174
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,300
 concerned about witnessing the name of Jesus, right?

175
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:50,260
 That is what we must occupy ourselves most, right?

176
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,700
 Let me remind you as the election coming up, right?

177
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,060
 What is occupying our time?

178
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,660
 What is occupying our thoughts most of the time?

179
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,180
 It should be, the Bible says, Jesus himself, right?

180
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:09,100
 The church, his people, his authority, his kingdom.

181
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,220
 Just like the Lord's prayer, "Thy kingdom come."

182
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,620
 On earth as it is in heaven.

183
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:20,460
 We're gonna bring God's kingdom on earth, to the earth,

184
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:25,460
 to our circle of inference, to help people see Jesus.

185
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,380
 That should occupy most of our time, most of our energy.

186
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,340
 So Jesus introduced himself, he has the highest power.

187
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,980
 He has the sharp double-edged sword.

188
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:39,300
 And he continues to talk to the church in Pergamon.

189
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,780
 He said, "I know," remember this formula

190
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,900
 in every single letter?

191
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,860
 He said, "I know your situation.

192
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,140
 "I know everything about you."

193
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:50,220
 He said, "I know where you live, where Satan has his thorn.

194
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:53,460
 "Yet you remain true to my name.

195
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,700
 "You did not renounce your faith in me,

196
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:59,900
 "even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness,

197
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:04,180
 "who was put to death in your city, where Satan lives."

198
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,220
 How many times Satan is repeated here?

199
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,100
 Two times, right?

200
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,980
 Yeah, two times.

201
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,020
 So looking at Pergamon, this thriving city,

202
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:17,140
 of course, he says, "I know where you live," right?

203
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,900
 Your physical address, right?

204
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:23,740
 You can punch it in, in your Google Earth,

205
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:25,460
 Google Earth or Google Map, right?

206
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:28,020
 You can go there, where you live, of course, is Pergamon.

207
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,120
 It's the ancient city.

208
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,940
 That's the physical location, just like Chicago, right?

209
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,100
 I know where you live, Jesus says.

210
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,540
 But Jesus is talking about not your physical location,

211
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:39,380
 it's just spiritual location.

212
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:43,420
 Spiritually, Pergamon was the throne of Satan,

213
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,860
 the throne of the evil.

214
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,500
 Now we have archeology uncover some of the truth

215
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,800
 about the city for us.

216
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,820
 Pergamon, in the last hundred some years,

217
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:01,620
 the Germans were there to dig up some of the things

218
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,580
 from the city, Pergamon.

219
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,620
 And Pergamon, we know, had a large altar,

220
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,460
 or temple, built for Zeus.

221
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:14,540
 And this huge altar, you can see it now

222
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:18,800
 in Pergamon Museum in Berlin, Germany.

223
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,220
 And because when the Germans went to today's Turkey,

224
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,860
 they dig up some of the stones,

225
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,020
 some of the stones of the altar and the temple,

226
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,540
 and they move it piece by piece back to Berlin

227
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,920
 and put it in the museum.

228
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,220
 And this is a huge pagan altar.

229
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:41,060
 This huge pagan temple, hundred some feet long

230
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:46,060
 and hundred some feet wide and 40 feet plus deep.

231
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,900
 It's a huge altar.

232
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,940
 And what we found in Pergamon was this huge altar.

233
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:56,780
 And you can see it in Germany.

234
00:11:56,780 --> 00:12:01,780
 And the story goes, as the German move the entire altar

235
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:05,300
 stone by stone to Berlin, and they reassemble it together

236
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,420
 in their own museum.

237
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:13,420
 And then it was 1930s, and the Pergamon Museum in Berlin

238
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,060
 was open to the public.

239
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,840
 And a few years later, the German Nazi party,

240
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,060
 they had some rallies, some political gatherings,

241
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,980
 and they are trying to design and build

242
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,960
 some of the huge plazas for the political rally.

243
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:38,180
 And in one of those, the Nazi party commissioned

244
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:43,180
 an architect to design a special plaza, Sibel and Phil.

245
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,380
 And in that plaza, the architect, the chief architect,

246
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:52,660
 got the inspiration from Pergamon altar.

247
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,220
 From this altar, he built that low right,

248
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:00,120
 Sibel and Phil, in 1930s.

249
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:06,060
 And they turned to Pergamon altar for inspiration.

250
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,020
 And of course, as you know, in the following years,

251
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,680
 Hitler descended down the steps.

252
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,860
 Now this altar is what the Bible is talking about.

253
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:18,700
 This altar at Pergamon is believed to be

254
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,140
 the throne of Satan, the seat of Satan.

255
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:27,220
 And it's very interesting to think about this verse,

256
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,140
 verse two, 13 and 14.

257
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:35,180
 Jesus is saying to the church in Pergamon,

258
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:39,420
 "Don't just look at the surface.

259
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,840
 "You need to look behind your city.

260
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,480
 "And you look behind the city, you know the power of Satan

261
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:49,140
 "is working behind, is working there.

262
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,120
 "There's a spiritual darkness,

263
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,020
 "dark forces behind what you see."

264
00:13:56,020 --> 00:14:01,020
 You know, from your sight, you can see a gigantic building.

265
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:05,980
 You can see a big, huge altar and temple.

266
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,860
 But behind, Jesus said,

267
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:11,800
 is the evil, destructive force of Satan, right?

268
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,500
 And we need to develop that kind of spiritual insight,

269
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,780
 that spiritual perspective.

270
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,900
 When we see something from the outside,

271
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,920
 we have to look behind the scene.

272
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,060
 Just like what Jesus did here.

273
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,200
 Chicago is a beautiful city, isn't it?

274
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,120
 Right?

275
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,260
 It's a beautiful city.

276
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:36,300
 Especially weather is good, all right?

277
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,600
 It's very, very beautiful.

278
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,820
 It's just a magnificent building.

279
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:42,220
 Magnificent buildings and magnificent city.

280
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,340
 But you need to look behind.

281
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,700
 Chicago is known to be one of the toughest places

282
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,000
 for churches.

283
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,120
 Do you know that?

284
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,020
 You know, not too far away from us, in our network,

285
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:03,900
 one of the Baptist churches was trying to fight

286
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:08,500
 for zoning permit to build a church.

287
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,860
 They tried to fight legal battles,

288
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,800
 not to be kicked out from their rental place.

289
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:18,460
 You know, the government is not friendly

290
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,820
 or even hostile to the gospel.

291
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,760
 Yes, this is a beautiful city,

292
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,400
 but you look behind the scene,

293
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:28,480
 you know there's something else working, right?

294
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,240
 The power of Satan.

295
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,960
 And the city needs the gospel.

296
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,840
 The city needs you to go in there,

297
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,840
 to bear the name of Jesus, to witness to other people

298
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,660
 about the wonderful name of our Lord, right?

299
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:46,160
 Same thing for Pergamon.

300
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,600
 Now, this letter says there was one martyr

301
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,100
 called Antipas, right?

302
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
 Antipas.

303
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,640
 And he's being described as my faithful witness.

304
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,560
 Now, we don't know much about Antipas here.

305
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,520
 Perhaps he was a leader in the church in Pergamon,

306
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,360
 and he was a martyr not too long ago,

307
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,880
 before this letter was written.

308
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:16,460
 Now, at the time of revelation, it was the first century,

309
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,960
 the late first century, which is AD 90s.

310
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:24,080
 And we know from other sources that some Christians,

311
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,960
 and in fact, quite a few Christian leaders

312
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,200
 have been martyred in the first century.

313
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,740
 Can you name some of them?

314
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,280
 Stephen is one of them, right?

315
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,360
 The bold ax, chapter seven.

316
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,620
 He was stoned to death.

317
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:44,400
 James, who wrote the epistle of James.

318
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,920
 Peter, who was martyred in the 60s.

319
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:53,920
 Paul as well, he was martyred in Rome in the 60s.

320
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,560
 And now when revelation was written,

321
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,360
 it was late first century, AD 90s.

322
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,960
 Antipas was one of them.

323
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,640
 And that implies he was a faithful witness.

324
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,600
 That implies that he was interrogated by Roman authorities,

325
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,300
 and he was ordered to be executed

326
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,280
 when he refused to curse Christ, curse Jesus,

327
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,440
 and worship the Roman emperor.

328
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,780
 When Antipas gave his testimony in the court,

329
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,160
 and he was being asked to reject Jesus,

330
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,740
 and to renounce his faith, and to curse Christ publicly.

331
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:36,960
 Antipas, that's for sure, he refused to do that,

332
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,080
 because he only worshiped Jesus himself.

333
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:43,560
 Now, in the midst of intense persecution,

334
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:47,120
 the small church in Pokémon needs a lot of encouragement.

335
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,200
 And Jesus said, "I know you guys.

336
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,660
 "I know what is going on with you.

337
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,560
 "I know you're suffering for the faith."

338
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:57,440
 'Cause that I know, that two words in English,

339
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:02,440
 that I know offers encouragement and comfort

340
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,120
 to those who are suffering for the faith.

341
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,000
 Jesus said, "I'm gonna protect you.

342
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,040
 "I know your situation."

343
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:14,840
 Now, Jesus never promised us to follow him,

344
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,280
 there will be no suffering.

345
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,280
 But he promised us to save us through suffering, right?

346
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,400
 So he said, "I know your suffering.

347
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:25,440
 "I know what you're going through, right?

348
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,300
 "I'm not sure what you're going through right now, right?

349
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,600
 "Possibly in the past few weeks, or past few months,

350
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,240
 "you have been going through some suffering.

351
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,440
 "But remember this."

352
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,440
 Jesus said, "I know, I understand, I'm with you.

353
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,320
 "I know your suffering."

354
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,160
 He spoke to, he spoke the same word to

355
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,880
 the Christians in Pergamon, at the throne of Satan, right?

356
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,800
 They were under attack.

357
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:57,600
 And Jesus today is speaking to you the same thing.

358
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,980
 I know what you are going through.

359
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,500
 Let's continue, verse 14.

360
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:07,560
 "Nevertheless," Jesus said, "I have a few things

361
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,140
 "against you guys, the church in Pergamon.

362
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,960
 "You have people who hold to the teaching of Balaam,

363
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,820
 "who taught Balak to entice the Israelites to sin

364
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:22,120
 "by eating food, sacrifice to idols,

365
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,600
 "and by committing sexual immorality."

366
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,180
 Verse 15, "Likewise, you also have those

367
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:31,000
 "who hold to the teaching of Nicolaitans."

368
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,360
 Now, what is going on here?

369
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,320
 It's using some Old Testament example

370
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:41,360
 to describe what is going on in,

371
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,780
 among some of the Christians in Pergamon church.

372
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,840
 He said, "First of all, some of the Christians there

373
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,300
 "held to the teaching of Balaam."

374
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:55,640
 Balaam is an Old Testament guy,

375
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,560
 and he's a very famous guy.

376
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,840
 And Balaam, as you remember from the book of Numbers,

377
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:03,120
 when the Israelites was trying to pass through

378
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,480
 the land of Moab, and they come in closer

379
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,080
 to the promised land, land of Canaan.

380
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,720
 And as they pass through the land of,

381
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,200
 outskirt of the land of Moab,

382
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:20,200
 the king of Moab called Balak, right, Balak.

383
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,220
 And he hire a prophet, a false prophet named Balaam

384
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,120
 to curse Israel, to curse Israel,

385
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,920
 to not to blots them, but to curse them

386
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,400
 to bring calamities over the Israelites

387
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,800
 as they pass through the land of Moab.

388
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:40,360
 But God protected the Israelites, right?

389
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:44,840
 And he turned curses into blessings.

390
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:48,360
 Now, what is going on in the Christians,

391
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,560
 some of the Christians in Pergamon was that

392
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:55,560
 they hold to the cultic teaching of Balaam.

393
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,240
 Now, I think what it means is that

394
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
 some of the Christians there

395
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,240
 were preaching for financial gain.

396
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,720
 Now, Balaam was hired, remember?

397
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:13,060
 He was hired for money, and he tried to curse Israel.

398
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:17,520
 And that is the figure of Balaam in the Old Testament

399
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,320
 and in the Jewish tradition, in the biblical tradition.

400
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,240
 Balaam is a false prophet, and he does God's ministry,

401
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,760
 or speaking the word of God, for money, right?

402
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:31,160
 To gain money, for material gain.

403
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:37,160
 And I'm sure this phrase here, or this description here,

404
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,160
 to describing some of the Christians

405
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:43,280
 who was trying to distort the gospel

406
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,400
 for their personal gain, just like what Balaam did.

407
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,560
 And second thing he has against the church in Pergamon

408
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,680
 was that they were eating food sacrificed to idols

409
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,880
 and commit spiritual, sexual immorality.

410
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,860
 I think it's likely at that time

411
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:05,140
 that Christians joined some of the local pagan associations,

412
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,000
 local pagan religious temple associations

413
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,020
 for financial benefits, right?

414
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:12,560
 Because if you join them, right, join the club,

415
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,600
 then you will have a better business

416
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,820
 and better job opportunities for financial gain, right?

417
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:23,700
 But in joining some of the pagan anti-Christian associations,

418
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,640
 they had to renounce their faith,

419
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,320
 or they have to renounce their faith for a moment, right?

420
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,220
 And they come back to church and they praise Jesus

421
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,620
 and say Christ is the Lord.

422
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,940
 But Monday to Saturday,

423
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,840
 they're worshipping the false gods, right?

424
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,860
 I think that's what happening here.

425
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,720
 It is turning Christian faith into making money.

426
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,760
 Turning Christian faith for our own benefit, right?

427
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,100
 Sexual immorality, right?

428
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,580
 For our own sexual satisfaction, right?

429
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:00,960
 If you think about it,

430
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,380
 this letter was not just written

431
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,720
 to Christians in the ancient world.

432
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,660
 It's also written to us, right?

433
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:14,040
 Turning our faith into making profit for ourselves, right?

434
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,960
 To satisfy ourselves, right?

435
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,780
 Don't we see that a lot?

436
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,660
 We believe in Christ, but ultimately,

437
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:26,660
 you know, at the bottom of our heart, we want benefit.

438
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,100
 We want material gains, right?

439
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,560
 We have faith, yeah,

440
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,600
 but we want that faith to be twisted

441
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,840
 so that we have freedom to commit sins, right?

442
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,540
 And that is a crisis of faith, right?

443
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,680
 That's what American culture does to all of us, right?

444
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,360
 It's consumerism, right?

445
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,200
 We go to church just like we go to Walmart, right?

446
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,680
 We go to church just like we go to Whole Foods.

447
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:58,840
 We like to pick and choose,

448
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,820
 and then ultimately, it's for our own benefit.

449
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,940
 If we do that, if we have that kind of spirit,

450
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:08,240
 if we have that kind of mentality distorted,

451
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,260
 we're no longer following Jesus, right?

452
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:16,800
 We are simply, in the name of faith,

453
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:21,800
 we want to gain some financial benefit, right?

454
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,000
 Some satisfactions for ourselves.

455
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,700
 And that's what Jesus said,

456
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,840
 "I have a few things against you," right?

457
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:33,220
 Even some of you who hold to the teaching of Balaam

458
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:36,300
 for financial gain in the name of faith, right?

459
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,620
 "I have this against you."

460
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:43,100
 He continues to say, "Repent, therefore."

461
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,200
 Repent.

462
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,140
 You gotta turn around, you know?

463
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,560
 You see what faith is all about, what Jesus is all about.

464
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:54,060
 Otherwise, Jesus said, "I will soon come to you

465
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,740
 "and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.

466
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,020
 "He who has an ear, let him hear

467
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:02,040
 "what the Spirit says to the churches.

468
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,360
 "To him who overcomes,

469
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:06,260
 "I will give some of the hidden manna.

470
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:08,480
 "I will also give him a white stone

471
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,440
 "with a new name written on it,

472
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,820
 "known only to him who receives it."

473
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,400
 Now, this is a stern warning,

474
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,600
 stern warning of twisting the gospel

475
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,480
 into self-seeking religion.

476
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:26,540
 If you understand faith in this way,

477
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,420
 if faith is simply self-seeking,

478
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:30,940
 looking for your own benefit,

479
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:33,320
 that is not biblical faith.

480
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,580
 That is Balaam.

481
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,880
 That is anti-faith, right?

482
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,820
 That is not biblical faith.

483
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,580
 And the judgment of God is severe.

484
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:47,980
 Jesus said, "I am coming to you," right?

485
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,640
 So you have to repent right now.

486
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,740
 But there's also reward.

487
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:56,880
 If you repent, if you follow Jesus with your whole heart,

488
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,820
 right, there's also blessing.

489
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:03,020
 The hidden manna, what is that?

490
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:04,360
 Manna.

491
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,780
 We caused you the story

492
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,740
 of the Israelites going through the wilderness.

493
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,460
 In the wilderness, they had no food, right?

494
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:18,480
 They had no water, but God gave them manna, right?

495
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,580
 God gave them manna.

496
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:25,740
 It symbolizes God's faithful provision.

497
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:28,420
 God is gonna provide for you, right?

498
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,060
 If you repent, if you follow Jesus wholeheartedly,

499
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,380
 you know that God is going to provide for you, right?

500
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,440
 Now think about it.

501
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,080
 Don't you think at times

502
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,640
 we're not committing ourselves to Jesus

503
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,480
 because we just don't believe that God can provide?

504
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,300
 Sometimes in the bottom of our hearts,

505
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,700
 we just don't think God is so good, right?

506
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,980
 We just don't think God is so faithful, right?

507
00:26:56,980 --> 00:27:01,140
 That's why we have to gain something, right?

508
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:06,380
 Just like the Israelites in the wilderness did, right?

509
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,620
 They just don't think that God

510
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,720
 will provide double on Friday.

511
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,220
 So before Shabbat, some of those people,

512
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,800
 they get the double of the portion they need, right?

513
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:17,940
 Because in the bottom of their hearts,

514
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,540
 they just don't believe that God is so good,

515
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:22,200
 God is so faithful.

516
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:28,180
 Here Jesus affirms that God is the faithful provider,

517
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:31,580
 and you have to step out of your comfort zone.

518
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,680
 You have to take a step of faith

519
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,260
 and believe that God will provide.

520
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:40,180
 He has prepared for you manna,

521
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:43,220
 spiritual food to satisfy you, right?

522
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:45,620
 Which is better than other food.

523
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:49,860
 And he has also promised a name on white stone, right?

524
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:55,120
 We're talking about archeology because that's my area.

525
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,460
 If you go to the ancient site,

526
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:59,880
 you always find some big stone, a slab of stone,

527
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,780
 and with the name of Roman emperors

528
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:06,780
 and the famous people inscribed on them, right?

529
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,120
 Yeah, just like Hollywood, right?

530
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,960
 You walk on the street,

531
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,680
 you have this important names, right?

532
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,340
 To step on, you can step on them.

533
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,100
 And they're permanently inscribed on stone

534
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:21,640
 and indestructible.

535
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:26,980
 And what Jesus promised us is that a name on white stone,

536
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:30,560
 a permanent remembrance of your name,

537
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,340
 a permanent memorial of your name, right?

538
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,620
 And that's a big deal in the ancient Near East.

539
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,400
 That's a big deal in the ancient society.

540
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,100
 My name wants to continue, right?

541
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,340
 That's why I have my son, my grandson,

542
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:46,260
 because I want to perpetuate my name.

543
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,940
 And Jesus promised you, if you're faithful,

544
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:53,460
 your name will be inscribed on white stone.

545
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,100
 But here, you must remain faithful.

546
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,620
 And you must remember, God is good.

547
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:08,280
 God is faithful and we can depend on him, right?

548
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:13,620
 I want to spend some moment to pray.

549
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,420
 The thing about who God is,

550
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:23,700
 who God is to you, is he such a faithful God?

551
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,300
 Is he just a good God that you can depend on?

552
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:29,540
 You can trust him wholeheartedly.

553
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,580
 Let's repent, let us come before him,

554
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,220
 knowing that he is indeed faithful and loving.

555
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,380
 Let's all pray.

556
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:41,300
 (soft piano music)

557
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:57,000
 Our loving Father, thank you for your word.

558
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,380
 Thank you for your reminder,

559
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,900
 your evaluation and your commendation

560
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:07,620
 and even your teaching.

561
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,700
 To correct us.

562
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:13,380
 So we come before you,

563
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:18,700
 knowing that you are such a great God of grace.

564
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:23,220
 Thank you for your redemption.

565
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:28,220
 Thank you for your gracious provision.

566
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:35,460
 And the fact that your son, Jesus Christ,

567
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:38,660
 came to die for our sin

568
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,140
 and rose from the dead for all of us,

569
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:45,820
 to restore our relationship to you,

570
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:48,460
 this fact reminds us,

571
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,420
 you are such a good and faithful, gracious God.

572
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,380
 Forgive us for our little faith.

573
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,980
 Forgive us for sometimes in the name of you,

574
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,060
 in the name of faith,

575
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:04,460
 we are self-seeking.

576
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:07,940
 So we come before you as you admonish us

577
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:13,540
 to repent, to change our way, to change our attitude,

578
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,580
 to change our mentality, change our heart, please.

579
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,780
 May your spirit change us,

580
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:22,180
 help us repent and help us to come before you.

581
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,780
 Just know that, believe that,

582
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:29,340
 and trust that you are such a faithful and good God.

583
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,460
 Thank you for being our God.

584
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:37,540
 So I pray for all the brothers and sisters here,

585
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,620
 pray for myself,

586
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:44,260
 that you'll grant us this heart of purity.

587
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,700
 So wholeheartedly we will follow you,

588
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,900
 wholeheartedly we will obey you

589
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:55,620
 and help us to be renewed in your grace

590
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,620
 and our lives can be witnessed in this city,

591
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:02,500
 witnessed to how great you are,

592
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,740
 witnessed to the name of Jesus,

593
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:08,700
 to help people to be introduced into your presence,

594
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:10,180
 to help people to see the gospel,

595
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,740
 to help people to know the name of Jesus.

596
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:20,060
 So send us out and be with us

597
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,860
 for you know everything that we are going through

598
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,020
 and you are dependable

599
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,860
 and we can trust you wholeheartedly.

600
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,780
 Father, in Christ's name we pray.

601
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:35,260
 Well, thank you again for worshiping with us

602
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,420
 and I wanna send you out with that mission

603
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,820
 to bear witness for the name of Christ

604
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:43,180
 and may God's peace be with all of you

605
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,180
 and I wanna see you next week.

606
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:48,740
 You can stay around for some fellowship time,

607
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,060
 enjoy our refreshment

608
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,180
 and I'm sure there's some mooncakes out there, right?

609
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,740
 Yeah, it's out there, all right.

610
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,020
 Thank you, Pam.

611
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,300
 All right, God bless.
