1

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000

4

Happy New Year to all of you

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
It's the year of pig

We're gonna have wish you piggy

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
How's that OK

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
講英文混中文

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
今年豬年

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,000
希望各位都能夠像豬一樣發財

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
OK

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I wanna share a couple of images with you

16
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
我想和你分享兩張相片

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
第一張相片

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
有隻豬去找一個紋身的

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,000
那個紋身師就問他

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
想紋些什麼

21
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Piggy, what kind of tattoo do you want?

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
那隻豬就說

23
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I want to look rich

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
我想紋一些東西

25
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
令到人家看起來很有錢

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Alright

27
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
如果你是那個紋身師

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
你會紋些什麼

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
What would you do if you were the artist?

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
What tattoo would you put on the pig?

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,000
What tattoo would you put on the pig?

32
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
That would make the pig look rich

33
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Dollar sign OK

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
What else?

35
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
What else?

36
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Yeah, this is what he did

37
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
You wanna be a piggy bank, right?

38
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
You wanna be a piggy bank

39
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
That you look rich

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
在新年的時候

41
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
我們常常祝福大家

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
我們說恭喜發財

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
What does it mean?

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
恭喜發財

45
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
恭喜發財

46
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What is it?

47
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Wish you well, right?

48
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Or have a lot of money

49
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is all kinds of blessings that we say to our friends, our families, our neighbors

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
In Chinese New Year

51
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We want them, wish them well

52
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Right? A lot of material prosperity

53
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
A lot of blessings

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
More money, more

55
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Maybe bigger house

56
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Bigger car

57
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
多些錢

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
多些

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
層樓大些,多些食物

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I want to think about

61
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
How does God expects us to handle our blessings

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
We know that God is God of blessings

63
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Material blessings is part of His blessings

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,000
神是一個很豐富,很多祝福的神

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
聖經是這樣說的

66
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
其實上帝給我們的祝福和供應

67
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,000
是有物質上的供應

68
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:06,000
物質上的,吃的東西,住的東西,我們享受的東西

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
This is all part of God's blessings to all of us

70
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
However, how do we do with it?

71
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What do we do with it?

72
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
How do we handle them?

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:22,000
其實耶穌經常說錢、財富的教導

74
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
耶穌經常說錢

75
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
所以我們教會也會說錢

76
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Jesus talks a lot about money and wealth

77
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,000
That's why we in the church, we also talk about it

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Especially in year of pig

79
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
We all want to be piggy bank

80
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
So I want to share a very simple story

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Told by Jesus

82
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It has to do with our perspective on wealth and prosperity and blessings

83
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
這個故事我想今天和你分享

84
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,000
就是在路加福音第十二章

85
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
這裡耶穌講了一個很簡單的故事

86
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,000
就是和我們地上的祝福是有關係的

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
我先讀一讀

88
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Gospel of Luke chapter 12

89
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Starting from verse 13

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Someone in the crowd said to Jesus

91
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Teacher, tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me

92
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Jesus replied, man, who appointed me as a judge or an operator between you?

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then the man said to, Jesus said to the disciples, said to them

94
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Watch out, be on your guard against all kinds of greed

95
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,000
A man's life does not consist in abundance of his possessions

96
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
路加福音第十二章十三節

97
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
他說眾人之中有一個對耶穌說

98
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
他說夫子老師請你吩咐我的兄長和我分我的家產

99
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
分家產

100
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
耶穌說你這個人誰立我作你段氏的官

101
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,000
給你們分家產呢

102
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
於是對眾人說

103
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,000
你們要謹慎自守免去一切貪心

104
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
因為人的生命不在乎家道豐富

105
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And the story continues

106
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:25,000
And Jesus told them this parable, this simple story

107
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,000
The ground, the field, the farmland of a certain rich man

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,000
produced a good harvest, a good crop

109
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
He thought to himself, what shall I do?

110
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I have no place to store my crops or my harvest

111
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Then he said, this is what I'll do

112
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I will tear down my barns and build bigger ones

113
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
And there I will store all my grain and all my goods

114
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
And I will say to myself

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000
You have plenty of good things laid up for many years

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Take life easy, chill, eat, drink and be merry

117
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,000
But God said to him, you fool

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
This very night your life will be demanded from you

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Then who will get what you have prepared for yourself?

120
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,000
This is how it will be with anyone who stores up treasures thanks for himself

121
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,000
but is not rich toward God

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
耶穌就用比喻對他們講

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,000
他說有一個財主田產豐富

124
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
自己心裏面思想說

125
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
我的田產沒有地方收藏,怎麼辦?

126
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:40,000
又說我要這樣辦

127
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
要將我的倉房拆了

128
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,000
另蓋更大的,在那裏好收藏我一切的糧食和財物

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
然後要對我的靈魂講

130
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:55,000
靈魂啊,你有許多的財物積存

131
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
可作多年的費用

132
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
只管安安日日地吃喝快樂吧

133
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
神卻對他說

134
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
無知的人啊,今夜必要你的靈魂

135
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
你所預備的要歸誰呢?

136
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,000
凡為自己積財,在神面前卻不富足

137
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
也是這樣

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Very simple story, ok?

139
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,000
This story is called the parable of rich fool

140
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:25,000
叫做無知財主的比喻

141
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,000
這個故事很簡單

142
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
他有一個很有錢的人

143
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,000
他有很多錢,他越來越有錢

144
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,000
然後他就想,那我就可以安安日日

145
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
神就對他說

146
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Guess what? Your time is up

147
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
And you don't even know it

148
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Talking about rich man

149
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
你看看這個故事

150
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
你知道這個人沒有做錯任何事

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
你知道他田產豐富

152
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:03,000
This rich guy didn't do anything immoral

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,000
He got a good harvest

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
He got a good produce

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Quantity earning exceed expectation

156
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Exceed forecast

157
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
或者他可能去年做得很辛苦

158
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Working really hard

159
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
這些是他值得有的東西

160
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
越來越多錢

161
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
他有個good year

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,000
他有個很好的回報

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Most probably he work overtime I guess

164
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
And he deserve all this good things

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
All this blessing

166
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:45,000
And nothing immoral that he has done

167
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
沒有做過不道德的事

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
他值得得到這些

169
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
But what's wrong with the picture

170
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Now, a surface of plain meaning of the story

171
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Will have us believe

172
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That Jesus is against all rich people

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Jesus is against wealth

174
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
表面上看,你會覺得

175
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
耶穌或者聖經是很爭錢的

176
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
耶穌覺得人都要窮

177
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
有錢他就最憎

178
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,000
有錢他就要拿你的錢

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,000
But this is a very superficial understanding of the story

180
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,000
但不可以這樣去解

181
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
不可以說這個故事

182
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
就是說耶穌很憎我們有錢

183
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
我們有錢就是有罪

184
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
沒有這個意思

185
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
You have to remember

186
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
This story was told in a Jewish context

187
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
A Jewish culture

188
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
We all know in the Jewish society

189
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Financial management, financial gain, material blessing

190
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Is the backbone of Jewish culture

191
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
All the Jews, most of the Jews are rich I think

192
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Many of the Jews

193
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Although there are many poor Jews in the world

194
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
但我們知道這個故事

195
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
是說這個故事的時候

196
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
是對猶太人的文化,猶太人的社會說的

197
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
我們都知道很多猶太人都有錢

198
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
猶太人很會做生意

199
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
耶穌就是跟這個背景

200
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
跟這些人來說話

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
而我們知道猶太人的文化

202
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
管錢,賺錢

203
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:29,000
是他們文化的軸心

204
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,000
是他們文化的一部分

205
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Now we turn to the Old Testament

206
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The scripture of Jewish people

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,000
It talks about the book of prophets

208
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Especially it talks about working hard

209
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Diligence, saving, right

210
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Managing your money well

211
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
And managing your wealth wisely

212
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Instead of letting nature take its course

213
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
All kinds of things that has to do with wealth

214
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And material blessings

215
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
So Jewish people

216
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,000
If we understand the Old Testament

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The Torah

218
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,000
We need to save, we need to manage our money

219
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,000
We need to gain and save

220
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
如果你看看猶太人的典籍

221
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,000
特別是舊約,有一本書叫做《針研》

222
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,000
你就知道裡面教很多東西都跟錢有關

223
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:26,000
我們要去勤力做事

224
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
我們要努力去賺錢

225
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
然後我們要儲錢

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
我們要好好管理我們的錢財

227
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,000
任由它荒蕩地花

228
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:41,000
這些全部都是猶太人的文化

229
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
猶太人的教導

230
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:50,000
So we know that Jesus is not against having wealth

231
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Jesus is not against having money

232
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Jesus is not against having material blessings

233
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
所以你不要想耶穌說

234
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
耶穌是受苦的

235
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
或者神很不喜歡我們有錢有這些祝福

236
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Now go back to this parable

237
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
I find this something very interesting

238
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Let me tell you how to read the Bible

239
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,000
How to read the story of Jesus

240
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
There is something you need to pay attention

241
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,000
When you come to reading some of the stories or parables told by Jesus

242
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
你看看這個故事的時候

243
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
我想你留意一件事

244
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,000
我想告訴你怎樣去看這些故事

245
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,000
這些故事很有趣的地方就是

246
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:40,000
不是比喻說了什麼才有趣

247
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,000
而是比喻沒有說什麼才有趣

248
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
So this is how you read the story

249
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
What is most interesting is not what the parable is saying

250
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What is interesting is what the parable does not say

251
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:01,000
到底那個故事沒有說什麼

252
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:04,000
而它應該說的就不說

253
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
So let's think about that

254
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Let's think about it for a moment

255
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,000
What is not being said in the story is the most interesting part

256
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
這個比喻沒有說的才是最有趣最值得留意的

257
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
Now remember Jesus is speaking to a Jewish society, Jewish audience

258
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
And all Jewish men believe in God

259
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Believe in the Creator

260
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Believe in the God of Blessing

261
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Every Jewish man begins every morning, each morning with one prayer

262
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
And that prayer is called the Thanksgiving prayer

263
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
阿尼莫德

264
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I give thanks

265
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I give thanks to the God of Blessing

266
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Every Jewish man begins every single morning when he wakes up

267
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
He prays the same prayer

268
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I give thanks to the God of Blessing

269
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
你要知道這個故事

270
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
再提一次

271
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:07,000
就是和一個猶太人的背景聽眾說的

272
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:13,000
而我們知道每一個猶太的男人都是信創造主

273
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:18,000
救贖主和上帝是一個滿有祝福的上帝

274
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,000
其實每一個猶太人的男人

275
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:47,000
But if you look at this story

276
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Alright, if you look at this story

277
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
A Jewish story

278
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Talking about this rich guy

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Never a word is attributed to God

280
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Never a thought

281
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,000
think about God

282
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
So what's wrong with this guy

283
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This guy is suffering from some sort of

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
You know, I guess spiritual Alzheimer

285
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
He forgets about God

286
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Never talk about God

287
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Never thought about Him

288
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
With all the material blessings

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,000
But somewhere up there

290
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,000
There's a higher power who grant me all these things

291
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
這個就是最有趣的地方

292
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
就是那個故事

293
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,000
說到這個男人的時候

294
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
他想都沒有想過上帝

295
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
他提都沒有提過上帝

296
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
他有很多很多的東西

297
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
越來越多

298
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
他的田產越來越多

299
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
他賺到的錢

300
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
但他從來沒有想過

301
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
原來在生命裡面

302
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,000
有一個更高的存在

303
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
一個上帝

304
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
在上面祝福他

305
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,000
來供應他一些這樣的東西

306
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So Jesus is not against wealth

307
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Jesus is not against having money

308
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
He is not against wise management of our resources

309
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
especially our financial resources

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Jesus is poking fun of something

311
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
When you receive tons of blessing

312
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,000
With extra money in your pocket

313
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,000
And then you have no thought of

314
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,000
There has to be a being up there

315
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Granting us all this

316
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Providing us

317
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,000
And sustaining us

318
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
所以耶穌沒有說受苦

319
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
你千萬不要覺得整本聖經

320
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
就是不喜歡我們有錢

321
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
不喜歡我們賺錢

322
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
耶穌絕對告訴我們

323
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
我們應該要好好做管家

324
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
好好管理我們的錢

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:54,000
但財主給予故事

326
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,000
有趣的地方就在這裡

327
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
就是有錢的沒有想過

328
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,000
原來上面有一個上帝

329
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,000
我的生命是由他來sustain

330
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
我的生命是由他來供應

331
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
而不是

332
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
你從17-19的故事來看

333
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
你看看17-19

334
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
這個有錢的人對自己說什麼

335
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
這是富家子弟對自己說

336
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
他說了五次

337
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
我會

338
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,000
他說了五次

339
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
我會做這個

340
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
我會把我的田割下來

341
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
我會建造更大的

342
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
我會存放我的寶物

343
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
我會開設銀行帳戶

344
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
我會開設投資帳戶

345
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,000
我會告訴自己

346
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
我種了很多好東西

347
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
你看看他說了什麼

348
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
他說我的田產多豐富

349
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
我要做什麼

350
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,000
我要拆我的倉庫

351
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,000
我要開多個帳戶

352
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,000
我要開多個投資戶口

353
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
我要收藏我所有的東西

354
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
然後對我的靈魂說

355
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
你不需要擔心

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,000
他說了我的農產

357
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
我的果子

358
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,000
我的農場

359
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
我的財產

360
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
甚至我的靈魂

361
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
我的靈魂

362
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,000
我的倉庫

363
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
我的生命

364
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
每樣東西都是我

365
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:19,000
我 我 我 還是我呢

366
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
我想這就是聖經的主題

367
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
主要的問題不是富有

368
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
不是恭喜發財

369
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
當然神想讓你發財

370
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
神想祝福你

371
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,000
主要的問題不是富有

372
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,000
主要的問題是我們的態度

373
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
對於富有

374
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,000
我們的態度對於錢

375
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
而耶穌想要的是這個

376
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
最主要的問題在哪裡

377
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
不是財富問題

378
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
而是我們對財富的心態

379
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
你拿著錢

380
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
我們儲著錢

381
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,000
到底我們的心態是怎樣去看它呢

382
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
這是第十五節

383
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
耶穌說什麼呢

384
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,000
耶穌說

385
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
祂說

386
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
注意

387
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
對於財富

388
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
我出生在香港

389
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
我十歲的時候

390
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,000
我跟隨我的父母

391
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,000
去見一個家庭

392
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
一個大家庭

393
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
所有的叔叔阿姨一起

394
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
所以中國新年最好的事情

395
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:35,000
對於一個十歲的小孩來說

396
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
最好的事情是什麼呢

397
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
就是你得到錢

398
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
你得到紅包

399
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
你得到很多現金

400
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
我們有很多現金

401
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
我非常開心

402
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
我記得我得到五、六百元現金

403
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
從豆禮士

404
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
恭喜發財

405
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
當我說恭喜發財的時候

406
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
有錢進入我的口袋

407
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,000
這是十歲的最好的事情

408
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
我們去見他

409
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
我們一起吃飯

410
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
我們吃得很豐盛

411
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
然後叔叔阿姨

412
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
特別是叔叔

413
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
叔叔阿姨叫了所有小孩

414
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
家裡有很多小孩

415
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
來玩個遊戲

416
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:26,000
遊戲叫做魚、蝦和蝦

417
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
你玩過這個遊戲吧

418
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
我們全部豆禮士

419
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
十歲的小孩當然很開心

420
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
我記得那次

421
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
我自己有五、六百元

422
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
然後叔叔阿姨叫我們玩魚蝦蟹

423
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
我們小孩當然是玩

424
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
我們這麼多錢都玩魚蝦蟹

425
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
誰做莊

426
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
那個叔叔做莊

427
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
我們在玩的時候

428
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
我們很開心

429
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
有輸有贏

430
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,000
玩這個遊戲很有趣

431
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
但這遊戲很糟糕

432
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
為什麼

433
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
我們玩了一場魚蝦蟹

434
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
我們很享受

435
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:08,000
但最後我們輸光了所有錢

436
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
我們輸光了所有錢

437
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
我們輸光了所有錢包

438
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
他們都去哪了

439
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:18,000
他們都回到叔叔那裡

440
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,000
那是一個邪惡的叔叔

441
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,000
那個叔叔原來是哄我們玩

442
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
搶光我們的錢

443
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,000
我從來沒有試過在人生裡

444
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
有一個這樣的時刻

445
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
我們覺得人真的很邪惡

446
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
你給我們錢

447
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
沒有條件給我們錢

448
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
我們會發財

449
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
但他把所有錢都拿回來了

450
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,000
但在那時候

451
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,000
我才明白了義氣和慈悲的分別

452
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
還有我的看法

453
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
在於富貴

454
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
耶穌說什麼

455
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,000
他說

456
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,000
你要謹慎自守

457
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
免得一切的貪心

458
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,000
因為人的生命不在乎

459
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
家道豐富

460
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
耶穌警告他的徒弟們

461
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,000
要注意

462
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
要超越神

463
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:14,000
對付所有的義氣

464
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,000
因為人的生命不在乎

465
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,000
家道豐富

466
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:27,000
那是義氣和慈悲的分別呢

467
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:35,000
貪和慷慨到底有什麼分別呢

468
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
我想給你們一些想法

469
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
我想給你們兩句話

470
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
讓你們去想一想

471
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,000
貪和慷慨到底是什麼呢

472
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
我想我們在座中間

473
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,000
沒有誰說自己會貪的

474
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
我們不是貪

475
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:57,000
我們只是省錢

476
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:03,000
義氣和謙虛的分別是什麼呢

477
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
我覺得耶穌定義義氣和謙虛的分別是

478
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,000
義氣是關於為自己而獲得的

479
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:17,000
而謙虛和謙虛是關於為別人而獲得的

480
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,000
貪婪是什麼呢

481
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
就是只為自己團職

482
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
懂得感恩或者慷慨

483
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
懂得去祝福其他人

484
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:38,000
這就是義氣和謙虛和謙虛的巨大分別

485
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
有些事要想一想

486
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,000
義氣是關於提高自己的生活標準

487
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,000
而謙虛是關於提高自己的獻祭標準

488
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:57,000
貪婪就是只想提高自己的生活水準

489
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:06,000
感恩和慷慨就是提高自己的施與標準

490
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,000
生活標準和獻祭標準

491
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
有些事要想一想

492
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
神給我們很多東西

493
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:22,000
有意圖讓我們分享和祝福別人

494
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,000
特別是那些真的需要

495
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:29,000
特別是他的國王工作

496
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
上帝祝福我們很多東西

497
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
其實想我們做什麼呢

498
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
不是想我們團職

499
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,000
而是想我們分享和祝福其他人

500
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:43,000
特別是祝福他的工作

501
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
我兩年前就讀了一本新研究

502
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,000
《學術學院》

503
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
它講述了父母

504
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
把孩子養大

505
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:56,000
把孩子養大有感恩心

506
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
有感恩心

507
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
有慷慨心

508
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,000
這本研究的題目是

509
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,000
"感恩父母養大感恩孩子"

510
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
這引起了我的注意

511
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:12,000
是一本研究關於如何把六到九歲的孩子養大

512
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,000
如何幫助他們發展感恩心

513
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:25,000
這是兩年前報告出來的科學研究

514
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
科學研究是說

515
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,000
家長如何養大孩子

516
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
特別是六到九歲的孩子

517
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
如何培養孩子有種德性

518
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,000
有種本性

519
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
他們懂得感恩

520
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:45,000
懂得慷慨

521
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,000
裡面有一樣東西是他講到的

522
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
他說

523
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:55,000
"Greater parent gratitude and family religious involvement"

524
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
"were the only significant predictors"

525
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,000
"of more frequent parent-reported child gratitude behavior"

526
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,000
父母有感恩的父母

527
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
懂得感恩的父母

528
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,000
還有他們對信仰的投入

529
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,000
生活的投入

530
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
整家生活的投入

531
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
是唯一能夠預測到

532
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,000
就是孩子會觀察到他有感恩的行為

533
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
我們知道孩子

534
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
他們可以說謝謝

535
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,000
但不代表

536
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,000
他們說謝謝

537
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
當他們收到某些東西

538
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
但他們不代表

539
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,000
感恩不是說謝謝

540
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:50,000
感恩是比喻好態度更重要

541
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
你得到某些東西

542
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,000
你說謝謝

543
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,000
感恩是更重要的

544
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,000
感恩是對你的心

545
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
而不是只是外在的行為

546
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
說謝謝

547
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
去感恩

548
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,000
不是純粹說謝謝

549
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
我們知道感恩是從心裡發出來

550
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
孩子懂得說謝謝

551
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,000
但他未必心裡真的在說謝謝

552
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:20,000
我發現這份研究很有趣

553
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
它談到"Role Model"

554
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,000
"Spiritual involvement of parents, adults"

555
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,000
"We are happy in simple things"

556
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
"We are happy to volunteer"

557
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
"We are happy to give, to share"

558
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:37,000
"All these have great impact on our next generation"

559
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
"There is a family culture of giving instead of getting"

560
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
"That heavily impacts our children"

561
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
我覺得很有意思

562
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
你想想

563
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
當我們成為成人

564
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
當我們成為父母

565
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
我們懂得去感恩

566
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,000
我們懂得去慷慨

567
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,000
懂得去施與的時候

568
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,000
懂得去跟別人分享的時候

569
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
這就是我們家庭的文化

570
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
我們的家庭文化

571
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,000
是跟我們下一代有很大的影響

572
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:15,000
這就帶來耶穌在《事實》中說的

573
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
他說

574
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
The Lord Jesus said

575
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:31,000
It is more blessed to give than to receive

576
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
聖經記載了耶穌說了一句話

577
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
他說"施比受更為有福"

578
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,000
真的有Blessing的人

579
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,000
真的有祝福的人

580
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:47,000
是那些願意施與多過願意去接受

581
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,000
這是我第一段信息

582
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,000
第二段

583
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
應用部分

584
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,000
就在午餐後

585
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:57,000
我想在這裡暫停

586
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,000
我先說一句話

587
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:02,000
我們的教會正在建造和種植

588
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
是因為所有的人

589
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,000
他們貢獻

590
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
他們捐獻

591
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
他們捐錢

592
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,000
他們幫助

593
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,000
這是一家人的慈悲

594
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,000
這是一家人的感激

595
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:20,000
我們想繼續這樣

596
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
我們已經三年了

597
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:26,000
我們看到了很多的福音

598
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,000
神邀請我們成為更好的管理員

599
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:35,000
祂所給予的東西

600
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,000
所有的物質和福音

601
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,000
是神給予的

602
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
我們如何看待它們

603
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
如何處理它們

604
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
我們會否只為自己而獲得

605
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
還是我們學會了給予

606
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
就像神給予我們很多

607
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
我們成會已經三年了

608
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
在我們開始的時候到現在

609
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
我聽到很多這樣的故事

610
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
就是一些感恩

611
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
願意施比受更為有福的故事

612
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,000
我們教會

613
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,000
神的工作可以繼續延伸

614
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,000
完全是因為這些故事

615
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
新年流流

616
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
恭喜發財之餘

617
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:17,000
我們希望大家能夠多一點祝福

618
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
但最重要的是我們如何在神面前

619
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
活得更加豐盛

620
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
施比受更為有福

621
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,000
在上帝眼中做一個有福的人

622
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,000
我想展示給大家一個影片

623
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
這個影片是為了介紹

624
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,000
2019年的新的管理員

625
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,000
等一下我們有一個短片

626
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
我想用這個短片來介紹

627
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
我們新的管理員

628
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
我們教會的領袖

629
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
我們選出來的領袖

630
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,000
我想請大家想像這個影片

631
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,000
是一個邀請

632
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
並不是只關於知道誰是誰

633
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
但這個影片是一個邀請

634
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,000
給所有人

635
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
每一個人

636
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
我們想想如何建立教會

637
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
我們想想如何一起服務

638
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
我們想想如何活得更加豐盛

639
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
更加豐盛的禮物

640
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,000
比得到的更豐盛

641
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,000
看過影片的時候想一想

642
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
到底我們除了認識這些叫團成員

643
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,000
這些舊的領袖之外

644
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
我們想一想

645
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,000
我們如何可以在上帝給我們這麼多祝福的時候

646
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
我們做一個好的管家

647
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
施比受更為有福
