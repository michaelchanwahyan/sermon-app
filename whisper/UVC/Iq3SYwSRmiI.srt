1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
 Alright, good morning, Yuyi.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,080
 大家早上好!

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,280
 It's good to be with you all again this morning.

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,280
 非常感激,今天有機會跟大家一起分享神的信息。

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,600
 Okay, so we have been in a series on Jesus' Sermon on the Mount for actually more than

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,560
 a year now, going through Jesus' teaching from Matthew 5-7, chapter by chapter, section

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:26,400
 by section.

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,480
 And today is a special day because we are finally coming to the concluding portion for

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,040
 this entire Sermon on the Mount.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,560
 And this is a very important section because after laying out all His teachings and principles

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:45,440
 for His Kingdom of Heaven, Jesus now demands a response from us.

12
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:51,040
 我们已经在登山保训的系列信息中学习了一年多。

13
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:58,240
 从马太福音第五章到第七章,逐章逐段的研读耶稣的教导,今天

14
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,040
 我们终于来到整篇登山保训的结尾部分。

15
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:07,040
 这是一个非常重要的段落,因为在阐明了天国所有教导和原则

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,600
 之后,耶稣现在要求听众做出回应。

17
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,640
 So if you have been with me since the beginning of this series back in July last year, my prayer

18
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,640
 for you is that at the very least, some of what Jesus has taught here have resonated with

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,640
 you or make an impact in your personal walk with the Lord.

20
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:33,640
 如果你从去年七月这个系列开始就一直同我一起学习的话,我为你祷告。

21
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:43,640
 希望耶稣在这里的教导至少有一些已经触动了你,化在于你与主同行的路上产生了影响。

22
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:49,640
 So before we dive into our passage today, let's just do a quick review of Jesus' Sermon on the Mount.

23
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:55,640
 And so when Jesus began his ministry, this is the central message that he preached.

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,640
 "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near."

25
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,640
 在进入今天的经文之前,让我们快速回顾一下耶稣的登山保训。

26
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,640
 当耶稣开始祂的事工时,祂所传讲的信息是,天国尽了。

27
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,640
 你们应当悔改。

28
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,640
 And so in this first century world, dominated by the Greco-Roman Empire,

29
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:24,640
 Jesus is actually ushering a new kingdom and a new way of living

30
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,640
 that is radically different from the culture around them.

31
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:35,640
 And so in his preaching, Jesus announced that the kingdom of heaven has now arrived here on earth.

32
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,640
 And the Sermon on the Mount is actually where we find out what this new way of living

33
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,640
 that Jesus ushers in looked like.

34
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,640
 So if you want to pull out your Bible, you can follow with me along for a little bit.

35
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:16,640
 In Matthew chapter 5, Jesus begins his sermon by casting a vision of what a true flourishing life

36
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,640
 or what a truly blessed life looks like in this kingdom of heaven in the Beatitudes.

37
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,640
 And so contrary to the culture, a true flourishing life comes from being poor in spirit,

38
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:35,640
 being humble and meek, and being persecuted because of righteousness.

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,640
 And then this true flourishing life should leave a positive impact in the world that we live in

40
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,640
 and point other people to God the Father.

41
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:49,640
 And this is why Jesus called us to be salt of the earth and light of the world.

42
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:52,640
 [speaking Chinese]

43
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,640
 [speaking Chinese]

44
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,640
 [speaking Chinese]

45
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:30,640
 And then in verse 17, Jesus proclaims that he has come to fulfill the law of God perfectly.

46
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,640
 As the only one that has perfectly fulfilled all of God's law,

47
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:39,640
 Jesus also established himself as the ultimate interpreter of these laws.

48
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:45,640
 And he reveals to us the heart of God and the better righteousness behind all these laws.

49
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:51,640
 And so in verse 20, he called us to live out this better righteousness redefined by him,

50
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,640
 not the religious leaders or the teachers of the law of his days.

51
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,640
 [speaking Chinese]

52
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,640
 [speaking Chinese]

53
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:28,640
 And from there, in the later half of Matthew 5,

54
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:33,640
 Jesus show us six case studies of this true and better righteousness

55
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:36,640
 that will lead to a truly flourishing life.

56
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,640
 Beginning with the issues of anger and lust,

57
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,640
 and then God's design for marriage,

58
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:47,640
 and then integrity in the way we talk in our speech,

59
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,640
 and then finally to not seeking revenge and responding to our enemy with love.

60
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,640
 This, according to Jesus, should be the norm in his new kingdom of heaven.

61
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,640
 [speaking Chinese]

62
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,640
 [speaking Chinese]

63
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:28,640
 And in Matthew 6, Jesus continues with his kingdom teaching

64
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,640
 by addressing three of the most common religious activities of his days,

65
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:36,640
 giving to the poor, praying, and fasting.

66
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:42,640
 And once again, Jesus redefines what true religion is according to his new kingdom,

67
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:45,640
 one that is not concerned with the praise of the people,

68
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,640
 but for the approval of the Father alone.

69
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:54,640
 And in the section on prayer, this is also where we find the Lord's Prayer.

70
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,640
 [speaking Chinese]

71
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:20,640
 And then beginning in verse 19 in chapter 6,

72
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,640
 Jesus turns his attention to our relationship towards our earthly possessions.

73
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:29,640
 And so, instead of worshiping our earthly wealth,

74
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,640
 Jesus tells us to invest in heavenly treasure that will last for eternity.

75
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:38,640
 And when we are able to set our heart on heavenly treasure,

76
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,640
 we don't have to worry about our earthly needs anymore,

77
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:45,640
 because we know that the God who takes care of the birds in the sky

78
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:50,640
 and the wildflowers in the field will take care of us as well.

79
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,640
 [speaking Chinese]

80
00:07:53,640 --> 00:08:18,640
 And when we come to chapter 7,

81
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,640
 Jesus continues to lay out the social responsibilities

82
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,640
 of those who are part of his new kingdom,

83
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,640
 especially in the way we treat others.

84
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,640
 And so, in chapter 7, verse 12,

85
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,640
 Jesus gives us this summary statement of our social responsibility towards others

86
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,640
 according to his kingdom ethics.

87
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,640
 And this is what sometimes we call the golden rules.

88
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:42,640
 So, do to others what you would have them do to you.

89
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,640
 And this is the true and better righteousness that Jesus has shown us.

90
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,640
 And this is also the new way of living that Jesus wants us to follow

91
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,640
 as the citizens of his kingdom of heaven.

92
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,640
 [speaking Chinese]

93
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,640
 And so, in chapter 12,

94
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,640
 Jesus gives us this summary statement of our social responsibility towards others

95
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,640
 according to his kingdom ethics.

96
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,640
 And this is what sometimes we call the golden rules.

97
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,640
 So, do to others what you would have them do to you.

98
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,640
 And this is the true and better righteousness that Jesus has shown us.

99
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,640
 And this is also the new way of living that Jesus wants us to follow as the citizens of his kingdom.

100
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,640
 And so, all of this leads us to our passage today,

101
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,640
 where Jesus presents to all his listeners, including us,

102
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
 with an important decision to make.

103
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,640
 And this decision is a binary decision,

104
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:43,640
 which means that there is an either/or decision.

105
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,640
 There is no room for being on the fence or not making a choice,

106
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,640
 since everyone has to decide for themselves.

107
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,640
 [speaking Chinese]

108
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:09,640
 So, what are the two options here?

109
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,640
 Let's take a look at our passage today.

110
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,640
 So, this is Matthew 7, verses 13 and 14.

111
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,640
 "Enter through the narrow gate,

112
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:22,640
 for wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to destruction,

113
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,640
 and many enter through it.

114
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,640
 But small is the gate and narrow the road that leads to life,

115
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,640
 and only a few find it."

116
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,640
 And so, this leads me to my first point today,

117
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,640
 that everyone has to make a conscious decision.

118
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,640
 [speaking Chinese]

119
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:42,640
 [speaking Chinese]

120
00:10:42,640 --> 00:11:03,640
 Yes, so everyone has to make a conscious decision.

121
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,640
 And so, when I was out on my run earlier last week,

122
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,640
 I saw this exact verse written on the ground around 33rd and Wentworth.

123
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,640
 [speaking Chinese]

124
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:25,640
 So, it says, "Enter through the narrow," and then it got blurred a little,

125
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
 but it's "Enter through the narrow gate."

126
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,640
 So, what is this narrow gate and this narrow path

127
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,640
 that our passage is talking about today?

128
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,640
 So, this narrow path is the way of the kingdom of heaven.

129
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,640
 This way of the kingdom is not the most glamorous or popular one.

130
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:46,640
 It will be restricting and confining for those who want to enter through it.

131
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,640
 [speaking Chinese]

132
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,640
 And so, again, if you look back at all the kingdom principles and values

133
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,640
 that Jesus has laid out in his sermon on the mount,

134
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,640
 they're all very counter-cultural and demanding in some sense, right?

135
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,640
 For example, to turn the other cheek, to love your enemies,

136
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:22,640
 and to not gather up material wealth for ourselves, and the list goes on.

137
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,640
 [speaking Chinese]

138
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:30,640
 So, to choose this narrow path means that it will not be an easy journey

139
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,640
 because there will be trials and challenges along the way.

140
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,640
 [speaking Chinese]

141
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,640
 So, that is the narrow gate and the narrow path on one hand.

142
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,640
 And on the other hand, there is the wide gate and the broad path,

143
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,640
 which I would call the way of this world.

144
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,640
 And this way of the world welcomes all kinds of challenges.

145
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:55,640
 [speaking Chinese]

146
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:03,640
 So, the narrow path is the way of the kingdom of heaven.

147
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,640
 And I would call the way of this world.

148
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:12,640
 And this way of the world welcomes all kinds of beliefs, lifestyles, and values.

149
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,640
 And this is why the broader path is so popular,

150
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,640
 and many people choose to enter through it.

151
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,640
 [speaking Chinese]

152
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,640
 [speaking Chinese]

153
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:37,640
 And in a world that prioritizes personal freedom,

154
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:40,640
 this is a very attractive path, right?

155
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,640
 Imagine living in a world where there is no moral absolute,

156
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,640
 and you are just free to do whatever you want to do.

157
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:51,640
 This might sound like a very compelling way to live initially,

158
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,640
 but I can guarantee you that there will come a point

159
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:59,640
 when the emptiness and the loneliness in life begins to settle in,

160
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,640
 and you just begin to wonder,

161
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,640
 "Is there more to life than this?"

162
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,640
 [speaking Chinese]

163
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:10,640
 [speaking Chinese]

164
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:35,640
 And this is when you realize that the freedom you have

165
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,640
 is actually not producing the kind of fulfilling and happy life

166
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,640
 that you think this freedom can produce.

167
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,640
 [speaking Chinese]

168
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,640
 And this becomes even clearer

169
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:55,640
 when we take a look at the final destination of these two different paths.

170
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,640
 The only path that will lead to a true and flourishing life

171
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,640
 is not the wide and easy one, but the narrow path.

172
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,640
 And so, yes, while this narrow path is restricting and confining,

173
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:10,640
 it is the only way that will lead to true freedom.

174
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,640
 [speaking Chinese]

175
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,640
 [speaking Chinese]

176
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:36,640
 I like how this author and pastor John Mark Comer puts it

177
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,640
 when he described the correlation between the dichotomy

178
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:43,640
 of the way of life that is restrictive and confined on one hand,

179
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:47,640
 and the resulting freedom that it brings on the other hand.

180
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:50,640
 [speaking Chinese]

181
00:15:50,640 --> 00:16:00,640
 So speaking of rule of life,

182
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:03,640
 or you can think of it simply as a plan to follow Jesus,

183
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:05,640
 John Mark Comer says,

184
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:10,640
 "The rule of life is an invitation to a very different definition of freedom

185
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,640
 than that of the modern world,

186
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:16,640
 an invitation to embrace constraints,

187
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,640
 and that if you give yourself to them, will eventually set you free."

188
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,640
 [speaking Chinese]

189
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,640
 [speaking Chinese]

190
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:44,640
 So, in the same way, if we're willing to embrace these constraints

191
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:48,640
 and limitation and restrictions that are being placed upon us

192
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,640
 because we choose to follow Jesus on this narrow path,

193
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:56,640
 it will ultimately lead to true freedom in Christ.

194
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,640
 [speaking Chinese]

195
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:11,640
 So, this is the first point that I want to emphasize today,

196
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,640
 that everyone has to make a conscious decision for themselves.

197
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,640
 And Jesus makes his command abundantly clear for us,

198
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,640
 "Enter through the narrow gate."

199
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:24,640
 [speaking Chinese]

200
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:36,640
 However, as we have seen,

201
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:40,640
 this journey through the narrow path will not be an easy one,

202
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,640
 and there will be trials and temptation along the way.

203
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,640
 And because of that, we need to be alert.

204
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
 And so this brings me to my second point today,

205
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,640
 that we need to be aware of spiritual deception.

206
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,640
 [speaking Chinese]

207
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:13,640
 So, let's take a look at verse 15 to 20.

208
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,640
 [speaking Chinese]

209
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,640
 "Watch out for false prophets. They come to you in sheep's clothing,

210
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,640
 but inwardly they are ferocious wolves.

211
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,640
 By their fruit you will recognize them.

212
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:32,640
 Do people pick grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles?

213
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,640
 Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit,

214
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,640
 but a bad tree bears bad fruit.

215
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,640
 A good tree cannot bear bad fruit,

216
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,640
 and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit.

217
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:49,640
 Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire."

218
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:52,640
 [speaking Chinese]

219
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,640
 [speaking Chinese]

220
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,640
 So on the way to the narrow path, we have to be alert and vigilant,

221
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,640
 looking out for false prophets or false teachers

222
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:33,640
 who are trying to lead us away from the path towards life.

223
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,640
 And most of the time, these false teachers,

224
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:39,640
 they don't just come with a bright neon sign telling you who they are.

225
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,640
 But instead, they usually come in spiritual disguise,

226
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,640
 like wolves in sheep's clothing.

227
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,640
 [speaking Chinese]

228
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:52,640
 [speaking Chinese]

229
00:19:52,640 --> 00:20:08,640
 And if you pay attention to just the culture around us,

230
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,640
 you can probably easily find all sorts of different narratives

231
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,640
 that promise the kind of true and flourishing life

232
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,640
 that only Jesus can provide.

233
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:19,640
 And so if we don't do our due diligence in discerning

234
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,640
 all these different narratives that are being thrown at us every day,

235
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,640
 we could easily fall into their traps.

236
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,640
 [speaking Chinese]

237
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:48,640
 And so because of this, Jesus warned us, "Watch out for false prophets."

238
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,640
 And according to verse 20, the best way that we can discern

239
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,640
 if someone is a true or false prophet

240
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,640
 is not by what they preach or what they teach,

241
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,640
 but it is by the fruit that they produce,

242
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,640
 and whether or not the fruit of the Spirit is evident in their life.

243
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,640
 [speaking Chinese]

244
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,640
 So this is the first type of spiritual deception

245
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,640
 that we need to be aware of, one that comes from other people.

246
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:19,640
 But Jesus also warns us about the second type of spiritual deception,

247
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,640
 that is our own self-deception.

248
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,640
 [speaking Chinese]

249
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:33,640
 And so we need to be aware of this.

250
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:38,640
 So verse 21, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, I am a prophet,'

251
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,640
 is a true prophet."

252
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,640
 [speaking Chinese]

253
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:50,640
 And so we need to be aware of this.

254
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,640
 [speaking Chinese]

255
00:21:53,640 --> 00:22:00,640
 And so we need to be aware of this.

256
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,640
 Verse 21, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,'

257
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
 will enter into the kingdom of heaven,

258
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,640
 but only those who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

259
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,640
 Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord,

260
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,640
 did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons,

261
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,640
 and in your name perform many miracles?'

262
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,640
 Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you.

263
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,640
 Away from me, you evil doers.'"

264
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,640
 [speaking Chinese]

265
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:57,640
 And so the keywords here are the word "says" and "do" in verse 21.

266
00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:01,640
 And so following Jesus is not just about saying it

267
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,640
 or confessing it with our mouth,

268
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:08,640
 but our action have to reflect what we confess and believe.

269
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,640
 [speaking Chinese]

270
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,640
 The book of James talks about that faith without work is dead.

271
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,640
 So if your faith in Jesus does not make you love God more

272
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,640
 and want to make Him the absolute priority of your life,

273
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
 your faith might be dead.

274
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,640
 And if your faith in Jesus does not make you become a more loving person

275
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:47,640
 towards your family, your coworkers, or your neighbors,

276
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,640
 again, your faith might be dead as well.

277
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,640
 [speaking Chinese]

278
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,640
 And the fact that someone can prophesize, drive out demons,

279
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,640
 and perform miracles in the name of God,

280
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,640
 and yet not be able to enter into the kingdom of heaven,

281
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:30,640
 this might come as a surprise to some of us.

282
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:36,640
 But this kind of spiritual self-deception is a possibility that all of us face.

283
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,640
 [speaking Chinese]

284
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,640
 So, why is the disconnect here for these false disciples of Jesus?

285
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,640
 The answer is plain and simple.

286
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,640
 They are doing the right thing, but for the wrong motives or wrong reasons.

287
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,640
 So these false disciples, they crave for the power and status

288
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,640
 that Jesus represents.

289
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,640
 They are not doing the right thing.

290
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
 They are doing the wrong thing.

291
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,640
 And they are not doing the right thing.

292
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:08,640
 So these false disciples, they crave for the power and status

293
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,640
 that Jesus represented.

294
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,640
 But they never truly acknowledge Jesus as the Lord and Master of their life

295
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,640
 by allowing the will of God to control and guide their life.

296
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,640
 [speaking Chinese]

297
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,640
 [speaking Chinese]

298
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:44,640
 And by the way, just a quick side note,

299
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,640
 this is still true 2,000 years later in our 21st century America,

300
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:54,640
 where people would use the name of Jesus to gain power, popularity, or even status.

301
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,640
 [speaking Chinese]

302
00:25:57,640 --> 00:26:10,640
 So, be aware of our own self-deception.

303
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:14,640
 Take an honest look at yourself and examine your intention,

304
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,640
 because we can be doing the right thing for God,

305
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,640
 but for the wrong motives and reason.

306
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,640
 And you don't want to wait until the day of judgment,

307
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,640
 and only to find out that you're being denied entering into the kingdom of heaven.

308
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,640
 [speaking Chinese]

309
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,640
 [speaking Chinese]

310
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:54,640
 So this is a very stern warning from Jesus, right?

311
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,640
 But again, of course, we all have the freedom to choose

312
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,640
 to either listen to Jesus' warning or to completely ignore it.

313
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:04,640
 So in this next section of our passage,

314
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:09,640
 Jesus differentiates between those who truly listen and follow what he has commanded

315
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,640
 versus those who do not.

316
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:17,640
 And so this is my third and final point, that true hearing requires obedience.

317
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,640
 [speaking Chinese]

318
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,640
 [speaking Chinese]

319
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:43,640
 So if you look at verse 24, it begins with the word "therefore."

320
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,640
 And what this means is simply that what Jesus is about to say here

321
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,640
 is directly related to what comes before.

322
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:52,640
 [speaking Chinese]

323
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:00,640
 So let's read this together.

324
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:03,640
 "Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine,"

325
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,640
 referring to all Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount,

326
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,640
 "and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on the rock.

327
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,640
 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house.

328
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,640
 Yet it did not fall, because it has its foundation on the rock.

329
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,640
 But everyone who hears these words of mine,"

330
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:28,640
 again referring to Jesus' teaching in the Sermon on the Mount,

331
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:34,640
 "and does not put them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.

332
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:40,640
 The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house.

333
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,640
 And it fell with a great crush."

334
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,640
 [speaking Chinese]

335
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,640
 So the main difference between these two groups of people is that

336
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,640
 the first group in verse 24, they hear these words of Jesus and puts them into practice.

337
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,640
 While the second group in verse 26, they hear these words of Jesus just like the first group,

338
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:28,640
 but they do not put them into practices.

339
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,640
 [speaking Chinese]

340
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,640
 So Jesus compares the first group to a wise man who builds his house on a solid foundation

341
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,640
 that will stand through all the life, all the winds and storms of life.

342
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,640
 But then he compares the second group to a foolish man who builds his house on sand.

343
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,640
 And when the flood and the rain comes, these two groups of people,

344
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,640
 they do not put them into practices.

345
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,640
 They do not put them into practices.

346
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,640
 They do not put them into practices.

347
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,640
 They do not put them into practices.

348
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,640
 They do not put them into practices.

349
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,640
 They do not put them into practices.

350
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,640
 They do not put them into practices.

351
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,640
 They do not put them into practices.

352
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,640
 They do not put them into practices.

353
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,640
 They do not put them into practices.

354
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,640
 They do not put them into practices.

355
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,640
 They do not put them into practices.

356
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,640
 They do not put them into practices.

357
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,640
 They do not put them into practices.

358
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
 They do not put them into practices.

359
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,640
 They do not put them into practices.

360
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,640
 So tying back to the first examples of the white gate and the broad path that leads to destruction,

361
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,640
 those who share the words of Jesus but do not put them into practice

362
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,640
 will also end up in a similar destiny,

363
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,640
 where the life that they spend years and years building

364
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,640
 will eventually come tumbling down.

365
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:57,640
 (translation)

366
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:02,640
 So, we come to the end of Jesus' teaching on the Sermon on the Mount.

367
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,640
 And Matthew, which is the author of this book,

368
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,640
 he then closed his entire section out by resuming the narrative,

369
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,640
 where he concludes,

370
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,640
 "When Jesus has finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at His teaching,

371
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:19,640
 because He taught as one who had authority and not as the teachers of the law."

372
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:28,640
 (translation)

373
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:39,640
 (translation)

374
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:43,640
 And one of the worst things that could happen after we hear from a sermon like this

375
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:46,640
 is to think that this has nothing to do with us,

376
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,640
 because Jesus is only speaking to His audience.

377
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,640
 But the truth is, these words of Jesus apply to us today as well.

378
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,640
 We all have to make our own choice to either follow Jesus

379
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:05,640
 and the way of His kingdom above, or to follow the way of our world.

380
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:10,640
 And again, Jesus makes it very clear for us, "Enter through the narrow gate."

381
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:23,640
 (translation)

382
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:36,640
 (translation)

383
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:41,640
 So, I have a few questions for us to reflect on today.

384
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
 So...

385
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,640
 (translation)

386
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:53,640
 Are you willing to deny yourself and follow Jesus along this narrow path,

387
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:57,640
 despite all the trials and challenges that will come your way?

388
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:05,640
 (translation)

389
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:09,640
 And are you willing to live a life in full obedience to Jesus,

390
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:14,640
 even though it means that you have to live in a counter-cultural way?

391
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:24,640
 (translation)

392
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,640
 So, spend some time in your seat and just reflect on your own,

393
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,640
 and in a few minutes, I'm going to close it out with a prayer.

394
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:59,640
 (translation)

395
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:07,640
 (music)

396
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
 Let's pray.

397
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:10,640
 (translation)

398
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:17,640
 Heavenly Father, You have shown us the way that leads to life through the narrow path.

399
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,640
 So, help us to walk faithfully on this path, even when it is difficult,

400
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,640
 and very few people choose it.

401
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:36,640
 (translation)

402
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:40,640
 Protect us from all the deceptions in the world around us,

403
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:44,640
 and also within ourselves, that would lead us astray.

404
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:48,640
 And Father, give us the wisdom to discern what is true.

405
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:58,640
 (translation)

406
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,640
 Jesus, we thank You for Your promise that You will be with us to the end of the earth,

407
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,640
 as we journey along this narrow path.

408
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:16,640
 (translation)

409
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,640
 And Holy Spirit, come and transform our lives so that we can bear the fruit of Your Spirit.

410
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,640
 (translation)

411
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,640
 In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.

412
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,640
 (translation)

413
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:40,640
 Well, thanks, Chi, for a challenging message, and let us sing to the Lord.
