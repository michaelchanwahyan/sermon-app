1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Thank you.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Well, it's a blessing and a pleasure

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,300
 to be speaking with you guys again today.

4
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:11,440
 So thank you all for allowing me to be here.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,540
 Today is the 3rd of December,

6
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,540
 and so if you weren't aware,

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,720
 allow me to be the first one to tell you

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,080
 that it is officially Christmas season.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,860
 Yes, it's the most wonderful time of the year.

10
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,220
 And when I was putting this together,

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,560
 I thought about singing that line,

12
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,400
 but nobody really wants that.

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:31,760
 Nobody wants to hear me sing.

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,460
 That wouldn't be good for anybody.

15
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,100
 But Christmas time, it's the time for Christmas trees,

16
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:40,200
 Christmas cookies, and Christmas decorations.

17
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,480
 It's a time to decorate houses, give gifts,

18
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,440
 wear matching pajamas,

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,740
 and one of my favorite parts of the Christmas season

20
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,980
 is that it's the only time of the year

21
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:54,080
 I can find eggnog at the grocery store.

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,960
 Are there any eggnog-like lovers in the audience

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,220
 by show of hands?

24
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,660
 Oh, only a couple?

25
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:01,160
 All right, that's fine.

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,260
 All right, I'll have to scratch the next five minutes

27
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,620
 of what I was gonna talk about.

28
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,860
 No, I'm just kidding.

29
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,700
 But something that's more important than eggnog,

30
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,140
 pajamas, cookies, is that this is the time of year

31
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:15,400
 we celebrate the birth of our Savior and Messiah,

32
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,540
 Jesus Christ.

33
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:20,480
 For many Christians, it's a time of Advent

34
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:23,280
 where we recognize and look back,

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,320
 celebrating the first coming of our Lord into this world,

36
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,860
 and we look forward in anticipation

37
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:33,220
 to His second coming into this world.

38
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,700
 So for many reasons, Christmas time

39
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,060
 should be a time of great cheer,

40
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,760
 a time of joy, and a time of hope.

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,200
 But unfortunately for many people, this isn't the case.

42
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,800
 For many people, the holiday season

43
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,300
 is actually a time of stress, a time of sadness.

44
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,220
 So I did a little looking into this,

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,620
 and in a recent study done by the National Alliance

46
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:59,120
 on Mental Illness, researchers found

47
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,880
 that three out of five Americans

48
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,200
 feel their mental health is negatively impacted

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,260
 during this Christmas season.

50
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,740
 Another study done by the American Psychological Association

51
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,260
 finds that 88% of people in America

52
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,840
 struggle with stress during the holidays.

53
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,440
 And there were many other studies done,

54
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,580
 and maybe some of you, people you know,

55
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:24,840
 have experiences that lead us to this conclusion

56
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,640
 that for some people, the holidays

57
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,820
 are actually a very tough, difficult time.

58
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,920
 But I wanna talk a little about why is it.

59
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,420
 Why is it that during what is supposed to be

60
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,500
 the most wonderful time of the year,

61
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,920
 people seem to feel anything but wonderful?

62
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,300
 Why during this season, which is a time

63
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,700
 that should be full of good tidings of great joy,

64
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,640
 are there so many people who don't feel that joy,

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,440
 who don't feel that cheer, and don't have that hope?

66
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,880
 For some, this could be caused by financial concern,

67
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,580
 worrying about making ends meet

68
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,980
 while you're finding gifts for family and friends,

69
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,760
 while you plan for the year ahead.

70
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,680
 That could be a source of stress.

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,020
 For other people, it's a time of loneliness.

72
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:10,920
 The distance between us and our family and friends,

73
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,660
 it feels a little extra distant.

74
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,300
 It feels a little extra heavy

75
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,500
 when we're not together during the holidays.

76
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:20,400
 As you mentioned, the weather also plays a part

77
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,540
 in this kind of dampened mood.

78
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:26,580
 It gets colder, nights are longer, days are shorter.

79
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,220
 Here in Chicago, the sun doesn't shine past 4 p.m.

80
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,620
 And that's honestly a little bit depressing

81
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,660
 because it's only getting colder and darker from here.

82
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:38,380
 And for some people, the cold weather

83
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,920
 can bring about aches and pains,

84
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,260
 kind of sort of triggers this flare up,

85
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,900
 you know, of maybe arthritis or something in your body.

86
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:50,960
 So the cold and the darkness certainly has an effect

87
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:52,340
 on people's mental health.

88
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:55,000
 But while this holiday hopelessness

89
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,440
 can be caused by a number of varying factors,

90
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,740
 there's ultimately one reason behind it all,

91
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,740
 one source behind this lack of joy, peace, and hope.

92
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,520
 And it's sin, it's the reality that we live

93
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:14,460
 in a fallen world, a world stained by sin.

94
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,320
 Sin is the source of all human suffering,

95
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,100
 sadness, and sorrow.

96
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,760
 And this is the unfortunate reality

97
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,460
 that we all face on a daily basis.

98
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,360
 We live in a sin-stained world,

99
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,580
 and in this world, even the most beautiful things

100
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,500
 that should bring us the most joy and wonder

101
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,980
 can be corrupted by sin.

102
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,020
 That's why it's no surprise to see that

103
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:41,540
 during a time of year that should be filled

104
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,260
 with joy, peace, and happiness,

105
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,780
 many are suffering.

106
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:48,960
 We see something beautiful corrupted by sin,

107
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,800
 pain instead of peace, strife instead of serenity,

108
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,000
 hopelessness instead of happiness.

109
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 Yet in the same way that we see this exchange

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,040
 of pain in the place of peace,

111
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,640
 something beautiful corrupted by sin,

112
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,940
 it's not just something that affects us.

113
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,120
 We can actually trace this pattern all the way back

114
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,080
 through the history of humankind to the beginning

115
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,380
 when we see that exchange take place.

116
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,120
 But in the same way that we can trace the problem,

117
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,620
 sin, back to the beginning,

118
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:27,900
 we can also find the solution to that problem

119
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,500
 from the very beginning.

120
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,000
 And so that's something that I wanna talk about today

121
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,540
 is how God from the very beginning

122
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:37,580
 has offered his people hope.

123
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,780
 And it was this hope, this promise of God

124
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,220
 that the people of God have looked to,

125
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,940
 have held onto for thousands of years,

126
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,240
 and it is this hope that has kept God's people

127
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,800
 even in the midst of great suffering, troubles, and trials.

128
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,480
 And so it's this very same hope that we can look to today,

129
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,700
 whether it's Christmas time,

130
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,540
 whether it's after Christmas time, in between,

131
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,280
 we look to this hope as a solution

132
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,440
 for our own sorrows and troubles.

133
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:09,420
 And so I wanna look together at Genesis chapter three.

134
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,660
 So we're gonna get into the text

135
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,620
 and I can stop just ranting.

136
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:15,500
 Well, actually, no, I'm gonna talk a little bit more

137
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,560
 then we'll get into the text

138
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,600
 because I wanna set the scene a little bit, right?

139
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,860
 I wanna give you guys some context

140
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:23,740
 for what is going on when we see here Genesis chapter three.

141
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:26,080
 So allow me to set the scene.

142
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,040
 So if you want, this is your thing,

143
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,940
 close your eyes, imagine it.

144
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,580
 You don't have to if you don't want to,

145
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:33,060
 but just picture it.

146
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,400
 There's total darkness, nothingness.

147
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,100
 The world is empty and blank.

148
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,700
 It's void of anything.

149
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,620
 And then a voice calls out into this nothingness,

150
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,900
 let there be light.

151
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,100
 And there was light.

152
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,700
 And then God creates the heavens and the earth.

153
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,380
 He puts all the galaxies, the solar systems,

154
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,620
 the stars in their place, the sun and the moon.

155
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,320
 He creates the earth and he takes all the water on the earth

156
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,620
 and he divides it and separates it and brings up the land.

157
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,080
 Well, then he plants seeds, trees,

158
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,860
 fruit bearing trees on the land.

159
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:12,340
 He fills the land with all kind of animal life, plant life.

160
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:16,140
 He fills the water with all kind of fish and wildlife.

161
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,860
 And you see God is building, designing step by step,

162
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:22,640
 day by day, this beautiful creation.

163
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:25,020
 And all of this creation that he made,

164
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,020
 that he powerfully, wisely, perfectly spoke into existence

165
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,840
 is doing something.

166
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:36,060
 The sun, the moon, the stars, the earth,

167
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,980
 the animals, the trees, the mountains,

168
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:42,140
 even the smallest grain of sand on the beach

169
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:45,700
 is declaring the glory of God.

170
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,980
 And we see all this happening,

171
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:50,140
 declaring the infinite glory of God as we go day one,

172
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,460
 day two, day three.

173
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:54,940
 And it's as if it's all leading up to a point, a climax,

174
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:59,940
 the pinnacle of creation on day six when God creates man.

175
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:04,780
 And so God takes from the earth the dirt and he forms a man.

176
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:07,640
 He forms him and designs him, the scripture says,

177
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,840
 and he breathes into him the breath of life.

178
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,260
 And in that we see something that God creates mankind

179
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,500
 in his own image.

180
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:19,080
 Nothing in all of creation can say that they are made

181
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,660
 or it is made in the image of God.

182
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:24,200
 But this one man is made in his image

183
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:27,140
 and all of his descendants made in the image of God.

184
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:31,060
 And so all of creation, all this perfection,

185
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:34,340
 all this beauty we just imagined, God gives to the man.

186
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:36,720
 And even amongst the perfect world,

187
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,800
 God sets aside a perfect garden

188
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,620
 and he places the man in the garden to keep it,

189
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:44,220
 to tend it, to live off of the fruit

190
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,460
 and all the bounty that God has given the man,

191
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,700
 everything he could possibly need.

192
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,980
 And then we see as the man is giving names

193
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,340
 to all the creatures, all the animals,

194
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,140
 he has a realization because when he,

195
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:01,180
 I'm imagining this, when he names the giraffe,

196
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,320
 he sees a daddy giraffe and a mommy giraffe.

197
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,980
 And he names a tiger, he sees the boy tiger

198
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,440
 and the girl tiger.

199
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,840
 Well, he realizes that all these animals

200
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,780
 have their pair and their mate, but I'm alone.

201
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,440
 That as good as these animals are,

202
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,780
 there's none that matches me,

203
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,540
 there's none that is perfect for me.

204
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,420
 I don't have a companion.

205
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:25,180
 And so God creates for him, he puts him to sleep

206
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,420
 and takes from his own side, his own flesh and bones

207
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,860
 and creates a perfect, suitable companion for this man.

208
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,920
 He creates the first woman and he gives her,

209
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,820
 like a husband giving his daughter in marriage,

210
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,060
 he brings her and gives her to the man.

211
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,180
 And the man sings out this praise,

212
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,100
 I think you could say it's the first psalm

213
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,020
 that we see in the scriptures when he thanks God

214
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,300
 and praises him for this woman he's given him,

215
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,300
 this helper, flesh of my flesh, bone of my bone.

216
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,740
 And we see that after this happens,

217
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:58,420
 it's almost as if God stops and he looks at the man

218
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:01,140
 and the woman and all the animals and all the trees

219
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,220
 and the plants and the waters and the stars

220
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,380
 and the sun and the moon, and he declares

221
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,780
 that it is very good.

222
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:11,860
 Absolute paradise, total perfection,

223
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:16,820
 no sin, no death, no pain, no toil, no suffering or sadness.

224
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,460
 In the garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had everything

225
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,560
 they could ever need and everything they could ever want.

226
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,760
 And this is where we begin chapter three.

227
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,440
 So I'll be reading from Genesis chapter three,

228
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,360
 verses one through 15, if you wanna follow along.

229
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,680
 Now the serpent was more crafty

230
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,400
 than any of the other beasts of the field

231
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,280
 that the Lord God had made.

232
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:44,040
 He said to the woman, did God actually say

233
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:47,240
 you shall not eat of any tree in the garden?

234
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:49,360
 And so I wanna stop a few places here

235
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,440
 as I read through this passage to point out

236
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,040
 some of these things that I think we can really

237
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,360
 gain a lot of wisdom from in seeing

238
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,160
 how did this first temptation take place?

239
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,640
 Because I believe that the tactics of the enemy

240
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:02,800
 have not really changed.

241
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,200
 There's nothing new under the sun.

242
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,680
 And so this form of temptation that we see

243
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,040
 come against the man and the woman and their response,

244
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,920
 we can experience those same things.

245
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,200
 And so we should learn from this.

246
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
 And so the first thing we see, the very first temptation,

247
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,120
 this first inkling of sin entering the world,

248
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,560
 it is a questioning and a doubting the word of God.

249
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,480
 When the serpent says to Eve, did God actually say this?

250
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,560
 What he's doing is he's questioning,

251
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,160
 creating doubt within the woman's mind

252
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,880
 of whether or not God's word is trustworthy,

253
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,360
 whether or not God is credible and reliable or authoritative.

254
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,880
 Did he actually say that?

255
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,600
 Do you really have to follow that?

256
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,120
 Are you sure you heard that correctly?

257
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,080
 There's that seed of doubt.

258
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:46,680
 And the woman responds and rightly corrects him.

259
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,040
 And she says, we may eat of the fruit

260
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,480
 of the trees in the garden, but God said,

261
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,360
 you shall not eat of the fruit of the tree

262
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,120
 that is in the midst of the garden.

263
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,520
 Neither shall you touch it lest you die.

264
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,540
 And so two things we see in Eve's response

265
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,480
 that are a little curious is that

266
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,120
 when you look at the previous chapter,

267
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,240
 God never said they couldn't touch the fruit

268
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,440
 or touch the tree.

269
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,040
 Somehow Adam and Eve, I don't know if they misheard

270
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:12,240
 or added it maybe for their own protection,

271
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,040
 but they added something to what God had said.

272
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,280
 What's more, we see that Satan,

273
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,280
 and this is, I believe, still one of his tactics today.

274
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,880
 He flips what God says.

275
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,100
 And so when we see God spoke to Adam that all the trees,

276
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,160
 all the fruit you can eat from, but not this one.

277
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,380
 What Satan does is he minimizes what God has given Adam

278
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,320
 and he maximizes that restriction.

279
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,040
 It says, did God say you couldn't eat from any tree?

280
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,740
 And so what Satan does is he wants the woman

281
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:46,080
 and the man to focus on the one thing God said

282
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,340
 wasn't for them that they shouldn't have.

283
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:51,820
 Instead of focusing on all that God had given them,

284
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,620
 I'm somebody who loves fruit.

285
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:55,740
 You can ask my wife, you can ask Rachel.

286
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,020
 I love fruit, I'm always looking for new fruit.

287
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,160
 There's so many fruit in the world,

288
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,460
 and they had all of it, and I can't believe it.

289
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,820
 They allow the devil to tempt them to only focus

290
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,060
 on that one tree they couldn't have.

291
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:10,180
 But as much as I have a hard time understanding

292
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,820
 why they would do that, we do the same thing.

293
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:16,540
 God has given us so much goodness in the world,

294
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:20,180
 and yet we're often tempted to focus on those things

295
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,400
 that we can't have because there's something in human pride

296
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,460
 that doesn't like God telling us what we can't do,

297
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,260
 what we can't say, what we can't have.

298
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,340
 We don't like that.

299
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:32,900
 And so instead of rejoicing and enjoying

300
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,820
 all the good things God has given us when we sin,

301
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:38,160
 we choose to instead enjoy the few things

302
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,300
 that God says, this isn't good for you.

303
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,660
 I don't want this for you, don't have that.

304
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,820
 And we rebel against God just as Adam and Eve did.

305
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,780
 And so my first thing is that we should learn from this.

306
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,500
 The first thing we can gain from this

307
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,920
 is to focus on the good God has given us,

308
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,100
 to overcome the temptation towards the bad

309
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,740
 that is not good for us.

310
00:13:56,620 --> 00:14:01,340
 I'll continue from verse four.

311
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,980
 But the serpent said to the woman,

312
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,020
 you will not surely die, for God knows

313
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,500
 that when you eat of it, your eyes will be opened,

314
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,380
 and you will be like God, knowing good and evil.

315
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:15,500
 Again, further doubting, now outright denying.

316
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,160
 At first it started with questioning,

317
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,860
 did God really say that?

318
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,480
 To outright denying, that's not true.

319
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,660
 Okay, God said that, but it's not true.

320
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:27,060
 And I think today we should also be aware of

321
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,880
 and on guard against similar temptations

322
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,760
 to mistrust or outright deny the word of God,

323
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:37,200
 that he's graciously given us for our good.

324
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,820
 So the temptation comes in verse six,

325
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,260
 says that when the woman saw the tree was good for food,

326
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:45,660
 and that it was a delight to the eyes,

327
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:48,760
 and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise,

328
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:50,520
 she took of its fruit and ate,

329
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,140
 and she also gave some to her husband who was with her,

330
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:55,220
 and he ate.

331
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,100
 Then the eyes of both were opened,

332
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,300
 and they knew that they were naked,

333
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,040
 and they sewed fig leaves together

334
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,380
 and made themselves loincloths.

335
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:07,140
 Adam and Eve had been naked from the beginning.

336
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,060
 Nothing new happened except this loss of innocence,

337
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,100
 where they realized they were naked.

338
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,460
 But the thing with that is that

339
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,100
 there was nothing wrong with nakedness.

340
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,660
 God had made them naked, and it was good.

341
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:20,940
 But we see what happens here

342
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,800
 when they took and ate of that fruit,

343
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,700
 their morality, their minds, their conscience was corrupted.

344
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,860
 They had lost their sense of innocence.

345
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,640
 And we see that entrance of sin,

346
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,960
 guilt, and shame into the world,

347
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,220
 to the point they tried to cover themselves with leaves,

348
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,180
 which you'll see later in the chapter,

349
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:40,100
 it was not sufficient.

350
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,500
 That's another sermon that I could,

351
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,660
 there's so many sermons you can get from this passage,

352
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:46,100
 but just remember that.

353
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,920
 They tried to cover themselves, but it wasn't sufficient.

354
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:52,860
 So, verse eight.

355
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,700
 They heard the sound of the Lord God

356
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,980
 walking in the garden in the cool of the day,

357
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:58,820
 and the man and his wife hid themselves

358
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,700
 from the presence of the Lord God

359
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,340
 among the trees of the garden.

360
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,860
 But the Lord God called to the man and said to him,

361
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,460
 "Where are you?"

362
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,140
 Now, I wanna make a point here

363
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,300
 that when God asked this question,

364
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,140
 he wasn't asking questions the way we ask questions.

365
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:15,820
 We ask questions because we wanna learn something.

366
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,860
 There's some piece of knowledge we don't have,

367
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,640
 and we want to get it.

368
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,860
 That's not how it works with God.

369
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,940
 God already knows everything.

370
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,520
 There was never a time where God learned something,

371
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,920
 because God already knows everything.

372
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,200
 So, when he asked Adam, "Where are you?"

373
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,960
 It wasn't because he didn't know where Adam was.

374
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,920
 It's because he wanted to prick the conscience of Adam,

375
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:39,600
 so Adam would reflect, "What am I doing?

376
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,440
 "Where am I?

377
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,680
 "I'm hiding from God."

378
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,000
 Which doesn't even, how can you hide from the God

379
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,520
 who knows all things?

380
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,460
 Whose eyes are everywhere, who sees everything?

381
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,700
 That was the point of this question,

382
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,620
 was to prick Adam's conscience.

383
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:56,580
 And Adam says this, "I heard the sound of you in the garden,

384
00:16:56,580 --> 00:17:00,940
 "and I was afraid, because I was naked and I hid myself."

385
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:02,100
 So Adam hid.

386
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,280
 He hid himself from God because of his guilt and shame,

387
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,420
 which we already know.

388
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:10,980
 I mentioned before, there's no logic in hiding from God.

389
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,780
 But we tend to do the same thing

390
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,060
 in a slightly different way,

391
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,620
 but it's the same thing at the heart of it,

392
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,100
 that when we sin against God and our conscience is pricked,

393
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,000
 we tend to feel that we ought to distance ourselves from God.

394
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,520
 Maybe we feel like, "Whatever I did this weekend,

395
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,560
 "I know it wasn't right.

396
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,680
 "I shouldn't go to church.

397
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,800
 "I can't fellowship.

398
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,620
 "I'm too guilty.

399
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:33,000
 "I'm not right the way others are right."

400
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,320
 Or we feel like, "I can't pray right now.

401
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,220
 "I can't go to God.

402
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:38,460
 "He's angry with me, 'cause he knows what I just did,

403
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,800
 "what I just said."

404
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,180
 Or maybe, "How could I pick up the Bible

405
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,020
 "and read it right now?

406
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,840
 "I'm such a hypocrite.

407
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,160
 "I just sinned, I can't."

408
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,680
 And so our sin causes us to hide from God in a sense.

409
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,920
 We turn from God.

410
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:52,300
 Well, on the flip side, how it should be is that

411
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,740
 when we sin, we ought to go to God,

412
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,520
 because he's the one who forgives us

413
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,880
 and cleanses us and makes us right.

414
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
 Sin should not separate us from God

415
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,980
 the way it did with Adam and Eve.

416
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:06,320
 We should go to God, confess our sins,

417
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,740
 and receive forgiveness and restoration.

418
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,480
 We're not gonna find that by hiding from God

419
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,200
 in many of the ways we try to.

420
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,100
 I'm gonna continue.

421
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:17,800
 Verse 11.

422
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:20,600
 God said, "Who told you that you were naked?

423
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,800
 "Have you eaten of the tree

424
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,720
 "of which I commanded you not to eat?"

425
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,280
 Now, this is an interesting part

426
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,240
 where we see something enter the world

427
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,600
 that we're also all still guilty of,

428
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,800
 called the blame game.

429
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:35,040
 Verse 12.

430
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,440
 "The man said, 'The woman you gave me to be with me.

431
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,440
 "She gave me the fruit of the tree, and I ate.'"

432
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,120
 So Adam not only puts the blame on the woman,

433
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,720
 well, she gave it to me,

434
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,560
 he also kind of puts the blame towards God,

435
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:50,160
 because it's the woman that you gave me.

436
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,720
 He's already pointing fingers.

437
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,000
 He's already passing the blame.

438
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,160
 Then what does the woman say?

439
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,340
 "The Lord God said to the woman,

440
00:18:57,340 --> 00:18:59,400
 "What is this that you have done?"

441
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,440
 The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."

442
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,700
 So we already see this lack of accountability

443
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,480
 and responsibility for sin.

444
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,720
 Instead of confessing and admitting guilt,

445
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,320
 it's, well, it's the woman's fault.

446
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,440
 Oh, it's the serpent's fault.

447
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,360
 Oh, God, it's your fault.

448
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,600
 You put us here.

449
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
 And we still struggle with that.

450
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,080
 It's difficult to take accountability when we sin.

451
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,240
 It's easier to think that, well, it's this person's fault.

452
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,880
 And, you know, no, I wasn't being rude.

453
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,980
 They just took it the wrong way,

454
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,600
 and they shouldn't have started with me.

455
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,480
 You know, we kind of steal all these things

456
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,820
 that Adam and Eve did and stumbled with here.

457
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,800
 They're still stumbling blocks for us today.

458
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,640
 We can learn a lot from reading this and from studying it

459
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:40,580
 and comparing what they did to what we should do.

460
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,960
 Okay, but I'll continue.

461
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,860
 The serpent deceived me, and I ate.

462
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:50,960
 I do want to note that after Adam and Eve sinned,

463
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,980
 it's important to see this, because in this next passage,

464
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:56,960
 we see the mercy of God, the justice of God,

465
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,320
 but also the mercy of God,

466
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,320
 because Adam and Eve had just been created by God

467
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,840
 from nothing, given everything.

468
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,500
 He gave them everything,

469
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:07,800
 and they immediately turned and rebelled

470
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,960
 and committed this heinous, high-handed sin

471
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,400
 against Almighty God, against their creator.

472
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,040
 And yet, God first turns to the serpent

473
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,000
 and punishes the serpent,

474
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,260
 not the man and the woman who had sinned against him.

475
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,960
 So even in that, you see some of God's mercy.

476
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:28,160
 God could have just started over from that second

477
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,280
 and created a new earth and a new Adam and a new Eve,

478
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,480
 but he was merciful.

479
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,140
 And the worst of this punishment is on the serpent.

480
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,220
 Verse 14, the Lord God said to the serpent,

481
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,820
 because you have done this,

482
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,500
 cursed are you above all livestock

483
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,540
 and above all beasts of the field.

484
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:47,060
 On your belly you shall go,

485
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,740
 and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.

486
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,780
 I will put enmity between you and the woman,

487
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,780
 and between your offspring and her offspring.

488
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,820
 He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel.

489
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:06,100
 So surely this was the darkest day in human history.

490
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,100
 It was the entrance of sin into the world,

491
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,480
 which at that time was a perfect world,

492
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,140
 an untarnished, unblemished world.

493
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,420
 Paradise was lost.

494
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:18,820
 We went from perfection to corruption.

495
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,380
 Innocence exchanged for guilt and shame.

496
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:24,380
 Purity exchanged for sin.

497
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,700
 Hope exchanged for hopelessness.

498
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,700
 Life exchanged for death.

499
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,940
 And even as bleak at times,

500
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,500
 depressing the current state of the world may seem,

501
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,780
 when you see all the terrible things happening

502
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:38,860
 in our city, in our country,

503
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,900
 surely you see it around the globe.

504
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,540
 I can guarantee you,

505
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,600
 nothing we have today is as dark as it was on that day,

506
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,940
 when darkness first entered the world.

507
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,580
 But as is often said,

508
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,060
 it's always darkest before the dawn.

509
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,680
 You see, in the midst of this very darkness,

510
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:02,620
 we find the advent, the emergence of light,

511
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,620
 a dawn of hope,

512
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,380
 a promise given by God himself,

513
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:12,100
 in which his people have held onto for thousands of years,

514
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:15,060
 a promise of salvation, redemption,

515
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:17,940
 restoration, and justice for mankind.

516
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:22,860
 And we find this promise, ironically, in a curse.

517
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,220
 In verse 15, the Lord God said to the serpent,

518
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,680
 "Because you have done this,

519
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:30,620
 "cursed are you above all livestock

520
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:32,680
 "and above all beasts of the field.

521
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:33,960
 "On your belly you shall go,

522
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,960
 "and dust you shall eat all the days of your life,"

523
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,400
 which is almost a metaphor,

524
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:43,760
 a picture of utter humiliation, lowliness, defeat.

525
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,360
 "I will put enmity," which is conflict, warfare,

526
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,440
 violence, "between you and the woman

527
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,080
 "and between your offspring and her offspring.

528
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,480
 "He shall bruise your head,

529
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,960
 "and you shall bruise his heel."

530
00:22:55,960 --> 00:22:58,480
 So this is the curse that God gives to the serpent.

531
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,920
 But even in this curse, we find a promise

532
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,200
 when God says, interestingly,

533
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,200
 "I will put enmity between you and the woman,

534
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,240
 "between your offspring and her offspring.

535
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,440
 "He shall bruise your head."

536
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,320
 There's a pronoun there of an offspring of the woman.

537
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:18,060
 "He shall bruise your head,

538
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,480
 "and you shall bruise his heel."

539
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,960
 And so I wanna talk a little bit about that last part.

540
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:24,640
 He shall bruise your head, you shall bruise his heel.

541
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,440
 It's referring to the offspring or the seed of the woman.

542
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,320
 In Hebrew, this is the word zara.

543
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:33,760
 Its meaning is like an offspring, a descendant,

544
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,600
 a child, a literal seed.

545
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,080
 And in the Bible, when we see this word used in this way,

546
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,600
 it always refers to a man, the seed of Abraham,

547
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,320
 the seed of David.

548
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,480
 But in this one instance,

549
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:48,000
 of all the places I could find in the Bible,

550
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,160
 the seed describes a woman.

551
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:54,080
 And this is because the seed is in,

552
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,440
 and it comes from the man.

553
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,960
 It doesn't come from the woman.

554
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,800
 So it's curious that God would talk

555
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,760
 about the seed of a woman.

556
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,920
 This wouldn't really make sense normally,

557
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,440
 but I think this is significant.

558
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,600
 Because in this promise,

559
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,200
 the seed of the woman is referring to a certain someone.

560
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,280
 And if you can think of who it is,

561
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,840
 go ahead and just shout it out.

562
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,480
 Exactly, exactly.

563
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,880
 'Cause there's one person, one child,

564
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,600
 in all of human history,

565
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,320
 who was born without a human father.

566
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,240
 So literally, Jesus, the Messiah,

567
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,440
 born of the Virgin Mary,

568
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,960
 could only be the seed of a woman.

569
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,460
 Jesus Christ, the Son of God,

570
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:37,040
 the seed of the woman,

571
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,440
 promised by God from the very beginning

572
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,240
 that he would be the one to bruise,

573
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:44,520
 to crush the head of the serpent.

574
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,800
 God says, "He will bruise your head,

575
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,160
 "you will bruise his heel."

576
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,720
 And so you can compare the two.

577
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,720
 To bruise someone's heel,

578
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,280
 it's like a snake bite to the back.

579
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,520
 You don't see it coming.

580
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,920
 It's kind of an underhanded, deceptive attack.

581
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,720
 But if a serpent were to come on the stage,

582
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,380
 and I don't know if we have snakes in Chicago.

583
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,320
 I know we have rats.

584
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,120
 Maybe if we had some more snakes, we'd have less rats.

585
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,900
 But if a snake came on stage and bit me in the heel,

586
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,360
 it would hurt, it would not be great,

587
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,880
 but it wouldn't kill me.

588
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,440
 It's not a fatal blow.

589
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:19,840
 But if I turned around and stomped on that snake's head,

590
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,760
 that's it.

591
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,680
 It's a fatal blow.

592
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,080
 It's a death strike.

593
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,800
 A complete defeat for that snake.

594
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,800
 And so in that curse, there's also a promise

595
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:32,600
 that this one figure, this male offspring of the woman,

596
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:35,360
 this savior, would be bruised on the heel,

597
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:37,700
 would suffer some temporary defeat.

598
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,360
 But in that defeat, he would ultimately defeat the serpent.

599
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,680
 And so this passage right here is known

600
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,960
 as the Proto-Evangelium, which just means the first gospel.

601
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,400
 It is the first gospel message in all of the Bible.

602
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,920
 The first glimpse of hope, promise of redemption,

603
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:59,360
 fulfilled in Jesus Christ's death and resurrection.

604
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,120
 Because in death, Jesus was rejected and scorned

605
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,580
 by his own people, betrayed by them.

606
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:10,400
 Betrayed even by a disciple who he loved as a brother.

607
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,520
 On the way to the cross, he was abandoned

608
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,340
 by the rest of his disciples.

609
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:18,520
 In that crucifixion, in that rejection and abandonment,

610
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:22,440
 Jesus suffered the serpent's bite to the heel.

611
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,920
 Yet in his resurrection, he crushed the head of the serpent

612
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:30,480
 declaring victory over sin, death, and the grave.

613
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,200
 And so this was the hope, this savior figure to come,

614
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,120
 was the hope of Adam and Eve, that one of their descendants

615
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,560
 would one day crush the head of the serpent.

616
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,320
 That this figure, this messiah, the savior,

617
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,740
 would defeat Satan and rid humanity

618
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,200
 of his evil schemes once and for all.

619
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,900
 It is this savior who is the messiah of Israel,

620
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,920
 the one in which the people of Israel

621
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,760
 hoped in for thousands of years.

622
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,920
 The one whose birth we celebrate every year at Christmas.

623
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:02,000
 He is the one upon which all of our hopes rest.

624
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,640
 All of God's people rest their hope in this one savior.

625
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,960
 He is the solution to all of our problems.

626
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:10,360
 The ones that, the sin problem that has plagued

627
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,220
 all of mankind throughout history and plagues us today.

628
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:18,020
 Our problem is sin, it's devastating effects on our bodies,

629
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,780
 our families, every aspect of our life is marred by sin.

630
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,460
 But just as it is written, she will give birth to a son

631
00:27:27,460 --> 00:27:30,020
 and you shall call his name Jesus.

632
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,300
 For he will save his people from their sins.

633
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,940
 This is the hope that we must cling on to.

634
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:40,000
 The same hope that Adam and Eve, even after the fall,

635
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,380
 even after such a devastating loss of perfection,

636
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,140
 this was the hope they held to.

637
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,380
 The same hope we see throughout the scriptures.

638
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:50,420
 So many of God's faithful held on to this hope

639
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:53,140
 of a savior, of a redeemer.

640
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,200
 One example I wanna look at from the book of Job.

641
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,260
 A great example, Job was a man who lost nearly everything,

642
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:03,760
 who by worldly standards had nothing to live for.

643
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,100
 His possessions, gone, his children, dead,

644
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:10,940
 his own friends accused him of evil.

645
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,500
 His wife even asked him, you know,

646
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,300
 why don't you just curse God and die already?

647
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:18,860
 Yet in spite of all his suffering and anguish,

648
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:21,180
 Job could confidently declare this.

649
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,780
 I know that my redeemer lives and that in the end,

650
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,460
 he will stand on the earth.

651
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,920
 And after my skin has been destroyed,

652
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,620
 yet in my flesh, I will see God.

653
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,820
 I myself will see him with my own eyes,

654
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,740
 I and not another, how my heart yearns within me.

655
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:40,860
 You see, despite Job's sorrow and suffering,

656
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:45,820
 he was able to hold on to hope in God, his redeemer.

657
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,980
 And so I ask, can you, can we say with Job,

658
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:53,020
 I know my redeemer lives in the midst of our suffering,

659
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:55,140
 my redeemer lives.

660
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:57,460
 In the midst of frustration, difficulty,

661
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,740
 disappointment with family, with friends,

662
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,060
 my redeemer lives.

663
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:05,100
 In the midst of pain and anguish, physical ailment,

664
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,820
 my redeemer lives.

665
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:10,100
 When you lose a loved one, my redeemer lives.

666
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:12,900
 You see, that is our hope, that Jesus Christ,

667
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,580
 the seed of the woman, he lives, he's our hope.

668
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,680
 It's this very same hope,

669
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,260
 which has been held onto for millennia.

670
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:23,680
 The prophets all wrote of it, they spoke of this hope.

671
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:26,100
 Many people have waited for thousands of years

672
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,340
 for this hope.

673
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,020
 Now we have him, we have this hope.

674
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,300
 Yet unlike all the people of God that came before us,

675
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,560
 we don't have to wait and look forward to it.

676
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,880
 We look back to something that already happened.

677
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,520
 We know what happened, we have a confidence of it,

678
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,880
 of the time that Jesus entered the world

679
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:46,640
 to live a perfectly righteous life that we never could.

680
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,080
 To suffer and die a painful, humiliating death

681
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,520
 that we never would.

682
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:53,920
 To bear the wrath of God that we deserved.

683
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,400
 To defeat sin, to defeat Satan.

684
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,400
 And we know that not only was he born in this world

685
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,560
 of the Virgin Mary, not only did he suffer

686
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,960
 and die under Pontius Pilate,

687
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:07,620
 not only was he buried dead for three days

688
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,780
 after three days, he rose again to life.

689
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,360
 And so we can say confidently, as Job said,

690
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:17,900
 I know my Redeemer lives.

691
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,480
 Not only is this a present reality that we look back to,

692
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,080
 that we commemorate yearly,

693
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,100
 we also have an even greater future hope that we hold onto.

694
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:30,180
 The second advent, the second coming of Jesus Christ

695
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:33,360
 into the world, the Messiah who will once and for all

696
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,100
 defeat the serpent.

697
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,780
 And when he comes back, he will raise all his believers

698
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:42,100
 who have fallen, he will raise us and give us a new body,

699
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:46,300
 uncorrupted by sin, new minds, unstained by evil.

700
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:49,700
 He will put the enemy under his feet

701
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,940
 and then put an end to sin and death and pain for all time.

702
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,340
 And he will give us eternity with God in a new heavens,

703
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,520
 new earth, a new place of perfection.

704
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,300
 And this is our joy, this is our peace, this is our hope.

705
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:07,500
 This is our solution to the problem of sin, shame and guilt,

706
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,620
 loneliness, hopelessness, depression, sickness,

707
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:14,220
 death, frustration, trouble, trial, tribulation.

708
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,500
 Jesus Christ is our hope.

709
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:20,380
 So during this Christmas season, we should be encouraged,

710
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,740
 encouraged by this hope of who he is, what he has done

711
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:25,900
 and what he will ultimately accomplish.

712
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,620
 Even in the midst of difficulties and troubles,

713
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,300
 we have a hope, we have something to hold onto

714
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,020
 that will keep us going.

715
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,340
 And therefore we should be encouraged

716
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:37,780
 and we should encourage one another.

717
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,980
 Look to a brother or sister,

718
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,660
 if you see someone around you, reach out.

719
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,860
 If they're struggling, so many of us are,

720
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,740
 offer them that same hope, remind them,

721
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,220
 encourage them with this hope.

722
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:52,060
 It's not just a hope that we have, we share with one another.

723
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,580
 There's a passage I wanna, I'll just mention it,

724
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,360
 I won't read it, but Ephesians chapter two, verse 12,

725
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,020
 Paul is reminding the brothers and sisters in Ephesus

726
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,740
 of the time before they were in Christ,

727
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:08,300
 when they were alienated from the household of God,

728
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,060
 they were strangers and in the world they had no hope.

729
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,820
 They were without God.

730
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,780
 And there's people like that today.

731
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,460
 And we once were like that with no hope in the world,

732
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,620
 with no ultimate solution or answer to all the troubles

733
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:22,980
 and pains of this world.

734
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,420
 But in Christ, we have that hope.

735
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,420
 And it's not just enough for us to hold onto the hope

736
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:30,540
 or to share it with our brothers and sisters,

737
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,240
 but we have to reach out to those in the world

738
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,620
 who are lost, stumbling in darkness, who don't have hope.

739
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,460
 Share that message of hope with them.

740
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,820
 I think Christmas time is a perfect time

741
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,140
 because it's already on everyone's mind.

742
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:44,060
 There's gonna be family meals,

743
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:46,580
 you might be sitting next to somebody in your own family

744
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,500
 who is lost and without hope.

745
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,380
 Share that hope with them, a coworker, a friend,

746
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,500
 a stranger on the bus or the train or whatever,

747
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,800
 share that hope with them.

748
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,160
 It's the perfect time.

749
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,520
 We have the hope that the world needs.

750
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,260
 So as we approach our celebration of Christmas,

751
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,640
 of the advent of Messiah, Emmanuel, God with us,

752
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,460
 who as we heard earlier is the wonderful counselor,

753
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:13,860
 almighty God, everlasting father and prince of peace,

754
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,700
 the seed of the woman and the savior of mankind,

755
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,700
 let us draw close to him, hold onto him, find hope in him,

756
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:26,060
 and be as willing and as eager to share that hope

757
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,640
 with someone else.

758
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,860
 And so my prayer for all of us, for you guys,

759
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,540
 is the same as Paul's prayer for the Romans,

760
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:36,040
 when he says, "May the God of hope fill you

761
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,080
 "with all joy and peace in believing,

762
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,580
 "so that by the power of the Holy Spirit,

763
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:44,480
 "you may abound in hope."

764
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,320
 Let's pray.

765
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:50,540
 Heavenly Father, Lord God almighty, I thank you, Lord.

766
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:53,840
 We love you, we praise your precious and holy name.

767
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,200
 We thank you that even in the midst of a dark,

768
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:01,100
 sin-stained world full of evil and trouble and suffering,

769
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,100
 you have given forth a light in the midst of darkness,

770
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:07,140
 a light that we look to, a light that we have,

771
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:10,080
 that we hold onto, and God, I thank you for this light.

772
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,460
 I thank you for your love that we see in Jesus Christ.

773
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:15,840
 Help us, God, to be encouraged by this hope.

774
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,080
 Help us to be strengthened and matured in our faith

775
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,800
 by this hope, and to be so filled with love

776
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,000
 for you and others that we take this hope to the world,

777
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,300
 who needs it more than anything, God.

778
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,560
 So that is my prayer today, that we would all be,

779
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,620
 not just hearers of your word, but doers who act,

780
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:37,960
 who take this message and apply it to our lives, God.

781
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:40,560
 Help us in this, I pray, for the glory

782
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,080
 and in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, amen.
