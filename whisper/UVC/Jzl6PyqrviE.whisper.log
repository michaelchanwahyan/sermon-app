[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.040]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.440]   It is great to be here on another Sunday morning with all of you to worship with you, to take
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.480]   communion with you, and to just enjoy the presence of this family that we've been adopted
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.600]   into.
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.560]   If I could, let me open us in a word of prayer.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.120]   Would you bow your heads with me as we pray?
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:40.240]   Our Heavenly Father, our Lord, and our God, we come before you today not by what we have
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:48.800]   done, not by our own merit, but because you saw us first and you loved us first, Lord,
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.260]   and you have brought us into your presence.
[00:00:53.260 --> 00:01:01.480]   And so, God, this Sunday morning we give to you, I ask that you would just calm our hearts,
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.120]   Lord, and give us minds that are focused.
[00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.960]   Would you clear away the clouds of sleep, of the troubles of this week?
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.920]   Would you focus our attention upon you?
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.840]   And so for that, Lord, I ask that you would be with me, that you would speak through me,
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.440]   and would you protect the ears of my brothers and sisters as they listen to what I say about
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.440]   your word?
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.440]   Would you help them remember your word and your word alone?
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.880]   All these things we pray in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.960]   Okay, so we'll be continuing our reading of James today, this letter from the Apostle
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.900]   James to the Jewish Christians of the dispersion, where he calls for his brothers and sisters
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:50.440]   to live lives according to the faith that they profess.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.720]   To be more than just believers in name, but also believers in their living.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.540]   In James' words, Christians cannot just be hearers of the word of God, you and I must
[00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.240]   also be doers.
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.640]   Last week, we saw in chapter 2, verses 14 to 26, that it is a living faith that saves.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:20.800]   That a faith which is without works, without any impact on a person's life, is like trying
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.720]   to live without breathing.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.520]   It's a life that's incomplete, missing an essential part, an essential aspect, and it
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.800]   is one that cannot sustain you.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.440]   It's wrong to live in this way, and it's impossible to live in this way.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.400]   The only outcome from a faith without works is death.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:50.560]   And so, James calls for his brothers and sisters to have a complete faith and be complete people.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.120]   He wants his fellow believers to be perfect, affected by their faith and transformed so
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:03.240]   that their entire being both agrees and works in cohesive wisdom and righteousness.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.600]   Toward that end, we are brought to the next part of his letter to his displaced brothers
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.640]   and sisters.
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.880]   If you have your Bibles with you, I invite you to turn with me to the book of James,
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.800]   it's third chapter, verses 1 to 12.
[00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.880]   Again, that is James chapter 3, verses 1 to 12.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.540]   If you don't have a Bible with you this morning, they'll be right here.
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.680]   So let's read, all right?
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   James chapter 3, verses 1 to 12.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.120]   Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you know that we
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.880]   who teach will be judged more strictly.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.280]   We all stumble in many ways.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.220]   Anyone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect, able to keep their whole body
[00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.220]   in check.
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:57.700]   When we put bits in the mouths of horses and make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal.
[00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:59.840]   Or take ships as an example.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.200]   Although they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are steered by a very
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.280]   small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.800]   Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.720]   Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.980]   The tongue also is a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.000]   It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one's life on fire, and is itself
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.120]   set on fire by hell.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.640]   All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures are being tamed and have been
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.040]   tamed by mankind, but no human being can tame the tongue.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.200]   It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.760]   With the tongue, we praise our Lord and Father, and with it, we curse human beings who have
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.280]   been made in God's likeness.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.800]   Out of the same mouth come praise and cursing.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.240]   My brothers and sisters, this should not be.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.440]   Can both fresh water and fresh water be the same?
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.240]   My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives or a grapevine bear figs?
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:13.920]   Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.920]   Do you want to be what James calls his brothers and sisters to be?
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.520]   A person who is wise and complete and whole?
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.960]   A person perfected by their faith?
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:33.040]   Here in James chapter 3, verses 1 to 12, we see the centrality of the tongue in being
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.360]   perfect.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:40.000]   He starts off this chapter by advising caution when considering a position of teaching among
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.320]   believers, right?
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:46.960]   Verses 1 to 2, "Not many of you should become teachers, my fellow believers, because you
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.400]   know that we who teach will be judged more strictly.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.000]   We all stumble in many ways.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.200]   Someone who is never at fault in what they say is perfect.
[00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.360]   It would keep their whole body in check."
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.800]   In speaking about strict judgment, we begin to think about the standard of God.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.880]   It's the standard of perfection.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:12.680]   And what James states is that among the many ways in which we fail to keep this standard,
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.160]   we most commonly and often fail through what we say.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:22.280]   We are prone to mistakes, and one great maker of mistakes is our tongue, to the point where
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:29.080]   James says that perfection in speech translates to perfection in character.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.760]   There's a correlation being drawn between a self-controlled tongue and a self-controlled
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.680]   body.
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:42.360]   So you see in verses 1 to 2 that the tongue is important, that the tongue holds a key
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.080]   place in the direction of your living.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:54.400]   In order to help us understand this, James gives us two illustrations in verses 3 and
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:59.520]   4, a horse and a boat.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.560]   There we go.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:09.000]   If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.280]   as well.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.780]   Look at the ships also.
[00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:15.600]   Though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.560]   rudder wherever the will of a pilot directs.
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.640]   That is a different version, but here we have two examples.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:26.880]   One is a living creature, the other is a man-made vehicle.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.640]   These are large things.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:32.920]   Horses and boats move with immense power.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.680]   Have you ever seen a horse?
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:35.680]   Anyone?
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   They're big.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:42.160]   Okay, I don't know how else to describe them, but they are much bigger than I pictured them
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.160]   to be.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.560]   When we quantify the strength of modern-day machinery, what do we use?
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:48.680]   What sort of word do we use?
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:54.400]   We use the word "horsepower" because horses are this measurement of strength.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:59.560]   We tell people, "This machine has this many horses' worth of power."
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:07.280]   By using a bit, which is a metal rod that fits across the inside of a horse's mouth,
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.120]   we're able to steer the horse.
[00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.920]   We're able to cue and direct the horse in the direction that we want.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:18.520]   A small tug lets the horse know which direction it should turn.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:25.560]   The entire body of the horse is guided by this bit, and it's the same with a boat.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:34.680]   We're given this imagery by James of a large boat driven by strong winds, although they
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:38.560]   are so large and are driven by strong winds.
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.680]   It's a large boat.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:43.060]   This boat is able to withstand the force of nature.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:49.400]   It takes the power of these air currents to be pushed across the waters.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.120]   And yet, using a rudder, a pilot is able to influence and change the direction of that
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:56.560]   force.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.280]   The boat is steered by the will of the pilot.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:06.260]   And so we're given these examples to help us understand the effect of words.
[00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:11.520]   Because the tongue holds a key place in the direction of their living.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:17.160]   It is the means by which even a body of great size is directed and controlled.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:24.060]   It is a small member of the body, but it makes great claims, which turns the body in unholy
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:27.300]   and ungodly directions.
[00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:31.680]   If you would look with me at James chapter 3, verse 5, it's on the screen right here.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:38.260]   Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts.
[00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:43.280]   Consider what a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:44.900]   The tongue boasts.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:50.480]   It makes claims, it oversteps, and it speaks in ill ways.
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:55.580]   We see in verse 5 through the idea of boasting that this small part of the body is not leading
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.780]   its bearer in the good directions.
[00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:02.920]   There is not a proper helmsman at the wheel of this ship.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:08.540]   Instead of works of mercy and compassion, there is only death and destruction.
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:14.880]   What a great forest is set on fire by a small spark.
[00:10:14.880 --> 00:10:19.520]   You know, since earlier this year, I think it was around March and April, there have
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.320]   been a lot of wildfires consuming Canada.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:26.700]   And I think Chicago got a brief taste of this smoke and ash.
[00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.280]   It drifted in over from the north.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:35.620]   And now what I read, this was in August, around August, I read was that the wildfires had
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:40.760]   burned up 37.8 million acres of land.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.340]   That is a lot of land.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:46.640]   And something interesting to go with that is that a good portion of these fires were
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:49.560]   started by dry thunderstorms.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:54.880]   It's this lightning produced by the dry environment that sparks these small fires.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:11:01.040]   Fires which spread across dried out vegetation in the blink of an eye, blazing into these
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.000]   massive uncontrollable conflagrations.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.980]   They're uncontrollable.
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:12.620]   They grow faster than they can be put out and they destroy and displace with no regard
[00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:16.180]   for anyone and anything.
[00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:23.880]   James describes the tongue as a fire, not just an object that steers, that changes your
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:29.600]   direction, but a fire that wreaks havoc on everything around it.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:36.480]   The tongue is also a fire, a world of evil among the parts of the body.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:42.880]   It corrupts the whole body, sets the whole course of one's life on fire.
[00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:46.380]   Look at that statement in the first sentence of verse six.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:51.340]   The tongue is a world of evil.
[00:11:51.340 --> 00:11:56.600]   The present reality of wrongdoing in this world and all the unrighteousness of that
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:12:03.260]   world occurs and it finds its representation in the tongue.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:08.980]   The tongue is the part of our bodies which is used by God's enemy to do harm.
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.420]   James points at it as a manifestation of evil that corrupts the whole body, the entire body,
[00:12:14.420 --> 00:12:20.820]   the part which directs the rest of our body towards a life of evil and destruction.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.360]   It is set on fire by hell.
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.820]   These are harsh words, scary words.
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:31.340]   James looks at the tongue as a power for evil.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:37.940]   And so our tongues, holding a key position in the direction of our living, more often
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.680]   than not directs us towards evil.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:46.140]   Have you ever been in a situation where you found yourself processing hurt or anger?
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:47.140]   We're human beings.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:48.900]   Of course we have.
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:55.660]   Maybe in those situations we find friends or family to vent our thoughts to.
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:13:01.780]   Maybe we even sit and mutter to ourselves going over and over again and again how the
[00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:04.180]   offense happened.
[00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:08.740]   But in that process we find that we work ourselves up into a rage.
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:15.700]   We get angrier and angrier or more and more upset as we hear our own words, not just our
[00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:23.820]   spoken words, but also our thoughts as we revisit them over and over again.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:29.540]   And then sometimes we even begin to take it out on the people around us and transgress
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.060]   against our brothers and sisters.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:36.880]   The tongue, our words, influence us.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.380]   They stain and they spread.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:46.500]   The tongue corrupts the whole body, causing our hands and feet to stumble.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.960]   And there is terrible news beyond this.
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:54.060]   If you would look with me to verses seven and eight.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:58.440]   All kinds of animals, birds, and reptiles, and sea creatures are being tamed and have
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.420]   been tamed by mankind.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:02.340]   But no human being can tame the tongue.
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:07.020]   It is a restless evil full of deadly poison.
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:13.300]   Think about how mankind has transformed all the things around us to suit our purposes.
[00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:18.480]   The multitude of animals that have been domesticated for our benefit.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.540]   Consider the blessing and command of God to Adam and Eve to subdue the earth and to have
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.160]   dominion over the fish of the sea and the birds in the sky and over every living creature
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.320]   that moves on the ground.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:33.180]   We have dog owners in our crowd and cat owners.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.500]   These animals are now used to living inside our homes.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:42.620]   Our food and our clothing come from cattle, from sheep, from domesticated pigs.
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:47.900]   Going even further than animals, the very land on which you now, I guess you are not
[00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:52.060]   standing, you are sitting, it's been shaped by mankind.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:59.860]   You live in Chicago, we're here in Chicago, and this place actually used to be a swamp.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:07.060]   And yet, even with all this accomplishment and ability, no human being can tame the tongue.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.300]   It says so right there.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.320]   No human being can tame the tongue.
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.880]   While the things that inhabit this earth can be tamed, the tongue cannot be tamed by man.
[00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:20.780]   This is terrible and sobering news.
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:26.140]   Instead of us controlling our tongues, our tongues control us.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.820]   Our tongues don't just direct us towards evil.
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:35.220]   They are themselves a restless force of evil that continuously fights to corrupt every
[00:15:35.220 --> 00:15:37.140]   part of us.
[00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:44.340]   They're like a poison that infects everything we do and everyone we interact with.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.940]   And this, this is wrong.
[00:15:47.940 --> 00:15:53.020]   James makes it clear to you and me that this is not right at all.
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:58.060]   The entire letter of James reminds us that those who are believers in Jesus Christ are
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:05.540]   not people of death, but people of life, living children of God with a living faith who are
[00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:10.420]   called to be both hearers and doers of the word of God.
[00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:17.220]   In verse 9, in verse 9, we are presented with this reality of what comes out of the mouth
[00:16:17.220 --> 00:16:19.180]   of men.
[00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:22.740]   With the tongue, we praise our Lord and Father.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:27.620]   With the tongue, we curse human beings who have been made in God's likeness.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.820]   These are contrary actions.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:33.820]   Praises and curses strive towards separate purposes.
[00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:39.820]   And not only this, the curses are directed at those made in God's likeness.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:45.860]   We are people who are in the image of God, a faint reflection of the one with infinite
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:49.380]   worth who is worthy of all praise.
[00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:54.740]   So curses against these human beings made in God's likeness slander the very God who
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.020]   was just being praised.
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.900]   And these come out of the same mouth, the mouth of those supposed living children of
[00:17:01.900 --> 00:17:04.380]   God with living faith.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.060]   This should not be.
[00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:12.900]   James, in his usual fashion, asks rhetorical questions again.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.220]   If you would look with me to verses 11 and 12.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.780]   Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:28.200]   My brothers and sisters, can a fig tree bear olives or a grapevine bear figs?
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.000]   Can both fresh water and salt water flow from the same spring?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.940]   The implied and obvious answer is what?
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.100]   No, obviously not.
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:43.540]   One when drank will satisfy thirst, the other will deepen thirst.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:45.220]   These are different waters.
[00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:48.020]   They are not the same.
[00:17:48.020 --> 00:17:51.980]   Can a fig tree bear olives or a grapevine bear figs?
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.940]   Again, the answer is no, right?
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.340]   These are not things that can happen.
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:05.500]   To borrow a line from one of my classmates, we are proved through what we produce.
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:12.140]   Fig trees being fig trees bear figs and olive trees bear olives.
[00:18:12.140 --> 00:18:16.100]   They are not the same plant, the same with a grapevine.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:19.420]   Grapevines produce grapes because they are grapevines.
[00:18:19.420 --> 00:18:23.980]   They bear their corresponding fruit.
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:28.500]   So why are praise and cursing both flowing from the same source?
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:32.400]   How can both death and life be produced by the same tongue?
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:36.220]   What does that prove about the one who is speaking?
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:40.720]   James makes this clear to you and to me, that this is wrong.
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:45.820]   It should not be and it must not be any longer.
[00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:53.420]   You and I, being people who follow the Lord Jesus Christ, who profess faith in Jesus,
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:58.740]   must become living children of God with living faith.
[00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:06.040]   Words of evil and death have no place coming from such people.
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:11.580]   So then, knowing that the tongue holds a key place in the direction of our living, that
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.920]   our tongues direct us towards evil and that children of God should not be guided by or
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:21.680]   speak evil, what should you do?
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.700]   Is the solution to work hard to control our tongues?
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:31.380]   Is it to, from this point on, having heard what you heard, put all your effort into gaining
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:34.620]   control over our words?
[00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.620]   Obviously not.
[00:19:36.620 --> 00:19:44.820]   If you look back at verse 8, no human power can tame the tongue.
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.540]   It doesn't matter how much effort you put in.
[00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:52.660]   You cannot force fresh water to flow out of a saltwater spring.
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:56.940]   So what's the solution then?
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:00.500]   Do you want to be a person who is wise, complete, and whole?
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:05.900]   A person that is directed by righteousness rather than an evil tongue?
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:10.220]   If that is the case, then position yourself.
[00:20:10.220 --> 00:20:15.860]   Position yourself to be shaped and led by the words of God rather than the words of
[00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:17.660]   men.
[00:20:17.660 --> 00:20:22.980]   Because it is not a word of life that comes out of you that transforms you.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:29.260]   It is words of life that are given to you that transform you.
[00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.820]   And God has given you his word to transform you.
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.860]   James himself pulls from wisdom literatures such as Psalms and Proverbs.
[00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:41.900]   And here is an example.
[00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:44.900]   Never mind.
[00:20:44.900 --> 00:20:48.900]   Where is it?
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.900]   One second.
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:55.780]   Okay, guess it's not there.
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:20:59.100]   If you have your Bibles with me, you can turn to Psalms.
[00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:02.260]   The book of Psalms, its first chapter.
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:07.780]   You'll be looking at verses one to three real briefly.
[00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:10.580]   It is not on the screen, and that's okay.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:12.780]   I'll read it out for you, all right?
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.700]   Psalm chapter one, verses one to three.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.100]   Blessed is the one who does not walk in step with the wicked, or stand in the way that
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:27.260]   sinners take, or sit in the company of mockers, but whose delight is in the law of the Lord
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:30.580]   and who meditates on his law day and night.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:36.340]   That person is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season,
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.740]   and whose leaf does not wither.
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:42.380]   Whatever they do, prospers.
[00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:43.940]   That's the example I give to you.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:49.500]   If you look at this verse, you'll find that there's this person here that's mentioned.
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:55.620]   A person who resists evil and flourishes like a tree planted by streams of water.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:22:01.420]   And they do so by meditating on the word of God day and night.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:04.220]   Do you know what it means to meditate?
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:10.480]   It's not this concept of clearing your mind that we so often think about.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:11.500]   You're not emptying.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.340]   You are filling your mind.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:20.220]   In scripture, to meditate is to mutter, to murmur to yourself, and to speak the word
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:24.800]   of God as you read it over and over.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:26.620]   It's not just a mental effort either.
[00:22:26.620 --> 00:22:31.940]   It's this engaging of your entire person, an exercise of your lips, your tongue, and
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.220]   your teeth.
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:39.900]   To meditate is to engage fully and to truly take in the word of God.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:45.620]   This person here who is described, the one who is blessed, who does not walk in the ways
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:53.540]   of sin, is not directed by evil, and instead meditates on God's law day and night.
[00:22:53.540 --> 00:22:56.500]   This is Jesus.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:01.660]   Meditate on God's word just as Jesus does.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:02.660]   And this is not new.
[00:23:02.660 --> 00:23:03.660]   All right?
[00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:04.820]   This is not new at all.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.920]   This is the same truth over and over in the letter of James.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.840]   Our actions and behaviors are not the reason for our faith.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.760]   They are the result of our faith.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:20.100]   In this chapter that we have just looked at, chapter three, James calls for believers to
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.980]   correctly display the state of their hearts through what they say.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:35.940]   And so, having heard all of this, having seen the importance of the tongue in shaping the
[00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:41.260]   way in which you live, while also knowing that this is a daunting fight, one that you
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:49.280]   cannot win on your own, allow the word of God to direct the way in which you speak.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:51.020]   Be diligent.
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:57.380]   Be a diligent hearer of the word of God so that you become a diligent doer of the word
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:59.020]   of God.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:05.380]   And by doing so, do not prove a bitter and critical heart through bitter and critical
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:06.380]   words.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:15.340]   Instead, prove to be a living child of God with a living faith through living words.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:18.580]   Let me close us in a brief word of prayer.
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:22.900]   Would you bow your heads with me as we pray?
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:29.380]   Father, you are the one who gives life.
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.120]   You are the breath in our lungs.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:36.820]   You are the one who spoke first and created all of creation.
[00:24:36.820 --> 00:24:40.860]   And so, Lord, I ask in this moment that you would speak to your people, that you would
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:46.220]   speak to my brothers and sisters, that your word would be the first thing upon their heart,
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:51.780]   the thing that shapes them, because it is your righteousness that we cling to, your
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:54.100]   work that we cling to.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:25:00.180]   And so I ask that you would continue to place your hand upon them, that you would remove
[00:25:00.180 --> 00:25:05.380]   the calluses from their heart, that you would give their ears the ability to hear your word,
[00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.100]   their eyes the ability to see your word.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:14.180]   Lord, would you place your spirit in them anew that they might come to know you in deeper
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:15.180]   and deeper ways.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:17.500]   We pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.
