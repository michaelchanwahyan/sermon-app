[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Pastor Mark.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:05.760]   - Hey everyone, good morning.
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.160]   I want to do something special today
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.160]   because I want to welcome everyone to be with us here
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.680]   and we want to appreciate your presence.
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.360]   Go ahead and stand up and find someone,
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.880]   find someone you have not said hi to today, okay?
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.120]   And go to that person and say, "It's good to see you."
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.200]   (audience chattering)
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.280]   (audience chattering)
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.200]   All right guys, well I know you have a lot to talk about.
[00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.120]   We will have time after the service, all right?
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:18.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.760]   Well, once again, I want to piggyback on Kelly,
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.560]   what she said about we need your help to build this church.
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.120]   And of course, we will appreciate the worship team
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.880]   for their music practice and their leading us today
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.480]   to worship God together.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.080]   Let's, let's, let's move around our applause.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.440]   And then of course, the backstage,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.560]   we have some new system installed
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.040]   and so we are trying to work out the transition.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.920]   So we want to appreciate each and every one of them
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.640]   inside the room, it's very hot in there.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.640]   And of course, thank you for being with us today.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.320]   And if you notice our title today,
[00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.560]   the sermon title is called Contagious Church.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.560]   Now, as you see this title, I want you to think,
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.560]   are you a contagious Christian or are we a contagious church?
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.200]   Yeah, and a church full of contagious Christians
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.800]   is full of people who truly experience the grace of God.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.960]   Now, let me give you two pictures to, you know,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.680]   try to illustrate what it means to be contagious.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.480]   And the first image I want to show you is a negative image.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.840]   Now, you remember COVID-19, right?
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.400]   We could not hug each other, we cannot touch each other
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.880]   and we have to make sure we are people to people
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.920]   at least six feet apart.
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.480]   When you were in a room with other people,
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.520]   when you heard one cough and you got scared
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   because the virus was spread, you know, fast and far
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.120]   and it would disrupt our relationship
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.120]   and actually it would disrupt our community.
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:04:00.280]   And as you can tell, something can be contagious,
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.040]   something negative.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.880]   Same thing happen when there's something wrong
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.720]   in our life like bitterness, it can be contagious.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   Cynicism can be contagious or lukewarm faith, you know,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.240]   half-hearted faith or gossip or disunity.
[00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.280]   They're like, they're kind of like secondhand smoke
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.600]   and one person can change the whole environment.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:40.920]   Now, that's the first image.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.200]   I want to show you the second image though.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.880]   So I want to ask you ever been in a room
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.280]   with a friend who laughs really loud?
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.440]   You know, when your friend laughs and you know,
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.800]   even you are kind of sad,
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.080]   but the laughter will change your spirit.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.480]   So when you're around people who love God,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.240]   who take God seriously,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.800]   you should also eventually do the same thing
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.640]   because that is contagious.
[00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.320]   You know, our holiness, our full spirit life
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.640]   and our faith can be contagious.
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:33.480]   Now in Acts 2, we've been studying the book of Acts
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:36.280]   and we see that after the Holy Spirit comes
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.280]   and the whole community become a contagious church.
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.960]   And let me read this passage from 42 to 44.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.880]   They, meaning the church in Jerusalem, the first church,
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.000]   they devote themselves to the apostles teaching
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   and to the fellowship and to breaking of bread
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.960]   and to prayer and everyone was filled with awe
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.520]   and many wonders, miraculous signs
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.600]   were done by the apostles.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   All the believers were together
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.000]   and had everything in common.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.640]   They sell the possessions and goods
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.240]   and they gave to anyone who had need.
[00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:19.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:36.280]   Now, first, we need to know how to read the Bible.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.920]   So when we read this passage,
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   we should not think that we have to copycat
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:46.080]   or do exactly what they did.
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.520]   Because this kind of copycat, you know,
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.400]   reading and application is kind of too simplistic
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.800]   because the church in Jerusalem,
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.000]   they worship in a different way than we do
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.040]   and they worship in the temple court
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:05.640]   and they worship in the homes of other people
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:08.960]   and there were no place called church that they go to.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:10.880]   Their homes are the church.
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:13.080]   So our context is different.
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:17.600]   So we cannot just copycat it and do exactly what they did.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.560]   And we worship in a different way.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.320]   We gather in a public place
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:26.320]   and we cannot simply just copy exactly what they do.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:33.720]   So what the Bible describes
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:37.280]   is not necessarily what the Bible prescribes.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.680]   But we can ask and we should ask,
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:47.040]   what kind of church were they
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.640]   in the first century Jerusalem context?
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.880]   And we should ask,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.120]   what kind of church were they
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:01.200]   in the first century Jerusalem context?
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.240]   And how does their church,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.760]   how does this church inspire us
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.160]   to be a church of Jesus today?
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:19.000]   So here in this passage,
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.600]   we see believers, ordinary folks,
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.520]   they live in a compelling way for the gospel
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.800]   and it was contagious
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:31.760]   and people were being drawn in and being attracted,
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:33.280]   not because the program
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:35.320]   or not because of their something,
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:37.400]   some of the activities that they did,
[00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:39.320]   it's the way they live in a compelling way
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.800]   to tell other that God is good.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:46.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.960]   So let me suggest three things
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.560]   that we should pay attention to
[00:08:49.560 --> 00:08:53.480]   that will inspire us to live a contagious church life
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.120]   and Christian life.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:01.720]   First and foremost,
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.240]   we should be a Christian.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.480]   And second, we should be a Christian.
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:13.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:15.360]   First and foremost, be devoted.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.720]   And secondly, they were generous.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.280]   And third, they were alive in worship.
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.760]   Now, verse 42, it says,
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.040]   they were devoted themselves
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.200]   to the teachings of the apostle,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.640]   to the teaching of the Bible.
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.760]   And you remember last week,
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.400]   I mentioned this point, be committed.
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.880]   I mentioned this point, be committed.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.440]   We Christians need to be committed.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.320]   Worship, coming together,
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.900]   are not occasional attendance.
[00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:56.200]   Never done in a way that is half-hearted.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.240]   So they, if you pay attention,
[00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:02.000]   they were hungry for the word of God.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.160]   And just like we are hungry,
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.720]   we want some food.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.520]   But spiritually, they were hungry
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.200]   and they want to go for food,
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:11.560]   which is the spiritual food, the word of God.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:17.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:34.400]   Like when you're hungry,
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.760]   you go to a happy lamb, right?
[00:10:36.760 --> 00:10:39.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:41.800]   And you want to devour the food.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:46.760]   Now here, the church is hungry for the word of God.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:51.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.840]   And brothers and sisters, I want to,
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.800]   you know, just want you to think about,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.920]   you know, we do live in an age of distractions.
[00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:07.920]   Now everyone is busy, everyone is rushing,
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.440]   and we're trying to handle a lot of things
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:12.080]   more than we can handle.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.960]   You know, sometimes spending time with God
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.960]   or studying the word of God with his people
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.920]   becomes optional.
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:31.200]   Now, when I was younger, much younger,
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:34.120]   when I was a young Christian in college,
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:36.040]   I didn't have a habit of reading the Bible
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.480]   or reading, you know, spiritual books,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.440]   you know, but, you know, I observed myself.
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.680]   I started to spend more time with questions
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.040]   who take the word of God seriously,
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.560]   and I began to change.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.520]   I began to, you know, cultivate the desire,
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.080]   or the desire to, you know, really taste
[00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:54.720]   and dig into the word of God
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:59.040]   and taste the goodness of knowing God himself.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:02.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:07.320]   And let me ask you, what are you devoted to?
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.320]   Is there a hunger in your heart
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.440]   for prayer, for worship, for the word of God,
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:19.840]   for fellowship, for seeing people to come to Jesus?
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:22.360]   Now, if not, then we must change.
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:25.440]   We must realize that we are not the only people
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.760]   who are in the world.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:29.360]   We are not the only people who are in the world.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.640]   We are not the only people who are in the world.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.960]   We must change, we must repent,
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:38.240]   and we need grace, the grace of God to have a fresh start.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.480]   And because, you know, being a contagious church,
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.280]   being contagious Christians,
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.000]   we need to begin with a heart changed by the love of God.
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:13:10.280]   Now, that's the first point, be devoted.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.480]   The second point is be generous.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:18.880]   44, 45, all the believers who are together
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.400]   and have everything in common,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.000]   and they sell their possessions and goods
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.680]   and gave to anyone as he had need.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:35.160]   Now, again, our context is different.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:36.600]   There's no copycat here.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:39.120]   We cannot do exactly what they did.
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.360]   But that is one of the most radical part
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:47.800]   of their commitment, is that people in need,
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.200]   when they saw it, they didn't say,
[00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.120]   let me just pray about it, or let me just wait for it.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:58.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:10.400]   Don't get me wrong, prayers are good,
[00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.720]   and all this caring are good,
[00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:16.000]   but you see that all these believers
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.480]   in the first church of Jerusalem,
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:19.400]   they act together immediately,
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.880]   and they are generous, and they give.
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:25.560]   Now, this was not communism, okay?
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:29.240]   This was not communism, because it was not forced.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:31.240]   It was not state-sponsored.
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.520]   It was moved by the spirit of God,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.760]   moved by the love of God,
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.120]   because their lives are being transformed by Jesus,
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.400]   and they gave up everything,
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:43.760]   and be generous to help and to give to the church.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:47.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:15:05.760]   Now, if you know something about the Old Testament,
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:08.680]   you immediately would think of Deuteronomy 15,
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.760]   because there was a phrase
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.560]   that describes the first church of Jerusalem
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.840]   happens to be in Deuteronomy 15.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:17.960]   Let me read that.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.920]   There should be no poor among you,
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:25.360]   for in the land the Lord your God is giving you to possess,
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.840]   he will richly bless you.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.640]   If only you fully obey the Lord your God
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.400]   and are careful to follow all these commandments,
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:39.400]   do not be hard-hearted or tight-fisted.
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.720]   Give generously without a grudging heart.
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:44.560]   Then, because of this,
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.480]   the Lord your God will bless you in all your work.
[00:15:47.480 --> 00:15:52.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:56.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:28.120]   Now, you see, in the Old Testament,
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.640]   God told his people Israel to be generous,
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:35.640]   and not only because there were needy people among them,
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:40.280]   mainly because that God will bless them.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:44.080]   And now, in Acts 2, the Old Testament vision,
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.040]   this vision is becoming a reality,
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:51.880]   not through laws, but through love.
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:59.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:11.320]   You see, this is the logic of the kingdom of God.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:16.320]   The way the world works is that when God bless me so much
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:20.000]   and I have extra, then I'll give a little.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   That is the way of the world.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:29.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:36.680]   See, God's way does not follow human logic.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:38.880]   God said, "You be generous first.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:42.800]   "You give in faith, then God will bless you richly.
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:45.840]   "And you practice generosity first,
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:49.240]   "and then you will experience the blessing of God."
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:57.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:18:07.600]   But as you know, our world is full of takers, not givers.
[00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:11.480]   You know, if there's food, I'll take as much as possible.
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.440]   If there are free things,
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:15.000]   I'll line up and get them all, right?
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.160]   You know, I drive by a food pantry
[00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:19.600]   on Ashland Avenue many times,
[00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:21.680]   and I see people line up for free things,
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:23.180]   and many of them are Chinese.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.160]   And I do think there are needy people in the city.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:30.040]   I do think we need to contribute.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.600]   But, you know, I have observed many people line up,
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.080]   you know, they really don't need free food.
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:36.660]   They really don't need the free items,
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:37.920]   but they line up anyway.
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.240]   They take everything home anyway,
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:41.960]   and then, you know, there's so much food,
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:45.640]   and, you know, the food, the extra food got rotten
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:46.480]   and wasted.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:51.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:19:17.280]  , and at times, you know, if you observe,
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.720]   even the church is full of takers.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:22.680]   You know, the first thing people come to church is to take,
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:26.400]   is to get, to get something.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.480]   And have you ever thought of, you know,
[00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:31.800]   the food in the cafe and the ministry?
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:33.840]   We need financial support.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:37.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:51.280]   And a couple weeks ago, we had our annual core team retreat,
[00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.840]   and one of the most important items we discussed
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.000]   and pray about is our church finance.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.720]   It's what we need to sustain and to operate our church.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.960]   And as of the end of June this year,
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.920]   we lack almost 20,000,
[00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:11.920]   and we need more than 38,000 a month to operate,
[00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:13.840]   to pay the rent, and to, you know,
[00:20:13.840 --> 00:20:16.040]   pay the staff and support the ministries.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.920]   And I think if you are practicing,
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.720]   tithes and offering regularly,
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.640]   and I wanna thank God for you,
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.760]   but if you are not,
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   I think the Bible is challenging us to give regularly,
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.160]   and that is one of the things we take part
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.920]   in building the church together.
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:38.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:42.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:21:05.520]   See, the word of God tells you
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.000]   that if you really wanna experience the love of God,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.280]   the blessing of God, you must act first.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:15.080]   You must act in faith, and not just our leftover,
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:19.000]   but our love, our response to the grace of God.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:30.400]   Now, remember what Jesus said in Luke 16.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:32.960]   He says, "No servant can serve two masters.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.240]   "Either he will hate the one and love the other,
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:39.360]   "or he will be devoted to one and despise the other.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.840]   "You cannot serve both God and money."
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:57.160]   For years, you know, walking with Christ,
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:59.080]   you know, for decades, you know,
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.320]   I experienced that if my heart for God is conditional,
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:05.360]   there's no way I can experience
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.720]   the unconditional grace of God.
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:09.880]   And I wanna remind you, you know,
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.960]   a contagious church is one that gives freely.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:16.800]   It's one that we receive the great grace of God,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.160]   and then we offer our best.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:24.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:36.280]   Now, the third point here is be alive in worship.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.720]   And it says, "Every day, they gathered together
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:42.640]   "in the temple courts, and they broke bread in their homes,
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:47.520]   "and ate together, and they were glad and with sincere hearts,
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:50.280]   "praising God and enjoying the favor of the people.
[00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:53.000]   "And the Lord added to the number daily
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   "who were being saved."
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.840]   And you see this community was alive,
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:03.560]   and their hearts were joyful,
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:08.000]   and they worshiped together with, you know, will, attitude,
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.840]   and they didn't worship God out of duty.
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:13.920]   They did it with joy.
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:17.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:21.840]   And the Lord said, "You know,
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:23.440]   "if you're going to worship God,
[00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.760]   "you're going to worship Him with joy."
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.920]   Duty, they did it with joy.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:23:32.840 --> 00:23:42.360]   Now, God does not look at your appearance.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:46.560]   God is not so interested in your, on the outside,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:48.240]   how you look on the outside.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:52.440]   God sees your heart deep inside.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.640]   You know, when you come to worship,
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.320]   you come to pray and reflect,
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:57.680]   and we should all do this,
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.800]   and pray that and prepare us,
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:03.800]   help me, God, to love you with all my heart.
[00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:07.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:22.000]   Now, as I reminded you last week,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   we Christians, we the church, are always visible in public.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:39.240]   Now, you imagine if we are all takers, you know,
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.720]   new visitors, you know, people come to our community,
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:44.320]   they will feel it.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:48.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:51.520]   And you see, if we are all givers,
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:55.520]   then God will sense, people will sense the life in us,
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:24:56.680]   the life of God in us.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.560]   And people will see, you know, how they eat together,
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.200]   how they spend time with each other,
[00:25:02.200 --> 00:25:05.600]   how they worship together, and they gave generously.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.640]   And people will say, "You know what?
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.920]   "I want to be part of that.
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.160]   "I want that too."
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.240]   And, you know, just a reminder,
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:16.000]   you know, last week I told you, all Christians, all of us,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.800]   we are living under the spotlight.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:21.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:23.560]   We are living under the spotlight.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:28.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:45.240]   So my conclusion will come to this question.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:48.800]   Does your life make the gospel attractive?
[00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:52.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.240]   Now, when someone sees you,
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.480]   would that person want to follow Jesus
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.880]   after watching how you live?
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:10.720]   And a contagious Christian life is worshipful, joyful,
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.680]   and, you know, it's a sharing life.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:24.600]   And that is the life of church this Holy Spirit creates.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:26.640]   Well, it doesn't mean we are all perfect.
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.120]   We all have our flaws and we all have our shortcomings.
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:34.560]   But, you know, that's what the Spirit is trying to create,
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:36.080]   a new church, a new life.
[00:26:36.080 --> 00:26:38.600]   And it's not a private life and that's not personal life,
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.040]   but a visible life.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:43.080]   It's not a strange life, but a generous life.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:47.960]   See, you come to God today
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.760]   and God wants to do something for you.
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:53.200]   You know, God wants to transform your life.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.960]   God wants your life and your heart and your home
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   to be contagious with His love and grace and generosity.
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:05.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.240]   Just like people were drawn and being attracted
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.560]   to the community of Acts 2.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:16.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.960]   And that's why we are here today.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:28.400]   And that's why we are here today.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:36.480]   So there are three important steps or simple steps
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.080]   I want to suggest to you today.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.240]   First, starting today, read the Bible every day
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.080]   and connect with other Christians.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:56.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:58.160]   And practice generosity.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.520]   And we all need to give as much generously
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:10.040]   to support the ministry.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.720]   And third is to worship God wholeheartedly.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.800]   Now, remember last week, what happened?
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.200]   You know, each of you get a name, right?
[00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:28.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.040]   Did you learn that name?
[00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.000]   Did you pray for that person?
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.480]   You did, I see nodding heads.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:36.880]   That's great, that's great.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:37.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.440]   If you've forgotten, if you've forgotten about it,
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:42.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.520]   that's okay.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:44.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:45.840]   You have one more week to go.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:47.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:50.000]   So this coming week, remember that person, okay?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:53.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:53.880 --> 00:28:56.600]   And today, I know there are new faces among us.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.320]   So I want you, after the service,
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:05.000]   to go to someone who's new to us.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:14.160]   And learn that person's name.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:15.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.440]   And then pray for that person.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.520]   All right, so remember these three things.
[00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:21.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.480]   Okay, read the Bible every day and connect with others.
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:25.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:27.960]   And then practice generosity.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:28.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:30.560]   And worship God wholeheartedly.

[00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.800]   And this is what you're gonna say.
