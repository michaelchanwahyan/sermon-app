1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Thank you, James, for giving us a short announcement.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,140
 Today, we're going to continue with our series,

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,800
 and there are some questions I want you to do together.

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,300
 There will be some riddle to solve, okay?

5
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:16,840
 All right, so it's coming up, all right?

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,900
 So, at the Apostles' Creek,

7
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,240
 we are talking about this ancient statement of faith.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,960
 It's been around for more than 1,500 years,

9
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,820
 almost 2,000 years, to give us a world map

10
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:32,160
 of what it means to follow Jesus Christ.

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,040
 We are coming to, I don't know,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,360
 statement number one, two, three, four,

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,200
 maybe four or five.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,720
 It talks about Jesus.

15
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,560
 Remember, the center of the entire Apostles' Creek

16
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,000
 is on Jesus Christ himself,

17
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,360
 what he has done and who he is.

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,720
 So, right here, we have a statement that says

19
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,880
 he was crucified, he died,

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,600
 and was buried, and he descended to the dead.

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,760
 That means he really died, right?

22
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:04,080
 Was crucified.

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,240
 All right, that is a technical phrase in the first century.

24
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,600
 Now, who is being crucified in the first century?

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,120
 Political criminals.

26
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,680
 They will be crucified.

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,580
 In fact, Jesus was not the only one

28
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,200
 being crucified in the first century.

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,480
 I think, as I prepared this message,

30
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,480
 I remember it was back in the 1970s.

31
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:34,020
 Yeah, '70s.

32
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:37,520
 Before you were born, right?

33
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,960
 Wait, I was born, okay.

34
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,580
 I was born.

35
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:43,840
 There in Jerusalem, they dug out a tomb,

36
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:49,420
 and in the tomb, they found some human bones.

37
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:51,500
 One of the bone pieces is

38
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,680
 a heel bone of a man, all right?

39
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,040
 Heel bone of a man.

40
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,720
 You can see on the left.

41
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,840
 There is still a Roman nail going through it.

42
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,760
 We guess that maybe in,

43
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:12,080
 somebody being crucified,

44
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,200
 that man being crucified, the victim of crucifixion,

45
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,360
 and he was buried, and then as they try to bury him,

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,160
 because there was a big nail going through his heel bone.

47
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,000
 You know where the heel bone is?

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,240
 Yeah?

49
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,400
 Going through it, professionally,

50
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,560
 going through the entire heel bone without breaking it.

51
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,920
 And then when they buried the guy,

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,680
 they could not take the nail out,

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,920
 probably because the nail was bent or something like that.

54
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:47,480
 So as you can see from this heel bone,

55
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:52,000
 you can reconstruct kind of what it would look like

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,840
 for a crucifix victim.

57
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,280
 So,

58
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,440
 both the feet being nailed to the vertical wood beam,

59
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,680
 and then

60
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,640
 hands and arms extended.

61
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,440
 Usually, the nail would go through your wrist.

62
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,200
 So this reconstruction does not show it.

63
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,280
 However, sometimes, a crucifix victim

64
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,060
 would be nailed to the cross by four nails,

65
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:29,720
 just like what the gospel have described.

66
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,560
 All right?

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,560
 The nailed hand, right?

68
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,600
 Both hands.

69
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,940
 And then, nailed feet, right?

70
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:40,440
 So this is something historical.

71
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,040
 We are looking at what's crucified, this face.

72
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,460
 Only the political criminals,

73
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,880
 political rebels, they were being hunt down

74
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,080
 by the Roman authorities, the Roman Empire police.

75
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:00,500
 And then they would crucify these people.

76
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,520
 Now, as mentioned, crucifixion is a political penalty

77
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:12,120
 for all those who have committed treason

78
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,200
 against the Roman Empire.

79
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,520
 Now, with this picture, we can see that, actually,

80
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,940
 when Jesus died on the cross,

81
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:25,560
 he let us see

82
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,280
 there was a political side to the kingdom of God.

83
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:36,760
 By dying on the cross, by suffering from crucifixion,

84
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,920
 he's actually showing us there was a different reality,

85
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,480
 different kingdom, different political reality.

86
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,640
 And we, as Christ followers, we have to see that.

87
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,800
 Just happened today is the happy independence day,

88
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,480
 well, tomorrow, right?

89
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,740
 The happy July 4th weekend.

90
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:04,840
 Many Americans are celebrating nationalism, right?

91
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,040
 Patriotism.

92
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,080
 There's nothing wrong with loving our country,

93
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,320
 but that can never trump our allegiance

94
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,480
 to the kingdom of God.

95
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:19,680
 Because followers of Jesus Christ,

96
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,600
 we are proclaiming a totally different reality.

97
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,320
 And Jesus, by dying on the cross,

98
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,920
 he proclaims a totally different world order,

99
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:32,840
 a totally different order of power,

100
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,100
 reconfiguring our whole life.

101
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:41,400
 When Jesus came to your life, when Jesus came to my life,

102
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,360
 there should be some reconfiguration of powers,

103
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,860
 reconfiguration of functions in our lives.

104
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:54,240
 Jesus died on the cross, he sacrificed himself,

105
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,760
 he laid down his own right.

106
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,600
 That is a different reality, isn't it?

107
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,480
 Right, crucifixion, Jesus died on the cross,

108
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,720
 it's other center, he died on the cross

109
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,920
 so that we can be saved.

110
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,340
 He did not grasp his own right in heaven,

111
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,680
 but he laid down his own right.

112
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:18,840
 That's why the Bible consistently emphasizes one fact,

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:23,360
 is that Jesus is the servant king.

114
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,060
 And that is the status for all church communities.

115
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:34,200
 We follow Jesus, we profess his faith,

116
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,960
 we believe in him, as the apostle of Crete says,

117
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,380
 we believe that he was crucified, he died.

118
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:45,640
 And that is the example of Jesus.

119
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:49,060
 Let me read a passage from Philippians 2.

120
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:54,760
 It says, "Your attitude, your mindset,

121
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,760
 "should be the same as that of Christ Jesus."

122
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,920
 And then he goes on, "Jesus, being in the nature of God,

123
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,960
 "very nature of God, did not consider equality with God

124
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,120
 "something to be grasped, but made himself nothing."

125
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,260
 Those of us who are versed in English grammar,

126
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,120
 you should know something called reflexive pronoun.

127
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,360
 You know what reflexive pronoun is?

128
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
 No?

129
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,600
 Those who are teachers, students,

130
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,760
 reflexive pronoun means something that you do to yourself.

131
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,580
 Right?

132
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,360
 Something that you do to yourself.

133
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,120
 That is reflexive pronoun.

134
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,280
 Can you find a reflexive pronoun here?

135
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,920
 Made himself nothing.

136
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:51,680
 Nobody forced him to do that, but he chose to do that.

137
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,680
 He made himself nothing.

138
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,880
 This is the example of Jesus.

139
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,400
 And we have to ask one more question.

140
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:03,760
 Why did Paul write 2-5, right, Philippians?

141
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,920
 There was something before 2-5, which is 2-1-4, right?

142
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,680
 Actually, Paul is actually teaching the Christians

143
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,440
 in Philippi, the small group churches,

144
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,940
 maybe five, 10 people a group.

145
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:21,480
 10, 15 people is called a church community

146
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,040
 in the city of Philippi.

147
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,920
 And he is trying to teach them

148
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:27,760
 what it means to live as a church.

149
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,320
 What it means to be the church.

150
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:33,520
 And church is a community where we lay aside

151
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,400
 our own interests.

152
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,480
 We come into the church, we gather with our,

153
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,400
 with the Bible study group or college Bible study group

154
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,320
 or high school group, or coming to worship.

155
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
 No matter where we gather,

156
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,360
 if we gather in the name of Christ,

157
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,360
 if we gather in the name of Jesus,

158
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,520
 first presupposition is to lay down your own rights,

159
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,560
 your own priority, your own interest.

160
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:02,920
 Working for the interest of others.

161
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:05,120
 That is the community of church.

162
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,160
 That is what Christ has called us to be.

163
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,680
 Now many people today, when we come to church,

164
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,180
 sometimes we forgot to check our attitude.

165
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,320
 We come here to be entertained, right?

166
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,840
 Have you ever noticed the worship team

167
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,840
 played some wrong notes?

168
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,760
 Probably they did, right?

169
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,640
 You walk out the church and would you give five star

170
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,560
 to the worship experience?

171
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,920
 Probably not, right?

172
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,640
 Probably not.

173
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,080
 But if we do that, if we do that,

174
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,800
 we miss the whole point.

175
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,240
 We are not experiencing the presence of God.

176
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,040
 We are not experiencing the presence of Jesus.

177
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,400
 We come here not as a customer.

178
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:53,560
 We come here as a community of Jesus Christ himself.

179
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,920
 And what did he do?

180
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,640
 He laid down his own rights.

181
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,440
 He made himself nothing.

182
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,400
 That is the church.

183
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:04,080
 That is what the church is all about.

184
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,800
 One more example.

185
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:08,240
 We can quote other passages from the Bible

186
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
 talking about the church being a different order

187
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,800
 from the world, totally different from our culture

188
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,760
 because the culture, there is a culture script out there.

189
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,680
 The American culture, happy July 4th,

190
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,920
 we celebrate individualism.

191
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:28,080
 That is the meta-narrative of our culture, of our world.

192
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:32,760
 And it's constantly brainwashing us to tell you

193
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,760
 that if you follow this meta-narrative,

194
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,880
 this big narrative, this cultural script,

195
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,200
 you'll be great.

196
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,360
 You define yourself by individualistic choices, right?

197
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,440
 I make my own choices.

198
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,880
 I want to define myself the way I want to.

199
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,160
 That is the meta-narrative out there.

200
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,760
 But when we come before Christ,

201
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,040
 it's a totally different ballgame, isn't it?

202
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,040
 We lay down our own rights.

203
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,440
 It's no longer individualism.

204
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,040
 It is other-centered community.

205
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:12,480
 We lay down our own rights.

206
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,720
 We lay down our own status.

207
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,600
 I think of some other passages from the Bible

208
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,760
 that also proclaims this kind of different order of power.

209
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,000
 Remember that there were some passages in the Bible,

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,320
 in the New Testament.

211
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:37,160
 It sounds funny to us as modern readers.

212
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,280
 I'll give you an example.

213
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:41,040
 One of the example is 1 Timothy 2.

214
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,120
 Paul there is teaching the women in the church

215
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,320
 not to dress up to go to church, but to dress down.

216
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,200
 Have you ever noticed that?

217
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,720
 No jewelry, Paul is saying,

218
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,080
 "Don't come here with nice clothing.

219
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,000
 "I see that you are not coming with very nice clothing.

220
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
 "That's good."

221
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,000
 All right?

222
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,160
 And why did Paul do that?

223
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,000
 Why did Paul do that?

224
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,080
 You think your clothing is nice?

225
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,240
 Well, anyways.

226
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,040
 (audience laughing)

227
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:21,800
 Well, you know, you picked that this morning?

228
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,640
 Cool.

229
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,720
 (audience laughing)

230
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,800
 Anyways, 1 Timothy 2.

231
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:29,360
 If you have time, go back home and read that passage.

232
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,800
 Paul is actually doing something very funny to us.

233
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,040
 He said, "Don't dress up when you come to church.

234
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,440
 "You dress down."

235
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,560
 Now the question is why?

236
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,120
 Because in the Roman Empire,

237
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:47,960
 the social order so often is defined by

238
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,720
 how you wear, right?

239
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,640
 Now it's funny to us because we no longer do that, right?

240
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:56,760
 We no longer emphasize so much on this, right?

241
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:59,800
 I'm a CEO of a big company.

242
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,220
 They can give a presentation,

243
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,920
 a formal presentation with jeans, right?

244
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,000
 I mean, we don't do that anymore, do we?

245
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,040
 We don't.

246
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:13,120
 I remember in the old days, in the '80s, in the '90s,

247
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,480
 when we go to church,

248
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,560
 sometimes we are required to put on suit and tie.

249
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,560
 Well, unspoken rule.

250
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,760
 I remember one time we were still in college.

251
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:30,320
 We were going with some friends to Los Angeles.

252
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,600
 So we were driving down from Northern California.

253
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,480
 I was in Sacramento at that point.

254
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,200
 And then we drove down to Los Angeles for vacation.

255
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,240
 So some of our friends, we went to Hollywood,

256
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,080
 we went to

257
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,720
 Universal Studio and all those stuff, right?

258
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,880
 The fun stuff.

259
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:51,480
 So on Sunday, we found a church.

260
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,320
 See, we have good Christians, right?

261
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
 We still find a church to go to.

262
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:00,680
 So Sunday morning, we drove to one of the churches

263
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:01,680
 in the area.

264
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,680
 So we walk into the church, right?

265
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,360
 So we were young and fun people.

266
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:13,120
 I remember one of my friends was wearing shorts.

267
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,680
 As a group, we walk into the church.

268
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,760
 And then we were stopped by a deacon.

269
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:23,280
 And the deacon stopped us,

270
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:26,440
 but not stopped me because I was wearing pants, right?

271
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,440
 Long pants.

272
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,720
 Stopped the guy wearing shorts.

273
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,840
 And started yelling at him

274
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,920
 that you don't come to the sanctuary with shorts.

275
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,160
 I mean, is that crazy?

276
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,200
 That's kind of crazy, right?

277
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,640
 That's kind of crazy.

278
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,760
 I still remember some of the churches

279
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
 back in my generation,

280
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,720
 they have ties

281
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:53,560
 at the door.

282
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,320
 And whenever they pick,

283
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:58,200
 they find a guy without wearing a tie,

284
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,600
 you can borrow a tie, don't worry.

285
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,280
 You can borrow a tie and tie it around your neck

286
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,440
 and you come to the holy sanctuary to worship God, right?

287
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,360
 Do you want to do that?

288
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,080
 No, right?

289
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,960
 I find it funny.

290
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,880
 I find it funny.

291
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,120
 Now I've grown

292
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,440
 after all these years.

293
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:25,400
 And I find it funny because

294
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,000
 the New Testament actually tells us

295
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,160
 to dress down.

296
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,440
 In the Roman order of things,

297
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,520
 you dress up

298
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
 to focus on your social status, right?

299
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,960
 That's why the wealthy woman

300
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,200
 would dress up when they go to church.

301
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,400
 And when they dress up to go to church,

302
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,400
 they will emphasize their own high status in the society.

303
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,560
 So that other poor people also come to the church,

304
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:56,760
 then there is a contrast, right?

305
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,840
 Now, poor is,

306
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:01,840
 poor is not trying to censor their clothing

307
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,120
 or what they wear.

308
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,840
 Poor is trying to say in the community of the church,

309
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:11,000
 we don't emphasize our social economic differences

310
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:16,440
 because the ground around the cross is level.

311
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:19,000
 At the foot of the cross, we are all sinners

312
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,840
 and we only justify by grace.

313
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:23,560
 And that's the spirit, right?

314
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,060
 That is what the church means.

315
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:31,480
 We come as a community to focus on others, not ourselves.

316
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,200
 Great example, right?

317
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:39,560
 If you take a look at the previous context of 2-5,

318
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,480
 you know, the hymn for Christ,

319
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,840
 how he made himself nothing,

320
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,840
 how he died on the cross as a slave.

321
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:52,160
 Paul was actually teaching the Christians

322
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,520
 how to be together, how to form a community together.

323
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,480
 He said, if you have any encouragement

324
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,980
 from being united with Christ,

325
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,080
 with any comfort from his love,

326
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:07,200
 any fellowship with the spirit,

327
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:09,320
 any tenderness and compassion,

328
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,600
 then make my joys, Paul says, complete

329
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:16,120
 by being like-minded, having the same love,

330
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,800
 being one in spirit and purpose.

331
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,160
 Do nothing out of selfish ambition.

332
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:23,920
 In humility, consider others better than yourselves.

333
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:28,560
 Each of you should look not only to your own interests,

334
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:31,560
 but also to the interests of others.

335
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,720
 Jesus was crucified and died as a political victim.

336
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:43,600
 That is the example of servanthood.

337
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:47,760
 We follow Jesus, we do the same.

338
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:51,260
 Now, the apostles continue with the phrase

339
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:54,560
 "under Pontius Pilate."

340
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,480
 You know who that guy is?

341
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,720
 Pontius Pilate?

342
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,360
 Pontius Pilate.

343
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,640
 Now, under the Roman occupation at the time,

344
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,060
 Rome will send a local governor, a Roman,

345
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:14,100
 to rule over conquered cities,

346
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:19,760
 like Palestine, the land of Israel

347
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,160
 at that time in the first century.

348
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:27,320
 So, the Roman governor would rule over the Jewish people,

349
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:33,960
 and of course, the Jewish people would hate the governor.

350
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:38,280
 So, there's a huge political disconnection there.

351
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,400
 There's a huge political tension between Pontius Pilate,

352
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,140
 who ruled Palestine at the time, AD 26 to 36,

353
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:50,060
 against the Roman population.

354
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:54,120
 There was story after story outside the Bible

355
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:58,440
 talking about people rebelling against the authorities,

356
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,520
 protesting, and all that stuff.

357
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:03,440
 And Pilate was a crafty politician.

358
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,200
 Remember, the Jewish authorities trying to persecute Jesus

359
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,440
 and crucify him and crucify him, they yell,

360
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,640
 and then they bring Jesus to Pilate, the governor,

361
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,920
 because as local authorities, the Jerusalemites,

362
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:23,080
 they could not impose a death penalty.

363
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:26,880
 So, they bring him to Pilate.

364
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,200
 As the Roman governor at the time,

365
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,360
 Pilate wanted to keep the peace, to please the people.

366
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,680
 That's why he had Jesus crucified.

367
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:40,120
 So, Pilate was a crafty politician.

368
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,280
 It's like today, right?

369
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,520
 You hear about who you should vote for,

370
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,360
 someone's going to try to win your vote, right?

371
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,760
 Don't get into the trap,

372
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,020
 because they are all politicians, right?

373
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:58,620
 They are all politicians.

374
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:02,700
 No political party can represent the kingdom of God.

375
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:05,380
 The kingdom of God is so big,

376
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:08,380
 bigger than left or right or center.

377
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:13,260
 A different reality, different order of things.

378
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,180
 Now, here's the riddle.

379
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,140
 As we talk about the Apostles' Creed,

380
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,140
 under Pontius Pilate, that's very interesting,

381
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,660
 because there's a bad guy in this Apostles' Creed, right?

382
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:27,740
 It's supposed to be something really pure, right?

383
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:31,980
 Document, talking about the Christian faith.

384
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,700
 Why did they put Pontius Pilate there, right?

385
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,260
 A bad politician there.

386
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,220
 Well, this is a historical note, right?

387
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:44,020
 Christianity is historic.

388
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:47,340
 Something that happened in real time and space, right?

389
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,760
 It's not some mythic stories.

390
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,820
 It's not some fictional stuff that we believe in,

391
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,180
 but something that actually happened

392
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,060
 in real time and space.

393
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:03,220
 Pontius Pilate, governor of Palestine, AD 26 to 36, right?

394
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,500
 If you check the Roman history,

395
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:11,580
 or the history of the eastern Mediterranean area,

396
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:16,900
 you would find this name show up

397
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,160
 on other different historical documents.

398
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:25,420
 Many years ago, there was a city in the land of Palestine

399
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,220
 called Caesarea Militima.

400
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,420
 It's a harbor.

401
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:35,760
 It's a huge man-made harbor.

402
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,220
 People were digging there, and they found a piece of stone

403
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,100
 being reused later time in a Roman theater.

404
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,860
 And on that stone, there were some inscriptions.

405
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,780
 Now, the riddle is, can you find the name Pilate

406
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,440
 on the inscriptions?

407
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,460
 Can you find it?

408
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:59,140
 Can you make it out?

409
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,060
 Where is it?

410
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:06,180
 Can you find P-I-L-A-T-U-S, or V-S?

411
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:10,840
 Can you find it?

412
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,900
 Where is it?

413
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:20,980
 The first line says Tiberium, right?

414
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:25,140
 Tiberius was also the Roman emperor at the time, Tiberius.

415
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:30,580
 So there's a Tiberium, some sort of temple,

416
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,000
 dedicated to the boss, right?

417
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:37,180
 The CEO of the entire Roman Empire, right?

418
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,700
 Tiberium, so this kind of a dedication inscription

419
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,540
 for a temple in Caesarea Militima.

420
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:46,120
 Can you find Pilate?

421
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,400
 Can you see that?

422
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,820
 Yeah, Pontus Pilate, right?

423
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:58,380
 Pontus Pilate, and the prefect of Judea, right?

424
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:05,660
 So Pilate is this historical thing,

425
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:08,020
 he's a historical figure, right?

426
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:09,700
 When they unearthed this thing,

427
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:12,660
 they finally find something in the stone

428
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,060
 that says Pilate was a real guy.

429
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:19,460
 Of course, Jesus was a real guy, right?

430
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:23,620
 As the Creed says, he was crucified on the third day,

431
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:29,100
 and then he rose again, ascended into heaven,

432
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,860
 and is now seated at the right hand of the Father.

433
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:35,780
 He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

434
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,500
 The empty tomb is being affirmed

435
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,460
 as an other historical fact.

436
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,720
 The tomb of Jesus is empty.

437
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,880
 Point blank, telling you, the tomb of Christ is empty.

438
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,840
 But how do you explain the empty tomb?

439
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:59,680
 I want to close today's message with a pretty long quote.

440
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,760
 I find this book is one of the best books

441
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,520
 on the reality of the empty tomb.

442
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,160
 This guy is an Israeli archaeologist,

443
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,040
 Israeli historian, Shimon Gibson.

444
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:15,960
 Now I find this book pretty interesting

445
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,680
 because he's, you know, Gibson is not,

446
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:21,600
 he's not a Christian, obviously.

447
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,180
 He's a Israeli Jew.

448
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:28,640
 He's a historian, and he has written this pretty good book,

449
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,320
 'cause this book begins with some sort of presuppositions.

450
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:39,320
 The presupposition is that the four gospel,

451
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,820
 Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

452
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,200
 are quite reliable documents.

453
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:50,440
 So he started to investigate what is being told

454
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,360
 by the four gospels.

455
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,240
 Are they really eyewitnesses?

456
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:58,840
 Are they really historical accounts, reliable?

457
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,860
 We can trace back to the time of Jesus,

458
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,840
 and then he's tried to unearth other stuff

459
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,520
 and to match the evidence.

460
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,520
 Toward the end, he says,

461
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,800
 "There were different strange theories

462
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,960
 "having been put forward to explain away the empty tomb."

463
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,420
 But Gibson said, "They are all based on nonsense.

464
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:26,720
 "Archaeology and history cannot prove or disprove

465
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
 "the possibility that Jesus' body was smuggled out

466
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,280
 "by persons unknown, but this is a matter of speculation."

467
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:37,220
 Now here's the important point.

468
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:41,220
 The reality is there is no historical explanation

469
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,060
 for the empty tomb.

470
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:47,480
 Other than, now if you try to come up with different theories

471
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,700
 different ways to explain away the empty tomb,

472
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,700
 Gibson is saying, there's no way you can do that.

473
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:59,180
 Because there's no historical scientific explanation

474
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,760
 for the empty tomb.

475
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,680
 Unless you adopt the biblical reason.

476
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,160
 The biblical reason.

477
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,640
 The theological explanation.

478
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,480
 Which says, the resurrection.

479
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,480
 And he says, "I leave it up to the reader

480
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,900
 "to make up your mind."

481
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,380
 I find this very interesting conclusion, right?

482
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,800
 You can do historical inquiry

483
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,760
 of why the tomb is empty.

484
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,100
 Somebody stole the body,

485
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,160
 or maybe the disciple went to a wrong tomb,

486
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,180
 or something like that, right?

487
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:40,380
 You can explain away the empty tomb,

488
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,540
 but ultimately, there's no historical scientific ways

489
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:50,380
 to explain why the tomb was empty.

490
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,300
 There's no way.

491
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:56,420
 Because that goes beyond historical inquiry.

492
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,580
 That goes beyond all scientific knowledge can tell you.

493
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:04,680
 At the end of the day, you can only conclude

494
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:08,060
 that the tomb is actually empty.

495
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,460
 But why?

496
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:12,200
 When you talk about the reason,

497
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:15,540
 there's only one reason given by the Bible.

498
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,300
 Whether you accept it or not.

499
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:19,260
 It's a theological reason.

500
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,020
 That God raised Jesus from the dead, right?

501
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,380
 God raised Jesus from the dead.

502
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:26,360
 It's a miracle.

503
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,860
 It's something only God can do.

504
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,020
 But to accept that reason,

505
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,380
 you cannot stay in your own order of things.

506
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,660
 You cannot maintain your own worldview, so to speak.

507
00:27:38,660 --> 00:27:41,880
 All right, you have to change your own worldview radically

508
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:46,260
 in order to accept that biblical theological reason

509
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:50,340
 that God did something to the body of Jesus,

510
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,140
 raised him from the dead.

511
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,900
 And that worldview transformation

512
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:01,240
 is to say that, okay, I don't maintain my own

513
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,240
 closed universe, closed system kind of worldview.

514
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:11,720
 Reality is not just here, now, and something I can touch.

515
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,200
 Right, I can sense.

516
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,600
 It's not just that.

517
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:18,760
 There's a reality higher than the order of things

518
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:20,000
 that I can see.

519
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,880
 And that is a supernatural metaphysical reality.

520
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,560
 I think Gibson, I have to agree with Simone Gibson.

521
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:34,800
 You have to make up your mind

522
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:38,840
 whether you accept the theological reason or not.

523
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:43,000
 Now, I want to close today's message by quoting this verse.

524
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,060
 Galatians chapter two, verse 20.

525
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:51,400
 Paul says, "I have been crucified, the old self."

526
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:53,920
 Paul is talking about his old self.

527
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,680
 "I have been crucified with Christ,

528
00:28:55,680 --> 00:29:00,200
 "and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me."

529
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,640
 The new self.

530
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,840
 When you accept Jesus, there should be

531
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,080
 a fundamental change in our lives.

532
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,420
 Our attitude, our worldview,

533
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,560
 our perspective on order of things.

534
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,140
 Christ lives in me.

535
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:19,840
 The life I live, the new life I live in the body,

536
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,680
 I live by faith in the Son of God.

537
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,620
 And He loved me and gave Himself for me.

538
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:33,120
 This is no longer something out there,

539
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,640
 some objective fact or something that happened

540
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,280
 in the world, in time and space.

541
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,080
 Yes, that's true, historical fact,

542
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,680
 and Pontius Pilate, Jesus, the real guy,

543
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,760
 and all that stuff, empty tomb.

544
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,760
 It becomes a subjective experience.

545
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:52,080
 It becomes your own personal experience.

546
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:57,920
 Christianity, biblical faith, it's all about relationship.

547
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,640
 It is your relationship with Christ.

548
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,040
 But please understand, this sort of relationship

549
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:06,680
 is not just, "Oh, you know, patting my back,

550
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,420
 "and you'll be okay."

551
00:30:08,420 --> 00:30:12,800
 It's a radical transformation, how we see the world,

552
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,960
 and how we see ourselves.

553
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,280
 Well, I want to recite the Apostles' Creed together,

554
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,700
 and then we'll pray together.

555
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:22,160
 That's all we recite together.

556
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,320
 You all stand.

557
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:29,480
 Apostles' Creed.

558
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,600
 Let's recite together.

559
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,720
 I believe in God, the God Almighty,

560
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,560
 creator of heaven and earth.

561
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:39,120
 I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.

562
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,360
 He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit,

563
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,360
 and born of the Virgin Mary.

564
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,480
 He suffered under Pontius Pilate,

565
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,440
 was crucified, died, and was buried.

566
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,240
 He descended to the dead.

567
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,160
 On the third day, He rose again.

568
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,960
 He ascended into heaven,

569
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,920
 and is now seated at the right hand of the Father.

570
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,640
 He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

571
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:04,280
 I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy universal church,

572
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,120
 the communion of saints, the covenants of sin.

573
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:13,320
 Let's all pray.

574
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,600
 Father, I give you thanks for breaking into our reality,

575
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,720
 breaking into our world,

576
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,140
 to tell us that you are real,

577
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:27,240
 to tell us that you have done something mighty,

578
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,280
 something that is beyond our explanation

579
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,800
 in real time and real space.

580
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:35,760
 In history, you have come,

581
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,800
 and you die on the cross for our sins,

582
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,400
 and you rose from the dead

583
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,760
 to give us new hope and eternal life.

584
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,440
 Father, this new reality, may you help us to be reminded

585
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:50,020
 and to stand on it,

586
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:55,560
 to base our whole life on this foundation,

587
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,000
 knowing that your kingdom is eternal,

588
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,480
 and your kingdom will come.

589
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,560
 And we pray that your kingdom will come into our lives,

590
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,160
 change us gradually,

591
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:11,760
 radically transform us into the image of your Son.

592
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,240
 And thank you for the relationship that we have

593
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,960
 at the foot of the cross.

594
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:20,240
 Thank you for saving us and changing our identity.

595
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,320
 And we are your children.

596
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,280
 We are your sons and daughters.

597
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:29,000
 And may you use us, may you continue to change us

598
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,840
 into your Son's image.

599
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:35,160
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

600
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,160
 Well, you're dismissed.

601
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,960
 Thank you very much, and I will see you next Sunday,

602
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,040
 and worship God together.

603
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:51,040
