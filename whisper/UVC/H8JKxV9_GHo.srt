1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500
 - Thank you, James.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,000
 Thank you so much for the church members

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,420
 who express in their own ways

4
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:10,840
 to appreciate the pastoral staff.

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,340
 I want to tell you something,

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,840
 even though I'm a lead pastor,

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:21,580
 as of today, I have probably the best team

8
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:23,680
 of pastoral workers on my team,

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,380
 so I really appreciate their,

10
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,720
 they're always hardworking.

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,140
 I don't have to keep track of their time.

12
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:34,420
 They are always working more than they should,

13
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:36,620
 so I just want to give a shout out to them

14
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,780
 and really appreciate their hard work.

15
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:44,540
 Well, today, we are going to take a detour.

16
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,080
 We're not going to talk about Providence

17
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:49,240
 for maybe two weeks or so.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,580
 I think there are times we need to address

19
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:56,320
 and think about or reflect upon

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,780
 what is going on in the world,

21
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,080
 and we as Christians are being called to be peacemakers

22
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:05,920
 and to be the bearers of Christ's image in the world,

23
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,460
 so today, we take a short detour

24
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,500
 and think about and reflect upon

25
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,560
 what is going on in Israel-Palestine.

26
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,840
 As you know, Israel is probably

27
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,900
 kind of like my second home, all right?

28
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:19,900
 Kind of like my second home.

29
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,320
 Actually, I'm planning to go back,

30
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,260
 leading a tour in May next year.

31
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,300
 I hope everything will deescalate,

32
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,100
 at least in the next few weeks or next month or so,

33
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,100
 and so today's sermon is gonna be shorter

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,260
 because we have a fire drill.

35
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:41,740
 However, I wanna switch the topic and switch our gear

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,100
 to think about what is going on in this piece of land, Gaza.

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:48,300
 As you can see on the map,

38
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:53,100
 Gaza Strip is at the lower left corner

39
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,020
 of the long corridor of Israel,

40
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:59,420
 and you can see right there, there's a yellow line,

41
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:03,300
 and Gaza Strip is a small piece of land

42
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,980
 on the Mediterranean Sea along the coast

43
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:11,600
 and in the southern part of Israel.

44
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,300
 Israel-Hamas conflict has captured

45
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,100
 the attention of the world, that's for sure,

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,300
 and I'm sure you read many, many news stories

47
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:26,300
 and many horrible images and videos

48
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:29,060
 on what is going on and what Hamas has done

49
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:32,060
 to the Israelis on October 7th

50
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:37,060
 was just pure horrendous terrorist act,

51
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,940
 especially for the civilians.

52
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,060
 Countless, many, many Israelis were terrorized.

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,380
 Some, many of them are kidnapped,

54
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,220
 and it's horrible to just think about

55
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:52,580
 what had happened to them and what will happen to them.

56
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,420
 And now with a lot of airstrikes

57
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,820
 by the modern state of Israel,

58
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,620
 bombing and ground invasion

59
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,900
 has already taken place in Gaza.

60
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,480
 Thousands of people, including the Palestinians in Gaza,

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,260
 their lives are being threatened.

62
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,980
 Now, there's a danger, there's a danger.

63
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:18,020
 Whenever war breaks out,

64
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,460
 it's particularly in this area,

65
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:24,780
 and you don't want it to spill out into a regional conflict,

66
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:28,700
 and there is a possibility of this danger happening

67
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:31,860
 because in the northern border of Israel

68
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:36,860
 is the Hezbollah, another terrorist organization

69
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,900
 funded by Iran, and there were different political actors

70
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,580
 coming onto the scene,

71
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:48,740
 and if this conflict continues to rise,

72
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,740
 it will be a disaster for everyone, everyone,

73
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,340
 not just Israel, but mostly for the Palestinians.

74
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,960
 So we have to think about this topic

75
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,380
 because Israel-Gaza conflict seems far, far away.

76
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,380
 They are eight hours ahead of us.

77
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:09,700
 With the fallback, it's nine hours away from Chicago,

78
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:13,540
 but it hit home, even in the United States,

79
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:17,260
 because 13 days ago, October 16,

80
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:21,660
 hate crime was committed in Plainfield.

81
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,500
 Plainfield is 40 minutes away from Chicago.

82
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,500
 What happened was a landlord was overwhelmed

83
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,780
 by his fear for Muslims

84
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,900
 in light of what's going on in Gaza, Israel.

85
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:39,260
 He went into the home of a Palestinian family, a tenant,

86
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:44,260
 and he went inside and stabbed a six-year-old boy 26 times

87
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:50,300
 and murdered the boy on scene and wounded his mother.

88
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:57,300
 It's Islamophobia, right, because what is going on

89
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,300
 and what you read on the news stories and all that.

90
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,260
 And October 21, October 21,

91
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:10,140
 the president is a lady rabbi

92
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,980
 of a Jewish synagogue in Detroit.

93
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:17,800
 She was found fatally stabbed outside her home.

94
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,460
 Now, whether this was a hate crime, we don't know yet,

95
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,020
 but this tragic story is definitely the tip

96
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,980
 of the iceberg of antisemitism.

97
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,420
 It is on the rise.

98
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,100
 With my years of listening to stories

99
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,820
 from both sides, Israel and Palestine,

100
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,820
 I observed two things.

101
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:41,740
 I think there is one set of responses

102
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:46,140
 or one set of viewpoints that are not so helpful,

103
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,900
 and other set of viewpoints or perspectives

104
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,320
 perhaps more helpful.

105
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,320
 Whenever a conflict arise in this piece of land,

106
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:59,820
 people are very quick to go to Bible

107
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,340
 and biblical prophecies being fulfilled and all that stuff.

108
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,540
 I do not think this kind of perspective is helpful.

109
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:13,180
 Perhaps we need to study,

110
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,840
 that's why we need to study the Bible, right?

111
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,260
 That's why we need to study the Bible in context, right?

112
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,300
 I don't think it is so helpful

113
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,420
 when we just see what's going on in Israel, Palestine,

114
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,020
 and then we quickly flip the pages of the scripture,

115
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,820
 and then we find this prophecy fulfilled

116
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:31,420
 or this prophecy fulfilled, and this is going to happen,

117
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,260
 and this may happen.

118
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:37,380
 We have to examine carefully what the Bible claims

119
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:39,560
 according to its context.

120
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,900
 And I hope to address some of the popular viewpoints

121
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,140
 in this short detour.

122
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:49,500
 But let me make this clear.

123
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,360
 Wars are ugly and evil.

124
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,480
 Wars are ugly and evil.

125
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:01,740
 And we as Christians, especially we believe in Jesus Christ,

126
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,780
 we are to pray for those who suffer,

127
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:11,780
 and we are being called to do peacemaking, right?

128
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:18,220
 One of the most quoted Bible passages

129
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,380
 when people talk about the Israel-Palestine debate

130
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,700
 is Genesis 12.

131
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,500
 Genesis 12.

132
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:31,500
 Here the Lord, or God, is calling Abraham, or Abraham,

133
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,340
 and he said to him, "Leave your country, your people,

134
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,380
 "your father's household, and go to the land,"

135
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,220
 which is the land of Canaan, eventually,

136
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,920
 "and I will show you.

137
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:44,000
 "I will make you into a great nation,

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,840
 "and I will bless you.

139
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,260
 "I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing,

140
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,140
 "and I will bless those who bless you.

141
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:53,420
 "Whoever curses you, I will curse.

142
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:56,420
 "All the peoples on earth will be blessed through you."

143
00:07:56,420 --> 00:08:01,620
 Now, this passage has often been quoted

144
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,580
 as God's unconditional promise to Abraham,

145
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,860
 the land of Canaan.

146
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,980
 The land of Canaan is given to Abraham,

147
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,840
 the father of Israel,

148
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,480
 therefore, it's given to all of his descendants,

149
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,940
 and therefore, as sons and daughters of Abraham,

150
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,260
 you have the deed, you have the title

151
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,580
 to go into the land and take the land.

152
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:27,700
 This is what we call sometimes the Abrahamic covenant.

153
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,700
 It means God is making a covenant to Abraham

154
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,420
 and to his generations after him.

155
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:38,380
 And sometimes we quote this passage,

156
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:41,020
 and it seems to settle the entire debate

157
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,220
 of Israel-Palestine.

158
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:49,020
 The land belongs to Abraham and his generations after him

159
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,980
 being granted to this land unconditionally.

160
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:55,580
 And some would say this is God's land grant

161
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,620
 to Abraham, the father of Israel.

162
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,700
 But when you ask more questions,

163
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,560
 it doesn't seem very straightforward.

164
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:07,040
 It doesn't seem as straightforward as we expected.

165
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,680
 First, what do we mean by unconditional?

166
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:15,500
 Now, we use it almost like a cliche for us,

167
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,860
 unconditional, right?

168
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,900
 God's unconditional promise, unconditional blessing.

169
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:26,360
 But sometimes we just don't think enough, right?

170
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,540
 Now, if you think about the background of the Bible,

171
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:34,540
 all covenants take two parties,

172
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,640
 just like a marriage covenant, right?

173
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:42,640
 Marriage covenant takes two parties to work together, right?

174
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,020
 Take two people working together,

175
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,980
 committing themselves together.

176
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,820
 This is the covenant background of the Bible.

177
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,300
 So when we say God is making a covenant with Abraham,

178
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:57,100
 we have to think very, very careful.

179
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,260
 Is it when we say unconditional,

180
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:08,340
 are we talking about God is making a unilateral commitment?

181
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:13,980
 Meaning that God is gonna give Abraham this land

182
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:15,420
 no matter what he does.

183
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:20,020
 If he does bad, he still get the land.

184
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,980
 If he does good, he still get the land.

185
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,140
 Is that what we mean?

186
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,740
 Now, as you can see in the last line of the slide,

187
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,420
 I wanna do some grammar with you.

188
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:35,500
 I know we hate grammar, right?

189
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,820
 Hate all sorts of grammar, English grammar,

190
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,860
 Chinese grammar, or whatever grammar, right?

191
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,860
 Now, if you take into the original verbs of this verse,

192
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:49,740
 this passage, you find that some of the key verbs

193
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,940
 are cohortative.

194
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,300
 Now, what we mean by cohortative is that

195
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:59,300
 it's not so much of I promise you something, anything goes.

196
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,380
 No stranger attached.

197
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:06,820
 Cohortative can be translated, or more correctly translated,

198
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,380
 let me do this.

199
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,660
 Let me bless you.

200
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,180
 Let me make your name great.

201
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:19,180
 Now, cohortative seeks to communicate potentiality.

202
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:21,900
 That means there is a possibility,

203
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,540
 there's a potential situation we can reach, we can achieve.

204
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,540
 But let me do this, and you being cohortative

205
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:34,060
 and collaborate with me.

206
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,580
 So let me bless you, and you trust in me

207
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,020
 so that you will be a blessing.

208
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,860
 You see what I'm saying?

209
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:43,820
 There are two parties, right?

210
00:11:43,820 --> 00:11:46,300
 It's not a unilateral commitment.

211
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,100
 Let me bless you instead of I will bless you.

212
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,540
 Let me make your name great

213
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:55,420
 instead of I will make your name great no matter what.

214
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:59,820
 Now, that's a little bit grammar.

215
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:05,740
 And in fact, if you read this passage this way,

216
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,940
 it makes more sense when you read the entire story,

217
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,380
 the entire narrative of Abraham.

218
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,300
 In the book of Genesis, chapter 12 through 22,

219
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,460
 the entire journey of Abraham

220
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:22,060
 is that God is calling him out of Ur,

221
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:25,260
 and then he goes to the land of Canaan.

222
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:29,780
 If Abraham respond positively, faithfully,

223
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:34,780
 he can make this potential situation a reality.

224
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:41,060
 Only when he obey, then this becomes a reality.

225
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,020
 If he disobeys, if he detours,

226
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,260
 then there are some barriers.

227
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:51,180
 Something happened and put the covenant in jeopardy.

228
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,020
 Now, 12, one, two, three is this passage.

229
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,540
 You know what happened in verse four?

230
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,180
 12, verse four.

231
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,380
 Let me read this to you.

232
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:07,300
 Abraham went according to the word of God,

233
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,460
 according to whatever God said to him,

234
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,980
 which is verses one to three.

235
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,580
 So Abraham responded positively.

236
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:20,580
 And in the entire story, whenever Abraham acts obediently,

237
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:23,260
 the plan of God advances.

238
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:25,780
 Whenever Abraham does things on his own,

239
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,900
 with his own means, then the plan detours,

240
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:33,260
 and there's a threat to the promise of God.

241
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:38,260
 So all covenants in the Bible have two sides.

242
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:45,020
 Both sides, both parties, in this case, Abraham and God.

243
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:49,900
 Abraham's descendant, Israel, and God have to work together.

244
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:53,780
 Another theory, or another popular saying,

245
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:58,060
 is that this land promise was not fulfilled,

246
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:03,060
 was never fulfilled until 1948, the modern state of Israel.

247
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:08,580
 Now let's examine, or try to trace,

248
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,540
 the theme of land in the entire Bible.

249
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:16,460
 I told you many, many times, the Bible is a grand story,

250
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,260
 from Genesis, the first book, to Revelation, the last book,

251
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,860
 Old Testament and the New Testament.

252
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,980
 It's a continuous grand story, grand narrative,

253
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:29,620
 to tell us what God has done in human history,

254
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,260
 in the midst of us.

255
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,700
 From the first book to the last book, it's a grand story.

256
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,340
 So there are different themes in the Bible

257
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,740
 that was introduced in the beginning,

258
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:42,500
 and you'll find that when you trace it,

259
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,900
 it will develop and it will evolve into something

260
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,860
 or becomes a reality.

261
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,820
 And as we know, all the themes,

262
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,180
 all the major themes in the Bible introduced

263
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:58,100
 in the beginning, including the land promise,

264
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:03,100
 find its ultimate fulfillment in Jesus Christ,

265
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,420
 in Christ our Lord.

266
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,540
 So you have to be sensitive when you read the Bible,

267
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,340
 you cannot pick and choose.

268
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:13,540
 You have to read a passage and know where the passage fits

269
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:16,660
 in the entire narrative of the Bible.

270
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,140
 So as the Bible story develops,

271
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,220
 the sons of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,

272
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,220
 they went down to Egypt and soldiered there for 100 years.

273
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:27,020
 And eventually God was gracious

274
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,380
 and God was faithful to his promise.

275
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,380
 And he called Moses and led the people of Israel

276
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:39,420
 out of Egypt, that was the Exodus, right?

277
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,620
 And then they came out of Egypt and end up in wilderness

278
00:15:43,620 --> 00:15:47,380
 for 40 years and they did not go to the land.

279
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:50,540
 They did not get to enter the land because of their rebellion.

280
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:55,240
 The first generation did not enter the land except Moses.

281
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,940
 Even Moses did not enter the land of Kingdom,

282
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,420
 except two guys.

283
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,260
 Who are they?

284
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:07,140
 Caleb and Josh, right?

285
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,940
 Caleb and Josh, right?

286
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,380
 They are the only two guy from the first generation

287
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:17,020
 of Exodus had the blessing to enter the land.

288
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,540
 And then with the second generation

289
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,180
 who were born in the wilderness.

290
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,660
 So finally, under the leadership of Joshua,

291
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,820
 they went into the land, the new generation,

292
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:28,740
 the second generation of faithful Israelites,

293
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,740
 they went in and they inherited the blessing of God

294
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:36,860
 because they put their faith in God.

295
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:38,780
 Again, there's a conditionality there.

296
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:43,140
 There is a criteria there.

297
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:46,300
 And the criteria is trust in God

298
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,700
 and you will inherit God's blessing.

299
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,340
 So as we turn to the end of the book of Joshua,

300
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,460
 we see this text.

301
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:58,440
 So the Lord gave Israel all the land he has sworn

302
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:02,820
 to give their forefathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

303
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,740
 They took possession of it and settled down there.

304
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,860
 The Lord gave them rest on every side,

305
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,780
 just as he has sworn to their forefathers.

306
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,820
 Not one of their enemies withstood them.

307
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,140
 The Lord hand all their enemies over them.

308
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,440
 45, very important, 45.

309
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,260
 Not one of all the Lord's good promises

310
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,600
 to the house of Israel failed.

311
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,760
 Not one failed.

312
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,660
 Everyone was fulfilled.

313
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:38,220
 Doesn't get as clear as this.

314
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,700
 Everyone is fulfilled.

315
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,900
 Every promise, not even one word,

316
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,860
 not even one word to the house of Israel failed.

317
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,480
 Everything is fulfilled.

318
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,720
 The land promise was fulfilled.

319
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,580
 Now before Joshua passed away,

320
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,980
 he also warned the people of God,

321
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:02,540
 the people of Israel, 23 verse 14.

322
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,700
 I'm about to go the way of all the earth

323
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,940
 and you know all my heart and all my soul

324
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,020
 and not one of all the good promises

325
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,160
 the Lord your God gave you has failed.

326
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,380
 Every promise has been fulfilled.

327
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:20,020
 Not one has failed.

328
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,180
 You keep on going, 16.

329
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,740
 There was a condition there.

330
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,660
 So now you settle down in the land.

331
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,420
 Now you get the blessing, right?

332
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:30,300
 However, there was also a condition.

333
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,900
 If you obey the commandment of God,

334
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:36,380
 the covenant of God, then you will stay.

335
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:39,380
 You will enjoy the presence of God, his blessing.

336
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:41,700
 But if you violate, verse 16,

337
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:43,380
 the covenant of the Lord your God,

338
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,980
 which he commanded you and go and serve other gods

339
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,300
 and bow down and worship them,

340
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,680
 the Lord's anger will burn against you.

341
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:52,180
 You will quickly perish from the good land

342
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,220
 he has given you.

343
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:59,640
 See, the land is not a free giveaway, you know.

344
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:02,940
 It doesn't seem that way, right?

345
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,500
 Even within the Old Testament,

346
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,380
 we are by the way in the sixth book of the Old Testament.

347
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,380
 Genesis to Deuteronomy, the Torah, five books.

348
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:17,980
 This is the book following the Torah.

349
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,020
 And people of God are expected to live faithfully.

350
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,580
 If they violate the covenant,

351
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:28,140
 they will be driven out of the land.

352
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,020
 Remember the original people in the land of Canaan,

353
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:36,100
 the Canaanites, the Amorites,

354
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:39,660
 they were driven out of the land because what?

355
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:44,660
 Because their sin has reached its full measure.

356
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,920
 That's why God is driving them out, right?

357
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:53,240
 Now, as if the Bible is not clear about the fulfillment

358
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:56,520
 of the land promise to Abraham in the Old Testament,

359
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,960
 the Bible continues to remind us.

360
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:03,000
 Again, we trace that theme beyond the book of Joshua

361
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,680
 and we come to 1 Kings.

362
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:08,640
 This is the time of David and Solomon.

363
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,640
 1 Kings 4.20, the people of Judah and Israel,

364
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,400
 they were now 12 tribes united as numerous

365
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,100
 as the sand on the seashore.

366
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,560
 They ate and they drank and they were happy.

367
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:26,080
 Solomon, the king, ruled over all the kingdoms

368
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,080
 from the river, Euphrates, to the land of Philistine,

369
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,320
 as far as the border of Egypt.

370
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,720
 All these countries brought trouble

371
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,820
 and were Solomon's subjects all his life.

372
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,260
 Keep on going.

373
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:46,660
 In the dedication prayer of the first temple,

374
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,060
 Solomon said, "Praise be to the Lord,

375
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,660
 who has given rest to his people Israel

376
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,260
 just as he promised."

377
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,860
 Not one, again, this phrase again,

378
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:00,620
 "Not one word has failed of all the good promises

379
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:04,940
 God gave to his servant Moses."

380
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:10,220
 It seems clear that the land promise

381
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,820
 however you want to describe it,

382
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,220
 conditional or unconditional,

383
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,700
 however you describe it,

384
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,660
 God's promise, the land promise,

385
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:26,420
 is already fulfilled within the time of Old Testament.

386
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:28,180
 By the time of Solomon,

387
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:32,340
 all the promises have fulfilled.

388
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:33,180
 Have fulfilled.

389
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:37,800
 That's why when they settle down in the land,

390
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:41,520
 the Israelites are being warned again and again,

391
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,060
 they need to be faithful to the covenant.

392
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:47,400
 They need to exercise their faith and trust in God

393
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,180
 so that they can enjoy the good land,

394
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,480
 enjoy the presence of God.

395
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,000
 If they don't, if they are faithless,

396
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,520
 then they will be kicked out.

397
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:02,600
 And that's why eventually they went into exile, right?

398
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,640
 That's how the Old Testament story goes, right?

399
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,360
 Again and again in the Torah or in other verses,

400
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,680
 God warned the people of Israel,

401
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,440
 when you settle down in the land,

402
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,720
 when you enjoy the presence of God,

403
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,000
 you have to do something and to be faithful to the covenant,

404
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,400
 faithful to the commandment of God.

405
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:26,400
 One of them is to not mistreat an alien or oppress him.

406
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,520
 For you were aliens in Egypt.

407
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:33,600
 You had that experience before, right?

408
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,520
 And so you don't oppress other people

409
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,880
 with a similar situation.

410
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,380
 It's kind of like us.

411
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:42,680
 Some of us are immigrants, right?

412
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,520
 We come to this land, we come to this place.

413
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:51,840
 Sometimes, you know, sadly, we oppress other people, right?

414
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,920
 Remember when you first came to the United States,

415
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,400
 it was a tough time, right?

416
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,040
 I used to work in a restaurant,

417
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:05,380
 just do dishes for 10 hours a day,

418
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:09,840
 cold water, no dish washing machine.

419
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:13,640
 Working in the restaurant 10 hours a day, right?

420
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,020
 It was really, really tough, right?

421
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:22,240
 Because I, you know, I don't come from a rich family, right?

422
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,720
 I have to work my butt off, right?

423
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,800
 If I turn around, now I'm settled down, right?

424
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,960
 If I turn around and oppress other people,

425
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:33,200
 this is really sad.

426
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,060
 Exodus 22, do not mistreat an alien

427
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:41,940
 because you used to be an alien in Egypt

428
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,300
 and you were oppressed.

429
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,660
 That's why you need to treat them kindly, right?

430
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:51,660
 That's part of the terms within the covenant.

431
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:58,700
 Leviticus 18, it says, "Even the land was defiled."

432
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,140
 Now, it was talking about the Canaanite,

433
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,960
 the people before Israel took over the land of Canaan.

434
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,260
 So God said, "I punish them for a sin.

435
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:14,260
 "And the land vomited out its inhabitants."

436
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:18,520
 And now you guys, the Israelites, 26,

437
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,880
 "You must keep my decrees and my laws.

438
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,180
 "The native born, the aliens living among you

439
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:28,320
 "must not do any of these detestable things."

440
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,520
 You know, in the context above,

441
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:36,020
 God has been listing out all the detestable,

442
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:39,000
 sinful things the Canaanite have done.

443
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:43,140
 The Israelites are being warned not to follow them.

444
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,480
 Verse 27, "For all these things were done

445
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:48,100
 "by the people who lived in the land before you,

446
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,220
 "and the land became defiled."

447
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:54,540
 And if now, if now, if you defile the land,

448
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:57,460
 the land is like a person, right?

449
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:02,460
 Vomiting out, just like it vomit out the nations before you.

450
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,140
 So you have to keep the covenant.

451
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,500
 Chapter 20, 22, "Keep all my decrees and laws,

452
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:17,260
 "follow them, so that the land where I'm bringing you

453
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,920
 "to live may not vomit you out.

454
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:25,280
 "You must not live according to the custom of nations

455
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,680
 "I'm going to drive out before you,

456
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:31,440
 "because they did all these things I abhorred them."

457
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:36,980
 The land, if you wanna live in there,

458
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,140
 if you wanna enjoy the blessing of God,

459
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:45,180
 if you disobey, you will be vomited out, right?

460
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,880
 If you don't act kindly to other people,

461
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,880
 if you become the oppressors, you will be kicked out, right?

462
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,020
 There's a conditionality there, there is a condition there.

463
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,860
 And why?

464
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,940
 Why is there a condition,

465
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,380
 if the land is given to the Israelites?

466
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:10,020
 Well, I think 25, 23 from the book of Leviticus

467
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,200
 answer this question.

468
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:17,040
 And the answer is, "The land must not be sold permanently,

469
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:20,740
 "because the land of Canaan," God said, "is mine,

470
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,840
 "and you are.

471
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,920
 "But aliens and my tenants,

472
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:33,340
 "you don't own the land," God said.

473
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:37,340
 I own the land, God owns the land.

474
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,340
 And the people of God are being blessed to enter the land,

475
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:49,500
 but they are called to be faithful tenants in the land.

476
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,760
 So let me sum up a little bit

477
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,980
 and give you a little bit more perspective

478
00:26:54,980 --> 00:27:00,800
 on whatever we hear from the modern conflict.

479
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:05,300
 Number one, the land promise was fulfilled

480
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:09,640
 in the Old Testament, in the time of David and Solomon.

481
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,680
 Not one word failed, remember?

482
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:14,360
 God has been faithful.

483
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:17,340
 Number two, God owns the land.

484
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:21,500
 The people of God do not own the land.

485
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,660
 They are simply tenants.

486
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:27,960
 Number three, living in the land is an opportunity

487
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,280
 for the people of God to testify the goodness of God.

488
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,120
 They live in the land of Canaan,

489
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,880
 so that they can tell the world, the nations around them,

490
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,460
 how good God is.

491
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,840
 Number four, security in the land depends on your loyalty,

492
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:49,000
 your faith to God's promise.

493
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,200
 Number four, land in the Old Testament

494
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:59,200
 is a foreshadow of life in Christ.

495
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:03,220
 Put it simply, whenever you read the Old Testament,

496
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:08,360
 by what we did, you find the people of Israel

497
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,800
 living in the land of Canaan.

498
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:13,200
 You sum it up as life in the land,

499
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:19,200
 but they are only the first theme being introduced.

500
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,660
 The theme keeps on developing.

501
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:28,240
 And when we come to Jesus Christ, our Lord,

502
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:32,220
 He came and He accomplished the salvation.

503
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,120
 He obeyed God to the end, and He died on the cross

504
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,840
 for your sin and for my sin.

505
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,000
 He was the perfect Israelite,

506
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,900
 the perfect covenant-keeping Israelite.

507
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:49,000
 And He was faithful to the covenant,

508
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,520
 and He did it on behalf of us.

509
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:56,520
 So when you read something in the Old Testament

510
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,360
 about the land, it's life in the land,

511
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:01,280
 how they should live in the land.

512
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:05,280
 It points to life in Christ.

513
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,680
 In the Old Testament, it was life in the land.

514
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,760
 In the New Testament, now, today,

515
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,240
 since the land promise is already fulfilled,

516
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,920
 and it's fulfilled in Christ,

517
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:22,440
 life in the land points to life in Christ.

518
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,440
 See, it's the same way.

519
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:28,640
 If we want to have the blessing in Christ,

520
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:33,640
 if we want to enjoy the joy and peace and love and harmony

521
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:37,520
 we have or promise from Scripture in Christ,

522
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,560
 we are also being called to be faithful.

523
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,520
 We have to exercise our faith

524
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,400
 in order to enjoy all these things.

525
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,520
 We can live in the land, live in Christ,

526
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,160
 enjoy His blessing and His presence

527
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:56,200
 only if we are faithful, right?

528
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,760
 Therefore, in the New Testament,

529
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,520
 it keeps on encouraging us

530
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:05,280
 that since Christ already fulfilled His covenant,

531
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:09,680
 fulfilled the salvation to save all of us,

532
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:14,380
 that's why in Christ we need to continue to follow Him.

533
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,220
 We need to continue to be faithful.

534
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,740
 Let me close by citing this verse,

535
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:21,540
 and I want to take this verse seriously.

536
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,900
 2 Corinthians 1:20.

537
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:29,020
 For no matter how many promises God has made,

538
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:32,260
 they are yes in Christ.

539
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:38,540
 So through Christ, the amen is spoken by us

540
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:41,880
 to the glory of God.

541
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,740
 You realize you speak Hebrew?

542
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:49,200
 We speak Hebrew because whenever we pray,

543
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:51,920
 we end with amen, right?

544
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,420
 What is that?

545
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:56,960
 Amen is a Hebrew word, meaning yes,

546
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:01,900
 meaning definitely, meaning truthfully.

547
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,340
 And what we find the truth,

548
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:05,880
 what we find the amen is in Christ

549
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:10,460
 because He did the covenant loyalty for all of us

550
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:13,940
 so that we, all of us,

551
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,380
 if we begin our faith in Christ,

552
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,600
 we are part of God's people,

553
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,260
 but we are being called to trust in Jesus our Lord.

554
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,140
 And only when we trust in Him,

555
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:28,200
 only when we are truly born again in Christ,

556
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,740
 then we can experience the grace of God,

557
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,580
 the blessing of God.

558
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:36,020
 And church, I want to encourage you today.

559
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:42,900
 Since we have such a huge blessing in Christ,

560
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,300
 therefore we press on.

561
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:50,660
 We need to continue to put our faith in Jesus our Lord.

562
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:54,580
 Put our faith in Him and continue to obey

563
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:58,460
 and trust in Jesus Christ our Lord.

564
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,300
 Amen?

565
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,340
 Let's pray together.

566
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:07,100
 Father, thank you for your son, Jesus Christ.

567
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:12,100
 He has done the covenant of faith

568
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,900
 and covenant all the promises we found on the cross.

569
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:20,580
 Thank you for sending your son to die on the cross

570
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,840
 and rose from the dead.

571
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,880
 And he's the true covenant keeper.

572
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,100
 And thank you for sending your Messiah,

573
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,300
 your Lord to save us,

574
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:32,900
 save us from sin, from death.

575
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,000
 And I pray that as your church,

576
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,380
 as brother and sister in Christ,

577
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:41,800
 we not only begin in Christ with faith,

578
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,720
 but we'll continue our faith in you.

579
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:49,400
 And help us as we face different challenges

580
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:54,400
 and different problems and different issues in our lives.

581
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,200
 We turn our eyes to you

582
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,800
 and we continue to follow and obey you.

583
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,640
 Thank you for being our faithful God.

584
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:07,000
 May you continue to help us to be faithful,

585
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,680
 to serve you, to worship you,

586
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,360
 to follow our Lord Jesus Christ.

587
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
 in Christ's name we pray.
