1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 - So we have our pastor, Pastor Mark,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,920
 who's gonna give our sermon today.

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,760
 - Thanks, Annie, thank you.

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:09,800
 Well, we continue to ponder on this important question,

5
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,080
 how to build, how to grow a healthy church.

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,580
 Again, we were at studying the book of 1 Corinthians.

7
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:23,220
 We were at chapter 12,

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:29,220
 and last week we studied the love poem of chapter 13.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:34,260
 So today, let us turn to 1 Corinthians 14, all right?

10
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,680
 So these three chapters are the Trinity chapters.

11
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,200
 Three chapters together, 12, 13, and 14,

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,980
 addressing the use of spiritual gifts.

13
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,620
 And actually, there was a bigger picture in mind.

14
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,900
 Paul is talking about church as a human body,

15
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,900
 as an analogy, that we are all different parts

16
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:57,780
 of this whole body, building up the body of Christ.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:01,660
 And then 13, as you remember, the famous love poem,

18
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,480
 love is patient, love is kind,

19
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,480
 to help us to get a right orientation

20
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:10,980
 of how to use our talents and our gifts

21
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,100
 to build up the church.

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:17,340
 And now we are at chapter 14.

23
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,000
 And let me begin by reading the passage.

24
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,300
 And there are two points in this chapter, chapter 14.

25
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,260
 First is the importance of sound biblical teaching

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,700
 for growing a healthy church.

27
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,000
 That's the first point.

28
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,180
 The second point is the value,

29
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:37,360
 the value of sound biblical teaching.

30
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:44,180
 As I have reminded you, what a church should look like

31
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:47,560
 and what a church should be,

32
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,340
 is not our preferences or our opinions.

33
00:01:51,340 --> 00:01:54,620
 It is not our suggestions that matter.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,260
 The end of the day is the word of God,

35
00:01:57,260 --> 00:02:02,100
 the final authority of God's revelation, the Bible.

36
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,860
 We come back to the Bible, we turn to the scripture

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:09,380
 and see what God has to say about our church,

38
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:11,120
 about church in general.

39
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,740
 So 14, verse one,

40
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:16,660
 Paul is dealing with the use of spiritual gifts,

41
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:20,700
 especially the gift of speaking in tongues,

42
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,460
 speaking in unknown language.

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,820
 14, one, pay attention.

44
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:28,820
 Paul says, "Let love be your highest goal,

45
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,100
 "but you should also desire the special abilities

46
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,980
 "or spiritual gifts the Spirit,

47
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,060
 "the Holy Spirit gives to all of us,

48
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,920
 "especially the ability to prophesy.

49
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,520
 "For if you have the ability to speak in tongues,

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:45,080
 "you will be talking only to God,

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,080
 "since people won't be able to understand you.

52
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,060
 "You will be speaking by the power of the Spirit,

53
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,480
 "but it will all be mysterious.

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,040
 "But one who prophesies,

55
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,800
 "who has the spiritual gifts of prophesying,

56
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,400
 "strengthens others, encourages others,

57
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,860
 "and comforts others."

58
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,740
 So Paul is making a contrast

59
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,980
 between the gift of speaking,

60
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,120
 well, how does the NLT translate it?

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,780
 Speaking in tongues, right?

62
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:21,300
 Or speaking in unknown language.

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,740
 He's contrasting one set of spiritual gifts,

64
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:27,460
 speaking in tongues or in unknown language.

65
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,740
 And then the other one is prophesying,

66
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:34,100
 speaking prophecy, you know, prophesying.

67
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,760
 So from this passage,

68
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,020
 we understand not all spiritual gifts are equal.

69
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:46,780
 Yes, the Holy Spirit will grant us different abilities

70
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,560
 or talents in the church,

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,020
 different members or different brother and sister,

72
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,700
 they have this set of gifts,

73
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:56,820
 or he has this set of abilities or talents,

74
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,600
 but not all spiritual gifts are of same importance.

75
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,020
 Why?

76
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,560
 Now, some of the spiritual gifts are obviously stronger,

77
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,460
 according to Paul.

78
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,740
 Why does Paul say that?

79
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:13,340
 Because the Corinthian Christians,

80
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,460
 they were desiring, they want,

81
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:21,080
 or they're yearning for some sort of spectacular gifts.

82
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,720
 You know, speaking in tongues,

83
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
 or speaking in unknown language, right,

84
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,960
 mysterious language, seems to them,

85
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,440
 the Corinthian Christians,

86
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,120
 would be something they wanna strive for,

87
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:37,640
 they wanna pray for, and they want that kind of gifts.

88
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:42,640
 And that sort of gifts probably look more spiritual to them,

89
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,400
 or look more supernatural to them,

90
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,400
 more spectacular to them.

91
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:52,760
 But, you know, as Paul has emphasized

92
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,560
 throughout these chapters,

93
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,600
 the Word of God is the standard.

94
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,100
 When we return to the scripture

95
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,840
 and see what the Bible has to say about spiritual gifts,

96
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,960
 even though we are not part of that charismatic tradition.

97
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
 So what is Paul saying?

98
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,600
 Paul is saying, he has nothing against speaking in tongue.

99
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:18,760
 He has nothing against that sort of spiritual gifts.

100
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,860
 Some people will speak in tongue

101
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,920
 because the sovereignty of the Holy Spirit,

102
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:26,400
 God has granted them this sort of abilities.

103
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,700
 But Paul seems to be doing something here.

104
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,460
 He deprioritize, you know,

105
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,400
 try to put some of the gifts,

106
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,880
 especially speaking in tongue, to a lower priority.

107
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:43,840
 He elevate some of the gifts

108
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,840
 the Christians in Corinth were not seeking,

109
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,160
 the gift of prophecy.

110
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,100
 Now, what does it mean?

111
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,300
 Okay, let's continue.

112
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,600
 Verse five, he says,

113
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,520
 "I wish you could all speak in tongues,

114
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,980
 "but even more, I wish you could all prophesy,

115
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,980
 "for prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues.

116
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,720
 "Unless someone is here in the public service,

117
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,000
 "when someone is speaking in tongues,

118
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,320
 "someone interprets what you're saying,

119
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,240
 "so that the whole church will be strengthened."

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,660
 Now, as you can tell,

121
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:24,260
 he is definitely not against speaking in tongue in general.

122
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,360
 But he said there was a greater gift,

123
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,200
 greater spiritual talent that has to be used

124
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,180
 when the church gathers, and that is the gift of prophecy.

125
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,020
 Now, what is prophecy?

126
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,440
 If you remember, I told you before,

127
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,540
 prophecy is not weather forecast, right?

128
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,040
 It was snowing outside, right?

129
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,080
 Right, it was snowing outside.

130
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,120
 Prophecy, in general, in the Bible,

131
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,960
 has nothing to do with weather forecast,

132
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,600
 whether it was snow at 3 p.m. today, 3.30 p.m. today,

133
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:59,200
 whether the forecast is correct or not.

134
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,000
 It has nothing to do with it.

135
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,700
 Prophecy, in the Bible, is not so much prediction.

136
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,540
 It's about preaching.

137
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,140
 It's about speaking the word of God

138
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:16,320
 according to the final standard of Scripture.

139
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,080
 Authoritative preaching, you can translate that.

140
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,420
 Prophecy is stronger according to Paul,

141
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,200
 because it trains your mind.

142
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,700
 You know, when the questions in Corinth,

143
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,940
 when they gather, you can imagine,

144
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,940
 like, say, we are the church in Corinth.

145
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,400
 Most of the people, they were looking forward

146
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,360
 to speak in tongue.

147
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,360
 Somehow, this Holy Spirit touches them

148
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,040
 and give them the spiritual ability

149
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,240
 to speak in mysterious language

150
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,940
 so that they can draw closer to God.

151
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,560
 But Paul is saying, by exercising those gifts,

152
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,940
 speaking in tongue, you are drawing closer to God

153
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,760
 only by yourself.

154
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,400
 And that's why that sort of gift, speaking in tongue,

155
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,360
 is lower in priority.

156
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:08,080
 What is higher in priority is that when the church gathers,

157
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:13,080
 preaching, biblical teaching, has the higher priority.

158
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,480
 When you come to church,

159
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,080
 when you come to a worship gathering,

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,080
 Paul says you need to seek for the gift

161
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,460
 of biblical teaching,

162
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,960
 the gift of sound doctrine,

163
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,560
 the gift of training our mind.

164
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,340
 Because some of the people, when they are preaching,

165
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,120
 when they're explaining the word of God,

166
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,720
 they're expounding on the word of God,

167
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,200
 everyone else would understand, right?

168
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,560
 See, for example here, I'm using a language

169
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,940
 that everybody can understand, right?

170
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:54,240
 Otherwise, your mind will not be trained,

171
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,340
 and you will not be able to understand it.

172
00:08:56,340 --> 00:09:02,320
 I am speaking a common language everyone can understand.

173
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,120
 If you cannot understand, there is a radio to translate.

174
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,600
 That's why we take this so seriously.

175
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,080
 We prepare the script, we prepare the sermon,

176
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:15,320
 and we prepare some teaching,

177
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,320
 drawn from the Holy Scripture.

178
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,720
 Because when the church gather together,

179
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,460
 Paul is saying we need to know

180
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:30,520
 and understand the will of God.

181
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,460
 It trains your mind, doesn't it?

182
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,960
 Now, a question for you.

183
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:39,600
 Do you think your mind, your thinking,

184
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,000
 matters to God?

185
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:48,220
 You think having an intellectual mind,

186
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,280
 a sound, rational mind, right thinking,

187
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,960
 about the teaching of God, about the world,

188
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,520
 about the Bible, about our lives,

189
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,960
 you think those things matter to God?

190
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,080
 They matter to God, right?

191
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,480
 They matter to God.

192
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,480
 The ability to discern, the ability to think critically,

193
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:14,440
 the ability to examine things rationally,

194
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:18,440
 these things matter to God.

195
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,800
 They matter to God.

196
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,880
 So much that Paul is saying there's importance,

197
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,760
 utmost importance.

198
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,960
 When the church gathers together,

199
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:31,760
 we need to understand the teaching of the Bible.

200
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:35,760
 That's why he elevate one set of gifts over the other.

201
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,680
 Speaking of tongues, that's nice, Paul says.

202
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:43,100
 But this is for your own private fellowship with God.

203
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,120
 Because nobody understand what you're saying.

204
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,180
 When the church gathers, everyone has to understand

205
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,840
 what we are talking about, what we are thinking about.

206
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,740
 So the ability to discern and ability to use our mind

207
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:57,380
 correctly, to think about things critically,

208
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,340
 these things matter to God.

209
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:05,580
 These are not the monopoly of some of the scholars,

210
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:10,980
 some of the intellectualists among us, right?

211
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,360
 There are some PhD students here.

212
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,940
 What they're talking about, we don't understand, right?

213
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:17,060
 (audience laughing)

214
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,540
 What they're doing, no clue, right?

215
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:23,740
 But let me say this, right thinking,

216
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,260
 right thinking, in order to think critically

217
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,260
 and to discern things, truth and error,

218
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:35,580
 these are important things to God.

219
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,880
 These are very important.

220
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,380
 So not only biblical teaching,

221
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,420
 some biblical teaching is important.

222
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:45,420
 Secondly, my point is, it is of value, all right?

223
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,560
 Everyone should watch this documentary on Netflix.

224
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:55,540
 It's a horrible, horrible thing to watch.

225
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,580
 I haven't watched it yet, all right?

226
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,220
 It's called "In the Name of God, Holy Betrayal."

227
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,060
 Now it's a very, it's a big hit these days

228
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:08,060
 because it was released March 3rd, only a few days ago.

229
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,120
 It was released on Netflix.

230
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:17,120
 It's a documentary series exposing the biggest cult

231
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:20,540
 in Korea, the Big Four.

232
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:24,180
 Now, as I said, I don't have time to watch it yet,

233
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,840
 but I will watch it.

234
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:28,300
 Have you ever watched it?

235
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,220
 Anyone?

236
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,540
 No?

237
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:31,540
 You're scared to watch it

238
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,580
 or you just don't have time to watch it?

239
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,100
 You should watch it, you should watch it.

240
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,100
 Because this documentary series has many episodes.

241
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:50,080
 It exposed the cult leaders in Korea.

242
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,520
 It's very interesting, it's very intriguing

243
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,360
 that all these cult leaders,

244
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,680
 they were able to attract thousands

245
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,840
 and thousands of followers.

246
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,260
 And according to this documentary series,

247
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:08,200
 this cult leaders in Korea, or even all over the world,

248
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,800
 because they plant churches, different groups,

249
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,880
 all over the world,

250
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,520
 they attract thousands and thousands of college students.

251
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,800
 Can you believe that?

252
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,520
 I mean, listen, let me tell you one of the quote

253
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,720
 from this series.

254
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,720
 One of the cult leaders used to say to his followers,

255
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:33,020
 and I quote, "Do you know who I am?

256
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,300
 "I bet you don't.

257
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,760
 "Well, I am the Messiah.

258
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,200
 "You don't need to search for God.

259
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,840
 "If you can't see God, look at me."

260
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:49,480
 These are some of the things that the cult leaders

261
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,840
 used to say to his followers.

262
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,240
 Thousands and thousands, tens of thousands of followers.

263
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,120
 "Look at me, I am God."

264
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,440
 It's very interesting to me because

265
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,400
 I just cannot understand why this sort of teaching

266
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,920
 would attract such a following,

267
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,840
 even among college students.

268
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:21,120
 Now, college students are supposed to be not so dumb,

269
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,080
 'cause they got into colleges.

270
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:28,260
 They must have some intellectual ability to discern

271
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,540
 in order to get themselves into campuses.

272
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,800
 It's just very intriguing to me.

273
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,320
 Many, many of the followers of this cult

274
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,880
 in Korea and around the world,

275
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,680
 they would follow wrong teachings,

276
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,020
 obviously false teachings.

277
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:54,480
 And I encourage you to watch this documentary

278
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,680
 to think with me, to ponder with me.

279
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,840
 What is going on?

280
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,680
 What is going on?

281
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,680
 Remember what Jesus said.

282
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,040
 He said, "Love the Lord with all your heart

283
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,480
 "and all your mind."

284
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,600
 You got to use your mind when you follow Christ.

285
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
 God expects us to use our mind.

286
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,160
 And our mind with the right thinking,

287
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,120
 to think critically, to discern,

288
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,800
 is pleasing to Him.

289
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,460
 It's pleasing to God.

290
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,880
 To discern and to understand what is going on,

291
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,120
 what is true and what is not.

292
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,760
 Christians, with all your mind,

293
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,040
 should be able to grow in this sense,

294
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,520
 to think logically, to think rationally,

295
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,200
 should make decisions wisely and critically.

296
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,920
 This is all expected in our Christian discipleship.

297
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,080
 Because our faith is not blind faith.

298
00:15:56,080 --> 00:16:00,360
 Our faith is reasonable faith.

299
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,620
 It can be justified.

300
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,220
 It's the right thinking that matters to God.

301
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:12,400
 Now, as I read some of the basic information

302
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:16,080
 before I watched the documentary series,

303
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:22,480
 I quote some of the obviously wrong false teachings

304
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,660
 from all these cult leaders.

305
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:31,700
 As I said, I find it very, very troubling.

306
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,840
 Students, you know, college students

307
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,520
 would fall into those traps, right?

308
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,320
 Because if you think about it,

309
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,080
 if you have the mind to really study

310
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,560
 and to discern, to think critically,

311
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,120
 you quickly will come to some of the scriptures

312
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,440
 obviously stated in the Bible

313
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,560
 that you can quickly tell

314
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:02,300
 these leaders are not teaching sound doctrine.

315
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:07,240
 For example, Matthew 24,

316
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,960
 when Jesus was talking about the last days,

317
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:13,720
 he told his disciples, "In the last days,

318
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:16,360
 "don't let anyone mislead you,

319
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:19,360
 "for many will come in my name,

320
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,440
 "claiming I am the Messiah,

321
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,960
 "and they will deceive many."

322
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,740
 See, if you use your mind and use your brain

323
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:30,400
 to just flip some of the pages in the Bible,

324
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,180
 you quickly can tell who is telling the truth

325
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,540
 and who is not.

326
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:38,600
 How could this educate people

327
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,000
 by this kind of lies, right?

328
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,080
 I just cannot understand.

329
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,580
 I mean, do you have an answer?

330
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:48,000
 I don't have an answer yet.

331
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:53,840
 Now, for many people who observe

332
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,820
 this terrible things and horrible things happening

333
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:01,280
 in people who use the name of God to deceive people,

334
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:05,500
 some of the people who are observers,

335
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,980
 kind of outsiders,

336
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,540
 they probably will conclude that,

337
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,900
 okay, all right, they will just abandon faith altogether.

338
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,180
 They will just abandon the Bible altogether

339
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:18,540
 or religion altogether in general.

340
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,300
 Because, see, some of the cult leaders

341
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,620
 using the name of God, the name of religion,

342
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,320
 to deceive many people and do horrible things, right?

343
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:31,180
 They will conclude that this is no use.

344
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,500
 I will just abandon God.

345
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,500
 I will just abandon the Bible altogether.

346
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,740
 But again, if you think about it,

347
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:42,740
 such conclusion is actually irrational, right?

348
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:48,960
 Because somebody misused the name of God

349
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:52,880
 doesn't mean God is useless, right?

350
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:58,680
 If you think clearly, I think the best way

351
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:04,040
 in observation of all these terrible things happening,

352
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:08,740
 the best way is not abandonment, but discernment.

353
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:14,360
 It's not abandonment, it is discernment.

354
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,200
 God is reminding you and challenging you to discern,

355
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:22,580
 to grow in your ability to think critically.

356
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,580
 Now, returning to chapter 14 of 1 Corinthians,

357
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:33,460
 you notice there is a key term being mentioned,

358
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:36,860
 being repeated over and over and over again

359
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,620
 in the entire chapter of 14.

360
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,240
 Let me give you an example, 14.12.

361
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,980
 Paul is speaking about the gift of preaching,

362
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,820
 sound doctrine, and the gift of speaking in tongue, right?

363
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:57,620
 He elevated one over the other and put speaking in tongue

364
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:00,900
 to the least of the list of gifts.

365
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:04,580
 The gift of preaching is much better.

366
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:09,380
 Verse 12, he said, "The same is true for you guys.

367
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:13,380
 "Since you are so eager to have the special abilities,

368
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:17,960
 "the spirit gifts, seek those that will strengthen

369
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:18,980
 "the whole church."

370
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:22,300
 He's talking about some of the talents,

371
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
 some of the gifts that has to be elevated

372
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,820
 because those gifts will strengthen the whole church.

373
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:33,520
 The word strengthen or the verb strengthen

374
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,380
 repeats again and again, over and over again

375
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:39,300
 in the entire chapter, because Paul understands

376
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,720
 when we get together, we need to strengthen

377
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,240
 and build up the church.

378
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,100
 Now, strengthening the word, many times in this chapter,

379
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:50,140
 literally, it can mean building up,

380
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:53,600
 building things together.

381
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,680
 It's used all over the Bible, especially in New Testament,

382
00:20:56,680 --> 00:21:00,240
 about the temple, the temple in Jerusalem.

383
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,160
 Brick and mortar, people put things together.

384
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,200
 Building up, strengthening.

385
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:09,600
 Talking about palace, the royal palace,

386
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,480
 palaces of the king, houses that people live in,

387
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,820
 physical buildings.

388
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,680
 He's using this word to describe when we get together,

389
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,080
 we need to use our presence and our talents

390
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,540
 and our resources to build up the church,

391
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:27,780
 to build like the temple, put bricks together.

392
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,260
 When we come together to have fellowship,

393
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,600
 when we come together to worship together,

394
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,740
 to serve together, we are putting bricks on one another

395
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,460
 and build up the temple so that God can be

396
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,980
 in presence with us.

397
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,540
 That is our goal.

398
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:46,820
 And that's why there's value in understanding

399
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,340
 the better gifts.

400
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,740
 The better gifts are those that will build up

401
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,040
 and strengthen the church.

402
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:58,040
 You probably know what contractors do, contractors.

403
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:01,860
 Have you ever done any renovation in your house?

404
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:04,380
 Repair jobs, right?

405
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,380
 Those are really, really tough jobs, right?

406
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:12,380
 I, in the past few years, because I got some major

407
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:17,180
 renovation in my house, I have to hire somebody

408
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,680
 to do the hot job, right?

409
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,420
 So I really respect those guys.

410
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:24,180
 You know, they got their hands dirty

411
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:29,180
 and they got the blueprint and they build things for me.

412
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,900
 Now, as you understand, as contractors,

413
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:38,260
 the building process is not an end in itself,

414
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:42,800
 but they always have the end goal in mind.

415
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:47,980
 What contractors do is to build things

416
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:51,500
 so that when the final project is done,

417
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:55,660
 the people who live in that space,

418
00:22:55,660 --> 00:23:00,140
 who use that space, will be benefited, right?

419
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,400
 They got the blueprint, they got the process,

420
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,940
 they got all the tools, and they know what the end goal is.

421
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,320
 The end goal is to build a beautiful building

422
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:13,180
 and finish the whole project so that whoever use it,

423
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:17,920
 the users, the people who live in it, they will enjoy it.

424
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:21,040
 That is the whole point of building the church.

425
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:24,920
 So Paul is encouraging us to use your gifts

426
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,680
 to build the church.

427
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:30,720
 Now, to summarize what the gifts are,

428
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,800
 I have a quick way to summarize it.

429
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,760
 It's three Ts.

430
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:41,080
 Your time, and your treasure, and your talents.

431
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:45,840
 Remember these three words, all right?

432
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,740
 The first one is time.

433
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,120
 What does it mean?

434
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,000
 When we gather, it takes time, right?

435
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,920
 There's no gathering of Christians,

436
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,540
 there's no worship gathering that would not take time.

437
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,240
 You set aside a time, you allot this time slot,

438
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,560
 I'm gonna worship God with the people of God, right?

439
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:09,340
 I'm gonna show up and be present, bodily present, right?

440
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,440
 Time, your treasure, right?

441
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:18,900
 Giving generously to the ministry of God, right?

442
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,120
 To train up the people

443
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,340
 so that his people will follow his way.

444
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:25,620
 Your talents, right?

445
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,680
 Now, I don't have to repeat all those stuff, right?

446
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,280
 Because we already talk about,

447
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,780
 we are gifted in different ways, right?

448
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:35,160
 Some of those are musically gifted,

449
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,840
 some of those who are gifted in some other ways.

450
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,840
 We are all using the gifts, right?

451
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:43,980
 Time, treasure, and talents to build up the church, right?

452
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,660
 Urban voice, our church.

453
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:51,200
 Let's build it so that God will get the glory.

454
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,440
 God will get the glory.

455
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,280
 I have some confidential pictures I wanna show you.

456
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:01,560
 As I prepared a sermon, I found some of the old pictures.

457
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:04,240
 As you know, Urban Voice UV,

458
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,680
 we launched our church as a church plan

459
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:12,140
 with just maybe eight or nine families together.

460
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,380
 It was back in 2016.

461
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:19,380
 So we were officially launched on the Easter Sunday, 2016.

462
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,120
 So as I prepared a sermon,

463
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:24,420
 I found some of the old pictures, all right?

464
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:28,620
 So the old pictures were all taken

465
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:32,240
 when we first move in to this place.

466
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:37,780
 When we first move in here, it had nothing.

467
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,220
 It's just an empty box.

468
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,300
 Who built it?

469
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:44,460
 People who have talents,

470
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:48,200
 people who are committed to build the church together.

471
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:51,540
 And I wanna show you this picture, it's about six or seven.

472
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:56,540
 And I want you to, well, who were with us

473
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,620
 in the very first Sunday, 2016 Easter Sunday?

474
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,100
 Who were here?

475
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:03,180
 Yeah, there are only a few, right?

476
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:05,580
 So praise God, these people,

477
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,880
 they were not here in the very first day,

478
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:11,140
 but they gradually, and God sent them here,

479
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:14,620
 and what a blessing to have all of you.

480
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,700
 But some of these pictures, as I show you,

481
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,540
 you have been coming to this church

482
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,660
 to attend the worship service,

483
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,980
 to participate in our ministries.

484
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,340
 Thank God for that.

485
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:30,100
 You should know our environment a little bit,

486
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,200
 right, our facility.

487
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,980
 So as I show you these old pictures,

488
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:38,120
 you tell me, where was this picture taken?

489
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:43,220
 Where, okay, exactly where this picture was taken?

490
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,060
 You ready?

491
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,980
 Where was this picture taken?

492
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,260
 Where?

493
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,820
 Where was the camera?

494
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:59,480
 Where was the camera?

495
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,060
 Right, it was around here, right?

496
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:05,100
 So we took a picture all the way there.

497
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,580
 Now it's changed a lot because we at this room,

498
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,340
 you know, this studio room, before COVID,

499
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:13,580
 before the pandemic, the room was not there,

500
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,580
 part of the building process, right?

501
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,560
 Next one.

502
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,260
 Where was this taken?

503
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:29,460
 That's right, right here, right here.

504
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:32,140
 Taken this direction, right?

505
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:36,020
 It's amazing to see how the builders, you know,

506
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:39,500
 build the church together, or build all this stuff, right?

507
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,620
 This thing is hollow.

508
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,500
 There were holes in it, right?

509
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:46,980
 They built a frame, you know,

510
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,820
 I was there almost every single day,

511
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,860
 and I took some pictures, you know,

512
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:55,860
 just to document what God has been doing in our midst.

513
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,840
 So this is the stage.

514
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,420
 How about this one?

515
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:06,220
 Where was this taken?

516
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,860
 Yeah, it's the cafe area, right?

517
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,860
 Back then we had only this crappy, you know, cabinet, right?

518
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:21,380
 And this worker was doing the drywall,

519
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:26,340
 and before we put the wood panels on.

520
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,580
 God built this church.

521
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:32,500
 How about this one?

522
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,700
 Where was this taken?

523
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:38,120
 Any guess?

524
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,340
 It's outside, it's actually the same angle,

525
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:47,600
 the cafe before the wall, before the drywall was put up.

526
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,980
 Right, so this wall right there.

527
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,860
 It's outside, the picture was taken outside, right?

528
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,740
 It's amazing, it's amazing.

529
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,060
 Every day I come here, you know,

530
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,100
 there's a process, more has been done, right?

531
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,500
 How about this one?

532
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,620
 Any guess?

533
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,720
 Where was this taken?

534
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,580
 Where was this picture taken?

535
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:10,600
 To what direction?

536
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,440
 Ah, that's tough, right?

537
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:16,560
 That's actually in the cafe area.

538
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:20,480
 If you stand outside the nursery door,

539
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,980
 you take a picture this way,

540
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,680
 not all the way to the end of the cafe,

541
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,440
 there's a dining table there, right?

542
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:28,080
 There's a bookcase there, right?

543
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,200
 Remember?

544
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,500
 Do you remember?

545
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,200
 Okay, all you pay attention to is the food, right?

546
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,160
 The food and the drinks.

547
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:40,860
 Seriously, this is taken from the end to the other end

548
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,280
 in the cafe area.

549
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,940
 How about this one?

550
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:44,760
 This is tough.

551
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,080
 It took me a long time to figure out where was this taken.

552
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:50,300
 I didn't even remember.

553
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:56,360
 It was actually taken from where James is.

554
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:59,100
 Yeah, it's right there, it's this corner.

555
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,940
 Can you tell?

556
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,180
 It's this corner, that's the back door.

557
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,840
 I want to show you this picture because,

558
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,800
 just like what Paul says,

559
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:14,960
 the church needs to be built up, you know, brick by brick,

560
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,280
 dry wall by dry wall.

561
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:20,660
 But Paul is not simply talking about hardware.

562
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:25,660
 He's talking about the people, the group, the church,

563
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,520
 the community getting together.

564
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,260
 All these pictures, I add this verse in there, 1412.

565
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,180
 In the same way, it is true for you guys.

566
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:40,060
 Since you are so eager to have your special abilities,

567
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,420
 the spirit gifts, seek those that will strengthen,

568
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:46,180
 will build up the whole church.

569
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,900
 A stronger church is the foundation,

570
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:53,060
 and the foundation is our mind.

571
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,820
 Our mind is oriented to the Word of God,

572
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,420
 a better understanding of faith.

573
00:30:58,420 --> 00:31:01,080
 Disciples should be thinkers.

574
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,220
 You should be able to discern, to think,

575
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,440
 to debate, to question.

576
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:16,460
 A good worship service is not one

577
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,280
 that would make you tear up.

578
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,200
 All right?

579
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,460
 Although I was worshiping and James was leading,

580
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:29,460
 it was such a great time we can praise our God, right?

581
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,460
 Offer our worship to Him.

582
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:37,440
 But a good service, a good worship, a good church

583
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,360
 is not one that makes you tear up,

584
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,860
 but one that challenges you to think deeply,

585
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:49,800
 to think more critically, to think better.

586
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:55,820
 Think in terms of God's Word.

587
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,160
 Think along the line

588
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,340
 with the biblical teaching of the Bible.

589
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,600
 Let's all pray together,

590
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,600
 and let's continue to live in the truth of God,

591
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:12,440
 and the truth is we live in His love.

592
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,320
 Let's all pray.

593
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:24,040
 Father, we give you thanks because you are the one

594
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,120
 who built this church.

595
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:30,040
 And thank you for the fact that the Holy Spirit

596
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,040
 is the builder.

597
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,720
 The Holy Spirit gives us in many different ways.

598
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,680
 So as we come before you, as we conclude our service,

599
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:45,480
 we ask that you would bring us into your presence again,

600
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:49,960
 and know that we are being saved by your grace,

601
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:54,360
 by your love, and your love would transform us

602
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:57,840
 to change our perspective, change our orientation,

603
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,440
 so that our lives, our gifts, our time, our treasure,

604
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,600
 and our talents will bring honor to you,

605
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,200
 to build up the church, to build up this community,

606
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
 so that your name will be lifted high.

607
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:12,000
 Thank you, and we praise you.

608
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,840
 Christ, we pray.

609
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,840
 (upbeat music)
