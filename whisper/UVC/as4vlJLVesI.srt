1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 [speaking Chinese]

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 [speaking Chinese]

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
 [speaking Chinese]

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

6
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

8
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

9
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

10
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:36,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

11
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

12
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

14
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,120
 - Well, we have a very special speaker today, all right?

15
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:20,520
 And Wasam asked me, is he the first Arab

16
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,400
 in our congregation, I think, right?

17
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
 You're the first one, right?

18
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,760
 Iraqi, right?

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,760
 And he's a native Iraqi, and he's from Baghdad, Iraq.

20
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,560
 How many of you have been to Baghdad, Iraq?

21
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,040
 (audience laughing)

22
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,160
 One, okay, all right.

23
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:40,440
 And he, through a very dramatic experience,

24
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,680
 came to Christ in Baghdad, Iraq.

25
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,480
 And he will tell you more about his story.

26
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,840
 Now he's Associate Minister of Sunset Church of Christ

27
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,720
 in Taylor, Michigan.

28
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,720
 Taylor, Michigan, you've been there, right?

29
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,080
 Michigan, you've been there, right?

30
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,160
 State of Michigan.

31
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:03,160
 And his vision is to tell Muslims about Christ

32
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,720
 and to tell Christians about Islam.

33
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:11,000
 And I think this is a very relevant topic today.

34
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,440
 Our coworkers, our friends, our neighbors,

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,920
 maybe Muslims, or maybe they believe in Islam,

36
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:22,960
 and they love to tell you about their faith

37
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,880
 and how to respond as a Christians.

38
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,240
 So a very, very relevant topic.

39
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:30,200
 And Wasam has also written two books.

40
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,200
 The first one is "I Am an Arab and I Am a Christian."

41
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

42
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:47,000
 The second book he has written is "Islam in Christ's Eyes."

44
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:51,240
 It's a scripture study, it's a group study guide

45
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:54,240
 to help you understand Islam from a Christian perspective

46
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,400
 and how to respond to Islam.

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

48
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:06,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:10,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

50
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

52
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

54
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

55
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

56
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

57
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:42,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

58
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

59
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,680
 Wasam, we wanna welcome you.

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,520
 - Thank you.

61
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,600
 (audience applauding)

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,440
 Thank you.

63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,280
 Good morning.

64
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

65
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,600
 It is so surreal that I'm invited in one weekend

66
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,120
 to talk in two Chinese congregations.

67
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,080
 I started the Arab Christian ministry.

69
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

70
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,000
 Upon my graduation

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,840
 from Sunset International Bible Institute.

72
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:56,760
 Locally, I work from my church, preaching the gospel

74
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:59,120
 to the predominantly Muslim population

75
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,240
 in the neighboring Dearborn, Michigan.

76
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:05,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

77
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,400
 And globally, I work as the adjunct assistant dean

78
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,840
 for the Arabic studies

79
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,560
 with Sunset International Bible Institute.

80
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:19,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

81
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:27,960
 And yet, I think you are never famous

82
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,560
 until you have your name said in Chinese.

83
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,560
 (audience laughing)

84
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

85
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:41,320
 I was born to a Muslim family in Baghdad in 1979.

86
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

87
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,400
 A few months after my birth,

88
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,760
 Saddam Hussein became our president.

89
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

90
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,520
 And Ayatollah Khomeini led the Islamic revolution

91
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,400
 in the neighboring Iran.

92
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:07,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

93
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,200
 And we started to have the war

94
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,400
 between the two countries that lasted for eight years.

95
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

96
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,880
 I was born and raised in a classic example

97
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,200
 of a world that was not told to love one another.

98
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

99
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,520
 A world that is not shaped by the goodness

100
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
 and the love of Jesus Christ.

101
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

102
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,880
 Shortly after the war, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait.

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

104
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:52,320
 We had the sanctions that lasted for 13 years

105
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,640
 in which my whole family lived on $1 a month.

106
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

107
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,360
 And we had the Gulf War of 1991.

108
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

109
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:10,120
 Up until that point,

110
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,920
 Saddam Hussein was a secular socialist military dictator.

111
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

112
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:25,640
 But after he had a Shiite revolt in the south,

113
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:29,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

114
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,840
 he realized he could not impose a secular system

115
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,440
 on the predominantly Muslim people of Iraq.

116
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

117
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,960
 So after he crushed that revolt,

118
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,680
 he started to put on a show of Islam.

119
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

120
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

121
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:06,120
 He wrote Allahu Akbar on the Iraqi flag.

122
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

123
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,800
 He ordered the Quran to be taught

124
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,320
 in all the Iraqi schools.

125
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,160
 He built hundreds of mosques all around Iraq.

127
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:26,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

128
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,160
 And he started to turn the Iraqi community

129
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,360
 from being secular to being more Muslim.

130
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

131
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,520
 My father retired in 1992.

132
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

133
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,720
 And my mom started working as a seamstress,

134
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,800
 mending the clothes of our neighborhood

135
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,240
 to provide for the family.

136
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

137
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:57,640
 I was in the middle of my teenage years,

138
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,800
 in the middle of the 1990s.

139
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

140
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,480
 When Iraq was officially at enmity

141
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,800
 with everything that is different in the world.

142
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

143
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,600
 We did not have the terrorism and the car bombs

144
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,400
 and Al-Qaeda that is ravaging the Middle East now.

145
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

146
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,720
 But all of that was a culture that was preached in mosques.

147
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

148
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,560
 Taught in schools.

149
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

150
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,800
 And propagated by the government's limited channels.

151
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

152
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,360
 Hate was preached everywhere.

153
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

154
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,280
 It is hate that eventually caused me

155
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,920
 to convert out of Islam.

156
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

157
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:09,520
 Hate is evil, whether it is in Iraq

158
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,640
 or in America or in China.

159
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

160
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,800
 We did not starve for food or water

161
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,840
 because of the sanctions years.

162
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

163
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,000
 But we were starving for a different kind of bread

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,920
 and a different kind of water that we did not even know.

165
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

166
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:44,840
 My four year old sister passed away in 1996.

167
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:48,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

168
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,840
 My mom, a panicked mother,

169
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,840
 and the funeral of her daughter was--

170
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:57,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

171
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,760
 Was begging for someone at the funeral

172
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,920
 to provide her with a glimpse of hope

173
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
 that that innocent child went to heaven.

174
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

175
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:20,360
 No one was able to provide her with that hope.

176
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

177
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,600
 And the only man who was knowledgeable in the Quran

178
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:29,400
 told her she will be judged for the very first breath

179
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,120
 she took in when she was born.

180
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

181
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

182
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,920
 A few months later that same year.

183
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

184
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:47,000
 My uncle got cancer.

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

186
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:52,000
 He was the uncle that I loved most.

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

188
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,000
 He was so kind and so generous and so humorous.

189
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

190
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,080
 But when I last saw him,

191
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,280
 he would cry every time I talk with him.

192
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:09,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

193
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,920
 Not only because he saw his death coming,

194
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,560
 which he did in a few days.

195
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

196
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,400
 But for the first time in his life,

197
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,600
 he was unable to go to the bathroom.

198
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

199
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,520
 To get ritually clean for the Muslim prayers.

200
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:33,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

201
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,480
 He was in bed, soiling himself.

202
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:40,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

203
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,440
 He thought God was done with him.

204
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:45,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

205
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,480
 And he died without hope.

206
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

207
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,200
 That's when I decided that's it,

208
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,600
 between me and God,

209
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,880
 rejected Islam and became an atheist.

210
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

211
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,400
 I thought I would be happy if I were an atheist.

212
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:05,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

213
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,840
 But somewhere deep inside me,

214
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:10,960
 I was looking for justice and for a sense of direction.

215
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:14,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

216
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,320
 I wanted to entertain and distract myself.

217
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

218
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,600
 I started to think about the world

219
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

220
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,160
 I started reading books,

221
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,560
 listening to music and watching movies.

222
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

223
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:39,560
 Most of the books that I read quoted the Bible.

224
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

225
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,680
 I got curious to get myself a copy of the Bible

226
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,680
 only to understand these quotes.

227
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

228
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
 I was in my second year in college

229
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,960
 studying civil engineering.

230
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

231
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,560
 When the first Mission Impossible movie was released.

232
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:07,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

233
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,280
 Tom Cruise picked the Gideon's Bible and read Job 314.

234
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:15,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

235
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,160
 That was the first time I see the Bible.

236
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:22,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

237
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,000
 I got so curious.

238
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,120
 I went to a flea market in Baghdad

239
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,760
 and bought my first Bible.

240
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

241
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,920
 It was the Gospel of John.

242
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

243
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,680
 I thought that was the entire Bible.

244
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

245
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,080
 I did not find Job 314 in the Gospel of John.

246
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

247
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,240
 So I thought Muslims were right.

248
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,320
 Everybody is making up a different Bible.

249
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

250
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,400
 Something caught my attention in the Gospel of John though.

251
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

252
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,040
 The way Jesus addressed

253
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,960
 the hypocritical religious authorities of his time.

254
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

255
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,520
 Something you're not supposed to do in a Muslim community.

256
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:16,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

257
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,680
 I was born and raised to two devout Muslim parents.

258
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

259
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,160
 And they taught me that every Imam

260
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
 is a steward of God's word.

261
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

262
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,440
 And we should not question them.

263
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

264
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,440
 Well, not Jesus in that book.

265
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

266
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,640
 It was the summer holiday

267
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:45,280
 between the second and the third year in college.

268
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:49,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

269
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,880
 When I was back at that flea market

270
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,520
 flipping the New Testament.

271
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

272
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,000
 I saw the Gospel of John in the New Testament.

273
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:02,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

274
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,000
 That was the first time I realized

275
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,360
 that the Gospel of John was not another Bible.

276
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,040
 It was part of a bigger book.

277
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:11,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

278
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,320
 So I bought the New Testament.

279
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

280
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,720
 A few days later,

281
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,160
 I realized that the New Testament

282
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,680
 was part of another bigger book.

283
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:24,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

284
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,360
 So I realized that I lost a lot of money already.

285
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

286
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:32,400
 And bought my first complete Bible.

287
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:35,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

288
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,200
 I was so shocked to see the accurate historical

289
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,600
 and geographic description in the Bible

290
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
 of a world that I am familiar with.

291
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

292
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,440
 Babylon, that's 50 miles to the south of my parents' house.

293
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

294
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:01,680
 Babylonians and Assyrians,

295
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,360
 these are the native Iraqis.

296
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

297
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:13,240
 Nebuchadnezzar, his poster is next to Saddam Hussein's

298
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,600
 picture in every street corner in Baghdad.

299
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

300
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,360
 The captivity, the pride of the Iraqi history

301
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,320
 that we studied in the seventh grade.

302
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:31,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

303
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:32,080
 I'm sorry.

304
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

305
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:49,640
 And I was thinking, man, the guy who made up this book

306
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,560
 really knew his history and geography.

307
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

308
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,360
 A Christian philosopher once said.

309
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

310
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,240
 That there are three things that we all need.

311
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

312
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,040
 And these are first, truth.

313
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

314
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,920
 And then goodness.

315
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

316
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,400
 And then beauty.

317
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

318
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,200
 But he said what we want is the exact opposite order.

319
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

320
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,520
 We want beauty first.

321
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

322
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,960
 And then goodness and then truth.

323
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

324
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,880
 The beauty of the Bible caught my attention first.

325
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:39,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

326
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,480
 It is the most influential and most beautiful piece

327
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,200
 of literature that was ever written.

328
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:47,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

329
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,520
 Then I fell in love with the goodness of the Bible.

330
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

331
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,000
 A book that preaches love and not hate.

332
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

333
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,920
 Peace and not violence.

334
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:04,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

335
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,440
 Forgiveness and not vengeance.

336
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:11,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

337
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,520
 Integrity, benevolence, you name it.

338
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

339
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,440
 And I fell in love with the Bible for being good

340
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,320
 way before I believed in the Bible for being true.

341
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:26,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

342
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:30,600
 I had so many questions to ask.

343
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

344
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,600
 I did not have any Christian friends.

345
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

346
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,080
 But when the third year in college started,

347
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,440
 I saw a man with a cross in his shirt in our class.

348
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

349
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,520
 He obviously flunked the third year.

350
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

351
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:53,240
 I asked him, are you a Christian?

352
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,320
 Do you know your Bible?

353
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

354
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,400
 He said, go ahead.

355
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

356
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,480
 I said, do you Christians believe that you are saved

357
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,200
 by God's grace or by your obedience?

358
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

359
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:14,960
 Like every other preacher,

360
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,800
 he did not directly answer my question.

361
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

362
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,280
 But he took the opportunity

363
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,320
 to introduce the gospel message to me.

364
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

365
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:32,320
 He explained to me how God is a holy and just God

366
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,880
 that does not tolerate sin.

367
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:38,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

368
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,440
 But at the same time, he's a loving God,

369
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,800
 so he sent his son to take our sins on him

370
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,280
 and die on the cross for us.

371
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:48,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

372
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,640
 It's a combination of God's grace and our obedience.

373
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

374
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,120
 I said, interesting.

375
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:58,960
 One more question.

376
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

377
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,720
 Do you really believe that?

378
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

379
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,680
 He said, oh yeah, we do.

380
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

381
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,600
 Next day, he brought me some literature

382
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,080
 that talked about how many tens of thousands

383
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,760
 of Bible manuscripts we have today in the museum.

384
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:20,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

385
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:31,600
 From different times, from different places,

386
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,000
 written in different languages.

387
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:37,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

388
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,040
 And they all match each other.

389
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

390
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,440
 That was the first time anyone tells me

391
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,480
 that the Bible has not been corrupted.

392
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:51,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

393
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,160
 I was 19.

394
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

395
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,800
 I was so happy to learn that the book

396
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,960
 that has the solution to every problem

397
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,640
 my community is suffering from turned out to be true.

398
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

399
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:13,600
 I was so happy to learn that the book

400
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,960
 that was both beautiful and good turned out to be true too.

401
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

402
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,640
 I thought everybody else would be as happy.

403
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

404
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:28,240
 I was wrong.

405
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

406
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,280
 The first person I tried to share the gospel with

407
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,320
 was the woman that I loved the most.

408
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

409
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,120
 My mom used to wake up before me

410
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,760
 to make breakfast for me every day.

411
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

412
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,920
 And at that time, she would not answer me

413
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,400
 when I say good morning, mom.

414
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

415
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,200
 One morning I asked mom, what's wrong?

416
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:02,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

417
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,360
 She turned to me and she grabbed me by the collar.

418
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

419
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:09,240
 And she asked me, please tell me

420
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,840
 what did I fail to provide to you?

421
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:14,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

422
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,000
 That you do this thing to me.

423
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

424
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,800
 I said, what thing?

425
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

426
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,320
 She said, I've been working day and night

427
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,240
 to make a human being out of you.

428
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

429
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,840
 I've been wearing my eyes out on that sewing machine.

430
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

431
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,160
 To send you to school.

432
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

433
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:46,000
 And you've been using my money to buy that blasphemous book

434
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,280
 that I've been seeing among your college books.

435
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

436
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:55,320
 Look at yourself, grow up.

437
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

438
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,560
 With that,

439
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:03,120
 with the lack of wisdom and the lack of encouragement.

440
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

441
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,360
 With the fact that I started to lose

442
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,640
 many of my Muslim friends

443
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,120
 and did not gain any new Christian friends.

444
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:15,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

445
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,360
 And with the fact that I started to get harassed

446
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:20,480
 by the religious authorities in my neighborhood.

447
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

448
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,280
 I came to that point where I thought,

449
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,600
 maybe this is all wrong.

450
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

451
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,200
 Maybe there is no God.

452
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

453
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,600
 Maybe the gospel was just another philosophy

454
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,960
 I wanted to entertain and distract myself with.

455
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:42,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

456
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,120
 I renounced the Christian faith and gave away my Bible.

457
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

458
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:53,120
 A few months later,

459
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

460
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:55,600
 I realized,

461
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

462
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,960
 that the hope and the satisfaction,

463
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:03,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

464
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,680
 and the fulfillment and the assurance,

465
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

466
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,960
 that I had when I claimed God's promises

467
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,440
 in the Bible as my own,

468
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:15,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

469
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,960
 cannot be replaced with anything in this life.

470
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

471
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,960
 I'd rather be a persecuted Christian with hope,

472
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

473
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,120
 than a comfortable non-believer with no hope.

474
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

475
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,160
 So I got a new Bible.

476
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

477
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,520
 In English this time, so my mom would not understand it.

478
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,360
 (audience laughing)

479
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

480
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,720
 And I continued to read the Bible in secret

481
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,400
 for the rest of my stay in Baghdad.

482
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

483
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:57,720
 My biggest discouragement was that it would take me 12 years

484
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,800
 going to every single church building in Baghdad

485
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,680
 trying to get baptized in faith.

486
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:06,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

487
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:15,720
 I finished school in 2000.

488
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

489
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:23,200
 Finished my service as a Republican guard in 2002.

490
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:27,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

491
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,480
 America invaded Iraq in 2003.

492
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

493
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,520
 We started to have the internet

494
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:36,880
 and we started to be open to the outside world.

495
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:41,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

496
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,840
 I would go online and download sermons and Christian songs

497
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,560
 and upload them to my MP3 player

498
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,520
 and listen to them on my way to work every day

499
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,160
 and read the passage from the Bible.

500
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:54,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

501
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:59,160
 Until that one morning in 2009.

502
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

503
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,520
 When my workplace, the Iraqi Department of Public Works.

504
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:08,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

505
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,760
 Was rocked by a truck bomb.

506
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

507
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,120
 I was in the staircase, I came out of it without a scratch.

508
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

509
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:24,080
 We moved to a substitute building

510
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,720
 in another neighborhood in Baghdad.

511
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:29,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

512
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:33,600
 That building had an internet cafe next to it.

513
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

514
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,800
 One afternoon I signed up for a free Bible study.

515
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

516
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:47,720
 And that's when everything started to change.

517
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:51,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

518
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,920
 A woman was assigned to grade my Bible tests.

519
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

520
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:04,240
 She asked me in her first email if I had any prayer requests.

521
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

522
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,760
 I said, "Would you please pray that I can get baptized?

523
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,640
 "I've been a believer for 12 years already."

524
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

525
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:18,720
 And would you please pray that I can live

526
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
 in a Christian-friendly community

527
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,000
 where I can say Jesus is Lord

528
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,640
 without getting killed right on the spot.

529
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

530
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:35,080
 That same day I came across a free book called Bible Basics.

531
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:39,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

532
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,800
 Written by a British man who had a ministry in Latvia.

533
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:46,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

534
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,160
 I ordered a free copy of that book.

535
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

536
00:28:57,240 --> 00:28:59,840
 He ended up coming to Iraq and baptizing me

537
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,480
 in a bathtub in Kurdistan, Northern Iraq.

538
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

539
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:13,040
 The woman that used to grade my Bible tests

540
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:15,560
 was a caregiver for a quadriplegic man

541
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,280
 in a Christian man's house in Pennsylvania.

542
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:22,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

543
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,040
 The Christian man told her if that Iraqi plans

544
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,080
 to come over here, he can stay with us.

545
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:31,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

546
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:37,880
 A few weeks later, the American embassy in Baghdad

547
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,960
 started issuing visas for Iraqis

548
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,840
 for the first time in 20 years.

549
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

550
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

551
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:58,400
 So I applied for the visa.

552
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

553
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,520
 Bought the plane ticket.

554
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

555
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,280
 Packed one bag.

556
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

557
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,560
 Said the final goodbyes to my family.

558
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

559
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,960
 Flew all the way from Baghdad to New York City.

560
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

561
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,320
 Came to this nation with one bag.

562
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

563
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,320
 With only enough money to survive for weeks.

564
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

565
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,440
 And with one contact, a poor woman in the Amish country.

566
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

567
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:39,560
 One Christian man there heard my story.

568
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:42,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

569
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,480
 He had me speaking in his church in Pennsylvania.

570
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

571
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,760
 The preacher of which turned out to be a graduate

572
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,760
 from the school I eventually ended up going to.

573
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:58,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

574
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:03,840
 He raised support money for me to go to school

575
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,120
 on the time I ran out of the last dollar

576
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,320
 that I brought with me from Iraq.

577
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:11,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

578
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,560
 I finished school and moved to the Detroit area.

579
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

580
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,240
 Back to the Muslim community,

581
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,880
 the same community I escaped from.

582
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

583
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,200
 Eight years ago, I used to hide my faith to stay alive.

584
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

585
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,880
 And today, I share my faith to make a living.

586
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

587
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,640
 Once again, appreciate your invitation.

588
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

589
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,160
 And your time and thank you and God bless.

590
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

591
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,760
 (audience applauding)

592
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,800
 Thank you very much.

593
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:59,040
 Well, we still have five minutes

594
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:02,000
 and maybe there are some questions from the congregation

595
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,960
 and we wanna ask you or you wanna answer

596
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,800
 if you have an answer.

597
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:06,800
 I am all yours.

598
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,880
 (audience laughing)

599
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,440
 Do you guys have any questions?

600
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,080
 Yes, ma'am.

601
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,440
 - Oh, Emily, please get a mic.

602
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:16,360
 - Can you tell us how bad they would treat Christian

603
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,760
 back in like Iran or Baghdad that you used to,

604
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,920
 well, before you leave?

605
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,040
 - There is much more to,

606
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,040
 well, they are persecuting Christians in Baghdad

607
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:28,320
 that you would know.

608
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,560
 Okay, learn the basic facts first.

609
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,400
 When I was born and raised,

610
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,800
 that was under Saddam Hussein

611
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,800
 who was a member of the Ba'ath Party

612
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,360
 that was established by a Greek Orthodox Christian.

613
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,760
 The Iraqi Prime Minister,

614
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:44,680
 the international face of Iraq, Tariq Aziz,

615
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,920
 was a Catholic Christian.

616
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,400
 And so there has not been any persecution

617
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,280
 on a religious basis under Saddam Hussein.

618
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,720
 Now, after Saddam Hussein,

619
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,880
 we still have a civil constitution

620
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,200
 and we still have a lot of Christians.

621
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,640
 In fact, my boss in Baghdad when I was an engineer

622
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,920
 was a Catholic woman,

623
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,920
 but the government is not strong enough

624
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,440
 to impose law and order.

625
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,520
 When a car bomb explodes in an Iraqi marketplace

626
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:17,280
 and kills 99 Muslims and one Christian,

627
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,160
 that story will be reported somewhere

628
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:23,720
 as a Muslim persecuting Christians.

629
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,520
 I think there is much more to the stories

630
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:27,600
 that you can hear, at least from Baghdad,

631
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,560
 from what I saw in Baghdad,

632
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,720
 than what you see from your end.

633
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:34,800
 Christians are being persecuted everywhere

634
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,520
 and more severely in the Muslim countries

635
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,680
 than here in the United States,

636
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,480
 but there is much more to the story.

637
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,000
 - Any other questions?

638
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,640
 (audience laughing)

639
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,880
 How many-- - Yes, ma'am.

640
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,720
 - Oh, sorry.

641
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:53,200
 - I'm interested to know how did you tell your mom

642
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,760
 and your family when you leave the country?

643
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,600
 - Okay.

644
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:59,280
 Good question.

645
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:04,040
 My mom first did not take me seriously.

646
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:07,800
 Then she took me seriously and she was really sad.

647
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:09,960
 Then right before I left, she said,

648
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,440
 "I know that you are doing the right thing,

649
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,120
 "but promise me one thing.

650
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,440
 "You do not join a drug dealing gang."

651
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,640
 (audience laughing)

652
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:20,320
 So that's the only thing she knew about America.

653
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,040
 I said, "No, Mom, I'm not gonna do that.

654
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,360
 "I would never do that."

655
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:28,320
 Unfortunately, things in Iraq started to go

656
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,160
 from bad to worse at that time.

657
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,080
 It's not as bad anymore.

658
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,200
 So ISIS came into the scene and more people got killed.

659
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,000
 And my mom eventually said, "You have always been wise.

660
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,400
 "I have never told you that,

661
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,240
 "but I knew that you were doing the right thing."

662
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:43,360
 My whole family knows about my conversion

663
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,480
 and my work now and they are fine with it.

664
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,080
 In fact, the first book that I wrote,

665
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,120
 the book that exposes Islam, actually that's the second book.

666
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,880
 The first book is "Islam in Christ's Eyes."

667
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,680
 I told my mom, "I wrote a book that exposes your faith

668
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:58,280
 "as bad and false and I dedicate it to you."

669
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,640
 She said, "I'm proud of you."

670
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,640
 (audience laughing)

671
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,080
 - Right there, Steve.

672
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:08,920
 - Sir.

673
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,760
 - Can I get a mic?

674
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,880
 - You made your mom change her view.

675
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,720
 - Time.

676
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,560
 - Time?

677
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,680
 - Yeah, you only have one chance

678
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,520
 to offend somebody with the gospel message.

679
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,480
 Two decades later, no one really cares.

680
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,480
 (audience laughing)

681
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,600
 - So you cast the bombardment

682
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,920
 of the gospel message, basically?

683
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:26,240
 - Well, no, my family are still all devout Muslims.

684
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:31,240
 And yeah, I mean, to be tolerant and receptive

685
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,200
 and respectful is one thing.

686
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,040
 To, for their hearts to be convicted of their sin

687
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:38,640
 and for them to really feel that they need a savior,

688
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,940
 that is a different thing.

689
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,000
 It's always harder with the family.

690
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:46,520
 I mean, when I first started to tell my mom about the gospel

691
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:49,320
 she told me, "Are you saying that you are right

692
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,600
 "and this whole world is wrong?"

693
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:54,080
 To her, the whole world is Islam.

694
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:58,680
 And so, yeah, I mean, it took time.

695
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,120
 That's the only thing.

696
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:00,960
 Yeah.

697
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,320
 - Well, as I said in the introduction,

698
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:05,160
 we have some friends or neighbors or co-workers

699
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,440
 who are in the Islamic faith.

700
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:11,180
 We are Christians and what are the pointers

701
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:14,120
 that you can share with us, how to share the faith,

702
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,880
 how to connect with a Muslim neighbor?

703
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:20,040
 - Okay, long story short, show them the love of Christ

704
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:23,360
 before you show them the truth of his gospel.

705
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,760
 'Cause people are interested in what is beautiful first

706
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,400
 and then what is good and then what is true.

707
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,760
 I have a whole course on that called Islam in Christ's Eyes

708
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:35,040
 that starts with, see, when you preach the gospel to anyone

709
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,560
 you will have to start where they are at now.

710
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:41,680
 And so what Muslims believe now and where to start,

711
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,320
 the theology of Islam explains the element

712
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,340
 of the Islamic faith, I talk about that.

713
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:48,400
 And to understand how things ended up

714
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,640
 the way they are at now in the Muslim world,

715
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,000
 you will have to have a basic exposure

716
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,480
 to the history of Islam.

717
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:58,440
 So history and then theology and then how to preach

718
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,480
 the gospel to Muslims, this all is a course

719
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,840
 that is called Islam in Christ's Eyes

720
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:05,560
 that I'm giving now in, what's the name of the congregation,

721
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:07,960
 the other Chinese congregation that I'm talking to?

722
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,760
 They have the name in Chinese characters,

723
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,000
 I have no idea. (audience laughing)

724
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,400
 And they gave me a ride here and a ride there.

725
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:18,400
 And so, before you share the gospel,

726
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:21,840
 okay, before you ask how can I share the gospel,

727
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,000
 you will have to ask an equally important,

728
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
 if not a more important question,

729
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,320
 why should I share the gospel with them?

730
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:31,480
 What is the motive when you want to share the gospel?

731
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,080
 What is the proper motive if you wanted to share the gospel

732
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,600
 with your non-Christian neighbor?

733
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,840
 Here is the right motive.

734
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,000
 When you share the gospel with your neighbor,

735
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:44,600
 Muslim or non-Muslim, remember that if they responded

736
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,760
 to that message of salvation,

737
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,440
 you will be stuck with them for all the eternity.

738
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,240
 Is this what you really want or not?

739
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,520
 If you don't love them that much,

740
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,160
 if you cannot stand seeing them in your neighborhood,

741
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:02,000
 don't you dare preach the gospel to them.

742
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,040
 Move on and preach the gospel to somebody else

743
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,360
 that you really like.

744
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:08,200
 So start with the proper motive first,

745
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,640
 and then the means, and then the opportunity.

746
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:14,840
 And no, we are not trying to murder anybody here.

747
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:17,000
 (audience laughing)

748
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,400
 - All right, so let's give a round of applause to Wissam.

749
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,240
 - Thank you.

750
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,440
 - Why don't we pray together?

751
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,280
 - Sure, please.

752
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,480
 - We pray for his ministry in Michigan.

753
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:29,040
 We also pray for more Arab people coming to Christ.

754
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:29,880
 - Thank you.

755
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,800
 - All right, let's pray.

756
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,120
 Father God, we just want to give you thanks

757
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,600
 because you are the God of the whole world,

758
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:39,640
 and you love every one of us with grace,

759
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,760
 and with love, and with beauty.

760
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,960
 We pray for Wissam.

761
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,560
 We praise you for how you have led him to come to Christ,

762
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,360
 to come to know the gospel,

763
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,240
 and come to the United States to start the ministry,

764
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:57,240
 to preach Christ to many Muslims in his neighborhood.

765
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,800
 We just pray that you will continue to use him,

766
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,920
 use his story, use his experience, his knowledge,

767
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:07,600
 to bring many to Christ, for your glory.

 (speaking in foreign language)

 - Amen.

773
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:48,960
 - Thank you very much.

774
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:49,800
 - I appreciate that, thank you.

775
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,880

 (audience laughing)

778
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,400
 - Oh, wow.

779
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,240
 - That's right.

780
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,080
 - Is that all the Chinese you can speak?

781
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:58,360
 (audience laughing)

782
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,720
 - Yeah, and I got that from Brush Hour.

783
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,560
 - All right, so.

784
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:05,400

785
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,440

 (speaking in foreign language)

787
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,520
 I am a Christian.
