[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.280]   Hi, everybody. Good to see you. Good morning. It's nice to be back at UV. Many of you may
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.720]   be here or maybe, maybe, maybe not here. I don't know. No, maybe not here. But I used
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:26.120]   to do these videos for UV during the height of the pandemic. And it's just like a one
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.800]   woman variety show where it's me and the camera. I'm just like, Hi, everybody. I'm Mr. Rebecca
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.200]   de la Homa. And I'll say it all in Cantonese. And I'll throw in some English in there. But
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.560]   today I'm going to be talking to mostly adults. So we're not going to play any games. But
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:51.200]   we're going to have some few fun interactive activities. And I probably will be less hyper,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:58.560]   but just as interesting. All right. So this morning, we'll be exploring a topic that's
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.320]   really near, dear to my heart. As you can see on the slide, it's about art, beauty,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.560]   and God. And I want to start by asking everybody a question. Gosh, it's so techie here. Last
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:23.080]   time I was here, I wasn't so techie. So what value do you place in art and beauty? So in
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:34.920]   other words, how important is it to you, like personally? And how important is it to society?
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:44.960]   It's a rhetorical question. So you can think about it. So I'll share with you what I often
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:54.360]   hear, especially from the Chinese culture that I grew up in. So art is way impractical,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:03.800]   like not very useful. Ancillary. What? The painting is $3,000. Why so expensive? No way,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:11.720]   I can do that, close my eyes. Paint, paint, paint, all done. So, and beauty, of course,
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.080]   is nice, but who has the time for all that? We don't have time to make everything pretty,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.960]   everything to look good. But if it's for skin care, we can do it. So the funny thing is
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:36.400]   that despite all these negative comments that I've heard or even have absorbed in our Chinese
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:42.200]   culture that I grew up in, and in culture in general, and society in general, we spent
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:54.920]   a lot of money and time and resources in artists, like BTS, Taylor Swift. I mean, they are artists.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:02.200]   Practicing their art form, performing on stage for tickets, sold out shows, multiple shows.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:08.080]   We spend money on other people's art, other artists that are celebrities. So the word
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:15.880]   celebrity means we celebrate them, right? But we don't really actually celebrate art,
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.200]   we just celebrate them. And especially here in the States, we have game shows and reality
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.680]   shows, especially for things like this, like America's Got Talent. But have you noticed
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.080]   when anybody goes on stage on America's Got Talent, it's like the same kind of talent?
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:42.600]   So we have someone's gonna sing, definitely gonna sing, maybe with a guitar, maybe with
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:51.320]   a piano, maybe both. Someone's gonna dance, someone's gonna do magic and wow the crowds.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.000]   So, what I'm seeing is they're doing these things, but you don't see someone stand up
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.920]   on stage and perform their talent in doing a math problem. How quickly can I solve this
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:12.920]   puzzle? Can I do a Rubik's Cube in less than a minute? Or how good am I at organizing spreadsheets?
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:19.660]   Those are not talents we celebrate, those are not talents we wanna compete for, but
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.200]   actually we do that, a lot of us, every day. That's what we practice, that's part of our
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   work. So, we as the audience love it when other people display art and beauty, right?
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:42.920]   We love it. So, if we're gonna spend time to watch these shows and watch the next YouTube
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:47.640]   video and the next YouTube video for the next two hours of our lives and not sleep, or buy
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:56.400]   tickets to watch these singers, it would seem that we highly value the arts. We highly value
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:09.920]   art and beauty. But I don't know if we actually encourage that in ourselves or for others.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:21.440]   I wonder why. And for me, this topic is really near and dear because I am an artist. I make
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.480]   my own artwork, I lead art making sessions and workshops, I work with a community, I
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:37.220]   exhibit their art, and I'm an author. These are all artistic, creative things that I do.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:46.660]   And it's a huge part of who I am. But I am no superstar celebrity. So, does it still
[00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:54.840]   matter that I do this stuff? Is it worth it? So, I've struggled a lot to be able to put
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:01.600]   what you see on the slide here in terms of identifying myself as an artist. It's way
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   easier to say I'm a teacher. Way easier when I was a business consultant to say, "Oh, I'm
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:17.480]   in consulting. All the aunties love it. Make so much money. Yeah, very good." In college,
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:25.400]   before college, I wanted to go to art school. No way is that happening. But I can do everything
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:35.440]   art on the side if I wanted, as long as it stayed a hobby. So, even after being a consultant,
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:44.120]   being an educator, et cetera, what do I come back to? I still come back to my passion.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:52.040]   And I can't deny that I feel my best when I make art and when I teach art. But even
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:56.560]   as I put these pictures up on this slide and talk about being an artist, it's still hard
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:04.160]   to reconcile these messages that I've heard either from growing up or messages from society
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:12.960]   and balance that with what I feel is very important and valuable. And kind of combating
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:20.640]   with what I am hearing in society saying, "It's really not that useful. It's shallow.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   It's superficial. It's ancillary." So, kind of selfishly, not too selfishly, but also
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:33.600]   like altruistically, I want to explore what the Bible says about art and beauty, about
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:41.240]   this topic. So, essentially, I want to know what God thinks about this in hopes that I'll
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.080]   find affirmation in what I'm doing. Because I'll get affirmation about being an accountant,
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.360]   no problem. I'll get affirmation about being a doctor, a lawyer, no problem. All the affirmation
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:08:00.560]   in the world. And if I don't get affirmation from God, maybe he doesn't care about art.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.480]   Maybe he doesn't care about that stuff that I care about. Then maybe as I explore, I'll
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:13.680]   find another direction. So, today, I want to explore with you what I've discovered so
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:22.320]   far. So, we're going to look at art and beauty as a theme. I know, I said I'm a teacher,
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.960]   right? So, I got to teach you these things in this kind of way so that all learners are
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:32.240]   included, all diverse learners in all these ways are included. So, you'll see graphs,
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:38.920]   you'll see pictures, I'll be talking. And that's what I do. So, we're going to go through
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:46.440]   the Bible. And when I look at themes, it's a theme because we see it across the Bible.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:51.760]   And the Bible is one narrative, not little stories picked out and put in a collection
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:59.760]   like fables. It has a beginning and it has an end. So, we'll look at creation. We'll
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:08.400]   look at the flood. Exodus, when God's people were taken out of Egypt as slaves. We'll look
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:17.120]   at the Psalms. And we'll look at parts of the New Testament. So, we're going to start
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:29.360]   from the beginning, the very beginning. So, in creation, the first thing we read is what?
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:36.120]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. Now, the earth was formless
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:43.080]   and empty. Darkness was over the surface of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:50.640]   over the waters. And God said, "Let there be light." And there was light. God saw that
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:58.000]   the light was good. And he separated the light from the darkness. God called the light day
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:08.400]   and the darkness night. And there was evening and there was morning, the first day. So,
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:16.400]   what I notice immediately here is that God is the original artist. He created something
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:23.960]   from nothing. So, if we look at art, you have a blank canvas and you put something on it.
[00:10:23.960 --> 00:10:30.840]   You look at a sculpture, there's stone, there's clay. It was a lump and the artist makes something
[00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:42.160]   out of it. Taylor Swift went from no song to a song. So, something was formless and
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:49.560]   was given form. Something was empty and it was being filled just by his word. There's
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:56.040]   a vision and there's an order and there's a plan for his creation. And he filled it
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:06.600]   layer by layer. In Genesis later, it says, "And God said, 'Let there be a vault between
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:12.360]   the waters to separate water from water.' So, God made that vault and separate the water
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:20.400]   under the vault from the water above it. And it was so. God called the vault sky. And there
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:27.880]   was evening and there was morning, the second day. And God said, 'Let the water under the
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:37.320]   sky be gathered into one place and that the dry ground appear.' And it was so. God called
[00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:50.080]   the dry ground land and the gathered waters he called seas. And God saw that it was good."
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:56.240]   So when we paint, whether it's on a canvas or a piece of wood, whatever it is, when we
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:03.200]   paint, we start out with something empty. And we have to paint from the background to
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:09.840]   the foreground, layer by layer. And you have to let it dry. If not, all the layers start
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:19.000]   combining and mixing. It gets all mixed up. And you can't tell each layer apart. So God
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:28.280]   first paints this background of the heavens and the earth. Then he adds the water, the
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:40.440]   sky, the land, plants, vegetation, seed bearing fruits, the flora. Then he hung luminaries,
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:52.800]   lights, the sun, the moon, the stars. More layers. The sky needs birds. All the fall.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:13:01.440]   The sea needs creatures. And the land, the livestock, everything creeping and crawling,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:10.160]   all the wild animals. Everything is there. And this is the beautiful painting God created
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:19.120]   with every detail from every vein of a leaf, every seed of a fruit, every crater in the
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:30.320]   moon, every feather in a bird, every fin on a fish, every spot, pattern on any creature,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:40.240]   any animal. And I think we can all say, if we look at God's creation in nature, wow.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:50.920]   What a design and what artistry. There's form, there's function, and there's finesse. So
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:56.280]   even in today's world, scientists, designers, and artists try to mimic what God created
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:06.960]   just by his word. Airplanes mimic birds. They call it biomimicry. So we have creations mimicking
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:13.720]   each other. Camouflage, where's that from? Things that scuba divers wear, where's that
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:24.200]   from? And we try to mimic it or even capture it with photographs, but we really can't capture
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:30.560]   all its majesty. So up until this point in creation, the earth is being filled and filled
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:43.520]   and filled as the backdrop for the last creation, humans. It's the only creation that God created
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:51.520]   in his own image. The scriptures say, "Then God said, 'Let us make mankind in our image
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:57.520]   and our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:01.960]   and the livestock and all the wild animals and all the creatures that move along the
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:09.080]   ground.'" So God created man in his own image. In the image of God, he created them. Male
[00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:17.200]   and female, he created them. And the Lord formed a man from the dust of the ground and
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:27.560]   breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. And the man became a living being. I think
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:34.880]   we've established pretty much that God is an artist, is a designer, is a creator here.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:45.400]   And every artist makes their mark. There's some sort of mark when you create. When you
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:53.040]   make the art, you mark it. This is Picasso's signature. We all recognize it as his mark.
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:16:03.980]   Not just his style, but his mark. Fancy Le Bouton shoes, underneath the red, ooh, a mark.
[00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:14.480]   This is a fake pair. Mid-century modern furniture, my favorite. What's the mark? The angled legs,
[00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:26.400]   the streamlined lines. That's a mark. God left a mark on all of his creation. And the
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:36.880]   biggest mark he made was on man. So only man was sculpted and molded from the dust of the
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:48.280]   ground. And the only creation given the breath of life. His own breath of life. So as humans,
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:55.440]   we're created in God's image. In his image. So I have kids. They're created in the image
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:17:03.200]   of my husband. They both are boys, and they both look like him and his brother. And people
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:12.640]   love to tell me that. Wow, he looks just like your husband. You are so correct. But I know
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:19.560]   they are mine. Because I birthed them out. And in certain angles and in certain lighting,
[00:17:19.560 --> 00:17:28.040]   with a certain smile, they sort of resemble me like 2%. So when they're created in our
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:34.120]   image, is it just what they look like? And of course we love that. We'll bring them.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:41.960]   Oh, look, this is my eyes. No. Oh, look, it's my nose. Also not my nose. So what I tell
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:48.120]   people is, yes, created in our image looks just like my husband and his brother. But
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:56.160]   all the insides are me. All that in there, me. So if we're created in God's image, we
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:06.480]   must share characteristics of our Father. And from what we just read in Genesis, in
[00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:13.640]   the beginning of the Bible, in the very beginning, God is a creator. God is an artist. So we
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   must possess creativity and artistry. But really, what's the point of having that? We're
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:29.040]   going to go say something and make some flowers appear? I don't have that power. So I don't
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:37.840]   have exactly what God has, but an image of it. But what's the goal of it all? Why? He
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:46.240]   recreated everything, didn't he? What's the point? So as I keep exploring, we've laid
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.560]   out the foundation in creation, right? So maybe as we look at this really pretty picture
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:19:01.360]   from up in the mountains looking, this creation is for enjoyment. It's so we can delight in
[00:19:01.360 --> 00:19:08.680]   God's creation, so God can delight in his own creation. That must be it. But what happened
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:17.360]   after creation? Adam and Eve were sent out of the garden. And then after generations,
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:24.360]   God's people were being corrupt and wicked and evil. God thought they were so evil, he
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:34.200]   regretted he made them. I never think that about my boys. Usually. He wanted to wipe
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:43.320]   them out with the flood. I just want to send them to the corner. But there's this one person
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:52.800]   he wanted to save. And that's Noah. Only Noah was righteous in the eyes of God. So he asked
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:59.880]   Noah to do something. Hey, Noah, I'm gonna wipe out the whole world with lots of water
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:04.120]   like a flood, but I'm gonna save you and your family. And this is what you're gonna have
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:17.160]   to do. Build a big boat. Like a really huge boat. So in scripture, he tells him exactly
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:23.320]   like what to do. Make it out of cypress wood, put rooms in it, coat it with pitch inside
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:30.560]   and out. Who's ever built a boat before? I've been in a boat. I've never had to make the
[00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:37.800]   boat that keeps me alive. Oh, and then it has to be 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide,
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:44.200]   30 cubits high. And make sure you have a roof on it. And below the roof, make sure there's
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:49.760]   an opening also one cubit high all around. Put a door on the side too. Make sure there's
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:58.720]   a lower, middle and upper deck. Oh, and after you're done with this big boat, put two of
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.760]   all living creatures in it, 'cause we're gonna save the moms and dads of all the animals.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.720]   Make sure you have every kind of food too, 'cause that's all you're gonna have to eat,
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:15.080]   you and your family. Whoa, dude. It's like getting a verbal blueprint of how to make
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:21.240]   this boat, but having no blueprint. So this picture of like, oh, there's A and there's
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:24.880]   A prime, there's B and B prime. And say, oh, don't forget C prime, prime, prime. And then
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:31.920]   this, I wouldn't know what to do. And I'm already good at math. I won't know what to
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:42.880]   do. No power tools. The scriptures say Noah did everything just as God commanded him.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:49.080]   Okay. So I don't know about you, but I wouldn't be able to know what to do about that. Can't
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:56.200]   even ask my spouse for help or my sons or anything, just me. But God knew, right? When
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:02.320]   he found Noah and asked him to build a boat, he knew he has craftsmanship. He knew he'd
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:13.440]   understand. So how does God use his talents? 'Cause this verbal blueprint is what designers
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:20.720]   do, is what architects do, is what contractors do, what builders do. Ultimately, Noah uses
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:31.600]   craftsmanship to obey the Lord out of obedience. So maybe that's like an objective of all this
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:41.760]   art and beauty stuff. To obey, to follow. Now, further on after the flood happened,
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:49.880]   let's look a little further for more examples. God's people were once enslaved by the Pharaoh.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:57.840]   And in Exodus, there is a different kind of ark that needs to be built. As God's people
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:03.960]   were saved by Moses, parting the Red Sea, going into this land, they were away from
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:12.400]   their country, they were away from a place. And God asked Moses, "Build a tabernacle."
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.880]   Tabernacle is a place where they can worship, a tent. It's very orderly. So if you look
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.640]   at the layout of a tabernacle, it's very symmetrical. There's lots of order. Who gets to be where
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:30.920]   and why. But inside this tent is an ark. Sort of like this. This isn't like the actual one,
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:37.880]   which is a model of it. But it's made of metal. It looks pretty intricate to me. You have
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:47.080]   to like know a lot of different things. And God said to Moses, "Oh, okay. I want you to
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:53.760]   make a tabernacle, a sanctuary, so I can dwell in it amongst my people. And make all the
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:24:00.880]   furnishings inside it, exactly like the pattern I'm about to give you." So pattern, design,
[00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:06.760]   blueprint. Patterns are what a lot of tailors and seamstresses use. You have to make it
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:15.560]   out of this wood, this high. Inside and out has to be pure gold. Put four rings for it.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:20.200]   Fasten it to four feet. Two rings on one side, two rings on the other. Oh, but don't forget
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.960]   the poles. Overlay it with gold. Insert the poles into the rings. Make sure you make an
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:35.760]   atonement cover of pure gold. Make sure it's this long and this wide. Wow. Man. Because
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:45.080]   if I were Moses, I'll be like, "What? How long is a cubit?" 17.5 inches long. How do
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.600]   you even measure a cubit? How do I make sure it's definitely that long, that wide, and
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:25:01.960]   that high? But don't worry. God has an answer. So in Exodus, we also read later, like a few
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:06.240]   chapters later, after all this direction, "Oh, I've already chosen people to take care
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:18.200]   of this. Don't you worry." God chose specifically, it says, "See, I have chosen Bezalel, son
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:23.520]   of Uri, the son of Hur, and the tribe of Judah. I filled him with the spirit of God, with
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:29.040]   wisdom, with understanding, with knowledge of all kinds of skills, to make artistic designs
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:34.580]   for work in gold, silver, and bronze, to cut and set stones, work in wood, and to engage
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:42.760]   in all kinds of crafts." He's like the Renaissance man. Like he can do everything. This is a
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:50.520]   true skilled artisan. Oh, and don't worry. I also appointed Aholiab, son of, I don't
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:56.200]   know how to pronounce this, Ahisamach, I don't know. But he's from the tribe of Dan, to help
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:03.600]   him. So Mr. Renaissance man isn't enough to make this sanctuary for the Lord. We need
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:09.580]   more skilled artisans. And don't worry, I've given ability to all skilled workers to make
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:22.100]   everything that I've commanded you. Wow. When's the last time you've heard of maybe a church
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:29.320]   or a place, an organization say, "Top priority, go get the artists." Number one, make sure
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:34.840]   we hire the artists and make sure we train them. Make sure they're skilled. Make sure
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:42.600]   they have all the support. I don't think that happens. Usually we go, "Make sure we hire
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:51.280]   the accountant. Make sure we have the CEO. Make sure we have the janitor." But that's
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:27:01.620]   not what's happening here. God is handpicking artisans out of everybody for very important
[00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:10.980]   work to build the tabernacle where he's going to dwell. The highest honor. But oftentimes
[00:27:10.980 --> 00:27:16.100]   these artisans, at least nowadays, are the outliers. When I say the word artisan, what
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:23.360]   do you think of? Bread. Art is no bread. Very good. I can't bake it. But it takes a long
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:31.980]   time to do it. I think of the really pretty baskets with the leather handles. Like, "Ooh,
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:36.680]   really pretty, really nice." I don't know how to weave it either. I don't even know
[00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:42.360]   how to sew my own clothes. I don't know how to do those things. I went to a wood shop
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:48.920]   at the park district. It took me three months to build a toy shelf for my child. Three months.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:55.340]   And then in two weeks, they were sick of it. I should have gone to IKEA. But I can't even
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:06.360]   build the IKEA shelf either. So God's saying, "I'm just going to pick these skilled artisans
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:18.460]   because they're my people of choice." And he treats them with priority and honor. Because
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:23.920]   this level of beauty, this level of art, this level of skilled craftsmanship is a level
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:32.440]   of excellence God deserves, wants, and requires. So art and beauty in this case isn't just
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:41.800]   for worship because the tabernacle is a place for worship. It's a form of worship. Because
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:48.120]   we want things to be excellent, high quality, and beautiful for God. And he even says that
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:55.660]   these people are blessed with this talent. Not everybody got it. And they've worked hard
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:29:02.500]   to develop this skill. Pure talent doesn't mean you can create. You need to practice
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:08.520]   and work hard. So these people are supported by everyone else in the community. These people
[00:29:08.520 --> 00:29:24.920]   were not picked. But I'm pretty sure someone's feeding these artists. So in this congregation,
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:37.360]   artisans were far from being ancillary. They were essential. The essential workers, basically.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:46.960]   Essential for worship. And I know nowadays in modern day church, we might not see worship
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:55.360]   in this way. Like I did not help Pastor Mark build this stage. I did not. I made the PowerPoint,
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:30:03.800]   but that's what I did. I didn't make the beautiful cityscape back there that Pastor Mark loves
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:11.440]   to build and create. When we think of the term worship, we usually think of music. So
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:21.120]   the songs that we sang, the music that we play on instruments, the DJ, which is pretty
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:26.800]   much all of Psalms in the middle of your Bible. That's what I was taught. I didn't grow up
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:31.320]   in the church, but when I went to my first Bible study, I couldn't figure out the order
[00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:37.400]   of all the books. And every time the teacher said, "Psalms, yes! Just open to the middle
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.160]   of the Bible, and I'll find it." And I always wondered why does it have to be in the middle.
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:49.880]   But it kind of makes sense. Because, well, these are songs, right? And in the Bible,
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:58.600]   we see when music is used, when instruments are used, it's for times of jubilee, celebration,
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.960]   the trumpets of Jericho falling down the walls. All you got to do, make some noise with your
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:09.800]   trumpets. Wow. But also in Psalms, in some of them, if you see, like in the beginning
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:16.480]   of Psalm 5, it tells you what instrument to use. Because Psalms are for music directors.
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:26.800]   It says, "Oh, use flutes with these. It'll be best." Wow. But what I want to focus on
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:39.520]   in Psalms is, yes, the melody instruments are nice, but really on the words, the lyrics.
[00:31:39.520 --> 00:31:47.600]   And I don't think we hear the lyrics or know the lyrics or absorb the lyrics as well, unless
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:53.620]   we're pretty familiar with the tune already. Like the songs we sang today, this morning,
[00:31:53.620 --> 00:32:01.560]   I knew one of them and I had to learn the other two. And I love it when I can sing along.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:15.240]   That brings me a lot of joy. But when I already know the tune, when I already know the music,
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:22.320]   I can't focus on the words. Because not every song is about joy and victory and happiness
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:31.520]   and fa-la-la, tra-la-la. A lot of songs, even the Psalms, the lyrics are about sadness,
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:41.280]   about fear, about anger. But everything is honest, authentic from the heart. So when
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:49.920]   words are written, either in prose or in poetry, accompanied by music or not, I think the objective
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:59.160]   of it is to share, to express. And worship music and worship songs are like a staple
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:06.040]   in modern day church service. So it's always in the beginning, it's always at the end when
[00:33:06.040 --> 00:33:11.840]   you respond to the teaching, the message. At least every Sunday service I've ever gone
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:20.600]   to. But why? Because the words serve to communicate and connect with what you just learned and
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:27.480]   what you just heard from the scripture. And in planning, you call it a response song after
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:35.800]   the sermon. Because it helps us respond to the Word of God. Not just praise Him, but
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:42.440]   respond like a conversation between us and God. So recall a very moving sermon I listened
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:50.720]   to one time, had to do with like our wickedness. It wasn't by Pastor Mark, but he also gives
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:56.560]   good sermons. But this one particularly talked about our wickedness, our wicked hearts, and
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:34:04.920]   all of us needed God's mercy. It was like cutting deep. And the response song after
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:13.280]   the sermon was the tried and true Amazing Grace. And even non-regular church goers might
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:23.880]   know the tune. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound. And then we got to these words, because
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:27.960]   I already knew, I knew how to sing it. I knew the tune. Got to these words, we got to the
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:37.240]   words, I was lost, but now I'm found, was blind, now I see, and then tears are flowing.
[00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:48.360]   I couldn't even control myself. And I felt it. And as much as I know it was the Holy
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:56.680]   Spirit resonating in me, it also reminded me of back in the day, because I'm kind of
[00:34:56.680 --> 00:35:04.160]   old, when you have to call the radio to pick a song. Radios have DJs, so it was not on
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:10.040]   demand. You had to wait for your song to be played on air, or else you can't hear it,
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   unless you happen to have the CD or the cassette tape. And it never fails when you ask the
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:22.680]   DJ for a song, probably for your crush, for your boyfriend, whatever, or maybe someone
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:30.960]   had called in about a heartbreak or something, the DJ picks a song in response to that situation.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:39.680]   And every time I listen to the radio, when that happens, it never fails to articulate
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:48.480]   those feelings. And when you hear your feelings being reflected in music, in words, in a song,
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:55.560]   it resonates. It comforts. It knows. At least to me, I know that I'm not alone. And that
[00:35:55.560 --> 00:36:05.760]   resonance is very powerful. All right. So, so far in the Bible, we talked about art being
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:17.640]   used to delight, to enjoy, to obey, to worship, communicate, connect. But art's art, right?
[00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:27.400]   Art could be kind of like anything. So what makes art beautiful? Because beauty seems
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:38.120]   sort of subjective, doesn't it? Like this watercolor looks beautiful to me. Is it the
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:43.240]   most beautiful piece of art I've ever seen? Is it the most beautiful piece of art you've
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:52.400]   ever seen? Would you not call it beautiful, but maybe just pretty? That's nice. That's
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:37:02.480]   interesting. Oh, I'm sure they really tried. Looks like a blob. What is it trying to say?
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:16.960]   I mean, the colors are pretty. Oh, it's very vibrant. How do we exactly define beauty?
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:26.520]   What's beautiful? I mean, in Exodus, when God was telling Moses what to build for the
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.200]   tabernacle, oh, there was purple, there was blue, there was colors, there were linens,
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:38.480]   there were tassels, there was gold. Wow. All the finest materials, down to the color, down
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:52.240]   to the fabric, it was defined. That kind of definition was beauty. And maybe sometimes
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:38:00.200]   we have certain rules that we follow. Maybe not too as specific as the parameters for
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:07.240]   the ark and the tabernacle, but we follow some sort of rules. So certain styles are
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:14.720]   trendy while others are classic. One color is in, like now, like mauve is really in,
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:20.160]   like beige is really in, grays, muted tones. But there was a period of time when neon was
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:26.800]   very in, like in the '80s. But maybe that's out now, or maybe it's coming back. So we
[00:38:26.800 --> 00:38:35.600]   judge beauty often within certain parameters. And in mathematics, there's something called
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:43.640]   the golden ratio. And mathematicians have discovered it in architecture, artwork, flowers,
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:50.720]   and nature. And that has to do with the proportion of the length and the width of something.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:58.440]   And usually that proportion ends up being about 1.6. Because these things are nice to
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.480]   look at when the length and the width and the proportions are about 1.6. So we have
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:08.640]   a photograph a little bit in the foreground and a lot in the background. So essentially
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:15.240]   we really like looking at rectangles. And we think they're really pretty to the eye.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:25.560]   So for a person's face, that ratio means the length is about 1.5 times the width. So more
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:31.760]   like a rectangle. I did not measure my face today. But some of us have longer faces, some
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:36.440]   of us have rounder faces, some of us have heart-shaped faces, some of us have broader
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:49.800]   faces. Not beautiful? More beautiful? Some people have said, "Well, you have a very symmetrical
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:56.040]   face if you put a line down the middle of your nose. If one side reflects perfectly
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:03.600]   on the other side, like Angelina Jolie. Beautiful. But if not, like one eye is bigger than the
[00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:12.960]   other, which I have. Not so pretty. So then in my pictures I have to angle. I want to
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:22.120]   show you, look at these photos of all these people. Different standards of beauty across
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:36.800]   cultures, norms, countries, generations. Who's most beautiful? Sometimes, in some places,
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:44.600]   lighter skin is beautiful. Sometimes darker skin, straighter hair, curly hair, coily hair.
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:48.160]   What if we go to different cultures? What if we don't show our skin? What if we paint
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:55.000]   our skin? We'll put markings on our skin, piercings on our skin. Is that still beautiful?
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:11.180]   I mean, the list goes on and on. Big eyes are more beautiful than small eyes. Snow white
[00:41:11.180 --> 00:41:17.560]   porcelain skin is really hit in Asia. So we have whitening creams, whitening masks, whitening
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:25.360]   this, whitening that. But you take that same Asian person and put them in a different context,
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:39.520]   tanner skin might be more in. Big eyes, small eyes, double eyelids, single eyelids, thick
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:47.880]   lips, thin lips, thick eyebrows, thin eyebrows. The list goes on and on and on and changes
[00:41:47.880 --> 00:41:56.400]   perpetually, time periods. At one point, fair and plump was really beautiful. And now it's
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:05.720]   skinny and dark. Sometimes it's voluptuous, like Beyonce. Sometimes it's not. And that's
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:17.800]   just for females. We haven't even talked about men yet. With this perpetually changing trend
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:27.520]   and beauty standards, what standards really stay true and can stand the test of time?
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:34.120]   So with all those different pictures, I think if I asked you who's the most beautiful, you
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:41.600]   might each pick a different face. Because it's based on preference. And beauty is in
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:52.840]   the eye of the beholder, isn't it? So if you were the beholder, you would pick what you
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:43:05.840]   prefer. But the ultimate beholder is God, is Jesus. And Jesus sees the beauty within.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:13.760]   In the New Testament, in the Gospels, we see Emmanuel, which means God with us. Jesus,
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:24.160]   God with us. Dwelling with us. So he basically kind of reset what's worthy, who's worthy,
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:31.560]   and where is worthy. He didn't go to the fancy places to see the fancy people. He didn't
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:40.080]   go to Michelin star restaurants. He went to where it was ugly and rejected. He met with,
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:46.880]   hung out with, cared for the dirtiest people. The prostitute who was criticized and judged
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:55.240]   for her profession, Jesus looked at her heart of faith. The tax collector seen as greedy,
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:44:13.840]   a liar, a cheat. Jesus looked at his heart for repentance and reverence for him. Even
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:20.040]   worship requirements kind of changed and got reset in the New Testament. In the Old Testament,
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:28.160]   we needed an ark to be like this. The tabernacle to be set up this way. We needed this, this
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:38.560]   high, this long, this wide, this color, that color. But those specific standards aren't
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:48.480]   so strict anymore because of Jesus. When Jesus died on the cross, there was like this earthquake.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:53.480]   In the Bible, it talks about a curtain tearing. The veil was torn from top to bottom, not
[00:44:53.480 --> 00:45:01.480]   bottom to top. And that veil was what separated people from God. Only the most holy and the
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:09.200]   most clean. And if you were to go in there, you'd die because you're not clean enough.
[00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:20.200]   Jesus changed all that. His death changed all that. We don't need these specific strict
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:28.320]   guidelines of what to craft, what to make, even though it's beautiful. But the focus
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:35.560]   is on the beauty of salvation and redemption instead. So things on the inside. So we have
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:42.440]   tons of examples, I think, throughout the Gospels on how inner beauty was emphasized.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:53.360]   But actually, we see that God was after our hearts from the beginning, after all. So that
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:57.400]   theme is actually carried, not just in the New Testament where it seems like things have
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:05.320]   changed, there's a turning point, but it runs in both Testaments. So who knows what this
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:17.480]   is about? Yes, my son is raising his hand. Yes, David and Goliath. Thank you for the
[00:46:17.480 --> 00:46:28.040]   applause. Little David beats big giant Goliath. We know the story. My boys love this story.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:34.000]   And I remind them that there's more to this story because the person of David is a key
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:41.360]   character in the whole Bible. David was a little guy who beat the big giant with the
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:50.840]   tiny stone. Classic hero. But not without help. I always ask my boys, how did David
[00:46:50.840 --> 00:46:57.800]   do that? Was he the strongest? Yep, there he is shaking his head. Was he the tallest?
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:07.520]   Nope. How did David do it when no one else dared? Yes, Ethan. Yes, because God was on
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:15.640]   his side. Their answers are so pure, aren't they? And confident because God was with him.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:28.200]   Because God. Yes. And also because David. David believed and had faith. Because all
[00:47:28.200 --> 00:47:34.920]   the other people, yeah, God was still there. But they didn't believe. They didn't have
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:44.680]   a heart of faith. Okay, now this is the victorious picture here. Just rewind a little bit, just
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:53.520]   a teeny bit. Before this happened, David was actually anointed king by Samuel. Because
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:48:00.040]   Saul was not going to be king and Samuel had to go to David's house. David's dad was Jesse.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:08.000]   And David had tons of brothers, older brothers. Stronger, taller, maybe more handsome. So
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.720]   Samuel had to bypass all those brothers because he thought, oh, that one is probably king.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:18.960]   That one's called tall and strong. He's pretty handsome too. But God's like, nope, not him.
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:26.480]   Keep going. Next brother? Nope, not him either. Man, none of them. Do you have any other sons?
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.920]   Yeah, we got like that. David, he's like out there somewhere taking care of the sheep.
[00:48:32.920 --> 00:48:43.880]   Go bring him in. For real? David? All right. That's him. Wasn't even what Samuel thought
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:51.840]   either, let alone Jesse. Because David didn't fit the bill of what we have an image of a
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:49:05.200]   king. But God chose David for his heart. And look what he did in the battle with Goliath.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:11.400]   And even when David became king, he committed a great sin. He took someone else's wife.
[00:49:11.400 --> 00:49:16.880]   I tell my boys, that's a big no-no. We do not take someone else's wife or someone else's
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:25.360]   husband. And then King David made plans for her husband to die in battle. That's like
[00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:34.800]   big no-no number two. And even amidst that grave sin, horrible sin, God looked at David's
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:48.040]   heart. So in God's eyes, the heart is huge, which puts a different perspective on beauty.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:54.640]   Because it's in the eye of the beholder, right? In David's case, I might look at him and go,
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:58.240]   "Oh my goodness, I can't believe he did that. I can't believe he did that with Bathsheba.
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:09.120]   I cannot believe it." And God still sees his heart. Yeah. But isn't it true that God's
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:21.600]   the ultimate beholder? He's really the only one. So I don't know about you, but I can
[00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:29.320]   be kind of shallow when it comes to looking at couples and celebrity couples. I like to
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:35.760]   see pretty people with other pretty people. And when that doesn't happen, in my eyes of
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:45.600]   course, I tend to criticize. Like, "Oh, she chose him." Or, "Oh, he chose her." I know,
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:55.560]   I'm shallow. I admit it. Yep. Like Hugh Jackman. Okay. So as superficial as it may sound, I'm
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:51:04.840]   speaking the truth of what I think and what I believe, right? Just based on outward appearances.
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:11.300]   But I fail to see in these celebrity couples is their inner beauty, which I would never
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:17.120]   be able to see, because all of my impression is based on their public image. So they may
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:25.600]   look really good, but you know what? Maybe they have the golden ratio face. I don't know.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:34.680]   But once you hear rumors of scandal, that pretty face is no longer pretty. Their beauty
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:43.760]   immediately plummets. But on the contrary, when you hear of a celebrity's loyalty, adopting
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:51.780]   dogs, rescuing babies, whoa, their beauty points skyrocket. They might not even have
[00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:57.480]   like a prettiest face, and it don't matter. All of a sudden, they're beautiful. Why does
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:52:05.560]   that happen, though? Do you think that inner beauty is visible on the outside? Does it
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:19.560]   change the person's face? Are things like kindness, humility, attractive? So attractive
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:27.600]   that it's more attractive and alluring than looks? So me and my husband have been married
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:36.280]   for a long time. And as I talk about being shallow about celebrity couples, I think about
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:42.520]   God looking at the heart, and then I have to ask myself, well, do I? Sometimes, sometimes
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:49.000]   not. In premarital counseling, the pastor asked us to read Peter, specifically the part
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:58.080]   that talks about wives, for me. First Peter, chapter 3, verses 3 to 5. "Your beauty should
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:04.400]   not come from outward adornment, such as elaborate hairstyles and the wearing of gold jewelry
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:12.600]   or fine clothes. Rather, it should be that of your inner self, the unfading beauty of
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:19.360]   a gentle and quiet spirit, which is of great worth in God's sight. For this is the way
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:25.320]   the holy women of the past, who put their hope in God, used to adorn themselves." I
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:33.320]   thought it was really funny and ironic, because all I could think about was my dress, my hair,
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:42.360]   my makeup, my bouquet, and all my accessories. But I get what the pastor was trying to say.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:50.360]   And, all joking aside, even though my nails were really important for that day, I understood
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:58.200]   what we're reading is important for all the days after the wedding day. And as time passes,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:03.520]   even though I think my husband is super cute, it was not the only thing that attracted me
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:13.160]   to him. And as time passes, we're almost at 15 years, and I've noticed since I was a kid,
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:21.800]   we've aged. And our looks have changed. Even though Asian don't raisin and beige don't
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:31.000]   age, I look younger than my age, but I have aged. And my looks have definitely changed
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:36.640]   from when we were dating, and especially from our wedding day, when I had lots of people
[00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:46.920]   helping me look a certain way. So as that change has occurred, it's really those character
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:54.180]   traits that we have to be attracted to. Although sometimes those same characteristics can really
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:55:01.320]   drive us crazy, it's really what continually is refined in our marriage and really carries
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:11.960]   us through. And I have to agree that that beauty from within is indeed precious and
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:25.140]   unfading. So we've kind of hopped through the whole Bible a bit to explore the theme
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:35.380]   of art and beauty in the scriptures, and the theme seems to be everywhere, shown in different
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:49.720]   ways. And all of this exploring has really shown me how much of a master artist God is.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:56:01.580]   So in the art world, when you talk about master artists, people say Rembrandt, Monet, Dali,
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:15.420]   Picasso. And I don't know if you've done a lot of art, maybe you have a practice of
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:21.740]   making art, or you know artists, but for me and some artists, mostly many of the artists
[00:56:21.740 --> 00:56:27.980]   that I know, we can spend days, weeks, or months on a piece, whether it's a painting,
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:36.540]   a picture, editing a photograph, designing something, a poster, whatever it is. When
[00:56:36.540 --> 00:56:47.180]   we step back and look at it, we appreciate what we made. It's not bad, it's pretty good.
[00:56:47.180 --> 00:56:52.980]   Keep fixing it. And when it's finally done, all done, maybe I'll put it in a frame, maybe
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:57:02.020]   I'll put it up somewhere, I celebrate the beauty of the artwork. And I call it good,
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:17.580]   like very good. I go rest, refresh, and realign. The next piece of art. To go back to creation,
[00:57:17.580 --> 00:57:25.380]   God saw everything he had made. And indeed, it was very good. So the evening and the morning
[00:57:25.380 --> 00:57:32.380]   were the sixth day. Thus the heavens and the earth, and all the host of them were finished.
[00:57:32.380 --> 00:57:37.620]   And on the seventh day, God ended his work which he had done. And he rested on the seventh
[00:57:37.620 --> 00:57:44.660]   day from all his work which he had done. And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified
[00:57:44.660 --> 00:57:56.220]   it. Because in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made. So unless
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:58:02.180]   we're commissioned to do a specific piece, like a portrait or draw my old house or something
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:09.020]   like that, artists don't really need their art pieces to be beautiful to you or anyone
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:17.860]   else. Because it's meaningful and beautiful to themselves. That's why they do it. So when
[00:58:17.860 --> 00:58:23.540]   I go to the Art Institute and go, I gotta go see the Monet exhibit, so beautiful. Gotta
[00:58:23.540 --> 00:58:28.020]   go to Paris, go to the Louvre. When my husband and I went for our 10th anniversary to Paris,
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:33.900]   I've never been, went to the Louvre. And there was a huge line for Mona Lisa. But the painting
[00:58:33.900 --> 00:58:39.300]   is actually quite small. Like in the textbooks, like it feels like it could be really big
[00:58:39.300 --> 00:58:45.300]   because you only see it on the page. You get there, it's like, I'm like 12th row from like,
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:56.180]   where is it? It's like, just like a regular sized portrait. And everyone's staring at
[00:58:56.180 --> 00:59:04.820]   it, talking about it. I'm not really sure if the artist cares what we think about Mona
[00:59:04.820 --> 00:59:12.740]   Lisa. But we really care about talking about it. So if I were to put like examples from
[00:59:12.740 --> 00:59:26.060]   artists like Picasso, Michelangelo, Da Vinci, Van Gogh, Monet, Cicel, Andy Warhol, abstract
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:32.180]   painters, installations that have one piece of stone on a pedestal and you walk away,
[00:59:32.180 --> 00:59:44.620]   new installations. I think we would all agree that it's all art. And objectively, all impeccable.
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:52.460]   But regardless, I don't think we would agree on which one's the best, or the most beautiful.
[00:59:52.460 --> 00:59:59.980]   And the artist frankly doesn't care. The maker of each piece of artwork didn't create it
[00:59:59.980 --> 01:00:06.180]   for you or for me, but for himself. So the maker already knows the purpose and the value
[01:00:06.180 --> 01:00:13.620]   of every piece that anyone else outside would never be able to clearly see. The maker is
[01:00:13.620 --> 01:00:20.340]   the beholder of the beauty and the creative process it took to make that holds a lot of
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:28.700]   feelings and stories of inspiration behind every piece. Therein lies the beauty, the
[01:00:28.700 --> 01:00:41.340]   inner beauty that only the artist knows very well. God is our maker, our creator, our artist,
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:46.860]   we are his creation. We're his art piece. In the Bible there's this analogy of the potter
[01:00:46.860 --> 01:00:59.020]   and the clay and Jeremiah. Who's ever done pottery class here? Like two. Who's ever seen
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:06.980]   someone do pottery before? Oh, like four, five. Who's ever watched a YouTube video of
[01:01:06.980 --> 01:01:23.180]   pot? Oh, okay, maybe 10. So it's messy. It's messy. Here's what happened in Jeremiah. The
[01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:27.900]   word came to Jeremiah from the Lord saying, "Hey, arise and go down to the potter's house
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:32.260]   and there I'll cause you to hear my words." So then I went to the potter's house and there
[01:01:32.260 --> 01:01:39.660]   he was making something at a wheel. The vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:44.860]   of the potter. So he made it again into another vessel and it seems good to the potter to
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:52.300]   make. So when you start making pottery, you throw clay, it kind of looks like this. You
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:58.500]   have a big clump, you want to make it wet, you put it on the wheel and it spins. Oh,
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:06.660]   you better start holding that clay. You have to put pressure on it. Not enough pressure,
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:17.820]   everywhere. Too much pressure, clump. Your hands shape it with pressure, with angling
[01:02:17.820 --> 01:02:31.020]   and sensitivity. Why was he told to go see the potter and the clay? Then the word came
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:37.100]   to him after he saw this. So if you can imagine, this is what Jeremiah is seeing. "Oh, house
[01:02:37.100 --> 01:02:44.660]   of Israel, can I not do with you as this potter?" says the Lord. "Look at the clay is in the
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:56.060]   potter's hand, so are you in my hand, oh house of Israel." So very experienced potters can
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:03:06.380]   do this. Make cups, make vases, many shapes, many heights, no problem. But should it happen,
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:12.920]   like a scripture is saying, it's marred, you messed up, darn it. You can still make corrections,
[01:03:12.920 --> 01:03:16.940]   you can remold the clay, a different shape, a different vessel. Until the potter chooses
[01:03:16.940 --> 01:03:25.300]   to glaze and fire, complete creative control over what the final outcome would be. So to
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:35.100]   me, that means we, being the clay, are continually being molded by the potter, being God. So
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:44.020]   we have to trust his hands to make us into vessels he's pleased with. Because the clay
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:56.100]   can't really talk back. Can't be like, why'd you make me like this? I was really intrigued
[01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:04.180]   by this pottery metaphor and this analogy, so I found in Romans 9, Paul reminds the people,
[01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:10.340]   puts them in their place, like you know your clay, right? And he says, "Does not the potter
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:16.380]   have the right to make out of the same lump of clay some pottery for special purposes
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:28.620]   and some for common use?" So I have no idea how God is going to mold me or mold you, and
[01:04:28.620 --> 01:04:37.420]   mold us, and I'm not sure what type of vessel you would be or I would be. I definitely don't
[01:04:37.420 --> 01:04:44.460]   know fully how to define common or special use, especially in this context. But what
[01:04:44.460 --> 01:04:54.900]   I do know is that God is an artist who makes beautiful things. So from his hands, some
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:05:02.860]   of us were given the talents of artistry, and we need to use them in obedience, to worship,
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:09.140]   praise, and connect. Maybe you don't consider yourself an artist, a designer, a maker, a
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:15.900]   painter, a sculptor, a musician, a singer, an actor, a poet, whatever you deem an artist
[01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:24.340]   to be. But do know that you were created as an art piece, and you were created by an artist,
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:32.820]   by design, which means you were created to be creative. And we were all created to admire
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:42.220]   and nurture beauty, both inside and out. So I encourage you to pause more often, step
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:50.660]   back and appreciate not just God's artistry, but also your own. Notice what is around you.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:57.420]   Take time to value art, value beauty, and value yourself. Because we often spend a lot
[01:05:57.420 --> 01:06:04.340]   of time nurturing quantitative, measurable things. Like I'm on a diet right now, because
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:09.540]   Thanksgiving, Christmas, Chinese New Year really hit me bad. But how do I quantify my
[01:06:09.540 --> 01:06:16.060]   progress? Inches, pounds, I wish it weren't pounds, it would be just like milligrams,
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:21.380]   that would be way more success and achievement there. But we spend a lot of time doing those
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:25.220]   things. How many hours did I sleep? How many hours did I work out? How many hours did I
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:32.380]   work? Blah, blah, blah. Quantitative, measurable. But since art and beauty are so highly valued
[01:06:32.380 --> 01:06:41.180]   by God, how about we try to nurture that part of us too? So to be corny, WWJD. Who knows
[01:06:41.180 --> 01:06:49.340]   what that means? No one has ever seen that on a bracelet before. So when I was growing
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:53.580]   up in church, which I didn't grow up in church, people were wearing these bracelets that say
[01:06:53.580 --> 01:06:58.860]   WWJD. What would Jesus do? T-shirts, hats, bracelets, everywhere. I was like, what the
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:06.660]   heck is that? What would Jesus do? I don't know, die? I don't know. Why are you wearing
[01:07:06.660 --> 01:07:15.700]   this? But really it's to remind us in every case, what would Jesus do? And in our theme
[01:07:15.700 --> 01:07:21.740]   and topic today, I believe Jesus will look for the beauty in the ashes, beauty in the
[01:07:21.740 --> 01:07:29.020]   everyday things, and the beauty in everybody, the beauty in people. Because after all, that's
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:35.780]   what artists do. So I started off this morning wondering what value God placed on art and
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:44.260]   beauty in hopes to affirm myself as an artist. And I think I found what I was looking for,
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:48.900]   and I hope you found something too. Thank you.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:58.460]   Thank you very much. Thank you very much for insightful sermon. And I want to pray together.
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:08:05.340]   Can we? Yeah. Let's all pray. Father, we give you thanks because you are the master artist.
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:11.900]   Thank you for creating this universe in such beauty. Thank you for the sunrise. Thank you
[01:08:11.900 --> 01:08:19.860]   for all the things that we can see and touch. And thank you so much for making us in your
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:27.260]   image. And thank you for your reminder that we can be creative and we are made to be so.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:32.660]   And I pray that we will worship you in this way to appreciate what you have created. And
[01:08:32.660 --> 01:08:37.380]   most of all, appreciate what you do and who you are. Thank you for being our beautiful
[01:08:37.380 --> 01:08:45.660]   God and our mighty God in Christ. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for the insightful.
[01:08:45.660 --> 01:08:52.700]   We should invite her to come back, right? Yeah. And such a great perspective. And by
[01:08:52.700 --> 01:08:59.860]   the way, I didn't make that cityscape. Irene did. Yeah. So praise God for that. And Willie
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:04.900]   did. We really appreciate the presence of artists. And as I told you a couple of weeks
[01:09:04.900 --> 01:09:10.540]   ago, people walk into this space, come to our cafe, they appreciate the beauty of it.
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:16.220]   And it's not my job. I'm no artist. And because of some of the artists in our team, in our
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:22.740]   church who have created this beautiful space, right? Let's do so. Let's put to work and
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:27.940]   be more creative and appreciate God's creation. All right? So today we have the fellowship
[01:09:27.940 --> 01:09:35.300]   in the afternoon, right? And we're going to start. So you're invited to join us. All right.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:38.540]   So I want to see you next Sunday and God bless you and you're dismissed.
