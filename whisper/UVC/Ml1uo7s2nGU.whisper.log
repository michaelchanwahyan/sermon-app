[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   about that. So we are in a very new series because we are nine year old. We have already
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:13.600]   celebrated our ninth year last Sunday and I know many of you were here with us and all
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:22.280]   the Easter Sundays are the church's anniversary. So we are nine years old and because we're
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.560]   coming to a new year, the ninth year of UV in our church, we would like to do something
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.600]   special this coming year. So in this coming year, we are going to centre on one theme,
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:42.720]   going to centre on one topic and this theme, this topic is called "Crossover". Now what
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.240]   is this? Okay, so you can see the logo is very beautifully written out, right? I hope
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.280]   this coming year you will know how to sign this. It's a cross and there's a heart and
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:05.600]   we're going to go out, right? And that's what we mean by crossover, alright? Qua yue, transform,
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.720]   to go beyond our comfort zone and that's the first thing we want to do. We all have our
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.800]   own comfort zone, right? Our emotional comfort zone, our social comfort zone and our own
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.440]   physical comfort zone, especially after the pandemic, right? Everyone seems to be suffering
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.800]   from social anxiety, right? Don't come near, okay? I want to be myself, okay? I want to
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:40.520]   just be isolated, right? And the Bible challenges if we are in the love of God, if we are in
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.200]   the grace of God, we need to leave our own comfort zone and that means we need to grow,
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.000]   okay? There are many ways we need to grow, emotionally, socially, spiritually, relationally,
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.080]   all kinds of things. We need to leave our comfort zone. So when I say comfort zone,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.120]   you probably will automatically think of some of the things that you try to keep to yourself
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.560]   and that may be our comfort zone and in this coming year we want to challenge you, we want
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:16.160]   to remind you to step out of your comfort zone, alright? The second thing here is to
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.120]   join with other followers of Jesus Christ. In our church there are many sisters and brothers
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.560]   from different backgrounds, speak different languages. I told you last year I had the
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.480]   goal of improving my Chinese, right? Yeah, the goal failed, okay? But this year it's
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.200]   going to be my goal as well, okay? I'm going to improve my Mandarin speaking skill, okay?
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:50.360]   I will continue to do that, alright? I may have said many funny things but I will head
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.640]   on, okay? I will continue to improve. So to join with other followers of Jesus Christ
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.720]   is to grow together, right? How do I improve my Chinese skill? By talking to you, right?
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.880]   And you talk back to me. And we have conversations and we have fellowship and we build our relationship
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:16.320]   together and we try to build a community to join with other followers of Jesus. That's
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:24.640]   the number two. Number three is that if our church continues to grow, if we experience
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:30.160]   the grace of God and we leave our comfort zone and join with others to build a church,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.960]   then we will have more potential, our redemptive potential to reach other people for Christ,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:40.360]   other neighbours for Christ. So that's the three things I want to remind you this coming
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:44.880]   year. We're going to remind you every single week almost. Leave your comfort zone. Pray
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.040]   that God will give you strength so that I can grow and leave my comfort zone and join
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.080]   hands with other people and reach out with the gospel, with the love of Christ. And God
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:04:01.680]   is calling us this year, the ninth year, to grow deeper, to deepen our unity, alright?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.160]   How can we unite together? We have to get to know each other. We have to speak to one
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:12.240]   another and we have to boldly engage in sharing the gospel to our neighbours. So this will
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:20.360]   be a year long focus and we want to take some of the passages from the book of Acts week
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.280]   after week. And we're going to preach and we're going to do Bible study on the book
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:30.080]   of Acts. You know how many chapters are in the book of Acts? How many chapters altogether?
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.920]   28. 28 chapters, alright? So that should be enough for us, right? There's a lot of materials.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.320]   And as you understand, the book of Acts is about the early history, early movement of Jesus'
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.920]   followers, the very first generation and what did they do. And the book of Acts is all about
[00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:55.640]   how they leave their comfort zone and to join with other people and to use the gospel and
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.880]   take the gospel to a farther end of the earth. So again, we will do sermons and we will do
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:09.160]   Bible study. We'll do a lot of things, you know, take materials from the book of Acts.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:16.360]   And today we would like to take a moment to think about what the book of Acts is all about.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:23.720]   Alright? Understand the bigger picture. Now in the book of Acts chapter 1, right from
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:31.440]   the beginning, it is Jesus rose from the dead and he stayed with his disciples for 40 days.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:37.200]   And he taught them about the kingdom of God. And there's a kingdom of God, there's a reign
[00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:44.600]   of God coming to his people. And that is the kingdom project, so to speak. And this kingdom
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:54.880]   project is a huge project. Acts 1.6. It says, "So when they had come together, the disciples,
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:01.040]   and Jesus, after Jesus rose from the dead and before he ascended to heaven, those 40
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.880]   days they had come together, the disciples asked Jesus a question. It's a very legitimate
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:15.000]   question. They said, "Lord Jesus, will you at this time restore the kingdom of Israel?"
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:22.160]   That's a legitimate question. Because every Jewish boy and girl is dreaming of the restored
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:29.800]   kingdom of heaven, restored kingdom of Israel. You know, in the good old days, in the times
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.240]   of David, King David, thousand years before Jesus, there was a kingdom, right? There was
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:44.720]   a political entity that they enjoy independence and freedom. And that's what they had in mind.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.800]   And they asked Jesus, "Hey, is it at this time because you rose from the dead and the
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:56.640]   kingdom project has begun, and it's this time that you're going to restore the fallen, the
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:02.840]   lost kingdom of Israel?" They asked Jesus that, and Jesus said to them, "It is not for
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:11.280]   you guys to know the times or the seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority."
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:18.840]   Alright, so he answered the question saying, "It's not for you to determine the time and
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:25.160]   the manner of the kingdom." So as I said, being Jewish in their blood, the disciples
[00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:31.120]   were thinking and dreaming about maybe Jesus would restore that kingdom of David, the political
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:38.040]   state of Israel. However, if you read on how Jesus replied to the disciples' questions,
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:45.000]   God has a bigger, bigger plan for his kingdom. God was about to launch a kingdom on earth.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Yes, yes, it can be called Israel, but this kingdom is not just a plot of land on the
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:59.760]   globe. This kingdom will be reaching to the ends of the earth. So God has a bigger plan
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.960]   for us. God has a bigger plan for the disciples. So I want you to think about this, okay? Think
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:14.520]   about what God wants from you. If God, in the Son of Jesus, in the Son of God, Jesus,
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:22.840]   rose from the dead, what does he want from you? And you have that new life. And God has
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:29.160]   a bigger plan for you. Now you may think, "Okay, I just attend church. I just attend
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:34.200]   Bible study, eat with other people. They have good food. Today we have good food. That's
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:41.200]   why we come. That's our dream. Maybe today, this morning you wake up, and that's all you're
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.600]   coming in for, right? Coffee, food, all this stuff. Maybe some lovely people here." But
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:55.680]   God has a bigger plan. I remember when I was younger, I'm already over 50 years old. I
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:05.200]   remember when I was 20 years old, I started going to church, and I had my own job. I graduated
[00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:11.880]   with a biochemistry degree, and I was working in the chemistry lab back many years ago in
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:17.120]   California. And I thought, "No, my goal is just to, okay, every week I'll attend the
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:21.440]   church. Of course, that's my basic, right? I'll do that. No problem." But that's pretty
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.160]   much it. I have my own job, and I have my own comfort life, and that's my comfort zone,
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.640]   right? And maybe here and there I try to help out, try to help out with the worship team,
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:38.360]   or try to help out with the backstage, try to help out with being an usher, anything
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.840]   I can do. But obviously, God has a bigger plan for me, right? And God has a bigger plan
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:54.760]   for you. I remember when we started and launched this church nine years ago, right here, last
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:10:01.040]   week some of you were here, and you saw some of the pictures, right? And we were an empty
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:09.920]   warehouse nine years ago. And I thought, "Okay, we'll just begin a local church, right? We'll
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:16.240]   stay small, you know, we'll do a little bit of things here and there, and that's it, right?"
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:26.560]   But little by little, God is showing us what He has in store for us. And I just never thought
[00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:34.680]   of or never expected that we would come to this day, right? Especially through the years
[00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:41.400]   of pandemics. Oh, those were very chaotic times, right? I remember we came here to pack
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:48.640]   up everything, you know, the sound equipment, the audio interface, and you know, those hardware,
[00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:53.280]   and we move it back to my home so that we can do live stream. And it was for a long
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:11:01.860]   time it was chaotic. But we come back after years of pandemic, and our online presence
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:09.300]   has been growing bigger. So that's why I'm saying God has something bigger for His people
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:20.160]   and for our church, right? So God wants to launch a kingdom, not in the political sense,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:25.160]   but in the spiritual sense. But look at you guys, right? Where are you from? Some of the
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.160]   early conversations that we have with some of the new friends here is that, "Where are
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:35.600]   you from?" Right? Yeah, where's your hometown? We all come from different hometowns, different
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   places, different background, we speak different languages, we have different cultures. But
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:47.240]   you know, God has this bigger plan for all of us and draws us together, all right? Now
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.600]   I want to repeat this. I want to remind you and emphasize this. If you want to choose
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.400]   your good friend or best friend, you wouldn't choose me, all right? And I wouldn't choose
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:03.960]   you, to be honest, okay? Because we're so different, okay? Okay, maybe you find me being
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:10.800]   a good friend, okay? But all I'm saying is God in His will put us together for a bigger
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:16.040]   purpose, you see? It's not by my choice, it's not by your choice, ultimately it's God's
[00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:21.520]   own choice and it's the Spirit's will to put us together as a body of Christ, as a church
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:27.360]   community and we can do something for God. And God does have a bigger plan for you and
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:33.320]   for me and for our church. So what does the Kingdom Project look like, all right? So Jesus
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:39.680]   is trying to answer this question. And let me break it down. Jesus in the book Acts chapter
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:45.960]   1 is trying to explain to the disciples, this is what God wants to do. This is what the
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:51.860]   Kingdom of God looks like. Number one, every person will be called to believe in the name
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:56.960]   of Christ. To come under the cross, at the foot of the cross, we believe the gospel and
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:02.320]   so that we are transformed by the love of God, by the grace of God. That's number one.
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:11.440]   Each of us, each and every one of us, has experienced God's salvation at the cross in
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:17.400]   many different ways but there's a common ground for all of us. We are all in Christ. We are
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:24.400]   all loved by God. We all belong to the sons and daughters of the Kingdom. That's number
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.160]   one. Number two, the Kingdom Project is all about each and every one of us, after we experience
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:35.960]   the transformation of the love of God, is joined together with other people, with other
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:44.800]   believers and we combine together, we grow the church body, the community together, right?
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:49.280]   And then ultimately, it's not for us. It's not that, okay, we are a happy family and
[00:13:49.280 --> 00:13:54.000]   then we're going to close the door and we enjoy our time. We're going to reach out to
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.120]   share the gospel to the ends of the earth. And that is the Kingdom Project God has in
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:07.840]   mind. So Jesus is challenging his disciples, his church. Hey, yes, I'm going to launch
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.680]   a new kingdom but this new kingdom is not about a plot of land that you can put a GPS
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:21.240]   on, on the map. It's not a small plot of land in Israel-Palestine. He's explaining, trying
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:28.040]   to expand the vision of the disciples. Hey, God's kingdom is so much bigger. And that's
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:37.240]   why Jesus continues. He said, "But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come
[00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:45.560]   upon you. And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all of Judea and Samaria, and
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:52.440]   to the end of the earth." You see, this is so much bigger, right? This is so much bigger
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:59.280]   than struggling for a small piece of land. It is sending us out as individuals who are
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:07.240]   transformed by the grace of God and dot the map of the whole world. From where? From Jerusalem,
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:14.720]   wherever they were at, their comfort zone, their starting point, to all of Judea and
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:23.600]   Samaria and to the end of the earth. And that's what the kingdom is all about. Now you may
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:31.000]   say this is a kingdom project beyond our ability, right? I mean, who can do this, right? I mean,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:37.280]   if you do a company startup, right, you wouldn't think, "Okay, wow, wow, we have to be a global
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:44.200]   company," right? At least in the beginning period of the company. But that's what Jesus
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:52.760]   has in mind. Go to the end of the earth. Is it even possible, you may say, if I were one
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:16:00.640]   of the disciples, I would probably ask the question is, "Who am I? Who are we?" Right?
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.000]   We're just ordinary people and we're weak and poor, we are limited, we don't have a
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:15.280]   lot of resources, right? At times we do wonder, I mean, how can we do that, right? I mean,
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:20.760]   how many of you have been a Christian for some years, for some time? Yeah? Quite many
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:26.560]   of us, right? And sometimes we don't even have the courage to tell other people we are
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:32.360]   Christians, right? You have moments like this in your workplace, in your school, in your
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:37.720]   family. Sometimes, okay, before meal we have to pray, right? That's the right thing to
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:43.120]   do, right? But sometimes we just do a three second or two second pray, right? We don't
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.240]   want people to look at us. We don't want people to see that we are weird, right? We don't
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:59.240]   want to stand out, right? However, that's what Jesus had in mind. To give you power.
[00:16:59.240 --> 00:17:06.040]   It's not because you have the resource to do it, but God is going to send the Holy Spirit
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:12.320]   to give you power and ability and capacity to do that. To bring the gospel to the end
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:21.840]   of the earth. I remember some years ago I was in another church, in my previous church,
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:30.540]   in the West Coast. I met this very successful businessman in my church, in the West Coast.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:36.400]   And he is like, I get to know him and he's the most articulate person I've ever known,
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:44.760]   right? He's a multi-billionaire company businessman. And he knows how to talk. He knows how to
[00:17:44.760 --> 00:17:50.280]   present, you know. You may have watched or listened to some of the talks on TED, right?
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:56.880]   On TED. The TED talk, the professional kind of, you know, presentation. And this businessman
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:05.680]   is one of those people. And he is so gifted and he's so resourceful. But when he came
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:16.000]   to Christ, he became a Christian. And of course he knew a lot of different platforms. He can
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:22.160]   share the gospel, right? In his workplace, with his co-workers and employees. He can
[00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:28.640]   bring a lot of people to church, right? But, you know, for a long this time, since he became
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:37.160]   a Christian, you know, he didn't even tell his co-workers that he was a Christian. Nobody
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:42.600]   knew in his workplace that he became a Christian and he was saved by grace. Nobody knew for
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:49.040]   a very, very long time. And then, you know, after he has grown so much spiritually, of
[00:18:49.040 --> 00:18:53.640]   course he has changed, but, you know, we ask him, "Why didn't you tell other people your
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:59.440]   question? Is it your identity, your spiritual identity?" You know why he said? He said,
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:07.680]   "I'm scared. I'm scared. I don't have the guts. I don't have the courage to do it."
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:16.720]   See, that is what is at stake here. Jesus is saying, "You cannot be my witness with
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:22.960]   your own strength. You don't have the guts. You don't have the boldness. You don't have
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:31.280]   the strength to be my witness. However, I'm going to send you my Holy Spirit. God himself
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:39.920]   will live in you." And Jesus knew that his disciples were weak. They were actually defeated
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:44.880]   at the cross, right? They were all scattered. They didn't have the guts to stand up for
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:52.720]   the kingdom. However, everything has changed since Jesus' resurrection. He's going to launch
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:20:00.320]   a new kingdom. And Jesus knew that we were weak. And God knows it. So God provides the
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:08.640]   resource. The Holy Spirit. God doesn't give us the money. God doesn't give us the ability
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:14.440]   to articulate, to communicate. No. All these things are secondary. But the most important
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:21.360]   thing is in your core, in your life, God's Spirit is giving you the power and courage,
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:29.480]   the ability to share the gospel, to be his witnesses. Let's center on that word. Witness.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:39.800]   Witness. Witness is someone who's being called upon to the court of law to provide a testimony,
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:47.360]   to tell the truth. And that is our identity, right? That is our identity. So Jesus said,
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.720]   "I'm going to provide you with that resource. If you tap into that resource, then you will
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:58.280]   begin to know that you have the power to be my witness." In the beginning of the chapter,
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:08.920]   verses four and five, Jesus said, I probably missed one of the, yeah, I think I did. Anyways,
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.160]   Jesus said what? "The power of the Spirit will come upon you." Now, what analogy I can
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:22.320]   use to describe the work of the Holy Spirit. Now, the Holy Spirit, the power of the Holy
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:30.400]   Spirit, it's like gasoline, okay? Gasoline for your car, okay? Many of us have your own
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:36.000]   cars, right? So if you drive a Tesla, some of you drive BMW, very nice car, right? Or
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.240]   you walk into our church, welcome. There are nice cars out there, okay? Please don't scratch
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:47.440]   it, don't touch it. They don't belong to me, okay? Nice car, right? But if you have a nice
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:56.040]   car, you don't have gasoline, you can go nowhere. You can wax it, you can clean it, right? But
[00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:04.360]   the car will not move until you fill it with power and gasoline, or electricity for your
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:11.920]   TV. And that's what the Holy Spirit is all about, is to give you the internal power to
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:22.480]   walk the journey of faith, to be Jesus' witnesses. So what did the disciples do? They did return
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:30.080]   to Jerusalem and obey the commands of Jesus. They stayed in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:36.600]   comes upon them. And they had the power to preach the gospel. So at the end of this sermon,
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:43.560]   I want to conclude with some of the thoughts, okay? Some of the thoughts are some of the
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:53.280]   homework for you, alright? Now these are your homework, okay? This week, this coming week,
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:23:03.240]   think about it. Name a person or a face that you know who has not known the name of Jesus.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:08.640]   Not the question yet, right? Maybe heard about it, maybe never heard about it. Think of a
[00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:16.400]   name, okay? Not a question. That God places that name, that person, in your heart. Think
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:24.080]   about this person. And then every single week, every single day of this week, set aside five
[00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:33.280]   minutes of your time. Each day, five minutes, to pray for that person, okay? Just pray for
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:41.120]   that person. That God will work in his heart or her heart, in his life or her life. That
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:49.200]   he or she will be brought to Jesus. So when you pray, pray for boldness as well. Because
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:55.240]   remember what Jesus said to the disciples? "You will be my witness." Jesus didn't say,
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.680]   "Okay, somebody else will be my witness." Okay, so you sit back, okay? You sit on the
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:06.400]   lazy boy, alright? You enjoy. No. You step out of your comfort zone and you pray the
[00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:13.640]   bold prayer. You know a lot of prayers that we utter to God are very safe prayers, right?
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.360]   We want to be safe, right? "God, I'm out of money. Give me some money." Right? "God, I'm
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:23.920]   sick. You know, heal me. Recover me." "God, I'm laid off. You know, give me a job." Those
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   are very, very safe prayers, legitimate prayers. But those are really, really safe because
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:34.440]   it doesn't challenge you, right? God's mind is bigger than your mind. God's plan is bigger
[00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   than your plan. And God's plan for your life is much bigger than what you can think of.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:46.680]   Much bigger than your safe prayers. Pray the bold prayer. When you pray this week, every
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   single week, pray that God will give you courage to speak. To be a good witness for Christ.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:25:01.200]   Pray that God will give me strength, okay? To live for Jesus. Until you pray that prayer,
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:09.280]   you will be a nice car without the gasoline, okay? You need to add some gasoline, alright?
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:15.520]   You need to add the power of the Holy Spirit. Come on, guys. Pray that God will help you
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:22.520]   speak. Help you relate to the other person. Have you ever prayed like that? The risky
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:30.320]   prayer. But it's a prayer full of God's power. It's a prayer full of God's vision. That He's
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   going to send you out to be the witness for Christ. So may this be our final prayer. God,
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:46.640]   dear God, give me the power to live for you. Give me the power to be your witness. Give
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:53.080]   me the power, the strength to share the gospel to the other person, your friend. Maybe your
[00:25:53.080 --> 00:26:00.080]   family member. Someone who God has put in your heart, okay? This is our final prayer.
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:08.120]   Let's all pray like that, alright? I'll give you some time as we play the music background.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:15.320]   Who is that that God plays in your heart, okay? Maybe someone close to you, maybe someone
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:22.320]   in your workplace. Anyone. God has put a face and a name in your heart. Let's all pray.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:32.040]   Let's all pray together. At this moment, spend 30 seconds, one minute to pray for that person.
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:54.160]   Dear Jesus, we come before you. We are weak and we are limited. We are small and we feel
[00:26:54.760 --> 00:27:01.760]   insignificant just like the first disciples felt. And yet we know that you have promised
[00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:11.000]   the Holy Spirit to be with us. You have sent your Holy Spirit, your power and your ability
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:19.880]   in our hearts to motivate us, to move us so that we step out of our comfort zone to share
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:30.000]   the gospel to other people. And Jesus, we pray that in your grace and your love, transform
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   us continuously. Help us to move from fear to courage. Help us not to be timid, but have
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:48.320]   the boldness because we do have the boldness in Christ. So I pray that you will use us
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:55.320]   in this week as we pray about the person you put in our heart. And I pray that we will
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   pray the whiskey prayer. We'll do something boldly for your kingdom. Thank you for your
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:10.880]   grace that we belong to your kingdom. All because of what Jesus has done for all of
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:17.200]   us. Thank you for your eternal love and your eternal grace. And I just pray that in this
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:23.520]   week you will be with us, you send us into our Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the end
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   of the earth. That we'll be your witnesses. And may you continue to grace us so that our
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:36.840]   church will continue to grow and our lives will continue to grow. Our heart will continue
[00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:43.840]   to be expanded, expanded with your love and your grace. To love like you do. To let us
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:50.840]   know like you do. To relate to other people like you do. So send us out so that we can
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:29:00.240]   continue to build your kingdom. To be part of your kingdom project. What a privilege.
[00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:06.320]   What an opportunity. What a blessing that we can share this project together. So may
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:11.160]   you continue to bless our church, to bless each and every one of us. May we rise above
[00:29:11.160 --> 00:29:17.320]   our challenges and our issues and our problems. To rely on your power, the power of the Holy
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:24.320]   Spirit to be your witnesses to the end of the earth. So we pray that you will help us.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:33.800]   And we know and we believe that you do. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:41.040]   Well may God send you out with peace and courage and the power of the Holy Spirit. Amen. And
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:47.080]   you're welcome to stay with us for a time of fellowship and thank you for A-Peng for
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:52.880]   preparing good food for us. So you can stay here or stay outside in the cafe and we can
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:56.920]   get to know one another and build a church together. Amen. See you next week.
