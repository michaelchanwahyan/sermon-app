1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 Family, I hope that you are doing well this morning and we are going to continue on with

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,020
 Matthew chapter 6, continue on with this study of the kingdom values that Jesus points us

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,960
 to in the Sermon on the Mount.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,680
 Now the last few weeks we've been talking about hypocrisy and specifically religious

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,160
 hypocrisy, hypocrisy in our faith, in our relationship to God.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:30,040
 And we've been talking about how serious it is, how it can be such a strong temptation

7
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,520
 to us as people of faith, people who take our faith seriously.

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,760
 It can be a really strong temptation to pretend to be something that we're not.

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,840
 And that's one of the reasons that Jesus gives it so much space, this topic.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,600
 He gives this topic so much space in Matthew chapter 6.

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,120
 But we have also talked about how devastating and serious the consequences of it can be

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,880
 for us.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:59,080
 And that's another reason that Jesus gives this topic so much space.

14
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:02,880
 So we're going to finish up today, but we're going to get just a little bit out of order

15
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:08,560
 with the verses because as Jesus is talking about this topic of hypocrisy, in the middle

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,200
 of this, he pivots and he talks about the correct way to pray because the passage we

17
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,080
 were discussing last week, he tells us not to pray like the hypocrites.

18
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:23,800
 And then he gives us a definition of how to pray, a template for prayer.

19
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,080
 And then he goes back to talking about hypocrisy and kind of finishing that up.

20
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,520
 So what we're going to do is we're going to skip ahead to verse 16, finish up this topic

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:36,480
 of hypocrisy, and then we're going to go back to the section on the Lord's Prayer and kind

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,240
 of consider that separately on its own.

23
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:42,160
 So this morning, we're going to skip ahead to verse 16.

24
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,920
 Last week, we finished up there at verse 6, but now we're going to be down into verse

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,000
 16.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,640
 And it says this, "And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they

27
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,760
 disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others.

28
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:01,960
 Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

29
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:07,440
 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen

30
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:14,440
 by others, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward

31
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,440
 you."

32
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,480
 Now, as we've discussed hypocrisy, we defined it biblically and we defined it in a few different

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
 ways.

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,840
 We defined it as pretending to be something that we are not or acting as if we are something

35
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,840
 that we are not.

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:31,200
 We've talked a lot about how we can do that in our relationship to God and our faith,

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,640
 that we can pretend to be righteous, pretend to be holy when we are not, and how that is

38
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,040
 damaging to us, but also to the people around us.

39
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,400
 We talked about how hypocrisy is also deceiving ourselves or others into thinking we can meet

40
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,160
 God's standards when we can't.

41
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:54,440
 Hypocrisy happens when we misunderstand God's grace and we decide that we can meet God's

42
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,760
 standards of holiness and righteousness in life through our own effort, through just

43
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,560
 trying hard and through trying to produce good works and through trying to be a good

44
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,560
 person.

45
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,520
 And we can't meet God's standards.

46
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:16,320
 That only happens as we repent and as we surrender to Jesus and let Him live through us.

47
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,800
 We talked about that.

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:24,400
 We talked about our other definition of hypocrisy, that it's really turning the spotlight on

49
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,280
 ourselves instead of God, trying to glorify ourselves instead of trying to glorify God.

50
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,640
 It's not that God wants us to hide all of our actions, but God wants us to make sure

51
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,680
 that in our actions that He is glorified, that the attention is put on Him and not on

52
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,360
 us, that our actions should not be to glorify ourselves, and especially not in our relationship

53
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,600
 to God and our faith.

54
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:55,240
 And we use this beautiful definition from the scripture that Jesus gives us from Luke

55
00:03:55,240 --> 00:04:00,000
 18 verse 9 that says this, "He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves

56
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 that they were righteous and treated others with contempt."

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,040
 And that's a great definition of hypocrisy in our faith, when we begin to trust in ourselves

58
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,960
 that we're righteous and treat others with contempt.

59
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,800
 And that's one of the devastating consequences of hypocrisy, is that we treat others with

60
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
 contempt.

61
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:21,060
 We're not kind and caring and loving towards others in the way we should be.

62
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,600
 As we've discussed it, we've gone through a few different things.

63
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,940
 We talked the first week about how maybe we've been hurt by hypocrisy in the church.

64
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,940
 We've talked about how maybe there were misplaced standards of righteousness and who defines

65
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:38,200
 righteousness that we had in our life.

66
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,720
 Maybe we were trying to live up to some standard that wasn't actually God's standards.

67
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:46,000
 It was just other humans that said, "You should be like this if you're a Christian.

68
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
 This is what it means to be righteous or to be a follower of Jesus or to be a Christian."

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,480
 And that wasn't God's standard, it was someone else's.

70
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,760
 And trying to live up to that damages us.

71
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,360
 We talked about those misplaced standards.

72
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:01,880
 We talked about misplaced expectations and how if we fall into hypocrisy or we follow

73
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,320
 someone who is in hypocrisy, that we can put expectations on them or on ourselves that

74
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,800
 God never meant for us to have.

75
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,640
 We can be deeply hurt and disappointed when we or that person we're following falls short

76
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,360
 of those expectations.

77
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,540
 We talked about misplaced pain.

78
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,280
 The fact that Jesus is not the source of hypocrisy.

79
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,800
 Jesus is not the source of the things that harm us.

80
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,320
 But sometimes when we encounter hypocrisy in the church or in our faith journey, we

81
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:34,600
 think that that comes from God or we think that that comes from Jesus.

82
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,160
 And so we think that that pain is the fault of God when it's not.

83
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,040
 It's the fault of other broken humans who have misinterpreted scripture or maybe they've

84
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,800
 just been plain wrong or maybe they didn't even know Jesus in the first place.

85
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:51,200
 And because of that, they've lived a life of hypocrisy.

86
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:56,440
 And then last week we got really convicting as we talked about our own tendency towards

87
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:02,280
 hypocrisy and how easy it is to fall into that, but also how serious it is.

88
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:07,240
 We talked about the fact that when we fall into hypocrisy in our life, that ultimately

89
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,920
 we're stealing glory from God.

90
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,480
 We're directing glory towards us that belongs to God and God alone.

91
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,880
 And we talked about the fact that ultimately we want to steal God's throne.

92
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,800
 We want to steal control from God.

93
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,960
 Control belongs to God and God alone in our life and in the lives of those around us.

94
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:28,320
 But we want to steal that away and give the image, give the perception that we're in control,

95
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,040
 that we can control what happens in our life and we can control our own success and our

96
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,560
 own righteousness and those things.

97
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,280
 And that's just not true.

98
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:40,600
 And we talked about the fact that we also want to steal destiny, God's will for our

99
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,200
 life, God's purpose and plan for our future.

100
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:47,840
 We want to steal that away and we want to insert in its place our own purpose and plan

101
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,760
 for our future.

102
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:55,080
 And that happens when we live in a place of hypocrisy, acting like we can control our

103
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,640
 own destiny when we can't.

104
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,000
 That's something that has to be surrendered to Jesus.

105
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,760
 And we talked about some of the practical applications of how to avoid hypocrisy through

106
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:10,680
 seeking humility and through doing what Jesus talks about, through being willing to do good

107
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,080
 works in secret that no one sees, that are hidden, because our heart is to do them out

108
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,840
 of love for God and love for others, not out of the recognition that we will get from anyone

109
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:25,880
 else and how important that heart is, that we do it because we want to please God and

110
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:30,320
 we want to love others, not because we're trying to please any other human.

111
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,240
 And today we're going to talk about one other aspect of hypocrisy that comes from the verses

112
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,240
 we're looking at today.

113
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:41,760
 That is a misappropriated burden, taking on a burden we're not supposed to take on.

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:45,360
 And we see some of that in verses 16 to 18 here.

115
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,600
 I'm going to read them again.

116
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,880
 It says, "When you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their

117
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:52,440
 faces that their fasting may be seen by others.

118
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,480
 Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.

119
00:07:55,480 --> 00:08:00,840
 But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, that your fasting may not be seen

120
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,640
 by others, but by your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward

121
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,640
 you."

122
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,240
 So what's going on in this passage?

123
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,480
 Jesus is talking about fasting.

124
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:14,500
 And maybe if you haven't been in church a lot, you're not sure what fasting is.

125
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:17,800
 Or maybe if you have been in church all your life, you still don't really know necessarily

126
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,800
 what it is.

127
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,800
 Well, fasting is something that God called his people to a long time ago in the Old Testament.

128
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,840
 And it continued in the New Testament.

129
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,040
 People have continued to practice fasting as a way to draw near to God.

130
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:39,380
 And fasting is when you voluntarily deny some of your physical appetites in order to seek

131
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,520
 after God.

132
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,400
 And usually it's fasting from food.

133
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,760
 It can be from other things as well, but a lot of times it's associated with fasting

134
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,020
 from food.

135
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,140
 So people say, "I'm going to not eat for a certain period of time," or "I'm going to

136
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:57,300
 only eat a few certain things for a certain period of time."

137
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,160
 And it's done not just for health reasons, although that might be a part of it, but it's

138
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,620
 not just done because it's going to help us to be healthier.

139
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:12,140
 It's done for spiritual reasons to say, "Okay, I'm going to deny some of these physical appetites

140
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:17,100
 so that I'm actually able to seek God more and to be focused on him and to really grow

141
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,620
 in my relationship with him and draw near to God."

142
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,620
 That's what fasting is.

143
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:24,820
 And that's what Jesus is talking about in this passage.

144
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,100
 So fasting involves intentionality.

145
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,860
 It involves a desire to know God.

146
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:34,340
 And it involves some sort of sacrifice and saying, "Okay, I'm going to sacrifice some

147
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:40,860
 of my desires in order to become closer to God and to draw near to him.

148
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,700
 And I'm going to demonstrate that I'm serious about God by denying some of those desires

149
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,380
 and appetites in my life."

150
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:56,100
 So when Jesus says that the hypocrites, when they go to fast, they are actually making

151
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:59,340
 it very clear and plain that they are fasting.

152
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,340
 When he says they disfigure their faces, what Jesus is saying is that the hypocrites were

153
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:13,500
 intentionally looking very exhausted and very ragged so that anybody who looked at them

154
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,500
 would say, "Oh, look at that guy over there.

155
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,500
 I mean, he's been fasting.

156
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,500
 You can see it in his face.

157
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,280
 He looks so tired.

158
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,460
 He looks like he hasn't even been able to clean up.

159
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,100
 I mean, what a spiritual guy."

160
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:30,540
 And again, it was something that was done for outward display to impress other people.

161
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,100
 And as we spoke about the last few weeks, to glorify themselves, to put the attention

162
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,580
 on them instead of putting the attention on God.

163
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,300
 That's what Jesus is referring to here.

164
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:46,300
 And so he says in verse 17, "When you fast, anoint your head and wash your face."

165
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,980
 What Jesus is saying is, "Don't be like the hypocrites that you try to put your spirituality

166
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:57,820
 on display for others and try to show people the depth of your devotion or how intense

167
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,860
 your sacrifice is so that other people will look at you and say, 'Wow, what a committed

168
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:03,860
 person.

169
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,140
 Their devotion to God is so deep.

170
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,380
 Their sacrifice is so great.'"

171
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,700
 Jesus is saying, "No, don't do that.

172
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:19,060
 When you fast, go ahead and wash your face and look normal and go about life normally."

173
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:23,260
 Because what is going on in a fast is supposed to be about your relationship to God.

174
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:25,020
 It's supposed to be about drawing near to him.

175
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:29,420
 It's supposed to be about denying your physical appetite so that you can connect more with

176
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,420
 God.

177
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:34,380
 It's not supposed to be about other people and impressing them in what they think of

178
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,380
 you.

179
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:41,300
 And so it's literally counterproductive to the fast itself for you to make it about other

180
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:45,340
 people's opinion of you and impressing other people with it.

181
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,020
 That's what Jesus is pointing out.

182
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,460
 And he's saying, "Your father knows that you're fasting.

183
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,260
 If you're sacrificing in some way to connect with God, God knows that.

184
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:55,900
 And he will reward you.

185
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:59,540
 He will reward you with a deeper relationship with himself.

186
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:04,980
 But you shouldn't do it to be seen by others."

187
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:10,020
 Now we've already discussed a lot this principle of not doing things to be seen by others and

188
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,500
 how easy it is to fall into hypocrisy there.

189
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,840
 So what I want us to think about today is just this principle of sacrifice.

190
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:23,820
 It's involved in fasting and it's involved in other parts of our walk with Jesus.

191
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:30,220
 And sometimes we think that that sacrifice is something that we're supposed to take on

192
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:36,020
 in order to basically be some type of super spiritual, super human, super Christian.

193
00:12:36,020 --> 00:12:38,260
 And that's totally not true at all.

194
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,180
 And that's part of what Jesus is pointing out here.

195
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,180
 He's saying that was a problem with the hypocrites.

196
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:48,540
 They were trying to take this sacrifice on and let everybody know how great they were

197
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:52,980
 sacrificing so that everybody would see that they were a superhero.

198
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,340
 And that's not the point.

199
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,020
 Jesus is the hero, not his followers.

200
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,980
 And we do that too.

201
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,500
 Sometimes we misappropriate this burden.

202
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,060
 We try to take on some burden that we were never supposed to have.

203
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:10,820
 And we try to shoulder up under something and show that we are doing this great sacrifice

204
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,220
 for God.

205
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,140
 And we get a little bit of a Messiah complex.

206
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,060
 We get a little bit of this idea in our head that we're actually supposed to go out and

207
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,060
 save the world.

208
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,460
 Or we're actually supposed to really transform someone's life.

209
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:29,060
 Or we're actually supposed to turn someone around and take them from a place of struggle

210
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:34,420
 and darkness and confusion to a place of beautiful light and flourishing and peace.

211
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,260
 And we're not supposed to do that.

212
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:39,180
 God is supposed to do that.

213
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,340
 Jesus is supposed to save the world.

214
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:44,220
 Jesus is supposed to transform lives.

215
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:49,980
 Jesus is the one who takes people from hurt and brokenness and affliction to peace and

216
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,780
 joy and beauty.

217
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,140
 Jesus is the Messiah, not us.

218
00:13:54,140 --> 00:14:00,060
 And we begin to operate from that place of having a little bit of that Messiah complex,

219
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:02,900
 thinking that we're supposed to save the world.

220
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:07,660
 First of all, there's an obvious amount of arrogance that plays into that.

221
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:10,080
 The fact that we would even think that in the first place.

222
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,540
 The fact that we would even think that we're able to save the world or transform someone's

223
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:19,060
 life in the first place shows that there's some pride in our heart that is not pleasing

224
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,060
 to God.

225
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:23,300
 We need to be in a place of saying, "God, I understand that apart from you I can do

226
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
 nothing."

227
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,780
 Like Jesus talked about when he talked about abiding in Christ.

228
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,140
 And we need to understand that.

229
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,100
 We need to say, "I'm not the one who's here to change things.

230
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,220
 I can't save other people.

231
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,020
 I can't even bring about transformation in my own heart, much less someone else's heart."

232
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:45,540
 So we need to get away from that arrogance of feeling like we're supposed to bear this

233
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,180
 burden of saving the world.

234
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:51,980
 But we also have to get away from the hypocrisy of that Messiah complex, thinking that we're

235
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:52,980
 going to save the world.

236
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:59,980
 That causes us to have to convince ourselves and the people around us that we don't make

237
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,660
 any mistakes, that we're perfect.

238
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:05,700
 And that leads us straight into all the things we've been talking about the last few weeks.

239
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,980
 This pretending to be something we're not.

240
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,900
 This acting like we meet God's standards when we don't.

241
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:15,020
 This treating other people with contempt because we think that we're more righteous than someone

242
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,020
 else.

243
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:20,180
 And so we have to stay away from that type of thinking because it leads us straight into

244
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,540
 hypocrisy.

245
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,780
 And we also have to stay away from that type of thinking because it is impossible.

246
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:31,220
 Thinking that we are going to save the world, having that Messiah complex, that leads us

247
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,660
 to a place of impossibility.

248
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:39,060
 We're basically trying to pick up a load that we cannot carry and we will ultimately be

249
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,280
 crushed by it.

250
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:46,320
 If we start to convince ourselves in our own mind that we're supposed to save this person

251
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,940
 or that person or this situation or this neighborhood or whatever, we are trying to shoulder a load

252
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:55,120
 that will crush us.

253
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,660
 As I said a moment ago, we cannot even transform our own heart, much less someone else's heart,

254
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:08,020
 much less transform a city or a neighborhood or a community or whatever.

255
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:09,420
 Now Jesus can.

256
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,500
 That's the beautiful thing.

257
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:15,580
 That's the good news is that Jesus can and he wants to work through us.

258
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,300
 We get to be instruments.

259
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:23,460
 We get to cooperate with God in seeing transformation happen in our neighborhood and in our family

260
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,400
 and in our friends' lives.

261
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,640
 It's not that we're not going to be a part of that, but we have to understand that we

262
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,220
 do not do that.

263
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,620
 We do not start it.

264
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:33,620
 We do not bring it to pass.

265
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,180
 Jesus starts it.

266
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:41,180
 He uses us to bring it to pass, but it's a work that he and only he can do and it's a

267
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,620
 work that he does as he lives through us.

268
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:49,660
 If we feel like we're supposed to save the world or save this person or that person or

269
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:55,220
 this situation or that situation, we are taking on a burden that was never ours to carry.

270
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,940
 We are misappropriating that burden and ultimately we're going to find ourselves crushed by that

271
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:00,940
 burden.

272
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,740
 And so we may say, "Well, you know, look at my sacrifice.

273
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,900
 I want other people to see that.

274
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:12,980
 I want other people to know that I'm carrying this heavy load," but we'll fall into hypocrisy.

275
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,340
 We'll fall into arrogance.

276
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:21,700
 We'll fall into impossibility and we'll be crushed by the magnitude of that impossibility.

277
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,100
 We cannot carry that burden.

278
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,020
 I think that's good for us to think about as followers of Jesus.

279
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:30,640
 We should not pick up burdens that we were never supposed to carry.

280
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:36,500
 We need to pray for the people in our lives, our family, our friends, our community, our

281
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,500
 city.

282
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:40,500
 We need to love and we need to serve with the love of Jesus.

283
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,520
 We need to let Jesus live through us.

284
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:49,340
 But we cannot feel like that we have to make change happen and if it doesn't happen, then

285
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,840
 it's our fault and that we have failed.

286
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,940
 That is not the role that God has called us to.

287
00:17:54,940 --> 00:18:01,140
 God has called us to be an instrument, to be a vessel, to be someone that He can use.

288
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:05,220
 God has not called us to be the Savior, the Fixer, the Healer.

289
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,880
 We can't do that and we need to understand that.

290
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:12,780
 We need to operate and live our lives from a place that says, "I want to cooperate with

291
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:17,140
 God, obey and be sensitive to Him and put myself in the right position so that He can

292
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,940
 live through me, but I'm not here to fix it.

293
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,700
 I'm not the one with all the answers.

294
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:27,580
 I'm not here being proud and arrogant and thinking that I'm going to transform things.

295
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:34,020
 I understand that I am a broken human who God is at work in my life and as He works,

296
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:41,980
 He can use that work to help someone else, but it's not about me."

297
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,940
 Now speaking of misappropriated burdens and a Messiah complex and hypocrisy, I want to

298
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,500
 close out today with just a few thoughts about the upcoming election.

299
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:59,500
 Don't worry, I'm not going to try to influence your voting in any way or try to berate your

300
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,940
 political views in any way, so this is not going to be one of those weird, awkward conversations.

301
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,620
 But I just want to give us some encouragement and some things to think about.

302
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:13,580
 Obviously we're just days away from November 3rd and this election and this is a really

303
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,980
 important election.

304
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,100
 You don't need to hear that from me.

305
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,780
 I'm sure you've heard it from many people already.

306
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,020
 So I want to begin just with encouraging you to vote.

307
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:25,180
 Hopefully you've already been able to vote through mail-in voting or early voting, but

308
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,540
 if you haven't, I would encourage you to go vote on Tuesday.

309
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:35,260
 I understand, I know our political system in the US is really full of deception and

310
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:41,580
 hypocrisy and division right now and sometimes that makes it kind of distasteful to be a

311
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:45,720
 part of and sometimes we want to disengage, but it is something that's important for us

312
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,380
 to participate in as followers of Jesus.

313
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:55,300
 It's something that we want to seek to encourage kingdom values in our world through our politics

314
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,580
 and in the United States, God has given us this opportunity to do that through voting

315
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:05,460
 and so that's a really important privilege and responsibility that we should participate

316
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:10,220
 in and we should take part in and take that seriously and make sure that we do it.

317
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:15,700
 God has delegated authority to earthly governments for the purpose of protecting human lives,

318
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:21,300
 and promoting human flourishing and that's something that God wants us as his followers

319
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:26,860
 to seek to do, to seek to promote human flourishing through the way we participate and the way

320
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,860
 that we vote.

321
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,740
 So we want to do that.

322
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:36,260
 Now obviously this election is going to be really hotly contested and I have no idea

323
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:42,060
 what's going to happen or what the results will be, but I just want to talk about some

324
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:47,420
 of the things that we might feel after the results because this is an election that people

325
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,260
 feel very passionately about, very strongly about.

326
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:57,220
 People have deeply held emotions about this election and our politics is so polarized

327
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:02,700
 and so divided right now that most people have a side, they have a team, they have a

328
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:07,700
 candidate or they have a group of candidates or a party that they are really emotionally

329
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,500
 invested in and so if you're one of those people, then depending on the results of the

330
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:17,740
 election you might feel a lot of things after Tuesday, on Wednesday or through the rest

331
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,740
 of the week.

332
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:23,700
 And I just want to give us some perspective and some thoughts about those things, especially

333
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,780
 if we're experiencing some negative emotions afterwards.

334
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,020
 I understand that we may not know on Tuesday night or Wednesday morning or Thursday who

335
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:36,500
 the winner of many of the races are, especially with the pandemic and such an unusual year

336
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,580
 in voting.

337
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:43,580
 It may be days or weeks or even possibly months before some of these races are decided, but

338
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:49,280
 the reality is the way our political system in the US is set up, the elections fall into

339
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,580
 categories of winners and losers.

340
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:55,420
 Once the final tally is in, there are winners and losers.

341
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,300
 So first let's talk about the scenario of your side or your candidate or your group

342
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:06,380
 of candidates or your party or whatever being on the losing side, feeling like that you

343
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:08,540
 have lost in this election.

344
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:12,940
 And I want to encourage you to not fall into despair.

345
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:17,780
 Don't fall into frustration with other people.

346
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,740
 Certainly don't fall into frustration that causes you to dehumanize the other side or

347
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:27,800
 the other party and feel like they're the source of all the problems in your life or

348
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,820
 in our country or in the world.

349
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:34,620
 That's simply not true and it's dangerous for us to think that way.

350
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:39,980
 God always wants us to regard others as made in His image and as worthy of our love and

351
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,020
 respect and our kindness and our service.

352
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:46,660
 Even if we disagree with them, even if we think they're doing something wrong, God still

353
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,300
 wants us to love them, to pray for them, to care for them in any way that we can.

354
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:56,420
 And if they don't know Jesus, to seek to connect them with God so that they can come into relationship

355
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,700
 with Jesus.

356
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,180
 And that's how we should respond.

357
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:06,060
 So if you feel like your side is losing, don't get upset or angry at the side that wins,

358
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:12,300
 even if they are completely unkind and arrogant in their victory.

359
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:18,260
 And don't misappropriate the burden of saving souls or saving our country and think that

360
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:22,040
 the soul of our country is won or lost with elections.

361
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:25,860
 The reality is Jesus is the only one who saves souls and He's the only one who can save the

362
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,860
 soul of our country.

363
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,100
 And yeah, in the United States we have an executive branch in our government that has

364
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,720
 a president at the top of it.

365
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:40,540
 But as a follower of Jesus, you have a foundational identity that is much deeper than your ethnic

366
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,900
 identity or your national identity.

367
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:46,940
 And so you don't serve a president, you serve a king.

368
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:55,180
 Jesus is the king that you serve and the kingdom of God is unshaken by elections.

369
00:23:55,180 --> 00:24:00,460
 And so the reality is that on the morning of November 3rd, you'll wake up as a subject

370
00:24:00,460 --> 00:24:02,400
 of the kingdom of heaven.

371
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,940
 You will wake up as someone who is loved by God and who's been given a mission to love

372
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:11,620
 God and to love and serve the people around you, to let Jesus live through you, to love

373
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,680
 those around you.

374
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,740
 And on the morning of November 4th after the election, November 5th, every day going forward,

375
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,020
 you will wake up with that exact same identity.

376
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,420
 You will wake up as a subject of the kingdom of God.

377
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,220
 You will wake up as someone who is loved and forgiven by God.

378
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:32,260
 You will wake up with this mission of loving God and loving others and allowing Jesus to

379
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:34,420
 live through you to love others.

380
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,140
 That will not change.

381
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:42,180
 So there's no reason for you to feel despair even if you feel like your side has lost in

382
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,360
 the election.

383
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,700
 You haven't lost anything.

384
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:52,660
 Your identity is unshakable and it lies at a level that is untouched by human decisions.

385
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,260
 God is not changed.

386
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
 God is still on the throne.

387
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,500
 Jesus is still in control of the world and your identity in Christ is completely untouched

388
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,220
 by the election results or anything else.

389
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:08,180
 Now let's consider the other scenario and this is perhaps an even more dangerous one.

390
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:10,160
 What if you're on the winning side?

391
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:15,100
 What if your side wins and your candidate wins or your party wins or the candidates

392
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,060
 that you prefer win?

393
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:23,100
 One of the dangers there is that you might feel this sense of victory and kind of self-congratulation

394
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:29,580
 and slip into a sense of complacency or a false sense of security because you feel like,

395
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,340
 "Well, my side won.

396
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:35,220
 The people that I want to be in office are now in office and everything's going to get

397
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:36,220
 better.

398
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
 Everything's going to turn out great.

399
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,980
 The world's going to be just fine."

400
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:45,220
 And that can cause us to get to a place of complacency in our obedience to God and that's

401
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,300
 really dangerous for us as followers of Jesus.

402
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:51,820
 Our culture has attached a strong element of morality to our politics and our voting

403
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,060
 process and sometimes there's this underlying assumption that as long as you vote and vote

404
00:25:56,060 --> 00:26:01,540
 in the correct way, which of course is defined differently by many different groups and many

405
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,260
 different people, but as long as you vote in the correct way, then you've done some

406
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:10,100
 type of moral good and you've done your moral duty and that's all there is really to do

407
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:14,540
 to fix things or to be a part of positive change in the world is just to go out and

408
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,100
 vote and to vote in the correct way.

409
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:20,300
 And that simply isn't true for the followers of Jesus.

410
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,100
 For the followers of Jesus, voting is very important, but it's only a very small piece

411
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:31,480
 of a much bigger picture of how God wants us to be involved in seeing change happen

412
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:36,600
 in our world and in seeing people cared for and in seeing the love of Jesus go out into

413
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,180
 our communities and our neighborhoods.

414
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,460
 And the reality is that no matter how great you think your candidate is and your party

415
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:49,540
 is and even if every race is run by your party and every candidate that you want to get into

416
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:56,060
 office gets into office, there will still be poverty even after those people are installed

417
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,100
 in office.

418
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,400
 There will still be racism and discrimination after those people are installed in office.

419
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:05,180
 There will still be violence and people killed and children killed after those people are

420
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,660
 installed in office.

421
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,840
 There will still be substance abuse and addiction.

422
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:12,320
 There will still be people abusing one another and oppressing one another.

423
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,300
 There will still be coronavirus even after your favorite candidate is installed in office.

424
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:23,140
 Your candidate winning doesn't mean an end to evil or corruption or anything else.

425
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:28,620
 So you need to understand that as a follower of Jesus, God still has so much that he wants

426
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:31,360
 to use you to do in our world.

427
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,500
 Our world is still broken and Jesus still wants to transform your life and use you,

428
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,620
 live through you to love and serve and transform the lives of others.

429
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:46,380
 Don't become complacent or comfortable because your side or your party or your candidate

430
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,620
 does well on Tuesday.

431
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:52,340
 Understand that God still has so much that he wants you to cooperate with him to be a

432
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,320
 part of.

433
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,340
 And remember that regardless of what happens on Tuesday, your identity is unchanged.

434
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:00,060
 You're not a winner or a loser.

435
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,780
 You're forgiven and loved.

436
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,780
 You're covered by the grace of Jesus.

437
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,300
 Your mission is unchanged.

438
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:08,220
 You're called to love God and to love the people around you.

439
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,680
 You're called to let Jesus transform your life and live through you to love others and

440
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,980
 transform the lives of people around you.

441
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,660
 You're called to live out the values of the kingdom.

442
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:20,340
 So go out and vote.

443
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:24,220
 Vote the values of the kingdom and then go right back to living out the values of the

444
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,880
 kingdom.

445
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,340
 Continue to love God.

446
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,480
 Continue to love others with the love of Jesus.

447
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:33,640
 Continue to serve and care for your family and your community and your neighbors and

448
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,020
 your church and your city.

449
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,380
 Don't despair.

450
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,300
 Don't get frustrated.

451
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:44,080
 Don't get complacent and comfortable and apathetic.

452
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,440
 Don't misappropriate the burden of saving the world.

453
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,220
 Don't think that burden belongs to you.

454
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,460
 Don't think it belongs to your political party.

455
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,860
 Don't think it belongs to your favorite candidate.

456
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,740
 It doesn't.

457
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:59,780
 Most of the people involved in politics probably have some level of Messiah complex.

458
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:02,660
 They think they can save the world, but they can't.

459
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,380
 There's only one Savior and it's Jesus.

460
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,740
 And the good news is that he is mighty to save.

461
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:15,160
 Let him do his work in your heart and in your life and in the lives of people around you.

462
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,380
 Let's pray.

463
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:22,600
 God I pray that you would help us not to personally misappropriate that burden and think that

464
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,420
 we are supposed to save the world or transform lives or change everything.

465
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:29,080
 We cannot.

466
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:33,200
 And it is arrogance and pride and hypocrisy for us to think we can.

467
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,540
 But God, also help us not to misappropriate that burden and place it on something else

468
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:43,240
 or someone else, on our politics or on our political party or our favorite candidate.

469
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:48,300
 Help us to see that only you can transform lives.

470
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:52,540
 Politics at best can maybe modify people's behavior, but that's really all it can do.

471
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,940
 Only you can change a heart and change someone from the inside out.

472
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:59,940
 And God, that's what our world desperately needs.

473
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:05,540
 And so I pray that you would help us to cooperate with you, to put ourselves in a position so

474
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:11,420
 that you can live through us, so that you can truly be transforming our hearts and live

475
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:14,180
 through us to transform the lives of people around us.

476
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:20,980
 God, may you be glorified in our lives and may we be used of you to love and serve others

477
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:25,520
 and to connect others with your kingdom so that more and more people are able to know

478
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:29,940
 you and to walk in your grace and to walk in your love and to experience your goodness

479
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,060
 and so that we see more and more of your shalom in our world.

480
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,060
 God, in Jesus' name.

481
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,860
 Amen.
