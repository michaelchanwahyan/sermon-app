1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,820
 to finish the long series on Apostles Creed.

2
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:06,980
 All right, Apostles Creed.

3
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:07,900
 This is a long series.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,140
 I think this is part number nine or 10.

5
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:14,440
 We began with the series and saying that

6
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:17,260
 the Creed of the Apostles are like

7
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:19,200
 roadmap of Christian faith.

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,380
 I remember when I was still in college

9
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,460
 and there were a bunch of guys and girls,

10
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,020
 brother and sisters, we grew up together

11
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:31,060
 in a local church and we were still

12
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,040
 in the college fellowship in my home church.

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,980
 Had quite a close friends and we grew up together.

14
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,920
 And back then we were all solid Christians,

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,440
 standing together, serving together,

16
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,300
 at least judging from what we said

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:51,740
 and how we act back then in those years.

18
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,820
 But as years go by, some have decided to quit.

19
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:00,580
 Some have decided to drop out of Christian faith altogether.

20
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:02,500
 But as I continue to discover,

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,380
 some of these friends quit

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:12,400
 because they reject the Christian faith.

23
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,020
 And as I continue to discover,

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,100
 they have some sort of truncated version

25
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,860
 or truncated understanding of what

26
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,100
 Christian faith is all about.

27
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,940
 For instance, I don't know what got into their thinking.

28
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,380
 One friend believes that Jesus is just a man,

29
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,600
 just a typical human being,

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:39,160
 and teaching mankind how to be good for some reason.

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,660
 But I find it interesting.

32
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:50,980
 And then the sort of Jesus that he believes in

33
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,300
 is simply a moral teacher.

34
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:57,020
 So it is understandable why there's no point

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:59,620
 to continue to follow Jesus, right?

36
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,820
 Because if Jesus is just a moral teacher,

37
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,060
 and what the heck does he do?

38
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,060
 What the heck does Christianity do to you, right?

39
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:12,060
 There are many moral teachers in the world or in history,

40
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,420
 right, and Jesus is one of them.

41
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,340
 And again, as I continue to discover,

42
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:19,460
 this is sort of a truncated, reduced understanding

43
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,940
 of what Christian faith is all about.

44
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,940
 Another friend of mine drops out of the Christian walk

45
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,300
 because life gets tough.

46
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:32,600
 Don't get me wrong, life does get tough.

47
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,340
 Different circumstances or difficulties

48
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:41,700
 happen along the way, and then sometimes we lost focus.

49
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,800
 And I think this friend of mine definitely presupposes

50
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,240
 that following Jesus means nothing

51
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,020
 but everything will go well, right?

52
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:55,900
 Now, if that version of Christianity shattered

53
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:00,020
 by different difficult circumstances in our lives,

54
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,420
 then definitely you will drop out, right?

55
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,580
 Now, again, I wanna focus on saying

56
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:10,580
 that this sort of understanding is problematic

57
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:16,160
 because following Jesus is being thought of

58
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,620
 as the skies are always blue and joy without sorrow

59
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,540
 and all that.

60
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,500
 And I tell you this, these kind of thinking

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,500
 are nothing but heresy, nothing but heresy, right?

62
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:35,980
 We are being blown by different cultural winds of our day.

63
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,380
 And the culture script has always been saying to us,

64
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,380
 hey, your life will go well because God is good.

65
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,640
 If your life doesn't go well,

66
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,280
 then there's some problem with God, right?

67
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,680
 There's some problem with your faith or anything like that.

68
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
 So you will automatically drop out, right?

69
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,760
 In our days and age, we love to pick and choose.

70
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,840
 We do, we love to pick and choose, right?

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,640
 I do that too, right?

72
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,440
 We go on Amazon, AZ, whatever that is, right?

73
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:15,260
 Recently, I was buying some item off Amazon

74
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,180
 and it took me quite a few minutes to pick and choose.

75
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,820
 I look at the customer view

76
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,260
 and I want to find the best deal I can get, right?

77
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,660
 It's for my benefit, right?

78
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:30,220
 That sort of mentality, if we bring to faith,

79
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,040
 it is problematic.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,220
 And we think that sometimes we are tempted to think

81
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,220
 that the Bible, the Christian faith is like Whole Foods,

82
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,100
 right?

83
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,560
 Ever been to a Whole Foods?

84
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,000
 You just go in and, you know, to a section.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,460
 You can pick the salad you want.

86
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,700
 You pick up some items or drop some items, right?

87
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:59,920
 Not interested, you just decide not to buy it.

88
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,500
 And I tell you, this is the biggest lie

89
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,140
 Satan is telling us.

90
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:10,120
 In the Bible, particularly in the Psalms,

91
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:14,360
 in the Old Testament, you see the poet, the believers,

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,800
 they struggle with their life circumstances.

93
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,000
 They struggle with suffering.

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,880
 They suffer from pains and sickness,

95
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,780
 but they never drop out.

96
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,940
 The only thing we know they are not dropping out

97
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,900
 because they, it's the fact that they are praying.

98
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,640
 The fact that they are struggling with God.

99
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:34,700
 They struggle mightily with God.

100
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:36,740
 When life is good, they praise God.

101
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:39,380
 When life is good, they give credit to God.

102
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:42,500
 But when life goes through a valley,

103
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:48,500
 they lament, they struggle, they complain

104
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,060
 until their faith is refined

105
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:55,580
 and their relationship with God is so polished.

106
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,940
 Have you ever seen a couple who are married for many years?

107
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:04,260
 Have you ever seen one of those couples, married couples?

108
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:07,220
 Married for so many years, okay?

109
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:13,020
 If you know them well, you know that their relationship

110
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,100
 is no more the kind of, you know,

111
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:18,760
 rosy, romantic stuff, right?

112
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,700
 They are, they passed that stage.

113
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,060
 I mean, they still have romance.

114
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:27,940
 They still have romance, but it's a different kind, right?

115
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,700
 The beginning phrase of the relationship

116
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,220
 of a married couple, probably just puppy love

117
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,720
 or something like that, right?

118
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,560
 It's very warm.

119
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,280
 I'm not going to talk down on those experiences.

120
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,840
 Those are great experiences.

121
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,840
 However, when the couple are committed to walk together,

122
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:50,360
 you find that their lives and their relationship

123
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,400
 is mature, right?

124
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,160
 And there you go, in years of experiencing

125
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,600
 the relationship together, walking together,

126
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,120
 you find husband and wife,

127
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,640
 they do have, you know, they do have mistakes.

128
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,120
 They sin against one another.

129
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,560
 They oppose one another.

130
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,320
 They fought, right?

131
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,160
 They argue.

132
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,460
 However, you see also the maturity of love,

133
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:25,520
 which means forgiveness, right?

134
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,520
 They learn to overlook each other's shortcomings.

135
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,800
 And the relationship is refined and continue to grow.

136
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:38,000
 And that sort of relationship is a great picture

137
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,600
 of our relationship with God, right?

138
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:44,840
 Our spiritual journey with God is exactly like that.

139
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,560
 We grow in the midst of difficulties.

140
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,280
 We grow in good times and bad times.

141
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,440
 And we grow also in our ability to discern,

142
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,880
 to evaluate things on earth,

143
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,640
 biblically and spiritually.

144
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,800
 And we grow in our ability to take on things that matter.

145
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:08,160
 As my relationship with God continues to grow,

146
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,640
 I know that there is something that really matter,

147
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:16,240
 eternal value, something of eternity,

148
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,440
 something that does not change and will continue to grow.

149
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,460
 And that is the most important thing

150
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,280
 that matters in my life.

151
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,640
 You know, I grew up, as I said,

152
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,880
 I grew up in my good years, you know, in college.

153
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:31,980
 I lost some friends, you know,

154
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,600
 but what the hell, I don't care, right?

155
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,520
 I know, I get to know other new friends.

156
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:40,080
 I get to know other people, right?

157
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,960
 It's like, it's like traveling on a train, right?

158
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:47,600
 There are some people who enter into the car

159
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,260
 and then some, you know, along the way, they exit the car.

160
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:57,160
 A few of them stay together until the destination.

161
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,840
 You know, people come and people go,

162
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:04,320
 but what is most important in your relationship with God

163
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,220
 is that you need to discern and you need to stick to

164
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:09,440
 what is most important.

165
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,400
 What really matters in your life, right?

166
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,700
 Romans 8.

167
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,560
 Romans 8.

168
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,600
 It gives us the biggest possible roadmap

169
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,920
 of our Christian journey.

170
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,280
 This is the biggest, like 50,000 feet above bird eye view

171
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,800
 of what Christian journey is all about,

172
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,480
 what God is doing in your life.

173
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,560
 Romans 8, 29.

174
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,600
 For God knew his people in advance.

175
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,000
 He chose them to become like his son,

176
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
 so that his son, Jesus Christ,

177
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,400
 would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.

178
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:03,900
 And having chosen them, he called them to come to him.

179
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,000
 And having called them to come to him,

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
 he gave them right standing with himself.

181
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,800
 And having given them right standing with himself,

182
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:18,120
 God also gave them his glory.

183
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,120
 Now, this is a bird eye view

184
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,000
 of what your relationship with God should look like.

185
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,040
 All right?

186
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,800
 Everything aside, all right?

187
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,600
 Oh, whether I have a good time or bad time,

188
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,320
 whether I have good buddies to walk with me,

189
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,340
 it's not even in this picture.

190
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:43,600
 God knew his people in advance,

191
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,320
 chose them to become his son.

192
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,800
 Now, we can call this sanctification.

193
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:53,300
 You know, when you started to follow Jesus,

194
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,800
 in definitely in different circumstances,

195
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,340
 some people come to Jesus in their difficult times.

196
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:02,860
 Some of them, you know, mountaintop experience,

197
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,600
 they come to know Christ himself.

198
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,720
 The process is still the same.

199
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,720
 The process of sanctification,

200
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:13,920
 sanctifying your life, right?

201
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,160
 God chose you.

202
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,080
 To be like his son.

203
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,440
 It's a long, lifelong process

204
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,160
 that you will continue to become more and more like who?

205
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,680
 Well, not your old self.

206
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,680
 Have you ever checked the mirror recently?

207
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,400
 Look at yourself.

208
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,320
 Have you changed?

209
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,560
 You know, a couple of years ago, many years ago,

210
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,400
 definitely you change, right?

211
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,320
 You know, I got more, you know, gray hair

212
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:44,640
 and, you know, wrinkles in here and there, you know?

213
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,800
 No matter what I do to myself.

214
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,320
 But, you know, I continue to grow older.

215
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:56,560
 But in the process that God has launched in your life,

216
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,880
 when you decide to profess that Jesus is my Lord,

217
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,520
 Jesus is the Christ, Jesus is my savior,

218
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,840
 and he died for my sin,

219
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,960
 and he rose from the dead for my hope,

220
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:10,320
 I kick in, God kick in.

221
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,400
 The lifelong process of sanctification

222
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,720
 is a process of sanctifying you,

223
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,680
 making you like who?

224
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,080
 Like his son, right?

225
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,040
 Hopefully at the end of the process,

226
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,560
 you will become more like his one and only son,

227
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,480
 Jesus Christ.

228
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,280
 So that his son will be the firstborn,

229
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:34,840
 the one who get the glory among the sisters and brothers.

230
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,720
 And God chose them and he called them to come to him.

231
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,680
 Having called them,

232
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:42,920
 he also gave them right standing with himself.

233
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,800
 Now that is what we call justification.

234
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,920
 You are justified.

235
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,240
 You became like Jesus Christ.

236
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,240
 God sees you just like he sees his one and only son,

237
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,720
 because you believe in the salvation, right?

238
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,840
 You believe in Jesus Christ.

239
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:06,640
 And that this process is not a long-term process.

240
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,320
 It's a punctual, one-time act.

241
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,440
 God acts in your life,

242
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,760
 and you became his child.

243
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:20,080
 You became his son or daughter.

244
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,720
 That is justification.

245
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:26,760
 That you stand before God and declare sinless.

246
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,640
 You declare totally forgiven.

247
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,560
 And that is eternal life.

248
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,200
 That is a one-time punctual event.

249
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,680
 When you are in Christ,

250
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,680
 God sees you as he sees his perfect son.

251
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,160
 Now, can you imagine the timeline, okay?

252
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,240
 Timeline of the Christian faith.

253
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
 All the way to the left, all the way to the left.

254
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,160
 All right, your left.

255
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,280
 It's justification, all right?

256
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,840
 You became a Christian.

257
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,800
 You became God's daughter or God's son.

258
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,960
 That is one-time justification.

259
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,600
 You stand justified,

260
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,440
 all because Jesus Christ has done for you

261
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,280
 on the cross and in the empty tomb.

262
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,080
 And then the timeline goes,

263
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,360
 the lifelong process of sanctification,

264
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,960
 that you will become more and more like his own son.

265
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,960
 Just like this.

266
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:28,520
 You start with justification, boom.

267
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:33,720
 And then there was up and down, up and down, you know,

268
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,560
 but in general, you're going up.

269
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,040
 In general, you're going up to heaven or the new world.

270
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,280
 That is the lifelong process that we are in right now,

271
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,120
 process of justification.

272
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:52,520
 And then at the end of it is glorification.

273
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:56,840
 Notice what he said, Paul said at the last phrase,

274
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,840
 "Having given them right standing justification,

275
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,560
 "God gave them his glory."

276
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,920
 One day when we see Jesus face to face, all right,

277
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,240
 either Jesus come back in his second coming

278
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:13,400
 or you go to Jesus, all right,

279
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,520
 because of whatever, you know, you die, okay?

280
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,400
 You die.

281
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:22,320
 And then your spirit will go, go to the presence of God.

282
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,200
 And one day, you know, the last two chapters of the Bible,

283
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,560
 the new world, the new heaven and new earth,

284
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,400
 when heaven and earth joined together

285
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,840
 in the state of glorification, the perfect state,

286
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
 there's no pain, there's no sickness,

287
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:41,360
 there's no homework, all right?

288
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,160
 There's no frustration anymore.

289
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,000
 Then you kick in the new world,

290
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,560
 the new heaven and new earth.

291
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:49,800
 Now, there are different,

292
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,800
 different funny understandings of what heaven is like,

293
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,800
 you know, what new heaven and new earth is like.

294
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
 Some people would think,

295
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,920
 "Oh, probably we just sing and make music 24/7," right?

296
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,920
 That's kind of boring, right?

297
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,920
 Especially if you are not musically talented, right?

298
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,080
 Unless, I guess, you know,

299
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,800
 in the last process of glorification,

300
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:18,520
 you resurrected and you got the glorified body

301
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,480
 just like Jesus had on the third day,

302
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:24,200
 then you probably become the best bass player

303
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,280
 or whatever, right?

304
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:30,280
 But still, I mean, making music 24/7 is kind of boring, right?

305
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,760
 But you know, you need to understand,

306
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:34,440
 you need to understand new heaven and new earth

307
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,280
 is Genesis 1 and 2,

308
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:41,840
 we fulfill, you know?

309
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:45,120
 Fulfill right before your eyes.

310
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,840
 Remember what Genesis 1 and 2 is all about?

311
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,760
 When God created humanity,

312
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,000
 His image bearers, all of us,

313
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,560
 God said to them,

314
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,560
 "Go and take control and rule the world for me.

315
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,440
 "You represent my image, my glorious image on earth,

316
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:12,440
 "and you're gonna bring my order to the rest of the cosmos."

317
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,000
 That is Genesis 1 and 2, right?

318
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,320
 Of course, it didn't go well, right?

319
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:21,320
 Genesis 3, man proclaim himself to be God, right?

320
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,840
 And kicks in the entire grand story of the Bible.

321
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:28,520
 But God never forsaken His world,

322
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:32,120
 His creation, our creation, you know, our world.

323
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:37,120
 He set himself a program to redeem the whole world,

324
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:42,200
 to bring humanity back to Him

325
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,160
 through His son, Jesus Christ.

326
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,960
 And now we are part of it, right?

327
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:51,680
 So the new heaven, new earth, what will it look like?

328
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,040
 It's not just playing music, saying,

329
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,560
 "Hallelujah 24/7."

330
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,640
 "No, no, I don't wanna go there."

331
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,880
 It's gonna be a glorified state

332
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:05,600
 that will bring God's holy, sacred, beautiful order

333
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,320
 to the rest of the cosmos, all right?

334
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,840
 I don't know if there's a space exploration

335
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,200
 in heaven and new earth, but whatever.

336
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,560
 There's no death, there's no pain, there's no sickness.

337
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:21,600
 All you do in this life, think about it.

338
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,000
 You know, you all go to work, right?

339
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Think of moments in your work

340
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,600
 that you find so much fulfillment.

341
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,000
 You find so much fulfillment.

342
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,840
 What is that?

343
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,600
 Ask yourself, what is that?

344
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,320
 That after, you know, your labor, your sweats,

345
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:46,360
 you work on something and you finish something.

346
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:50,240
 You finish a product, you finish maybe homework, okay?

347
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
 Maybe your assignment or something.

348
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,720
 And then you get a sense of satisfaction or fulfillment.

349
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,280
 That is who you are, right?

350
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:02,200
 You're so gifted in this area, no matter what that is.

351
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:09,240
 That sense of fulfillment multiplies it infinitely.

352
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:15,480
 That is what new heaven and new earth will look like.

353
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,720
 That you will be exploring and extending

354
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,200
 the order of God to other areas.

355
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,760
 Take control of other areas.

356
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:33,200
 You know, I always remind some of our accountants

357
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,480
 or finance people in my church.

358
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,760
 I always ask them, you know, have you ever realized,

359
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,720
 you know, God's original creation

360
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,960
 is the creation that has potential to multiply.

361
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,160
 Just as when you read through it, you know,

362
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:58,640
 seed within seeds, God creates trees and the plants

363
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,880
 and the animals and they can multiply.

364
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,720
 Things are meant to be multiplied by human hands.

365
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,680
 You know, I think last hundred years,

366
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,760
 the biggest discovery for ancient history

367
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,800
 is that when you pick some, when you take some wild grain,

368
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:20,640
 take some wild grain, and then you work it

369
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,840
 and you cultivate it and you take the seed out of it,

370
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:29,280
 human hands, plant it, and then it grows.

371
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,960
 The biggest discovery is that through a human process,

372
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,840
 wild grain becomes better, right?

373
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,840
 You know, the rice, the white rice that we eat, okay?

374
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,840
 I don't eat that much now, but why is it so soft?

375
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,760
 Why is it so rich?

376
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,760
 Because it's process and process of human effort

377
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,680
 being added into the creation, and the creation multiplies.

378
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,000
 The value becomes higher.

379
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:09,200
 Cultivated grain is more expensive than the wild grain, right?

380
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,400
 Because there is human process involved in it.

381
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,080
 And that is the process of multiplication.

382
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:20,360
 That is what God originally meant us to do.

383
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:23,040
 The original creation, Genesis 1 and 2,

384
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,400
 and the last two chapters, the new heaven and new earth,

385
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,080
 it's not a static concept.

386
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:31,840
 It's the holy, sacred, dynamic.

387
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,760
 We, as we deem people in Christ,

388
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,000
 we will participate in the new heaven and new earth

389
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,360
 to explore and to invent, you know,

390
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:45,840
 to get to know this amazing creation

391
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,840
 and to get to know God himself, and God is infinite, right?

392
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,720
 So I hope I will continue to teach in heaven and new earth.

393
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:57,120
 And you will continue to do Bible study

394
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,160
 in heaven and new earth.

395
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:05,160
 And whatever you do, and God made you to who you are, right?

396
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:09,520
 Whether you do a labor work or those,

397
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:13,920
 some guys doing PhD researching or something, right?

398
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:18,280
 Making molecules, those, I don't understand those stuff.

399
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,520
 But we will continue to engage in the creative process,

400
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:25,320
 you know, bringing God's order to the rest of the cosmos.

401
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:30,080
 That is the bird eye view of what it is,

402
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,400
 what it is all about to follow Jesus.

403
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,920
 Justification and lifelong process of sanctification,

404
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,600
 and then finally, the glorification, all right?

405
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:42,920
 So don't get, don't retire yet.

406
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:48,160
 All right, new heaven, new earth is not for retirees.

407
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,800
 We continue to work without frustration, right?

408
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,840
 And again, the apostles,

409
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:00,080
 we end with Romans 8,

410
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,760
 is telling us that once we kick in

411
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,920
 to that relationship with Jesus, it's a dance with God.

412
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,120
 It's a dance with God.

413
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,160
 We dance with the music of the Holy Spirit.

414
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:19,040
 And sometimes the music sounds bright and happy.

415
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:24,200
 Sometimes the melody sound sad, lamentation.

416
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,760
 That is the long process of ups and downs

417
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,560
 in our sanctification, but it's an eternal dance.

418
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:34,200
 It's an eternal dancing with God.

419
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,080
 A long-term process, a long-term journey

420
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,920
 of discovering God and being transformed

421
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:44,920
 into His Son's image.

422
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:49,360
 To say to a 15-year-old that you are okay

423
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:54,360
 with the way you are is the utmost disrespect to humanity.

424
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:59,680
 Let me say that again.

425
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,920
 To say to a teenager or younger or older, or even you,

426
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,720
 you are okay, perfectly okay with the way you are.

427
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,240
 It's disrespect of God's creation.

428
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:19,800
 You are not okay with the way you are right now.

429
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,920
 Agree?

430
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:28,240
 You cannot avoid the need and the joy of transformation.

431
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,080
 God is transforming you and shaping you.

432
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,000
 That is the mark of maturity.

433
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,200
 The mark of maturity is to say to yourself in the mirror,

434
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,680
 I'm not okay with the way I am today

435
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:50,280
 because the Holy Spirit is shaping me constantly.

436
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,720
 And I need to let God's grace to work in my life.

437
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,360
 Let the Word of God continue to shape me

438
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,760
 and challenge me to shape me,

439
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:04,960
 to transform me into the image of His Son.

440
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:09,720
 And the Apostles' Creed is challenging us to aim for that,

441
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:13,360
 to aim high in the kingdom of God.

442
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,960
 You are not okay with the way you are today, no way.

443
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,720
 You will be transformed and let God transform you.

444
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,080
 I believe in the Holy Spirit.

445
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,040
 That's the first section of the Creed.

446
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,440
 I believe in the Holy Spirit.

447
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,200
 Have you realized this is the new creation?

448
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,520
 When the Spirit comes upon you,

449
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:39,080
 when the Holy Spirit is making you God's children,

450
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:42,720
 you are a new creation.

451
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,480
 The Holy Universal Church, the Holy Catholic Church,

452
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,120
 the Chameleon of Saints speak to us

453
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,400
 that once the Holy Spirit is taking you

454
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,360
 into the kingdom of God,

455
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:00,640
 the church becomes your new family.

456
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,520
 And that new family never change.

457
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,440
 The earthly family will change.

458
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,440
 The configuration of it, you know,

459
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,640
 it will not last forever, right?

460
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:15,520
 Family relationship will not last forever.

461
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,200
 You understand?

462
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,600
 Someday, my son is not my son, right?

463
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,080
 And I'm not his father, someday, okay?

464
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:32,960
 This family, earthly relationship will not last forever.

465
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:34,920
 Right?

466
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,720
 To make it last forever as if it really lasts forever

467
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,240
 is actually idolatry.

468
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,920
 To make it idol in our lives.

469
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,200
 It will change if we transform so much

470
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,120
 that it will be glorified, right?

471
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,280
 And the fulfillment that we have in the family relationship

472
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:58,280
 will exceed how we feel.

473
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:04,320
 Will exceed the sense of fulfillment we have right now.

474
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,600
 In the new day, in the new heaven and new earth,

475
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,360
 it will be so glorified.

476
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:11,400
 So the church, the Universal Church,

477
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,200
 the capital C Church is the new family.

478
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,280
 And then the Chameleon of Saints,

479
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,480
 I think we talk about it, is the new relationship.

480
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,360
 When we are in Christ, okay?

481
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,280
 When we are in Christ,

482
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:29,600
 whether you're a Christian struggling with your faith

483
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,840
 so much or some other, you know,

484
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,360
 having a mountaintop experience,

485
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,120
 praise God every single day.

486
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,000
 If we are in Christ, we have this new relationship,

487
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,000
 the Chameleon of Saints, like togetherness, right?

488
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:48,240
 Somehow being united together.

489
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,840
 As we worship today, I don't know if you have noticed

490
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,560
 one of the songs, One Voice, right?

491
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,960
 Now, I didn't plan that,

492
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,080
 and the worship leader picked that song.

493
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,080
 The song talks about some sort of unity.

494
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,160
 That kind of unity goes beyond our ethnic unity,

495
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:12,920
 our political identity.

496
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:16,160
 It goes beyond that.

497
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,960
 In Christ, we find that new communion, new unity.

498
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:26,240
 The forgiveness of sin, the new relationship with God.

499
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,840
 Chameleon of Saints is the horizontal relationship,

500
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,960
 human being to human being, question to question,

501
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,720
 new chameleon of saints.

502
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,880
 And the forgiveness of sins is vertical.

503
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,040
 So we look upon God and say, "We are justified,

504
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:48,200
 "not because of our own effort, our own work,

505
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,840
 "but what Christ has done in your life

506
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:55,360
 "that made you someone who is new before God,

507
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,120
 "as if Jesus Christ, the one and only perfect Son."

508
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,080
 And then finally, I believe in the resurrection of the body,

509
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,360
 the new existence.

510
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:09,640
 God kicks in the new existence in our lives

511
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,840
 when we profess the name of Jesus.

512
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,640
 You know, you realize that?

513
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,280
 Yeah, I know my body continues to decay,

514
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,280
 your body too, right?

515
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:27,560
 We get old and we get sick, we get COVID.

516
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,240
 We are weakened, right?

517
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,080
 You know, it used to be I could do 70 pushups,

518
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,920
 just like that.

519
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,640
 Or you could do that.

520
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,240
 I can't do it anymore.

521
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,280
 Right, now I even have struggle with 20, right?

522
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,160
 We decay.

523
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:56,160
 However, we have the hope of getting the new body,

524
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:00,800
 the new existence, just like the third day of Jesus Christ.

525
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,200
 He walked out of the empty tomb.

526
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,160
 He conquered death for us.

527
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,640
 He conquered sin and darkness and Satan for us.

528
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,160
 No more forces of darkness,

529
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:15,160
 no more forces of deterioration can go upon you.

530
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:18,360
 And this is the new existence that we have.

531
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,640
 And we have that hope in future.

532
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,760
 Whether we see Jesus face to face

533
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,720
 or in the new heaven and new earth,

534
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,720
 we'll get a new body.

535
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:31,240
 A lot of people think that, okay, once we die,

536
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,960
 our spirit will go like floating around, you know,

537
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,920
 just being creepy and all that.

538
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:42,400
 No, that's not the biblical picture.

539
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,520
 The Bible tells us that we are going somewhere,

540
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,600
 eschatology, going some end,

541
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,560
 and the end is the glorified body.

542
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:57,120
 All God's people will share in Jesus Christ.

543
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,640
 And lastly, the Creed says,

544
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,080
 I believe life everlasting.

545
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,000
 That is the new world.

546
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,720
 Eternal life is not something

547
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,400
 that we experience after we die.

548
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:16,000
 Eternal life is the experience that we have once

549
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:20,240
 you come to know Christ.

550
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,560
 When you come to know Jesus, that is eternal life.

551
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,120
 And God is with you.

552
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,040
 And you live in the presence of God.

553
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:33,040
 That's why the Bible continues again and again

554
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:37,080
 telling you, you need to be obedient.

555
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,760
 You need to listen to the word of God.

556
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,080
 You need to walk with the spirit

557
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:44,520
 so that you can live in the presence of God, right?

558
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,760
 And that is conditional.

559
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:49,840
 I know God's love is unconditional in some sense,

560
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,880
 but it's also conditional.

561
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:56,880
 If you want to experience the power and the joy,

562
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,680
 the peace, the hope that we have in Jesus Christ,

563
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,400
 well, there is condition.

564
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,400
 We need to be committed to worship Him.

565
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,440
 John 10, 10.

566
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,520
 Let me close with this verse.

567
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,080
 Jesus is talking to the Jewish people in the New Testament,

568
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,680
 to the people of God.

569
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:24,840
 The thief comes only to steal and kill and to destroy.

570
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:31,040
 I, Jesus said, came that you may have life

571
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:36,240
 and have it abundantly, abundantly, you know?

572
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,080
 Like overflowing in your life, right?

573
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,080
 All the good things of the kingdom,

574
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,120
 the joy, the peace, the patience, the hope,

575
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:47,680
 and all those good stuff will be so overflowing

576
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,440
 in the cup of your life.

577
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,720
 You cannot bear to contain them.

578
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,800
 It has to overflow out of your life

579
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,600
 and you need to share with other people, right?

580
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,600
 You need to, you know, have other people experience it.

581
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,440
 It's shareable, right?

582
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,440
 And it has to be shared.

583
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:09,520
 There is life abundant.

584
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,760
 In Old Testament term, this is New Testament,

585
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,600
 Gospel of John, in Old Testament term, it's shalom.

586
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,880
 Shalom.

587
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,560
 Even the Israeli Jews today will meet each other,

588
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:23,040
 see each other, and they will say the first word,

589
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:27,160
 not hi, not hello, but shalom.

590
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,400
 Shalom.

591
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,240
 What is shalom?

592
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,880
 Shalom is not merely the absence of war.

593
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:42,200
 It's not just the absence of frustration,

594
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,760
 absence of death, all the bad things.

595
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:49,440
 It's not just the absence of the negative things.

596
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:54,440
 Shalom is positively means all the great things

597
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,560
 that we have in the kingdom,

598
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:03,120
 all the great attributes of God that we can share,

599
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:06,080
 we can experience, that is shalom, right?

600
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:10,880
 Quite meaningful, you know, to greet each other,

601
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,200
 to say shalom.

602
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:14,560
 I wish you well.

603
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,880
 Your body, your spirit, your mind, your emotion,

604
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,520
 everything in your life will be so blessed

605
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,920
 that you can have shalom, right?

606
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:33,280
 That is a foretaste, a foretaste of the new world,

607
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,800
 the new heaven and new earth.

608
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,760
 Well, I pray that God will bless you in such a way

609
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,400
 that you will continue to experience the foretaste

610
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,480
 of the banquet, foretaste of the great things to come,

611
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,840
 the greatest thing to come.

612
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:56,520
 Nothing the world can offer you that,

613
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,680
 only in Christ we have this hope.

614
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,080
 Let us all pray together.

615
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:06,600
 Father, we give thanks because you are our great God.

616
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:11,080
 And thank you for the hope that we have in the kingdom,

617
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,960
 the eternal hope that we have,

618
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,160
 that that hope challenges and conquers death,

619
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:28,400
 and conquers the dark power of Satan and sin.

620
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,960
 And I pray that this hope will be,

621
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:36,400
 will sink in into the very core of our being,

622
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:39,880
 that we'll continue to look forward

623
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,880
 to this new heaven and new earth, this life eternal.

624
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,040
 And thank you that we are justified in Christ.

625
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,680
 And thank you for your spirit being sent to be with us,

626
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,280
 to dwell in us, to sanctify us,

627
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,240
 to help us to walk and follow you.

628
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,480
 And I pray that one day we look forward

629
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:08,040
 to the day of glorification,

630
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,400
 that we can experience kingdom in the fullness.

631
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,000
 And right now, no matter where we are,

632
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:18,440
 no matter what circumstances we are facing,

633
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,480
 we get the foretaste of the glorious heaven.

634
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,520
 That someday we'll see you face to face,

635
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:29,360
 and your people will continue to worship you, to serve you.

636
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:32,680
 And thank you for the church that we have,

637
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,520
 the community of faith that we share,

638
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,440
 the communion of saints.

639
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:38,160
 And I pray that this sense of unity

640
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:41,960
 will continue to grow your church, to grow your family,

641
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,040
 that your church will be your people,

642
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,840
 empowered to glorify your name.

643
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:49,800
 In Christ's name, we pray, amen.

644
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:53,000
 Well, lastly, two minutes, I want to.
