1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Hey guys, I know a lot of people are sick in the last week, right?

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,940
 You sick too? Yeah. And I've been sick.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,200
 And since last Sunday evening,

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,740
 after all this talking and meeting and I lost my voice for three straight

5
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,400
 days, three days. Yeah. I completely lost my voice.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,200
 This is the first time happened in my life. I could not speak, you know,

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,480
 you know, this is how,

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,400
 how devastating it is for me to not to be able to speak a word,

9
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,740
 right? Especially because we know we are pastors. We, uh,

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:37,100
 we live by what we say, right? And we have to say,

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,000
 we have to say things that we have to speak. Right.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,400
 And what is most frustrating for me is actually at home when I'm trying to

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:49,100
 command my children to do something good for the family. Right.

14
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:54,300
 I said, Nathan, can you do the dishes? Because of my crack voice,

15
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,860
 you know, I couldn't speak up. Right. And then how they deal with me,

16
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:00,700
 it was that, what can you say that again?

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:05,960
 And it was very, very frustrating. And, uh, on Wednesday, last Wednesday,

18
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:09,800
 I slowly get my voice back. Um, so, you know,

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,060
 as you can tell my voice has not fully recovered. Um, but, um,

20
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:18,560
 because, because of my voice, it's not working so well,

21
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,140
 I will make today's sermon a little bit shorter. Praise God, right?

22
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,960
 Happy new year. So anyways, uh,

23
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,360
 last Sunday we began the series on atomic wisdom.

24
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,800
 And this is part two. As I said, atomic does not mean destruction.

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:40,800
 Atomic means tiny, insignificant, but as we, uh,

26
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,840
 do life change,

27
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,300
 we need to understand the dynamic of making life change successful,

28
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,140
 making life change sustainable. We want to achieve our goals in the new year,

29
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:53,420
 whatever new year resolutions you may have.

30
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:58,020
 We need to understand on what conditions that we can improve ourselves.

31
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:02,760
 Whether you are doing your schoolwork or you're doing your career or your

32
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,620
 family plan or financial plan or spiritual plan, whatever that is,

33
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:11,520
 we have to understand what conditions are necessary to make life change,

34
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,880
 uh, sustainable. So that is what, uh, this is all about. Uh,

35
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:20,920
 we trying to integrate behavioral psychology insights from a book like

36
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,380
 atomic habits by James clear on the left, or, uh,

37
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,080
 we integrate it with, uh, the book of prophets,

38
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,840
 or especially a chunk of writings in the Bible called wisdom literature.

39
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,020
 And as you can tell, if you find wisdom literature in the Bible,

40
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,720
 usually is in the middle of the Bible,

41
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,480
 some of the Psalms and the book of prophets,

42
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:48,020
 they are full of wisdom and insights of how to live a skillful living,

43
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,840
 how to live a life that will honor to God.

44
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,800
 And there's one characteristics about, uh, wisdom literature. Um,

45
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,940
 it is bottom up literature, not top down.

46
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:05,100
 As I told you, the prophetic literature,

47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:10,060
 what the prophet says or the Torah, the law, this all top down, right?

48
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,500
 God reveal himself.

49
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,760
 God tell you what his demands are and what his principles are from top down

50
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:21,960
 revelation from top, top down and wisdom literature is bottom up.

51
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:27,360
 So the wise teacher will observe the creation, the creatures, the human,

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,240
 humanity,

53
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:33,400
 how human nature is and trying to draw lessons and revelation of God from

54
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:37,520
 bottom up from the creation.

55
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:42,680
 So I think this kind of literature will help us or inspire us to open our eyes

56
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:46,720
 to observe how the order of the cosmos,

57
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,920
 how the order of God's creation is and learn wisdom here and there.

58
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:56,520
 Like this one, 25 from the book of prophets, it says the perfect,

59
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:01,460
 the purposes of a man's heart are deep waters,

60
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,700
 deep waters. So you look into yourself,

61
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:10,460
 you find you're doing some thinking all the time and your thought life,

62
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:16,160
 whatever you're thinking of the purposes of the thinking of a man's heart,

63
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:19,640
 unlike deep water, deep water.

64
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:24,120
 How many of you do fishing from time to time? Right? Like deep water fishing.

65
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:29,140
 No shaking your head. Boring, right? Like deep water fishing.

66
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,160
 You know,

67
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,160
 you gotta have your bait down deep in the water and you can wait and once you

68
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,760
 get your fish, you gotta pull it out, right? And patiently pull it out.

69
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,760
 This is what wisdom is all about,

70
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,920
 especially wisdom and insight into human nature.

71
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,920
 It's like man's heart are like deep water.

72
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:53,360
 Even we sometimes don't understand what we are thinking about,

73
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,040
 but a man of understanding, a wise teacher will draw them out.

74
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,120
 Use patience, use principles to observe and to understand human nature.

75
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:12,320
 Then you understand how we work, understand the general human nature.

76
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,800
 That is wisdom literature.

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,040
 And European journal did a study of 96 people some years ago and find that if a

78
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,320
 person wants to form a new habit, say you have new year resolution,

79
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,040
 say you don't read your Bible every day,

80
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:35,520
 you want to have a new habit to read the Bible every single day.

81
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,800
 How many days would it take for a person to form that new habit?

82
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:45,760
 It finds that the shortest time for someone to develop a new habit is 18 days.

83
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:53,720
 18 days doable, right? 18 days.

84
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,920
 The longest time for some people,

85
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:01,080
 the lazy people is 254 days.

86
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,360
 That's still doable, right? Less than a year. And you can form a new habit.

87
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,240
 How many of you floss every single day? Floss your teeth.

88
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:15,320
 Only a handful. How disappointing, right?

89
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,320
 But good news to the dentist, right?

90
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:22,560
 How many of you go to the dentist like once every six months, once every,

91
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,200
 every year? You should go. You should go. Okay.

92
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,680
 Flossing is a new habit, right?

93
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,000
 And how many days would you take to form this new habit?

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,640
 Shortest is 18 days. Longest is 254 days.

95
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,480
 And in average is 66 days, 66 days.

96
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:46,640
 So those of you don't floss your teeth, start flossing today.

97
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:52,440
 For 66 days in average, you will have this new habit. Hallelujah.

98
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:54,680
 Right? How cool is that? Right?

99
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:59,200
 So you have to plan ahead and you have to understand how we work, right?

100
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:05,440
 So let's reveal what we have talked about last week is the power of 1%.

101
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,280
 If you make 1% change every single day for 365 days,

102
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,480
 you will be like that curve.

103
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:18,040
 You will accumulate the result and the effect or the impact of your life change

104
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,320
 for 37 times or even better.

105
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:24,800
 Once you have the patience to, to,

106
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,400
 to grind through the valley of disappointment, right?

107
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,040
 However, if you don't do any improvement,

108
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,280
 if you are 1% decline for 365 days, bad news for you,

109
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,640
 you have no result at all. Right?

110
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,920
 So no matter what solutions you have in mind, keep that in mind.

111
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:46,600
 1% only for every single day, 365 days,

112
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:51,440
 you will see impactful result.

113
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,320
 That's principle number one, power of 1%.

114
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,680
 And then the power of incentives or disincentives.

115
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,760
 Once you have incentives in your goal, in your plan,

116
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:07,960
 then the possibility of achieving your goal will be higher.

117
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,920
 And the specifics are better. Remember I said,

118
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,200
 if you have a new goal in mind, a new year resolution,

119
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:20,480
 make sure you specify the when and where and how.

120
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,880
 The more specific you are, the better you will achieve your goal.

121
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,440
 Number four, community, the people you hang out with,

122
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,680
 will make influence on you, will make influence on you.

123
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:36,680
 So you have to understand how it works.

124
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,560
 A lot of this are actually common sense, right?

125
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,920
 They're all common sense.

126
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:47,840
 And of course behavioral psychologists will solidify our understanding how we

127
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:51,400
 work. So we'll continue today with principle number five,

128
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,200
 is the power of default, power of default.

129
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,240
 Now what does it mean? Default.

130
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,120
 Default means something preselected for you,

131
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:06,520
 preselected for you. Now a lot of you use computer, right?

132
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,560
 Right. How many of you will browse the internet? When you browse the internet,

133
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:15,280
 you have to choose which browser to choose. No, right?

134
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:19,600
 How many of you use Chrome? Chrome browser? Edge?

135
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:24,840
 Fox? Firefox? No? I mean,

136
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:27,000
 you browse the internet on your phone or your computer.

137
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:31,280
 There's always default browser, right? I use edge.

138
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,400
 And every time I open edge, sometimes the right-hand corner will ask me,

139
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:39,400
 do you want to make Chrome the default? I said, no,

140
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,080
 don't bother me. Right?

141
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,360
 That is the power of default because you don't have to choose because it's

142
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:48,480
 already preselected for you. That's how live change works, right?

143
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,560
 Recently, my wife just got a new phone.

144
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,640
 Actually it's an old phone from Rachel because Rachel got a new phone and I give

145
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,200
 the used phone to mom as new as iPhone.

146
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,400
 She has been using Android for years and she just

147
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:10,360
 got switched to iPhone.

148
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,600
 So my whole family, everyone is using iPhone except me now.

149
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:20,280
 I'm the only Android user and it took her days to get used to the iPhone.

150
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,000
 Yesterday, last night,

151
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,880
 she was still struggling with the iPhone operation

152
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,880
 system. Right? I said, good luck to you. Right?

153
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,680
 And it takes time to make the default happen. Right?

154
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:41,080
 For me, Android is the default. For some of you, iPhone is the default,

155
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,880
 but you have to understand the power of change for default. Right?

156
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:49,080
 So psychologist tells us usually when, when,

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:54,120
 when there's something new happen in the calendar and you make some new year

158
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,960
 resolution, some new goals,

159
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:00,960
 the chances of succeeding is better.

160
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,560
 Say you have some new life change,

161
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,640
 a fresh start strategy, like new year.

162
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,400
 Usually people make new goals or plan for new

163
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,080
 endeavors when,

164
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,560
 when the new year hits,

165
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,960
 because this is first strategy and the behavioral scientists are telling us

166
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,960
 people would like to tie new goal at some turning point in their lives.

167
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:34,680
 So this month is the best day or best time to make new year resolution. Right?

168
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,720
 Right. You don't want to make some new goals on September 19th. Right?

169
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,440
 I mean, what does that have to do with you? Right? September 19th,

170
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,440
 by the way, is our birthday. Right? It has nothing to do with you. Right?

171
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,920
 But new year, everyone's new year.

172
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:54,920
 Everyone is going through new year and first start strategy usually work.

173
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,480
 22 six from the book of Proverbs.

174
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,920
 It says to train a child in the way he should go.

175
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,720
 When he's old, he will not turn from it.

176
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,680
 Train, discipline or dedicate,

177
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:15,400
 begin or inaugurating the life of a child when he was born or she was born.

178
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,960
 You want to set the default for her.

179
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:24,840
 She'll come to Sunday school. She will come to learn the faith. Right?

180
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,280
 By the way, this is not brainwashing. Right? It's teaching.

181
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:34,280
 We all want to teach the best thing for our child and our faith and our values

182
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:37,000
 are the most important things that we want to teach our child.

183
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:42,840
 And the Proverbs sets train your child or dedicate him in the way he should go

184
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:48,600
 the rest of his life. Then in general, when he is getting older,

185
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,760
 he will not depart from it because the beginnings are critical.

186
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,960
 The default is critical.

187
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:03,640
 I'm talking about the power of default. One of the scholars, um, you can,

188
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,160
 you know, do a Google search is James Choi. James Choi.

189
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,640
 James Choi is a professor at Yale school of business.

190
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:20,000
 It's very interesting, right? Uh, Choi is a professor as Yale school.

191
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,480
 Yale is one of the best schools in the world.

192
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,280
 And, uh, Choi is a solid question.

193
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,800
 When you Google on YouTube talking about James Choi, uh,

194
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,200
 he will be so point blank telling people about his faith,

195
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:41,480
 right? And news channel interview him. He always say, I am a Christian.

196
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,920
 So choice is solid question. And he has done much research on 401k,

197
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:52,040
 401k. How many of you have 401k or some sort of retirement plan? Right?

198
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,880
 You do, right?

199
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:58,320
 And James Choi is one of the scholars who has done so much research on a 401k.

200
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,720
 And he found that, uh,

201
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,520
 the ideal saving rate for today's Americans is

202
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:10,240
 14% of your income, 14% of your income.

203
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,120
 Um, you invest 40% of your income into 401k.

204
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,600
 Then, uh, you have a really solid retirement, uh,

205
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,000
 arrangement for yourself and his study. Uh,

206
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,600
 one of his studies try to follow up on people, uh,

207
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,160
 employees signing up for 401k.

208
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,440
 Now the first option of the study is that the first group of people to have the

209
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,960
 employees or new employees, when they, uh,

210
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:43,000
 go to work first day to give them the choice to opt in,

211
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:48,720
 to sign up for 401k and give them 30 days to do

212
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,800
 so. So when you're new to the company, when you're a new employee,

213
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,160
 the boss will tell you, the HR will tell you, okay,

214
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,360
 you have 30 days to sign the full 401k plan. All right.

215
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:04,880
 And this assess rate for people opting in the

216
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:08,160
 401k plan in 30 days is 75%.

217
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:14,040
 Not bad, right? Not bad. However, if you reverse it,

218
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,840
 but the second group,

219
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,880
 the second group of employees is that when they come to work the first day,

220
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,960
 you already signed them up for 401k.

221
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,520
 So it's automatic enrollment and then you give them 30 days to

222
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:33,040
 opt out. All right. So first day of work,

223
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:37,680
 HR telling you, you are signed up for 401k already. All right.

224
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,840
 You have 30 days to opt out. You can sign off from the plan.

225
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,960
 And the end,

226
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:48,520
 we saw the success rate for people signing up for 401k with

227
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,720
 automatic enrollment is 100%.

228
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,600
 100%. Why?

229
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,320
 Because the power of default, right?

230
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,640
 You presuppose something in your life,

231
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:06,400
 some sort of habit like this day of the week,

232
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,120
 I'm going to come to worship. This time of day,

233
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,120
 I'm going to read the Bible. That is the default position.

234
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:19,960
 And you have the default presuppose and it will have 1% chance,

235
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:25,240
 1% effect on you and 365 days you have 30 plus life effect change in your life.

236
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:30,760
 Every single morning after I had my,

237
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,160
 when I have my breakfast during my breakfast time,

238
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,560
 I would turn to the phone.

239
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,760
 I'll go to YouTube because I subscribe to a channel.

240
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:46,200
 It's a devotional channel and it will take me a reading one verse from the Old

241
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,560
 Testament and one verse from the New Testament and each video take one verse is

242
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,520
 only three to five minute long. So during the breakfast,

243
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:04,600
 I will turn to the YouTube channel and I will watch that video and the teacher

244
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:10,880
 will explain to me what this version is all about. Right?

245
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:16,200
 Is that easy? It's easy, right? But that's my default position.

246
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:20,200
 So I've been doing it for many, many, many, many,

247
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,600
 many times and for a very, very long time.

248
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:26,400
 And that is the power of default, right?

249
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,080
 So think about it when you plan your new year,

250
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:34,080
 when you plan your life goals are important,

251
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,440
 but you have to understand the power and the effect of default presupposing in

252
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:44,640
 your life, then it will have life, permanent life change on you.

253
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,200
 Number six, make it personal.

254
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:53,280
 The more personalized your goals are,

255
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,680
 the interventions are, the more successful the outcome.

256
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,840
 The more personal it is, you make it more personal,

257
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,200
 then it will make it more sustainable.

258
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,040
 And that's why people hire personal trainer in the gym, right?

259
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:13,680
 How many of you have personal coach to help you do exercise?

260
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,880
 No, huh? I know, I know, I know you guys don't do that. Yeah.

261
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:23,120
 But you know, because you have, people have personal trainers,

262
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,480
 so they've, they will feel accountable, right?

263
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,080
 It's a person to person relationship.

264
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,160
 Proverbs 27 says,

265
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:36,560
 like a bird that strays from his nest is a person who strays from his home.

266
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:41,640
 So talking about people who left their home, right?

267
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,760
 Like many of you left your homeland and you're trying to take root here in the

268
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,560
 foreign land. You are like a bird, right? You're like a bird.

269
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,280
 You're flying here and there. You left your nest.

270
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,760
 Then we'll skip to verse 10. It says,

271
00:18:55,760 --> 00:19:01,160
 but do not forsake your friend and the friend of your father and do not go to

272
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:05,640
 your brother's house when disaster strikes you. Why?

273
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:11,000
 Why don't you go to your brother's house when you need help?

274
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
 Because here's the wisdom,

275
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:19,440
 better a neighbor nearby than a brother far away because you already move away

276
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,960
 from your homeland, right? Whoever have blood relationship with you,

277
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:29,200
 your dad or your mom, your siblings. Yeah, they, they, they,

278
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,160
 they are close right in terms of blood relationship.

279
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,040
 But since you move away from them, you are far away from them.

280
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,280
 And who is better when this, when you need help?

281
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:43,360
 A neighbor without blood relationship

282
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,240
 nearby would be more valuable, right?

283
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,000
 That's what I find church family valuable, right?

284
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,920
 Sometimes we bump into each other and we learn each other and Oh,

285
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,680
 you're a Christian too. I'm a Christian too.

286
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:03,400
 It's for some unexplainable reason, some mysterious connection, right?

287
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:07,280
 Because our faith, our core values are the same,

288
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,640
 even though we are not blood related, right? And we feel close, right?

289
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:17,080
 That's why we have fellowship and that's why we foster the relationship and our

290
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,880
 faith community so that we get this wisdom.

291
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:26,080
 What is it? Better is a neighbor nearby than a brother,

292
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,280
 a blood related brother far away, right?

293
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,280
 That's what church is for, right? When you need help,

294
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:39,680
 people around you and nearby who can help you more so than your siblings,

295
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:46,000
 right? Amen to that. Sometimes it's like that, right?

296
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,200
 I heard a story about a PhD student. The PhD student, you know,

297
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,960
 you need to graduate from a PhD program. You have to write dissertation, right?

298
00:20:54,960 --> 00:21:00,520
 And this station runs around 200 to 300 pages long and you have to write a lot

299
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,440
 of chapters and you have to write those chapters by a certain date, right?

300
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,480
 So the story I heard is that this PhD student,

301
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:17,240
 because he has to write a certain chapter, like chapter one,

302
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,480
 by a certain date, chapter two, and then by a further day,

303
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,520
 and then chapter three and so on, right? In order to motivate himself,

304
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,600
 he writes a series of checks, post dated,

305
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,640
 date them accordingly and give the stack of checks to his friends and saying,

306
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,400
 you know, if I don't write a chapter by a certain day,

307
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:45,200
 then you can cast a check. Right? Sounds like a good strategy, right?

308
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,560
 And make it really, really personal, right?

309
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:50,840
 Because not only the checks are with the friends,

310
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:54,840
 but the checks are your money, right? If you don't,

311
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,960
 if he doesn't write a certain chapter by a certain deadline,

312
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,200
 then he will lose the money, right? But if he does so,

313
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:05,920
 then he will get the check back, right?

314
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:11,880
 Make it personal. As you know, I'm in a PhD program.

315
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,920
 I don't think I would do that. Yeah.

316
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:19,720
 But think about it, you know,

317
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:23,600
 spiritual goals or some sort of new year resolution,

318
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,080
 Bible reading plan. You ask a friend to keep you accountable, right?

319
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,200
 You ask a neighbor, "Hey, check on me." Right?

320
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:37,800
 Did I keep the reading going or not?

321
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,800
 Well, as I said, my sermon will be shorter.

322
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:44,080
 So I would like to do a short conclusion today.

323
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,040
 And coming back to here,

324
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:51,320
 what I shared to you last week is that there are three big areas we have to

325
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,320
 think about our life. When we manage our life,

326
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,280
 God has given us, think of this three areas of growth,

327
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:02,360
 spiritual growth, spiritual health, and emotional health,

328
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:08,440
 and physical health. Set some goals or have some ideas, specific ideas,

329
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,560
 how you can live a life of wisdom,

330
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,080
 manage your life better.

331
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,080
 And today I would like to emphasize on emotional health.

332
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,600
 And I know to many of you, perhaps emotional health is a new language.

333
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,880
 A new aspect. Right?

334
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,760
 But emotional health is very, very, very important. Very important.

335
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:37,200
 And you know, my generation or my previous generation,

336
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,200
 would like to sweep things under the rug. You know,

337
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:44,560
 that's how we deal with emotions. Right? You feel sad.

338
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:49,520
 You tear up, you know, that's not a man's thing. Right?

339
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,320
 That's what my dad taught me. Right? Sweep it under the rug. Right? Yeah.

340
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,280
 You grind your teeth and then you move on. Right?

341
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:00,840
 And who cares about your emotional health? Right? But you know,

342
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,200
 in this generation, I think we need to learn this language.

343
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,080
 We need to learn how to live with emotional health.

344
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,760
 If you read some of the Psalms in the Bible,

345
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:16,640
 the Psalms are prayers of the people of God,

346
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,800
 to God, people of God, to the Lord.

347
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:25,120
 And they write Psalms and their prayers and that become the book of

348
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:25,960
 Psalms. Right?

349
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:31,040
 Many of these prayers are not rosy and happy

350
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,280
 prayers. Right? Yeah.

351
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,960
 There are praise Psalms and Thanksgiving Psalms and all that. Right?

352
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,120
 But many of the Psalms are written

353
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,640
 from some sort of negative emotions.

354
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,520
 The Psalms you find,

355
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:52,280
 they are in fear and they are struggling with anxiety.

356
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:58,760
 They are struggling with fear and depression and

357
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:02,520
 sadness. Sometimes they cry out to the Lord. Right?

358
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:06,880
 When they wake up and prosper, their hearts are frustrated. Right?

359
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,000
 But they write the prayers out and they go to God. Right?

360
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,280
 So the Psalms are full of laments,

361
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:19,040
 will and honest prayers and they grieve before God.

362
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,880
 And the people of God did not hold back their true feelings toward God.

363
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,760
 And bow means because God is all knowing. Right?

364
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,800
 God knows how you feel. Right? You can't hide it.

365
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,200
 You can't sweep under the rug, but it's there. Right?

366
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,680
 But you need to understand God is big enough to handle your complaints,

367
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:43,240
 your griefs, and your laments.

368
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,560
 And we can draw close to God with deeper intimacy.

369
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:54,280
 I find that sometimes Christians always like to over-spiritualize things.

370
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,920
 There is a certain tendency,

371
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:03,920
 especially conservative Christians. We like to spiritualize things.

372
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:09,040
 You know, when you feel sad and we say, "Oh, we need to give thanks." Right?

373
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:13,440
 Because give thanks every day and be joyful every day. Right?

374
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,120
 Are those true? Yeah, those are true. Right? In a certain sense.

375
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:23,000
 But you know, when we feel sad, sometimes we sweep it under the rug and say,

376
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:26,680
 you know, if we are living faithfully, we have faith in God,

377
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,000
 we should not feel sad. Right?

378
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,000
 And that is tragic because that will suppress our emotions and sweep it under

379
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:39,880
 the rug and it will do damage to ourselves. You know,

380
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,520
 recently you may have heard some news stories about, you know,

381
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:47,320
 some celebrities, right, commit suicide.

382
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,800
 I heard one from someone in the morning service. He said,

383
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:58,760
 there's a Korean actor or actress, something like that,

384
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:02,760
 celebrity who committed suicide. And days before,

385
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:07,960
 nobody knew that he was going through something negatively.

386
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,280
 There was no signs. Right?

387
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,640
 Because you think about physical symptoms are visible. Right? Like my voice is,

388
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,920
 you know, you can hear it, right?

389
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:22,120
 It's visible and you know I'm sick. Right?

390
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:26,840
 You have runny nose, you're sick. There's a physical, visible,

391
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,040
 you know, bodily symptoms. But emotional,

392
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:37,760
 usually has no visible signs. Right?

393
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,160
 People may sound positive, but you know,

394
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:47,800
 in the middle of the night you're struggling with some griefs or some dark

395
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:51,280
 emotions. And what do you do about it? Right? Instead of,

396
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:54,440
 instead of suppressing it, you know,

397
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:59,040
 the Psalm gives us the channel to go to God in prayers.

398
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:02,880
 And God can certainly beg enough to hear your cries.

399
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,800
 And it's okay to go to heavenly daddy to say, you know, I,

400
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,240
 I feel sad and I struggle. Right? I complain.

401
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,520
 God can certainly handle that.

402
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:20,920
 Many years ago, I think almost 20 years ago,

403
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:26,960
 I was in a state of some sort of fatigue, you know,

404
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:31,320
 very, very exhausted, you know, emotionally and spiritually.

405
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:36,120
 And I was trying to figure out what is going on in my life. You know,

406
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:39,240
 from the outside, nobody can, nobody can tell. Right.

407
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,160
 Even my wife cannot tell. Right.

408
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:46,520
 My wife cannot tell because I take care of her. I do my best. Right.

409
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:50,280
 Nobody knows. You know, I feel really,

410
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:55,520
 really restless and exhausted. So I got some books and, you know,

411
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,520
 I know where the resources are. So I got this book.

412
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:00,920
 This book is called, um,

413
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,200
 "Unmasking Male Depression" written by a Christian psychologist,

414
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,920
 Archibald Hart.

415
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:15,520
 Now Hart has been a professor of Christian psychology in Fuller Seminary in

416
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,960
 California for many, many years from 1970,

417
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:25,360
 early 1970s to, to the 2000s. Um, he ended his career,

418
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:30,720
 um, uh, teaching at Fuller until 2016.

419
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,320
 And he just passed away at Be With The Lord in 2021 during the

420
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,840
 pandemic. And he wrote this book. And by the way, this is not,

421
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,400
 this may not be one of the best books on market,

422
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:45,600
 but this is a very, very helpful book. So I picked up this book.

423
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,600
 I didn't know what this book is all about. Right.

424
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,360
 It talks about male depression. Hey, I'm male.

425
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,000
 I feel depressed. Right. And by the way, there's,

426
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,280
 there's also another book he has written with another psychologist,

427
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,880
 um, on female depression. So I picked up this book after the first chapters,

428
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,840
 I could not put it down.

429
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:13,720
 I could not put it down because it's like a mirror and

430
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,120
 telling me what kind of depression I am going through,

431
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:22,040
 what kind of emotional state I'm going through and the signs and symptoms and all

432
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,280
 that, and how to deal with that,

433
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:28,080
 how to allow me to have room to deal with the dark emotions

434
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,360
 inside my mind, right inside my feeling.

435
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:35,680
 So I find this book is a life-saving book for me. Now I struggle for it.

436
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:42,320
 I struggled for probably two plus years. Yeah. Two plus years serving in the church.

437
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:46,560
 And, uh, you know, my plate is full and I'm full of activities. Right.

438
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:49,600
 But in the middle of the night, I'm just find myself, you know,

439
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,520
 struggling and exhausted.

440
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,680
 And this book helped me to clarify a lot of issues I was going through.

441
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,560
 Now I give you this example because I want to tell you, we have to,

442
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:07,720
 um, have the wisdom to manage our emotions.

443
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,640
 We do. We do. Okay. Don't learn from the previous generation.

444
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,720
 Right. They're doing the wrong way. You know, they deny it,

445
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:21,600
 but what is the way out? Right.

446
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:26,400
 How do we manage emotions correctly, properly and wisely?

447
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,560
 Right. So these are some of the resources that you should have.

448
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:34,960
 And in the morning service, I also mentioned, uh, probably there was a necessity

449
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,200
 for us to go to see a counselor. You know, in Chinatown,

450
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:43,320
 we have a wonderful growing ministry of counseling.

451
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:47,600
 Um, I don't know what the English is, but, um, they are trilingual.

452
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,280
 So English, Cantonese, and Mandarin,

453
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:55,960
 and you can call them and set up an appointment and you can see

454
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:59,040
 a counselor, a professional counselor, uh,

455
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,400
 well-equipped to help you process, you know, what is going on in your life.

456
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,880
 And usually it's about what four to six sessions.

457
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,000
 Each session is about 50 minutes.

458
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:14,680
 You talk to a skilled counselor and she or he will be able to draw

459
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:18,560
 things out of you to help you manage your emotions better.

460
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,760
 I believe there's no healthy question unless we are emotionally healthy,

461
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:27,800
 unless we're physically healthy, unless we're spiritually healthy.

462
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:32,400
 And those three things, or even more mental and all the,

463
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:37,280
 all the other aspects of our lives are intimately integrated together.

464
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,480
 And we need to make sure that we are healthy. Right. So, um,

465
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,400
 if, if that rings a bell, you know, you can come to me and, um, you know,

466
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:51,600
 I can give you a brochure and give you the information. You know,

467
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,000
 one of my good friends, uh, Dr. Jane Mann,

468
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,400
 Jane Mann is one of the skilled counselors, uh,

469
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,320
 working there and serving the community. And definitely you should try it. Right.

470
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:06,600
 Um, actually they charge, but it doesn't charge that much. You know,

471
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:09,720
 I talked to Jane, I said, how do you earn money?

472
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,520
 How do you make it sustainable? Right.

473
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,400
 But the goal of the ministry is to serve the community,

474
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,720
 to serve people like you and me. Right.

475
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:23,800
 And it's necessary. It's necessary. Right. Um,

476
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,400
 I don't know what happened to you in the past year.

477
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,280
 Maybe the past year has been a really rough year for you. Uh,

478
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,720
 you really struggling. Sometimes we just strip things under the rug.

479
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,200
 Maybe you need to see some of the resources that's out there.

480
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,720
 Maybe you need to see a professional counselor. And by the way,

481
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,120
 don't have that misconception that, Oh,

482
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,120
 I'm going to see a counselor. That means I'm insane.

483
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:00,280
 No, you can see a counselor and enrich yourself. Right.

484
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,600
 You can enrich yourself by talking to a well-trained

485
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,960
 counselor. Right. Everybody should see a counselor. Right.

486
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,640
 We all need another wise person in front of us to

487
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:19,560
 draw things out of us so that we can live, um,

488
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,440
 healthily. Right.

489
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:24,680
 We can live a life that would bring honor to God.

490
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:31,000
 All right. So we understand all this principles and let's go to God

491
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:36,360
 and pray that we will continue to live a

492
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,920
 faithful living and, um, uh, live a life of wisdom,

493
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:44,920
 honoring to God. And then we're going to partake the communion together.

494
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,520
 Let's all pray. Father, thank you.

495
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:53,200
 Thank you for all the bad and good experiences that we have.

496
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,760
 Curses and blessing you give and take away.

497
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:01,880
 And you are the Lord who is sovereign over our lives and you're in control of

498
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:06,760
 all things. Father, once again, we come before you as the first Sunday of

499
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:11,880
 2024, we commit ourselves into your hand.

500
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,160
 And knowing that you are the God who is kind,

501
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:22,400
 who is gracious, who loves us so much.

502
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,440
 Thank you for all that you have done through your son,

503
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,720
 Jesus Christ on the cross. You redeem us holistically.

504
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,960
 You'd only not only save our soul, but you save our body.

505
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,560
 You grant us holistic redemption.

506
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:51,160
 And I pray that our lives will rest in your hand and we'll find the true

507
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,080
 peace.

508
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:58,280
 Help us God to live in a way that will honor you.

509
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:02,760
 As we launch into a new year,

510
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:09,080
 we don't know what you have in store for us, but we know your character.

511
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:13,760
 We know you are a good God. So once again,

512
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:18,320
 we pray that you will hear our cries, hear our struggle,

513
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:24,240
 help us to grow spiritually, physically, and emotionally, mentally,

514
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,920
 healthy in such a way that we will draw closer and closer to you.

515
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:34,560
 Thank you for being there and walking alongside with us,

516
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,600
 even in our dark times and also in our good times.

517
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,960
 Thank you for being our faithful God.

518
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,200
 As we enjoy the communion together, take the bread and the cup.

519
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:54,040
 Help us be reminded how much you love us. In Christ name we pray.
