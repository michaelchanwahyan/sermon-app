1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
 All right, thanks, Kelly.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,900
 Well, today's marathon, you guys in the race?

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,200
 You wish, right?

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,140
 You wish.

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,480
 I was talking to someone in the morning service, and

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:12,180
 he's a veteran.

7
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,340
 He's actually ran, I think, five races in the past 10 years.

8
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,380
 So he's a veteran.

9
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:21,040
 He doesn't have to do the draw to to join the race.

10
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,640
 So so I was I was I was looking at him.

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,540
 He was here and I was talking to him and said,

12
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,040
 Why are you here?

13
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,400
 Was supposed to be a running.

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,740
 Right. And he said, No, I'm not going to run today.

15
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,200
 I mean, this year and he's running, you know, every every other year.

16
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,740
 So we do have some runners.

17
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,800
 We do have some runners in our congregation.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
 In any case, good to be with you.

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,900
 And I know the traffic is kind of crazy, especially if you're coming

20
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,100
 from the downtown area and the South Loop area.

21
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,080
 But, you know, it's great to be here.

22
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,180
 We will go to the last letter of the seven letters to the seven churches.

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:07,080
 So if you have the Bible, please turn with me to chapter three,

24
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:10,480
 chapter three of Revelation.

25
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,840
 We are finally coming to the last letter.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,880
 Remember, there were seven letters.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,440
 Jesus sent letters to seven churches

28
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:25,040
 and from Ephesus, the first one and all the way to

29
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,940
 Lilladahshir today and Lilladahshir is kind of inland.

30
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,080
 It's about 40 miles southwest of Philadelphia.

31
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,200
 Remember, we talk about the latter to Philadelphia as well.

32
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,840
 And also is 100 miles east of Ephesus.

33
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,580
 So it's situated in a valley.

34
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:48,880
 It's a very fertile valley.

35
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,940
 And what is known for in Lilladahshir

36
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,380
 is that it's a traffic hub. It's kind of like Chicago, right?

37
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,900
 It's kind of like Chicago.

38
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,140
 We are right at the center of all the traffic.

39
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,840
 That's why we always have a traffic jam all the time.

40
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,180
 And it's getting worse with all the road constructions and all that.

41
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,040
 And back in the first century,

42
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,300
 there was a Roman highway going through from right to left

43
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,980
 and it passes through Lilladahshir.

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,900
 So as you can see, it's a traffic hub.

45
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:25,300
 It's also a banking hub, a financial hub.

46
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:31,500
 And it's also famous for textile industry and medical schools.

47
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,580
 You know, back then they have medical schools

48
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,540
 and they have fairly famous

49
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,340
 medicine for eye diseases.

50
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:45,080
 If you have some eye diseases in those days, you go to Lilladahshir.

51
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,900
 In those days, you go there to be a doctor.

52
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,140
 You go there to earn money.

53
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,840
 So as you can imagine, the city is very, very rich.

54
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,200
 And all the people there are very rich.

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,700
 And I'll tell you a story in the first century, about 1860.

56
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,200
 So about 30 years after Jesus' death and resurrection.

57
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,200
 And it's within the period of the early church.

58
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,340
 And there was a massive earthquake

59
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:17,100
 happened around the region of Lilladahshir.

60
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:22,540
 And if you remember, the letter of

61
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:29,300
 revelations were written in 1890, late first century.

62
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,000
 So 30 years before this letter was written,

63
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
 this massive earthquake happened in Lilladahshir.

64
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,840
 It was 1860.

65
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,140
 And some of the towns were destroyed as well, like Sardis.

66
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:43,080
 Can you see Sardis right there?

67
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,900
 Sardis, Philadelphia, Sardis.

68
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,000
 Sardis was completely wiped out.

69
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,540
 And Rome has to use the federal fund to help rebuild Sardis.

70
00:03:53,540 --> 00:03:59,280
 However, Lilladahshir is such a remarkable city, and

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,180
 they didn't need any funds from Rome.

72
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:06,880
 And they rebuilt the city themselves.

73
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,800
 It's pretty cool, right?

74
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,300
 In the past few weeks, we heard about the hurricane

75
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,780
 in southeast of United States, Florida.

76
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,740
 Well, just imagine the towns are being just tragic

77
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:25,740
 and everything is wiped out and you need federal money

78
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:30,040
 to pump into the region and to rebuild everything and to clean up everything,

79
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:33,040
 to rebuild the lives of the people.

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,380
 Lilladahshir back then said to the Roman government,

81
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:41,780
 saying to Rome, we don't need your federal money

82
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,300
 because we have enough money to rebuild after the earthquake. Right.

83
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,680
 Pretty cool, right?

84
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:52,940
 And you can imagine the people in the church in Lilladahshir,

85
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:58,240
 they should have that kind of pride and financial resources.

86
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,380
 And that go into the culture, that go into the church.

87
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:07,440
 And I would say it is very true for our church as well.

88
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,940
 Yes, we don't have a lot of people, but aren't we all pretty resourceful?

89
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:16,440
 I think we are.

90
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,700
 In some way or the other.

91
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,080
 So this letter is written to the church in Lilladahshir and also to us.

92
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,940
 Let's read it through. It's a fun letter to read through.

93
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,940
 Verse 14 and following.

94
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,880
 To the angel of the church in Lilladahshir write.

95
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,640
 Jesus said to the church in Lilladahshir, the Christian in Lilladahshir.

96
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,280
 These are the words of the Amen.

97
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:47,000
 The faithful, true witness, the ruler of God's creation.

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,600
 I know your deeds and you are neither cold nor hot.

99
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,540
 I wish you were either one or the other.

100
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,300
 So because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold,

101
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,960
 I am about to speak you out, out of my mouth.

102
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,600
 It's kind of interesting.

103
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,140
 Jesus interceded himself as the Amen.

104
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:14,160
 Well, you know, Amen.

105
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,260
 What does it mean?

106
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,360
 Was pray and end with this cold, cold word.

107
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,640
 Right. This cold word.

108
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,660
 Amen. What does it mean?

109
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,400
 Truth. Right.

110
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,600
 Sincere, truthfully.

111
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,100
 Amen. Amen. I said to you, Jesus said to the people all the time in the gospels.

112
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,340
 Amen. Amen.

113
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:35,060
 I said to you and English translation is truly, truly.

114
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,860
 I said to you, no, God does not lie.

115
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,160
 God cannot lie.

116
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:43,800
 And what God says must be true.

117
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,340
 And it has to be true.

118
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,300
 This is who God is.

119
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:54,500
 Jesus said something about our lives, about the church in Laodicea,

120
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,300
 and he gave his evaluation and the evaluation has to be right,

121
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,800
 has to be truthful, has to be according to the facts.

122
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,000
 And his evaluation is kind of interesting.

123
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,800
 He said, you guys are lukewarm.

124
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,460
 I would rather you guys are hot or cold,

125
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,360
 but you guys are lukewarm, you are neither cold nor hot.

126
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:21,160
 That's interesting.

127
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,700
 Sometimes we use this verse as as if, you know, God is wanting us to

128
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:29,440
 not to be lukewarm, we either be hot or cold.

129
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,140
 And you think about it, it's very interesting if you use this verse this way,

130
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,060
 because, you know, aren't we required to increase our spiritual temperature,

131
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,700
 our passion for God, right?

132
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,840
 Our passion for God.

133
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:50,160
 If if this verse is about our heart temperature for God, our passion for God,

134
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:55,900
 willing God prefer us to be, of course, hot, right?

135
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:00,300
 And of course, warm, warm is better than cold.

136
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,440
 Hot is better than warm.

137
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,000
 You see what I'm saying?

138
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,800
 You know, you take the temperature of the congregation and God is saying,

139
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,900
 hey, you know, you guys are lukewarm.

140
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,160
 I just don't want you guys, I'll spit you out.

141
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,460
 But if hot, meaning we have passion for God,

142
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:20,340
 then of course, God prefers that.

143
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,800
 But if cold in that sense is being lack of passion for God,

144
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,000
 then that sounds kind of strange.

145
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,240
 But the Christians in the little desire are lukewarm.

146
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:35,900
 They're not too hot, not too cold.

147
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,140
 Lukewarm, it's just like a glass of water.

148
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:46,100
 Like a glass of water, you know, between 100 Fahrenheit to 60 Fahrenheit

149
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,400
 is kind of considered hot, right?

150
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,100
 I consider it lukewarm because the temperature,

151
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,140
 if raises above 100 Fahrenheit, it can burn you.

152
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,540
 It can burn your tongue.

153
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,500
 If it's below 60, it's kind of cold.

154
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,960
 So room temperature is kind of like 60 to 100 Fahrenheit.

155
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:10,960
 So we always take this word as the measurement of our spiritual temperature,

156
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
 our passion as Christians.

157
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:20,800
 And God will be saying, you know, I do not prefer you to be lukewarm.

158
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,100
 Now, if that's the case, I think it's kind of strange, right?

159
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:29,000
 As I said, wouldn't God prefer us to be warmer than cold?

160
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,760
 But this word says neither cold nor hot.

161
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,900
 I would rather you guys, you know, be cold or be hot, you know,

162
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,240
 just don't be lukewarm.

163
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,160
 So, you know, there has to be some other way to understand this verse.

164
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,460
 And I think if we get this right, it applies to all of us.

165
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,060
 Now, in order to understand this, we have to understand geography.

166
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,460
 Geography.

167
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,760
 Here on the map, you can see Heropolis.

168
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,500
 Heropolis is on the left, upper left, right?

169
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,800
 Heropolis.

170
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,600
 And then on the right is Colossae.

171
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:14,600
 And then right in the center is Laodicea.

172
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,160
 Now, what am I talking about?

173
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:22,400
 Now, since this passage is about water in Laodicea,

174
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,500
 so we have to take a look at the region, about the water supply.

175
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:35,440
 Now, Heropolis on the upper left is about eight miles north of Laodicea.

176
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,500
 It is a city and it's still a very, a city alive today

177
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:45,840
 because they are famous for hot mineral springs.

178
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,500
 Hot mineral springs.

179
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,140
 Just like you go to Yellowstone National Park,

180
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:54,240
 you see all kinds of, you know, hot springs.

181
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:58,940
 Or you go to hot spring in the Arkansas,

182
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:03,940
 there's a place called Hot Springs because they are known for hot springs

183
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,240
 and people will enjoy it.

184
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,600
 And you can see in the picture, it's still alive today.

185
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:12,240
 And tourists will go there and just dump yourself into a hot spring

186
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,040
 and you just enjoy your time, right?

187
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,900
 Cool.

188
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:18,540
 So that's the water supply in Heropolis.

189
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:22,400
 In the east, on the right, is Colossae.

190
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:28,200
 It is situated at the foot of a snow-capped mountain.

191
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,340
 It's called Mount Katmos.

192
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:35,040
 And because you are right there, Colossae,

193
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:40,040
 you are right below or right at the foothill of the snow-capped mountain,

194
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,700
 what do you get?

195
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,740
 You get cold water.

196
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:45,240
 Therapeutic water.

197
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,840
 And you can take a bath even.

198
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:51,240
 And you can drink the pure, pure water.

199
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,440
 It's like you get a bottle of water today,

200
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,100
 it says whatever mountain, whatever spring that it comes from,

201
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,600
 probably it's fake.

202
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,700
 But you get pure water in Colossae.

203
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,300
 So you got hot water on the left, upper left, hot spring.

204
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,900
 And then you got cold water on the right.

205
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,640
 So as you can see,

206
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:17,500
 the verse is referring to the other city.

207
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,800
 God said to Laodicea, "I would rather you guys be hot or cold,

208
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,500
 but you guys are lukewarm."

209
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:29,900
 Let's take a look at the description of lukewarm water.

210
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:36,000
 Laodicea had, it's known in history,

211
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,700
 Laodicea did not have reliable water supply.

212
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:46,500
 Because the water has, by the time the water from the hot spring

213
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,200
 coming to Laodicea to the south,

214
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,200
 the temperature decreases, right?

215
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,100
 Hot water becomes lukewarm water.

216
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:02,700
 And remember, if the water becomes lukewarm,

217
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,300
 you cannot use it as hot spring.

218
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,400
 It's not hot spring anymore.

219
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,800
 It's called lukewarm spring.

220
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,300
 But it's not therapeutic anymore.

221
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,000
 It's not for medicine anymore.

222
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And the water from hot spring

223
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,300
 usually carries a lot of minerals.

224
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:23,700
 And when that mineral rich water reaches Laodicea,

225
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,100
 it will clog up the water pipes.

226
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,300
 It will clog up the water pipes.

227
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:31,500
 Today, we call it hot water.

228
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,200
 You see what I'm saying?

229
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,600
 It's common sense, right?

230
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:39,200
 Yeah, it's common sense.

231
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,800
 That's why you need filter water.

232
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,100
 You filter out the dirt or the mineral in the water

233
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,300
 so that you can drink it.

234
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,500
 Now, that's what happened in Laodicea.

235
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,300
 All they got is hot water, lukewarm water.

236
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,500
 You can't drink it.

237
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,500
 And it's bitter to drink it.

238
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,100
 So you have to spit it out.

239
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:01,100
 So now you got it.

240
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,600
 Here are some of the pictures from Laodicea,

241
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,700
 and you can still see some of the broken pipes.

242
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:12,100
 They have some pipes, you see the white stuff.

243
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,100
 Around the pipes, those are from, you know,

244
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:20,500
 hardened, solidified minerals of the lukewarm water.

245
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,900
 So if you're a plumber in Laodicea,

246
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:25,200
 you got good business.

247
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:29,200
 Because every house needs your service every now and then.

248
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,300
 Because you have to clean up the pipe.

249
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:34,900
 You have to clean up all the plumbing system

250
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,000
 so that you get water coming into the city.

251
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,700
 So they don't have fresh water.

252
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,600
 So God is saying, "You are right in the middle."

253
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:45,400
 Right?

254
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,200
 I put a plumber there

255
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,500
 because it's gonna be bad to live in Laodicea.

256
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:54,200
 You always have to drink from bottles of water.

257
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,300
 You don't, you can't, you can't just, you know,

258
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:00,500
 turn on your tap and get some water to drink.

259
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:03,000
 So much different from Chicago.

260
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,600
 God is saying, "I would rather you guys be hot on the left.

261
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,500
 Be hot spring, so you're functional.

262
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,100
 You can bring benefit to other people.

263
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:18,300
 Or to the right, the cold water, people can drink it."

264
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:22,600
 He's talking about not the temperature of the water.

265
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:27,100
 It's the functionality, the functions or purpose of the water.

266
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,400
 Right in the middle of Laodicea,

267
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,600
 the water has no use.

268
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,000
 You have to spit it out.

269
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,300
 It's totally no use.

270
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:42,900
 He's referring, using this metaphor to talk about Christians in Laodicea.

271
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,000
 And they are nominal Christians.

272
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,000
 What does it mean, nominal Christians?

273
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,400
 That, okay, you profess that you are Christians,

274
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,100
 but you don't live like one.

275
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,400
 You don't live out the gospel.

276
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:59,300
 You don't have a living relationship with Christ.

277
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,100
 You just go through the motion and you just don't care.

278
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:06,800
 Right? You come here, okay, all right, then, you know, Monday to Saturday,

279
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,100
 I just care about myself.

280
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,400
 You just don't care about your relationship with God.

281
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,000
 You don't have a living relationship with God.

282
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,100
 You don't have the life to show other people.

283
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,500
 So you cannot bring benefits to other people.

284
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:22,900
 God is saying, "I would rather be left or be right.

285
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:28,500
 Be cold or be hot, so that people can use you.

286
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:34,300
 God can use you to be his instruments, to be a witness to him."

287
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,300
 So we got that clear up, right?

288
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,200
 We got that clear up.

289
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,700
 It's not talking about spiritual temperature.

290
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,300
 It's talking about spiritual function.

291
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,800
 It's malfunctioning Christians.

292
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:51,100
 It's malfunctioning Christians in Laodicea.

293
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,100
 You're not doing what you're supposed to do.

294
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:57,600
 You're not living a life you're supposed to do.

295
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,000
 Because when we believe in the gospel, we should have changed,

296
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,400
 at least fundamentally, our value system,

297
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:09,900
 our schedule, our life, our function,

298
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,400
 and our relationship with God and to other people.

299
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,500
 Everything has to be reconfigured.

300
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,800
 But in Laodicea, all those Christians are nominal Christians.

301
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,100
 They are not functioning, malfunctioning church.

302
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:30,800
 Now, as you can see, you know, what does Christ want in our lives?

303
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:36,100
 Christ wants, Christ desires a living relationship with you.

304
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:43,700
 God desires most about your relationship with God himself, with Jesus.

305
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:48,300
 In order to be fruitful, in order to be functional,

306
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,800
 you cannot be lukewarm.

307
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,500
 God has to use you.

308
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:57,300
 What is your function?

309
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:02,800
 Jesus said, "If you abide in me, if you have a living relationship,

310
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,100
 fellowship with me, then I can dwell in you.

311
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:12,800
 If you love my word, if you abide in my word, then I can live my life through you."

312
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:19,500
 Christ desires, Jesus wants your whole heart worship,

313
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:24,700
 your service, your time, your talent, your treasure, your life,

314
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,100
 God's life, eternal life can live through you.

315
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,400
 And you can do things out of love for God.

316
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,800
 That's what Jesus desires.

317
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:40,300
 He doesn't really look at how rich you are or how well off you are.

318
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:45,200
 If you are not generous, you present no functions to other people.

319
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,800
 You are not being used by God's eternal kingdom.

320
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:52,200
 That's what Jesus wants.

321
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,300
 He wants you to have a living relationship with him.

322
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,600
 And secondly, this passage says, God decides to dwell in your heart.

323
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:07,700
 Because without Christ dwelling in our heart, without Christ dwelling in our heart,

324
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,600
 we cannot live out the gospel.

325
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,500
 This letter continues, 317.

326
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:17,100
 Jesus said, "You say, I am rich.

327
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,800
 I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing."

328
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,600
 But Jesus said, "You do not realize you are actually wretched.

329
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,300
 You're wretched.

330
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:31,900
 You're pitiful, poor, blind and naked.

331
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:38,900
 I counsel you to buy from me gold with fire in the fire, so you can become rich.

332
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,700
 And buy from me white clothes to wear, so that you can cover your shameful nakedness.

333
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:48,900
 And then you can heal your eyes so that you can see."

334
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,700
 You see, this is all local languages.

335
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,500
 Laodicea is famous and well known for all of this stuff.

336
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:59,400
 Their gold, their treasure, their wealth, and their power.

337
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,200
 The textile industry.

338
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,300
 Their eye medicines.

339
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:09,700
 That's a spirit of self-sufficiency.

340
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:14,500
 That we think we can do life without God.

341
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,800
 Ask questions.

342
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,300
 I'll make money.

343
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,000
 I'll save up money.

344
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,800
 I don't need Jesus.

345
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,400
 I mean, come on, Jesus is just a footnote to me.

346
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,000
 The main content, I'm going to write my life.

347
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,200
 I'm going to write every chapter.

348
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,700
 That's my main content.

349
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,700
 And where's Jesus?

350
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,700
 I mean, maybe it's just a little bit footnote.

351
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:38,700
 Jesus said, "You are actually pitiful.

352
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:43,100
 You're poor and you're blind and naked."

353
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:46,300
 319.

354
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:52,800
 "Those whom I love," Jesus said, "I would bilk and discipline.

355
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,300
 So be earnest and repent.

356
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,900
 Here I am, I stand at the door and knock.

357
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,100
 If anyone hears my voice and open the door, I will come in

358
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:07,400
 and dine with him and he with me."

359
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,100
 You see the language of fellowship here?

360
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:13,800
 Eating together in the ancient world is so important.

361
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,700
 It's also important today.

362
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,500
 It is even more important in those days.

363
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,300
 In the ancient world, intimate fellowship, you know,

364
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:24,600
 dining together and sharing a meal together.

365
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,600
 To have friendship.

366
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,000
 To have a living relationship.

367
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
 So we can eat together, we can talk together,

368
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,800
 we can have fellowship together.

369
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,300
 You see, good friends, what do good friends do?

370
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,300
 They eat together.

371
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,900
 But do you eat with your enemies?

372
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,400
 No, you don't.

373
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,300
 You eat with your good friends and you talk to them

374
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,400
 for hours.

375
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,700
 You can talk to your good friend for hours and hours

376
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,600
 and it feels like eternity.

377
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,900
 That's what Jesus desires.

378
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,000
 Jesus is knocking on your door, knocking on our door.

379
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,300
 And Jesus said, "Please listen to my voice.

380
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,700
 I want to renew my relationship with you.

381
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,700
 I'm here all along, I'm knocking."

382
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,100
 And what's wrong with this picture?

383
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:17,300
 Jesus is being kicked out of the house.

384
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:20,600
 But He is there knocking.

385
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,300
 It's not because He doesn't have power to open your door.

386
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,700
 He does have power to open the door.

387
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:30,500
 Jesus is not saying, "Okay, I'm going to beg you,

388
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,700
 I'm going to love seek without you.

389
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,900
 I have to come in and have fellowship with you

390
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,900
 and otherwise I feel like less of myself."

391
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,800
 No, Jesus is not like that.

392
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:43,300
 Remember the first verse of this letter,

393
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:47,100
 Jesus said, "I am the Amen, I'm the ruler of the creation.

394
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:49,500
 I'm the Cosmos guy, you know.

395
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,200
 I create the cosmos.

396
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,700
 I create the universe and I am in charge of the universe."

397
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,200
 However, Jesus is saying with gentle words,

398
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:06,100
 "I am standing outside and I'm knocking on your door.

399
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:11,200
 I desire fellowship, relationship with you."

400
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,900
 Verse 21, "To him who overcomes,

401
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,600
 I'll give the right to sit with me on the throne.

402
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,500
 Just as I overcome and sat down with my Father on His throne.

403
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:32,000
 He who has ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."

404
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:36,200
 As we close and finish off this series,

405
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:38,000
 this is the seventh letter

406
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,300
 and this is the most, my beloved letter

407
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:43,300
 because it says so much about us.

408
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:46,400
 It says so much about me as well.

409
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,300
 Sometimes I just busy with my work

410
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:53,800
 and I forgot that what Jesus really desire

411
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,600
 is a moment with me

412
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:00,400
 so that I can read His word.

413
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:04,800
 I can listen to His voice and have fellowship together.

414
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:11,000
 When was the last time you really enjoy relationship with God?

415
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,000
 And you just spend hours and hours

416
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:20,200
 praying and nurturing the relationship,

417
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:26,800
 talking, talking to Christ, someone who loves us.

418
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:31,000
 Just this letter is filled with warnings,

419
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,200
 is filled with builds.

420
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,100
 There's no praises here.

421
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,400
 But you know, don't misunderstand.

422
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,000
 You know, God sometimes has some hard words for us.

423
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,100
 It's not because He hates us.

424
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:47,500
 It's not because He wants to condemn us.

425
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:53,400
 Some of those hard words, tough words are tough love.

426
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:58,700
 Jesus said, "I want to sit down with you

427
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,600
 to have a meal."

428
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,000
 Meal, quite no agenda.

429
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,500
 It's like a close friend.

430
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,700
 Intimacy.

431
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,700
 We come before Christ today.

432
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,200
 Let us turn and repent.

433
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,200
 God looks at us now.

434
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,700
 God looks at your heart right now.

435
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:28,100
 He doesn't count you, how much you have accumulated

436
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,800
 or how much achievement for Him at this moment.

437
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 Jesus said, "I'm knocking on the door."

438
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,200
 Knocking on the door of your heart, open,

439
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,400
 and I'll come in and have intimacy, fellowship with you.

440
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,000
 Let's all pray together.

441
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:56,500
 Father, we confess that sometimes we treat our faith

442
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:00,200
 as just a concept of philosophy or idea.

443
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:05,700
 No matter how good the idea sounds,

444
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,300
 that is not the point, that is not the core.

445
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,100
 The core is coming before you

446
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,300
 and know that you love us

447
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:19,900
 and know that we respond with love.

448
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:24,800
 I know you are knocking on our door every single day

449
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,700
 and we confess that sometimes we pretend

450
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,900
 that we don't hear it.

451
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,000
 We just go about our lives without you

452
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,800
 and treat you as a footnote.

453
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,800
 So we've confessed our sins.

454
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,200
 We just confess our weaknesses.

455
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:48,400
 And at this time, we just pray that your Spirit

456
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,000
 will speak to us and turn our hearts back to you

457
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:57,600
 so that we will enjoy our relationship with you,

458
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,300
 so that our lives will abide in your Word,

459
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,500
 our lives will abide in your love,

460
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,600
 that your life, your eternal life,

461
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,600
 the life of Christ, the life of the gospel,

462
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,700
 can live through us.

463
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:18,500
 So Jesus, we open the door.

464
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,600
 You come into our hearts

465
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,500
 and be our Lord, be our ruler,

466
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:30,500
 just as you are ruler of the entire universe.

467
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,700
 So yes, we come before you

468
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:37,400
 and thank you for being our loving God.

469
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,300
 In Christ, we pray.

470
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:45,300
 Well, we're gonna close off with our verse of the month.

471
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,740
 All right?

472
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,500
 Verse of the month.

473
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,000
 I hope you have that memorized.

474
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,400
 If not, we're gonna recite it together.

475
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:58,300
 Now, this is a relevant promise

476
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,900
 out of the letter of 1 John.

477
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,100
 And it's a very appropriate closing

478
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,400
 for the last letter of the seven churches.

479
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,200
 1 John 1, 9.

480
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,900
 Why don't we read together?

481
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:14,100
 "If we confess our sins,

482
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,600
 He is faithful and just

483
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,900
 and will forgive us our sins

484
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:23,000
 and purify us from all unrighteousness."

485
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 If we confess our sins, He's faithful and just.

486
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:32,000
 He is righteous and He will forgive us in Christ.

487
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,300
 All of our sins and clean us up

488
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:37,700
 from all the unrighteousness,

489
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,900
 all the injustice, all the sinfulness.

490
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:43,900
 And God is gonna live in our hearts.

491
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,900
 Today, if you echo with my prayers,

492
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,300
 I do wanna urge you,

493
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,900
 let us spend more time with God.

494
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:59,500
 Now, every day, you know, take 10 minutes, 15 minutes,

495
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:02,800
 you know, rather than, you know, scrolling through our phone

496
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,300
 and, you know, looking at TikTok videos,

497
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,500
 Instagram updates or whatever crazy news out there.

498
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,600
 Know that God is in control.

499
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:15,500
 Spend some time of intimacy with Him

500
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,700
 because God always desires your heart.

501
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,700
 Right? Let your heart be open to Him.

502
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,800
 So we do that.

503
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,200
 And today, as we end our service,

504
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,400
 and we're gonna have some refreshment,

505
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:32,400
 and please stay, please stay for Bible study.

506
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,200
 You know, don't treat Bible study

507
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,900
 as an intellectual exercise only.

508
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,700
 Your faith needs the Word of God.

509
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:42,100
 If you wanna grow,

510
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,400
 there's no way that you can just go through the motions.

511
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,600
 You need the Word of God to dwell in your heart.

512
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:49,100
 All right?

513
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,500
 So we do invite you to stay

514
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,400
 for about an hour of Bible study,

515
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,400
 and we're going to chapter two of the Book of Romans.

516
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,900
 And I'll lead the English group,

517
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,400
 and Paul is gonna lead the Chinese group.

518
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,100
 And we're gonna enjoy our time and have fellowship

519
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:09,700
 and abide in God's Word.
