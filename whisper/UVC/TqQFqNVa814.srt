1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
 - Thanks, Kelly.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,300
 Well, why don't we say hi to your neighbors?

3
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:08,600
 I know some of us are out of town

4
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,960
 and cannot be here this week,

5
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,640
 and there are people who have gotten

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,880
 to some minor or major car accident

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,720
 in the past week or two,

8
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,060
 and our prayers go out to them

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,320
 and to continue to pray for them,

10
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,360
 especially Phoebe.

11
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,680
 Phoebe's still on break

12
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,720
 because of the serious car accident.

13
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:34,280
 She's fine, but she does need more time

14
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,740
 to recuperate, all right?

15
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:38,580
 So let's keep praying for them

16
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,920
 and praying for our church ministry.

17
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,160
 Today, we are going to finish our series

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,680
 on atomic wisdom, okay?

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,520
 Atomic wisdom.

20
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,840
 This is part three, okay?

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,640
 Let me move this around.

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,480
 Part three.

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:53,980
 What we are doing is that we take

24
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,360
 one of the best seller out there,

25
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,400
 and the book is called "Atomic Habits," all right?

26
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,040
 Some of you might have heard of this book,

27
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,440
 "Atomic Habits."

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,240
 It's a very popular book.

29
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,440
 It talks about behavioral psychology.

30
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:12,480
 It talks about how we build good habits,

31
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,440
 and we ask the question,

32
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:16,400
 what kind of conditions are necessary for life change?

33
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,240
 What kind of conditions are necessary

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,200
 for the probability of achieving your goal?

35
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,160
 In the new year, some of us might have some new goals, right?

36
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,360
 You may have new goals to be on diet

37
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,300
 or do more exercise or be more healthy,

38
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,360
 something like that.

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,240
 We try to draw insight from this book

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,880
 called "Atomic Habits,"

41
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,280
 and it's already translated into different language,

42
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,560
 Chinese included,

43
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,480
 and it draws so much insight from behavioral psychology

44
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:53,220
 and trying to help us to set up a system,

45
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,800
 how to set up our life in general

46
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,540
 to have good habit, to have healthy habit,

47
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,300
 and we wanna combine this so-called secular insights

48
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,340
 into biblical wisdom,

49
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:09,100
 and that is on the right, the book of Proverbs,

50
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,260
 and if you wanna find the book of Proverbs in the Bible,

51
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:14,060
 it's right in the middle after the book of Psalms.

52
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,620
 The book of Proverbs is the part of the wisdom literature,

53
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,580
 and this is part three,

54
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,860
 so we're going to reveal what are the principle

55
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,660
 that are necessary for life change,

56
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:29,340
 and number one, we talk about 1% power, right?

57
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,060
 Remember, if you do a tiny change every day

58
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,300
 after a whole year of 360-some days,

59
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:38,260
 you will receive or you will achieve your goal

60
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,260
 in 30-some fold multiplication,

61
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,380
 and do not estimate the tiny power

62
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,380
 of every tiny change that you do every single day,

63
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,580
 and principle number two is incentives

64
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,780
 or disincentives are effective,

65
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:59,260
 incentives and disincentives.

66
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:01,720
 If you set up some goal in your life,

67
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,540
 for our church, for our fellowship,

68
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,160
 probably we're gonna read the Bible a little bit more,

69
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,240
 or we wanna pray more,

70
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:13,660
 we wanna build up some of the good habits,

71
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,820
 and we do need to set up some incentives and disincentives,

72
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,660
 but tell you the truth.

73
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,940
 I finished this series in the 10 o'clock service,

74
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,560
 and after the part three, after this one,

75
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,540
 a brother came up to me, and he said,

76
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,460
 thank you for your message,

77
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,020
 thank you for encouraging us to set up a good habit,

78
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:38,020
 good life, and he pulled out an envelope from his pocket

79
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:43,820
 and gave me $50, because he heard the first part of message,

80
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,860
 and he wanna build up some good habit,

81
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:48,740
 and he wants to have some incentive

82
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:51,100
 or disincentive in his life,

83
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:55,220
 so he was encouraged by the message, by the insight,

84
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,420
 and he built up some good habit,

85
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:59,340
 and after part three of the series,

86
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,300
 he came up to me and gave me $50, yeah,

87
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,260
 praise God, right, praise God, $50.

88
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,760
 Anyways, so you have to think about life changing,

89
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,700
 it's necessary to have some benefits, some incentives,

90
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:16,420
 right, you go to the gym, you get some incentive,

91
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,340
 and you're gonna praise yourself,

92
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:20,540
 or you wanna uplift yourself,

93
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:25,540
 so you have system with incentive or disincentives.

94
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,460
 Number three is specifics are better than generals, right,

95
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,820
 set up a goal, set up a system,

96
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,700
 which is as specific as possible.

97
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,700
 Number four is that our community is important,

98
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,300
 because the people that we hang out with,

99
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,420
 the people that we see a lot,

100
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:49,340
 will have influence on us, so the community is important.

101
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,340
 Number five is the power of default, default, all right,

102
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,580
 so you set up your habit, and you say,

103
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,380
 this is the priority, and this is the default of my life.

104
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,140
 Every single morning, what are your defaults?

105
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,420
 You wake up, and you brush your teeth,

106
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,180
 wash your face, right, these are your default, right,

107
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:16,620
 so in order to have good habit in our life,

108
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,180
 you have to have, you have to understand

109
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,020
 the power of default, the effect of default, all right,

110
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:28,020
 so the assumption to make this habit possible.

111
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,420
 Number six is making it personal, all right,

112
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:34,420
 making it personal, either you find a friend

113
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,220
 who is keeping you accountable,

114
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:41,100
 making it personal will make it even more possible

115
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,020
 to have your new habit set up.

116
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:45,700
 So number seven now, number seven

117
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:48,340
 is the power of environment, all right,

118
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,400
 so you need to understand, if you want your life to change,

119
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,900
 or you want a kid's life change,

120
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,980
 we need to set up a good environment, good environment,

121
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,460
 the physical environment have so much impact on us,

122
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:04,320
 all the people around us, all right.

123
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,540
 Many, many years ago, many years ago,

124
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,020
 many, many years ago, I used to have a TV in my bedroom,

125
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:15,460
 a TV in my bedroom, somebody gave me a TV, right,

126
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,700
 so I said, where should I put it?

127
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,500
 I put it in my bedroom, right,

128
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,200
 you think it's a good environment?

129
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,340
 No, right, no, it was so bad, it was so bad,

130
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,180
 so I took it off, right, because when we had the TV

131
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:35,060
 in the bedroom, you know, it disrupt my sleep, right,

132
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,900
 and my kids, when they were so much younger,

133
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:40,140
 they come into my bedroom all the time,

134
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:43,420
 because they wanna watch TV, or lying on the bed, you know,

135
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:48,180
 so I remove it, because it was a bad environmental setup.

136
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,600
 So behavioral psychology here, study finds that

137
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,180
 how people maintain a diet,

138
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,200
 how people maintain a good diet.

139
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:03,580
 As you know, in the United States, we eat too much, right,

140
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,300
 we have so much to eat, we have so much to eat,

141
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,220
 we always eat too much.

142
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,700
 Well, study finds that it is simple to maintain a diet,

143
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:18,100
 to eat a little bit less, and the method is very simple.

144
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,340
 You make a habit before you have a meal,

145
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:25,860
 you drink two glasses of water, right,

146
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:27,020
 you drink two glasses of water,

147
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:30,200
 then you will eat a little bit less, right,

148
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,220
 that makes sense, right?

149
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:36,420
 Many, many years ago, when my kids were still so much younger,

150
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,940
 five year old, six year old, you know,

151
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,700
 sometimes we, in Chicago, we drive all the way to Toronto,

152
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,580
 right, to have some good Chinese food, right, yeah.

153
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,140
 Here, the Chinese food is fine too,

154
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,340
 but you know, you go in Toronto,

155
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,300
 you got so much better, right?

156
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:55,300
 So many years ago, we go to Toronto for family trip,

157
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,820
 because the kids were so young,

158
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,760
 they did not know how to appreciate good food, right?

159
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:06,260
 The expensive food, they don't know how to appreciate it.

160
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,300
 So we, as good parents, we bring the kids first

161
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,180
 to the bakery, so we buy them a bun or so,

162
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,220
 and fill up their stomach,

163
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,580
 and then we go to a good restaurant, right?

164
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,180
 So we adults can enjoy it, right?

165
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:24,060
 That sounds like a very, very good insightful wisdom, right?

166
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,660
 We save a lot of money, right?

167
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:28,460
 Because we only buy good food for ourselves, right?

168
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,820
 Because they don't know how to appreciate it,

169
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,180
 why spend the money on them, right?

170
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:37,180
 So, the study finds that if your stomach

171
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:41,940
 is a little bit full, then you go to the meal,

172
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:46,940
 then there's a bigger chance for you to maintain a good diet.

173
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:52,020
 And the flip side is telling us that new habit,

174
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,380
 you have to make it easy and natural.

175
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:57,900
 And there are some behavioral psychological study

176
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:02,900
 done for cafeteria of a hospital in Boston.

177
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,460
 And the study is trying to find out

178
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,940
 how to encourage the staff to get healthy food

179
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,620
 in the cafeteria.

180
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,340
 And the plan is very simple,

181
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,380
 is to change the layout of the cafeteria.

182
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:21,220
 Change the layout of the cafeteria.

183
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,060
 Simply by changing the layout, you get so much effect.

184
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:30,820
 Now, the layout change has to do with bottled water

185
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:34,060
 being put at the entrance of the cafeteria.

186
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:37,220
 And fountain drink, where do you put it?

187
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,380
 You put it all the way back, right?

188
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,120
 Make it difficult for you to get fountain drink, soda.

189
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,580
 So, after three months, the study finds

190
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,580
 that water consumption increases 25.8%,

191
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:56,020
 and soda consumption drops by 11.4%.

192
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,060
 Isn't that amazing?

193
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,420
 It's the same way.

194
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:05,420
 I mean, many of you go to office and work in the office.

195
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:10,140
 Sometimes you find office cafeteria layout intentionally

196
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:13,060
 to discourage you to get snack food.

197
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:18,180
 Snack bowl or candy bowl or junk food

198
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,560
 is being placed in the breakout room.

199
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,780
 And then the healthy food or water is being put

200
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:29,260
 on some place where it's convenient.

201
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,540
 What goes wrong in the last few years

202
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,140
 is that people working from home now, right?

203
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:36,460
 And that is bad, right?

204
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,300
 That is bad.

205
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,760
 Because in the pandemics, everybody works from home,

206
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,880
 works at home, and there's a huge temptation, right?

207
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,940
 You work from home, right?

208
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,600
 With your computer, and kitchen is right next to you,

209
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,760
 and you get hungry, right?

210
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:56,020
 You get boring, and then you go to find some potato chips

211
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,480
 or some snack food, right?

212
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,480
 And that is unhealthy.

213
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,640
 And actually, the biblical wisdom has so much to say

214
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,640
 about our environment, especially about the people

215
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,020
 that we hang out with.

216
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,080
 They have effect on us.

217
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:13,080
 Proverbs 27, 17.

218
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,920
 27, 17.

219
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:19,320
 It says, "As iron sharpens iron,

220
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:22,500
 "as one man sharpens the face of his friend."

221
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,760
 It says, "If you surround yourself with good friends."

222
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,220
 Now, in the immediate context of chapter 27,

223
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,560
 it talks about bad relationships.

224
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,040
 So 15 or 14, verse 13, talk about bad relationship,

225
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,080
 bad community.

226
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,440
 It will have a negative effect on your life.

227
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:46,440
 But here in verse 17, the wise teacher is telling you,

228
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,360
 if you surround yourself with good and spiritual people,

229
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,620
 you will grow, you will grow.

230
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:56,260
 If not, your life will decline.

231
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:59,040
 You will slowly drift away from God.

232
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,840
 You will slowly drift away from the fear of the Lord.

233
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:07,720
 And it tells you, nobody can be a Christian alone, right?

234
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,200
 No one's an island.

235
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,960
 Everyone is connected, and that's why you need to belong

236
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,600
 to a spiritual community, a home church.

237
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,560
 And that is important.

238
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,560
 You cannot do Christian from home, all by yourself, right?

239
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,880
 And the biblical language for Hebrew is very interesting,

240
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:33,080
 because in Hebrew, here it tells you a piece of iron

241
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:38,240
 sharpening another piece of iron, right?

242
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,480
 And slowly, you will increase the value

243
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,720
 of both pieces of iron, right?

244
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,360
 The iron, one piece by itself, it has value.

245
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,260
 However, if you rub it with another piece of iron,

246
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:57,760
 both of them will get sharpened and becomes a knife, right?

247
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,200
 It becomes a knife or some tool,

248
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,800
 and the value of the piece of iron will increase.

249
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,180
 And what it said about, the funny thing about Hebrew

250
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,180
 is that in Hebrew, the word faith, faith,

251
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:18,320
 is actually used to describe the blade of a knife.

252
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,300
 The blade of the knife is actually the face of the knife.

253
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:27,460
 So the wise teacher is saying, as iron sharpening iron,

254
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,420
 as one friend sharpens the blade of the other friend,

255
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,440
 the face of the other friend.

256
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,960
 So no one can be a Christian alone.

257
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,080
 You need to plug in to some sort of community

258
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:42,520
 or small group or some local church

259
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:45,200
 in order for you to grow spiritually,

260
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,080
 to grow your relationship with God.

261
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,300
 So that is the power of environment.

262
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:55,520
 Principle number eight is habit bundling or habit stacking.

263
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,400
 Now what the psychologist is telling us

264
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:03,640
 is that if you wanna build some new habit,

265
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:08,640
 you need to tie the new habit to some established habits.

266
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:12,480
 Some habits that you are doing like your second nature.

267
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,420
 How many of you drive a stick shift?

268
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,180
 How many of you drive a stick shift?

269
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:21,380
 There you go, all right, here's the man.

270
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:25,740
 I drive a stick shift for so many years.

271
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:30,540
 So even today, I get into a car,

272
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,220
 my left foot will do something.

273
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,060
 I will try to find the clutch.

274
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:35,880
 And then there are times,

275
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,200
 because I have automatic transmission car as well,

276
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,880
 so sometimes I jump into the car

277
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,320
 and then try to find the clutch.

278
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,720
 There's no clutch there, right?

279
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,080
 Because it becomes a second nature for me, right?

280
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,120
 So that's established habit.

281
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,360
 So the psychologist is telling us

282
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,720
 if you wanna build new habit,

283
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:57,720
 you have to attach it or tie it with some established habit.

284
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,400
 And the easiest way to develop this

285
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,080
 is to think about, okay, established habit,

286
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:05,940
 and then I wanna add something to my established habit.

287
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:11,640
 Every morning or every night, you brush your teeth.

288
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,740
 When is the best time to floss your teeth?

289
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,680
 It's after brushing your teeth, right?

290
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,320
 Brushing your teeth is already an established habit, right?

291
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,960
 I hope that's true to you.

292
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,440
 It's established habit.

293
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,640
 It's kind of, you don't have to think about it.

294
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,880
 But if you are not flossing your teeth regularly,

295
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:35,000
 the best way, the behavioral psychologist is telling us,

296
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,840
 is to stack it onto some established habit.

297
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,080
 If you check the wisdom literature in the Bible,

298
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,200
 it actually talks about stacking,

299
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,040
 something adding to some of the habits

300
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,440
 that you may already have.

301
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,280
 Here, chapter four, verses 20 and following.

302
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:58,240
 The father is teaching the son to have wisdom.

303
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,960
 So he says, "My son, pay attention to what I say.

304
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,560
 "Listen closely to my words.

305
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,520
 "Do not let them out of your sight.

306
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,400
 "Keep them within your heart,

307
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,080
 "for they are life to those who find them,

308
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:14,440
 "and health to a man's whole body.

309
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,480
 "Above all else, guard your heart,

310
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,960
 "for this is the wellspring of life."

311
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,400
 You see the stacking here?

312
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,680
 One of the way you appreciate the book of Proverbs

313
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:29,640
 or wisdom literature is that there are short sayings,

314
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,520
 and sometimes one short sayings has two short verses.

315
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,480
 Verse B is stacking on verse A, all right?

316
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:42,400
 It's like staircase, A and then B, A and then B.

317
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,840
 Sometimes A, B, and C.

318
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:48,080
 Here, it says, "My son, pay attention."

319
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,480
 Pay attention.

320
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,080
 It's actually a military word.

321
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,480
 It describes soldiers, you know,

322
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,840
 standing, guarding on the top of watchtower.

323
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:03,840
 And what the soldier is doing is actually paying attention,

324
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,800
 paying attention to noise from the enemies.

325
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,880
 Maybe there's approaching army,

326
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,600
 approaching horses to the city,

327
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,760
 and you pay attention to it.

328
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,040
 So he says, "My son, pay attention to what I say.

329
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,800
 "Listen closely to my words."

330
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,440
 Pay attention, listen closely.

331
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,480
 Do not let them out of your sight.

332
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,640
 Put it right in front of you.

333
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:33,720
 Keep them within your heart, right?

334
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,440
 Stacking one on the other.

335
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,040
 Because they are life, right?

336
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:40,360
 They are the wellspring of life.

337
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:44,640
 I remember I told you when I was in college,

338
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,760
 I failed the first test of my chemistry class,

339
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:52,040
 and then the following nine tests, I built a new habit.

340
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,960
 After the lecture, after the class,

341
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:57,760
 I don't go with my classmates to go out to Starbucks, right,

342
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,080
 to have a good time there.

343
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,880
 No, I go immediately to the library

344
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,200
 and to review the materials.

345
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,200
 And I actually use less time to ace the test.

346
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:13,920
 All my classmates, they have fun, they have good time, right?

347
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,640
 But at the end, I ace all nine tests.

348
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:20,720
 And that is habit stacking.

349
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,760
 You stack one new habit to your established habit.

350
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:28,000
 And that is habit bundling.

351
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 And principle nine is to make your goal attractive.

352
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:38,040
 Make it as attractive as possible.

353
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:41,120
 Use different wordings to describe your goal,

354
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,440
 to describe your system, to describe your new habit.

355
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:49,440
 If you use attractive words, you will tend to change.

356
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:55,280
 You go to the gym, you have to do some exercise.

357
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,120
 If in your mind, if in your mind,

358
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,000
 you use some negative description

359
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 to describe that new habit, you will bound to fail, right?

360
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,120
 Oh man, I have to go, I have to drag my body to go, right?

361
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,120
 But if you describe your new habit in a nice way,

362
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:19,220
 there is a bigger chance for you to achieve it.

363
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,080
 You know, in the United States hotel rooms,

364
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:28,980
 they are trying to find ways to encourage the customers

365
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:32,260
 to reuse the towel.

366
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:34,660
 That will save a lot of money, right?

367
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:37,340
 Because sometimes you go to a hotel, you stay there,

368
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:41,580
 and then you use the towel only once or just part of it,

369
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,940
 right, and then you throw it on the ground, right?

370
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:49,020
 And then you use, and after that, you use a new towel, right?

371
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,220
 And by the end of the day,

372
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,360
 you probably use three or four towels, right?

373
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,800
 Which are unnecessary.

374
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,420
 And the hotel manager is trying to do a study.

375
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:05,800
 It says that if you wanna encourage guests

376
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,800
 to reuse their towel, you describe reusing towel

377
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,020
 with some good words.

378
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:18,860
 As you can tell here, it says,

379
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:23,860
 dear guests, every day, tons of water, gallons of water,

380
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:29,420
 are used to wash towels that have been only used once.

381
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:35,380
 And this hotel is committed to conserve natural resources,

382
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,540
 and this is how you can help, right?

383
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,780
 If you put it back on the rack, I'll use it again.

384
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:45,940
 If you throw it on the floor, please exchange it, right?

385
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:50,020
 And the study finds out, because of this wording,

386
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,780
 even at the wording, save the planet, right?

387
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:55,020
 You don't have to do anything to save your planet.

388
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
 You just reuse your towel, right?

389
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,220
 It makes you a hero, right?

390
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:04,100
 The study finds that this means it's effective.

391
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,540
 And then the end, the result is 75% of the guests

392
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,660
 in the hotel, reuse their towel more than once.

393
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:18,020
 Because you describe in such a way to save the planet,

394
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:23,020
 right, we do this together, you establish some social norm

395
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,320
 for people to conform to it, right?

396
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,820
 And the wisdom literature has so much to say about this.

397
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,820
 It describes wisdom with beautiful, glorious terms.

398
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:42,360
 Chapter four, wisdom is supreme, therefore get wisdom.

399
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,240
 Though it costs all of you, get understanding.

400
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,240
 Esteem wisdom is being personalized as a woman.

401
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,240
 Esteem her and she will exalt you.

402
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,960
 Embrace her, she will honor you.

403
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:04,980
 It is a garland of grace, it's a crown of splendor.

404
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:10,480
 If you get wisdom, you get crown of splendor, right?

405
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:15,960
 Supremely, you know, super positive terms to describe,

406
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,300
 you know, living a life of wisdom in front of God.

407
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,720
 Developing our spiritual life,

408
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,140
 developing our close relationship with our God, our creator.

409
00:22:27,140 --> 00:22:30,840
 Positive terms, you know, positive effect

410
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,680
 of the descriptors that we use.

411
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:38,680
 Some years ago, there was a famous,

412
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:42,900
 a very famous speech therapist.

413
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:47,040
 Her name is Nina Rustin, Nina Rustin.

414
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,040
 She is a British therapist to help children

415
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:58,000
 how to correct their pronunciation,

416
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,840
 how to correct their speech.

417
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,840
 And what Nina Rustin does is more than

418
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,520
 the typical therapist will do.

419
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,440
 A typical therapist will correct the pronunciation,

420
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,480
 the saying of how they pronounce terms

421
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:18,240
 and how they make sound for the children.

422
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,680
 And that is necessary, but Rustin does more than that.

423
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:26,660
 Rustin call on the whole family of the child

424
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,960
 into her office and she assign assignment

425
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:34,440
 to each of the family members.

426
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,760
 And every family members, she said,

427
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,120
 "You have to do something in your family.

428
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,440
 "And what you do is you have to go home

429
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,440
 "and every single day make it a daily habit

430
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,440
 "to praise one of the family members."

431
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,000
 To find something specific,

432
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,640
 to praise one of the family members,

433
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,600
 maybe your sibling, maybe your parents.

434
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,560
 But you find something specific to appreciate,

435
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:04,520
 to thank, to praise.

436
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,280
 And then the one who is receiving the appreciation

437
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:12,480
 has to say something to receive it.

438
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,440
 You can't say a typical Asian way, right?

439
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,880
 No, no, no, no, I'm not good, right?

440
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,760
 We always pretend to be humble, right?

441
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,060
 This is our Asian culture.

442
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,920
 The one who is receiving has to say something

443
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,780
 in positive term.

444
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:31,920
 So for example, mom can say,

445
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,500
 "John, I love how you share with Matthew."

446
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,520
 And John cannot refuse it.

447
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,200
 John has to make it happen as well.

448
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,840
 John has to say something like,

449
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,800
 "Thanks, I appreciate the compliment.

450
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,120
 "It made me happier, thanks mom."

451
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:53,760
 And this dialogue has to be a daily habit

452
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,120
 in the whole family.

453
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,760
 And Linda Woodson finds that

454
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:02,200
 if you wanna improve a child,

455
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,040
 improve her speech,

456
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:08,880
 you cannot do it alone, right?

457
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,360
 You cannot just fix the child.

458
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,980
 You have to have the entire family get involved.

459
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,520
 And by doing so, the entire family culture has changed.

460
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,560
 We appreciate each other and encourage each other

461
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,480
 and build up the confidence of one another.

462
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,600
 And especially, it will help the child

463
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,800
 who is struggling with speech.

464
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:37,800
 And what's funny is that right after the therapy,

465
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:44,320
 not only the child, speech has been corrected.

466
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,840
 The husband and wife relationship has improved.

467
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:51,500
 And they come back to Linda Woodson and say,

468
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,920
 "Thank you, thank you for improving our marriage

469
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,000
 "and our family."

470
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,120
 So that is the principle.

471
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,880
 It is common sense, right?

472
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:04,400
 But to make our goal, to make the system attractive,

473
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,840
 make it positive, will increase the possibility

474
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,980
 of achieving our goal.

475
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,560
 The last principle, number 10.

476
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,080
 It is to establish system, not goal.

477
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:22,560
 Think about not goal, but the system achieving the goal.

478
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:26,720
 It's not the end that you most concerned about.

479
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,040
 It's the means to the end that is most important.

480
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:36,040
 So here I want to quote a long quote from Atomic Habits.

481
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:40,920
 And I only have the Chinese, but what it says is that,

482
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:45,920
 goal and results are not so much important.

483
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,760
 Why?

484
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,760
 Because he gives the example of Olympic athletes.

485
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:57,960
 All the Olympic athletes are trying to get the goal, right?

486
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,480
 Every one of them has the same goal, to win,

487
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,720
 to get the goal.

488
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:07,620
 So what is the difference between a winner and loser?

489
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:11,520
 The winner has set up a system with tiny habits

490
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,120
 of training himself or herself

491
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:18,520
 in order to get the gold medal, right?

492
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,480
 That is the only difference.

493
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,240
 The difference is not at the goals that they set.

494
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:27,440
 It's the system, it's the habits that they have.

495
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,440
 So all of this interesting, insightful psychology

496
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:35,040
 is telling us how to build a good life.

497
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:39,160
 And actually if you find, if you read the book of Proverbs,

498
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,480
 it has so much to say about how we should set up

499
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,760
 a good system in our life, right?

500
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,140
 Now in the book of Proverbs, the first nine chapters,

501
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,680
 first nine long chapters,

502
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,560
 are the introduction of the whole book.

503
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,000
 The introduction of the whole book.

504
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,520
 And this introduction is very interesting.

505
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:01,140
 It introduced two characters.

506
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,760
 The first character we can call lady wisdom,

507
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,800
 or woman wisdom.

508
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,400
 So wisdom is being personified,

509
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,320
 being described as a person, as a lady, as a woman.

510
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,740
 And the other character, the second character,

511
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,840
 is lady folly, or woman folly.

512
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,960
 That's very interesting because you find wisdom,

513
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,080
 it's like you look for a good wife, right?

514
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:32,080
 If you reject wisdom, if you love folly or foolishness,

515
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,480
 you will find yourself marrying to a wrong woman, right?

516
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,640
 That's very interesting, but if you consider the context,

517
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:43,540
 you understand why it is being described in such a way.

518
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:49,800
 Because the book of Proverbs is teaching of wisdom

519
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,420
 from the father to the son.

520
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,440
 When the son is growing up,

521
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,840
 one of the main goals in his life

522
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,500
 is to establish a good family, right?

523
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,120
 To find a good wife.

524
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,440
 So the father is using this means, this metaphor,

525
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:09,720
 to teach the son what is most important,

526
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,460
 is to find wisdom in God.

527
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:16,220
 In chapter nine, verses one to three,

528
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,720
 it says wisdom has built her house,

529
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,700
 he has held out his seven pillars.

530
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:25,520
 The wisdom, or lady wisdom, has prepared her meat

531
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,680
 and mixed with her wine.

532
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,460
 She has also set her big table, big table of good food,

533
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,540
 sent out her servant, her mates,

534
00:29:34,540 --> 00:29:38,820
 and she calls from the highest point of the city.

535
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,260
 Is calling out to the young men, the young people,

536
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:47,100
 to come to her table, come to her house.

537
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,140
 She's calling out and yelling out

538
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,220
 from the highest point of the city.

539
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,220
 That is what the lady wisdom is trying to say.

540
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,640
 And then also, the lady folly has so much to say,

541
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,140
 and what she said is actually similar

542
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,400
 to what wisdom wants to say.

543
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:10,020
 Chapter nine, verses 13 to 14.

544
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:13,060
 The woman folly is loud,

545
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:15,660
 she's undisciplined, without knowledge.

546
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:18,980
 She sits at the door of her house,

547
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,700
 again prepare a table,

548
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,700
 on the seat at the highest point of the city.

549
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,620
 So the lady wisdom is calling out

550
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,760
 from the highest point of the city,

551
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,080
 and then the lady folly is calling out

552
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,380
 from the highest point of the city.

553
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:36,200
 And what's interesting about this phrase,

554
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,980
 at the highest point of the city,

555
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:40,240
 is at the top of the mountain.

556
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,120
 Now in the biblical culture,

557
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,580
 when you see a mountain,

558
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,480
 mountain top,

559
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:53,500
 you usually think of the temple,

560
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:59,060
 because all the temples are built on the Acropolis,

561
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,700
 the highest point of the city.

562
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:04,920
 So here lady wisdom at the highest point of the city,

563
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,780
 calling out to those who need wisdom,

564
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,860
 and the lady folly also calling out from the same place,

565
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,740
 from the highest point of the city.

566
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,740
 What does it mean?

567
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:19,080
 It means wisdom is not just secular,

568
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:23,020
 self-improvement pieces of advice.

569
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:27,340
 Wisdom is actually God himself, right?

570
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:29,780
 God is calling out from the highest point of the city

571
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,940
 to his temple, his house,

572
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,580
 to invite us to build relationship with him, right?

573
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:39,260
 But at the same time, the false gods,

574
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,180
 the gods of the culture,

575
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,260
 the gods out there, the false gods,

576
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,560
 are also calling out from the same place,

577
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:46,740
 from their temples,

578
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:52,280
 to entice people or to tempt people to follow them.

579
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,680
 So if you come to this point,

580
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:58,000
 you understand the book of Proverbs

581
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:02,400
 is not just talking about self-improvement strategies.

582
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
 It's not just being better.

583
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,600
 It's not just becoming a better man or woman.

584
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,160
 It's actually about worship,

585
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:13,000
 about your relationship with God.

586
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:17,280
 Remember the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

587
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:21,200
 The fear of the Lord is the proper relationship

588
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,680
 between you and God is the beginning,

589
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,800
 is the foundation of wisdom.

590
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,720
 So it's not just talking about self-improvement.

591
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,100
 It's talking about us worshiping the right God,

592
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,020
 the true God.

593
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,500
 So I hope that we will end this series

594
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:41,760
 by this appeal,

595
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:45,920
 that God is calling you from his temple,

596
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,640
 from his dwelling place,

597
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:52,240
 to invite you to build a right relationship with him.

598
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,640
 And the good news we have from the Bible

599
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,640
 is that we, as sinners,

600
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:03,640
 we are being prepared for the salvation of Christ.

601
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:08,720
 And Jesus came in our place,

602
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,200
 in the place of sinner,

603
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,740
 to die for us, to sacrifice himself for us on the cross,

604
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,320
 in order to bring us back and redeem us

605
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,480
 so that we can be the children of God.

606
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:23,340
 And I hope that this will be true to each and every one of us

607
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:27,140
 that we will build on the beginning of wisdom

608
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,680
 to get to know God in Christ.

609
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,920
 Everyone who has accepted Jesus Christ

610
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:37,120
 as his personal savior and the Lord of his life

611
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,120
 will be related to God,

612
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,800
 totally forgiven,

613
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,520
 and stand righteous in front of the Holy God.

614
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,640
 And that is the beginning of wisdom.

615
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,840
 And I hope that this will be your decision today

616
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,200
 to get to know God in Jesus Christ,

617
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,080
 and you will begin a life of wisdom.

618
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,080
 Let's pray together.

619
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:05,440
 Father, we love you because you came to save us.

620
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:09,440
 You came to redeem us in Christ Jesus.

621
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,120
 Thank you for the way of wisdom

622
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,600
 that is laid before us.

623
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:19,360
 Thank you for bringing us back to you.

624
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:25,320
 And our Lord Jesus is the way, the truth, and life.

625
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:29,660
 So we come and approach you without fear,

626
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:32,040
 approach you afloat,

627
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,520
 fearlessly,

628
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,080
 all because Jesus Christ has done so much for us,

629
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,480
 forgiving our sins and accepting us just as we are.

630
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,680
 Thank you for what Jesus has done for us

631
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:49,360
 to die on the cross, die for our sin,

632
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,640
 so that we can live.

633
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:56,520
 And thank you for inviting us into your relationship.

634
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,400
 And I pray that each and every one of us

635
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,020
 will begin with our relationship with you,

636
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:07,600
 to invite Jesus to be our savior,

637
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,720
 that we can call you as our father.

638
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,760
 Thank you, and make us new.

639
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:16,920
 Help us to build new habit of wisdom,

640
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,200
 to live wisely,

641
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:23,560
 to live in the fear of you,

642
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,580
 and to live wisely, to walk wisely,

643
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:29,240
 to bring glory to you.

644
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,300
 In Christ's name, we pray.

645
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,600
 Well, God bless you all,

646
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,860
 and I hope to see you next week,

647
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,040
 and we continue to worship our God.

648
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:39,800
 Stay behind for our lunch,

649
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,520
 and after our lunch, around one o'clock,

650
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:45,240
 we will split into different groups for Bible study,

651
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,080
 and we'll continue to study the Gospel of Mark.

652
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,120
 All right, God bless.
