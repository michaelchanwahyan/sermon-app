[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   All right.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   All right.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   Here we go.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Well, good morning, everyone.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   For those, I recognize a few faces here this morning.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   And for those who are here from college and all that, my name is Tommy Lee.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   And just a little bit about me, I'm born and raised here in Chicago.

[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   My parents immigrated here to Chicago in 1972.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   So I lived in the Chinatown Bridgeport area all my life.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   I still remember when Bridgeport was, I was one of only five Chinese students who had
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   ever been to a college.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   And I was a freshman in high school.

[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I still remember when she first started.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   I went to Washington University in St. Louis.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   I went to Washington University in St. Louis.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   I thought I was going to be a doctor.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   I thought I was going to be a doctor.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Because a lot of times, when you have Asian parents,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Because a lot of times, when you have Asian parents,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   my parents gave me a choice.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   my parents gave me a choice.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Doctor, lawyer, engineer.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Doctor, lawyer, engineer.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Pick one.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Pick one.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   WashU gave me a full ride,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   WashU gave me a full ride,
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   so I guess I'm going to be a doctor.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   so I guess I'm going to be a doctor.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   After a first semester, I realized,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   After a first semester, I realized,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   yeah, I'm not going to be a doctor.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   yeah, I'm not going to be a doctor.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.

[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.

[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   I was going to be a lawyer.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.440]   Many of you guys are familiar with Hebrews 11, the Hall of Faith.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.720]   It talks about all of the Old Testament heroes that the writers of Hebrews tells us belong
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.000]   into this Hall of Faith.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.160]   It gives us the names in order belonging to the Hall of Faith.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.160]   There's Abel.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   There's Enoch.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.280]   Noah was in the Hall of Faith.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.680]   Abraham was in the Hall of Faith.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.400]   Isaac was in the Hall of Faith.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.200]   It talks about Jacob.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.840]   It went down to Joseph and Moses.
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.280]   It even goes to the people who crossed the Red Sea.
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.600]   Rahab.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.400]   And then the writer of Hebrews says, "For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak,
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.400]   Samson."
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.520]   How in the world Samson made it into the Hall of Faith?
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.440]   I will never know.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:54.000]   Japheth, David, Samuel, and the prophets.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.480]   Missing from that list is Daniel.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.440]   Another omission for some reason, Daniel didn't make it to this list.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.920]   Solomon did not make it to this list.
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.280]   The brightest of all of the kings of Israel, but yet at the same time, he had a lot of
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   heart motives.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.520]   He could not overcome the stain of lust.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:20.160]   Solomon was omitted, and Elijah was not named in this list.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.160]   Why?
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.400]   Think through a little bit about that.
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.320]   In verse 35 though, as he finishes this list, he does mention one thing.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:37.520]   He says, "Included in this list are the women who received back their dead by resurrection."
[00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:44.760]   Clearly referring to the story that we're going to look at today with the widow's son.
[00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:50.720]   So now you're sitting there, you didn't tell me, you forgot to mention Elijah, but you
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:58.880]   pinpoint the action or the event in which he raises the widow's son from the dead, Elijah
[00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.480]   raises, and you add that story in there.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.040]   What were you trying to say to us?
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:08.640]   I have some theories, and we're going to go back to it at the end of the sermon once we
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.880]   look at this particular story.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:15.460]   And here's the big ideas we look at verses 17 to 24 today.
[00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.020]   Our main idea, our big idea is this.
[00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.540]   Miracles unfold in the hands of humble hearts.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:32.460]   God uses and performs miracles in the hands of people with humble hearts.
[00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.120]   Miracles unfold in the hands of humble hearts.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.980]   Let's take a look at 1 Kings chapter 17.
[00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:47.500]   And he writes this in verse 17, "After this, the son of man, the mistress of the house,
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:55.100]   became ill, and his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him."
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.740]   Verse 17, it tells us, "After this, the son of the woman."
[00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.900]   After this, what happened in verses 1 through 17?
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.660]   For those who don't remember, let me just give you a quick recap beginning in verse
[00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:08.100]   17 to where we are right now.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.500]   Remember the first appearance of Elijah.
[00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.400]   Who did we say Elijah was?
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.780]   His name really means, "My God is Jehovah."
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.180]   El meaning God, Jah meaning Jehovah, I connects the two, Elijah.
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.900]   My God is Jehovah.
[00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.300]   Where is Elijah from?
[00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.240]   He was the Tishbit of Tishbi in Gilead.
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.420]   What does that mean?
[00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.660]   Well, Tishbi is somewhere in Gilead.
[00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:38.620]   We know where Gilead is in the map at that point in time.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:41.420]   But no one knew where Tishbi was.
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:45.040]   This Tishbit from Tishbi in Gilead, what does that mean?
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.260]   He came from obscurity.
[00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:47.260]   No one came.
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.620]   So this guy, this Tishbit of Tishbi, where no one ever knew where he comes from, gets
[00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.180]   and has a meeting with the king.
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:07:00.260]   It happens over in the first three verses, King Ahab of the northern kingdom.
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.580]   Post David, post Solomon, the whole thing went to disaster.
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.340]   You know, soon separate into northern kingdom, where Elijah, the book of Obadiah, Queen Jezebel
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.580]   is at, and then the southern kingdom, where Israel, where Mark is right now, a lot of
[00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.260]   times Israel, Jerusalem, all those guys, that's where Nehemiah, Ezra, all of that takes place.
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.260]   But we're focusing on King Ahab of the northern kingdom.
[00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:31.940]   Well, this guy from Tishbi gets a meeting with King Ahab, and he says this to him, "Neither
[00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.060]   dew nor rain except by my word."
[00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:40.140]   Because you people are worshiping Baal, the god of fertility.
[00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:43.180]   Let me then show you how powerful my God is.
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.940]   There will be no more dew, there will be no more rain, nothing, except by my word.
[00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:56.000]   And he tells him, here's my motivation, "It's before the God before whom I stand."
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:03.260]   And then later on, as we end up in verse 6, God at the climax of this event, he ushers
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.860]   and brings him to Cherith.
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:07.340]   Cherith, solitude.
[00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.020]   Cherith, he's by himself.
[00:08:09.020 --> 00:08:11.340]   He's fed by ravens, all of that.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.920]   He's fed by the brook, water by the brook.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:19.100]   But the drought is three and a half years, and soon the brook dries up.
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.140]   And God says to Elijah, "Go to Zarephath.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.380]   I now want you to go from Ahab to Cherith to Zarephath."
[00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:32.860]   Well Zarephath is a hundred miles away, so this guy has to walk a hundred miles.
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.380]   King Ahab and soldiers are after him.
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:39.900]   So then he not only goes, walks a hundred miles, he goes to Zarephath, which is the
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:46.900]   home of Queen Jezebel, who is married to King Ahab, who is the worst of all the worst.
[00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:51.220]   And God then says to him, "I want you to go, and a widow will meet you."
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.220]   A widow?
[00:08:52.220 --> 00:08:53.220]   Yes, a widow.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.500]   Shows up to the widow's house.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:09:00.060]   The widow tells him, because she's gathering sticks, "I have no food.
[00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.620]   I have a little flour.
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:02.620]   I have a little oil.
[00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:09.140]   I'm going to go bake some bread so that you, my son and I, will eat it and die."
[00:09:09.140 --> 00:09:11.900]   And Elijah's looking at him, he says, "Really?
[00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:17.540]   Of all the people in Zarephath, you made me walk a hundred miles to meet a widow who's
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:23.900]   going to tell me that she has no oil, no flour, and she's now going to make food to die?"
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:31.260]   Yes, yes, that's what I'm going to tell you, because God knows what we need.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.220]   God knows what we need.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:39.060]   And the story goes that you're going to have to continue to do all these things and go
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.060]   and do.
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:44.380]   And the second thing that we talked in sermon is not only does God know where you are, he
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.020]   knows where Elijah was at the beginning from chariot.
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:49.220]   He wants him to go to Zarephath.
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:51.540]   He then knows exactly where he needs to go.
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.420]   You go to Zarephath, and he knows what you need.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:56.180]   I'm going to give you the widow.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:09:58.020]   It may not be what you want.
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:04.140]   It may not be what you think you need, but it's what you need according to what I think
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:05.140]   that you need.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.340]   That's what God is calling him to do.
[00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:11.380]   And then lastly, that I want you to go and do.
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.380]   And that's what he says to the widow.
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:20.580]   But now this thing comes, and the story goes in verse 17, after this, the son of the women,
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:27.180]   the mistress of the house, after all this thing happens, he becomes ill.
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:35.780]   And his illness was so severe that there was no breath in him, and he dies.
[00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:42.260]   And in verse 18, the widow says to Elijah, what have you against me, O man of God?
[00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:50.380]   You have come to bring my son to remembrance and to cause the death of my son.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:51.380]   That's what she believes.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:52.780]   A couple things I want to say about this.
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:58.500]   Number one, the woman has a wrong perspective on sin.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:05.980]   Somehow or another, when this thing happens, she believes that her sin is being punished
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:07.940]   by God.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.280]   Now here's the one thing as Christians that we have to believe, right?
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:14.100]   We know that this woman has some sin.
[00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.280]   We don't exactly know what this sin is.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.540]   We do know that the sin is eating her up.
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:26.180]   There must be some guilt within that sin that keeps popping up, that is at the forefront
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:27.900]   of what she's thinking.
[00:11:27.900 --> 00:11:33.460]   And eventually, for some reason, as we read, we infer that she thinks that eventually this
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:35.280]   sin will come in the open.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:44.860]   But when her son dies, she immediately thinks, God wants me to remember the sin and causes
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:47.300]   my son to die.
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:50.140]   Couple of things I want to say about that.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:53.420]   Sin is present in the world, yes.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:58.220]   There are implications to your sin.
[00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:01.940]   There are consequences to your sin.
[00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:05.220]   There is also sin in the world.
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:11.020]   That's why diseases, natural disasters, all of that, because of the presence of sin in
[00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.800]   our world, bad things happen.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.840]   So there are consequences and ramifications to our sin.
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:23.040]   There is sin in the world because of the fall of Adam and Eve.
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:25.940]   But here's something very important.
[00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:34.480]   God will not kill other people or do harm to other people just to punish your sin.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.480]   God is not going to kill the widow's son just to punish the widow.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.400]   There are sin, there are ramifications to sin, there's sin around the world, but God
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:47.800]   is not a sadistic God.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.480]   That's something that the widow needs to understand.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:53.800]   She has a wrong perspective on sin.
[00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.320]   Not only that, what happens?
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:13:02.860]   She's blaming Elijah because she's hurt.
[00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:11.640]   Because sometimes we say and do things when we are hurt that we regret.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:18.400]   Sometimes we say things when we are hurt, when we are angry, that we can't take back.
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:25.080]   As Asians, for most of us here as Asians, we don't know how to deal with anger.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.780]   One day, a lot of times, I may need you to help me understand.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:31.920]   As an American Asian born here in the U.S., sometimes I may not understand, but I find
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:36.600]   with my parents, they're very private about everything.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.240]   They just keep everything inside.
[00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:39.240]   They never open up.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.780]   I've never understood why.
[00:13:41.780 --> 00:13:43.480]   My mom always just says, "No, no, it's no problem.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.960]   You just got to put your head down."
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.640]   And they never share about their feelings.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.920]   In all my life, my parents have never shared what they were thinking about.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.140]   They have never been open and they never want to share with anyone.
[00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:57.760]   Everything is a private matter.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:07.440]   So eventually one day when all of this pressure builds up and once in a while you just explode.
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:15.680]   And here a lot of times we see the widow gets so frustrated, she says things to Elijah that
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:17.440]   she probably would forget.
[00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.120]   She takes out her anger at Elijah.
[00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:21.380]   Let me tell you a story.
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:24.840]   Have you ever been to a bad funeral?
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:29.320]   Now funerals are kind of bad, but have you just ever been to a funeral that just went
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.560]   completely berserk?
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.000]   I went to one funeral one time.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.400]   It was a very close friend and she had about six or seven siblings.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.400]   And then the siblings did not get along.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:45.120]   The mother had passed away and now the father had passed away.
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:49.640]   The older sister gets up and she's supposed to do the eulogy.
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:53.280]   She gets up just like this and she starts doing the eulogy.
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:56.360]   And so she starts talking about the dad.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.440]   Then suddenly she just went off course.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:15:05.560]   She started blaming all of the siblings about how no one took care of the dad, all the problems
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.340]   with each of the different siblings, and how she was the sister who took care of him when
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.000]   all the other sisters were not there.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.160]   Well, one of the brother-in-laws stood up in front of everyone and says to the sister-in-law,
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.040]   "I am so sorry for this.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.060]   She's not mentally right."
[00:15:23.060 --> 00:15:28.080]   So he gets up and he's trying to grab and pull her off stage.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:36.080]   And then she starts running around this funeral home that we're in trying to read her eulogy.
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.640]   Next thing you know, the sisters stand up and they're all trying to corner her and she's
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:44.760]   running around this funeral home finishing up her eulogy so everyone knows how bad the
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.120]   sisters were.
[00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:49.240]   And then suddenly they just start swearing at each other.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.400]   And we're all sitting there watching.
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.740]   And you're sitting there, "This is terrible.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:54.820]   This is terrible.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.460]   Everyone's swearing at each other.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:57.820]   The casket goes out.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.020]   They're swearing at each other as the casket's going out."
[00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:02.020]   It was interesting.
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:06.980]   I bet you as you look back, as you can imagine, the family was never the same.
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:12.060]   As you can imagine, there was things said that you just regret.
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.420]   There was things said that you wish at the key of the moment that was never said but
[00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:18.340]   can never be taken back.
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:21.500]   I remember my mom.
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:27.220]   My mom is, I told you a lot of times, she's not a very open person.
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:32.860]   My mom could be a hard person and she keeps all these anger things built up.
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.020]   And my mom a lot of times got into fights with my younger sister so much and they would
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:41.340]   say things that I'm sure they would regret.
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.300]   It's been 20 years now.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.960]   I have not seen my sister.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:52.420]   She moved out, got into it with my mom, moved out, went, disappeared somewhere in New York
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.980]   and cut off ties with my mom.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.580]   She felt like as brothers, me and my twin brother will always side with my mom.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:03.140]   I'm sitting there, I said to her, "You know, she's like this.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:05.880]   You have to learn to forgive her."
[00:17:05.880 --> 00:17:09.700]   Because a lot of times she struggles with so much anger but my sister couldn't do it
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.220]   and she just couldn't stand it about my mom.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.060]   And she disappeared for 20 years.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:17.680]   My mom tried to call her.
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:22.580]   My mom tried to apologize for once in my life, I've never seen that.
[00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:27.980]   My mom tried to tell my sister that she took back everything she said.
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.700]   My sister never returned her phone call.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.920]   It's been 20 years.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:43.160]   So sometimes in the course of life when we get angry, we will say things that we regret.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:48.160]   We will say things that we wish we could take back.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.380]   And after all this Elijah and all this stuff and she sees this widow, the son's widow,
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:55.300]   widow's son dies.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:58.420]   And the widow takes out her frustration.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:03.240]   You know what Elijah's response was in verse 19?
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.700]   And he said to her, "Give me your son."
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:12.980]   Elijah never told her that things were going to be okay.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.780]   Elijah never rebukes her.
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:18.500]   Elijah doesn't argue with her.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:23.620]   Elijah doesn't tell her and reason with her, "Hey, I'm not at fault here, all right?"
[00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:27.020]   And help her see what she was wrong in her thinking.
[00:18:27.020 --> 00:18:32.020]   Elijah doesn't even speak scripture to her and tell her to trust God and place your faith
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.820]   in God and pray to God he'll save you.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.420]   He doesn't do all these things.
[00:18:36.420 --> 00:18:39.940]   For some of us, a lot of times we've been in this situation, he doesn't even say, "Hey,
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:40.940]   how are you feeling?"
[00:18:40.940 --> 00:18:43.220]   "Well, how do you think she's feeling?"
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:46.860]   He also doesn't say, "I understand."
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:51.340]   I think all of us have had to deal with people who are hurt.
[00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:56.260]   Death of a beloved one, loss of a job, circumstances that happen.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.740]   And sometimes when we're counseling different people, we want to solve their problem.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.340]   We want to tell them it's going to be okay.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:06.100]   That's not what they want to hear at that time.
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.020]   We want to tell them you got to pray to God.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:10.140]   That's not what they need to hear at that time.
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:13.340]   We want to tell them, "Hey, look, God is in control."
[00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:15.300]   Or we sit there and say, "How are you feeling?"
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:16.780]   It'll get them even more mad.
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:21.420]   One time I said to an individual who was diagnosed with cancer, I said, "How are you feeling?"
[00:19:21.420 --> 00:19:23.540]   She says to me, "How do you think I'm feeling?"
[00:19:23.540 --> 00:19:27.780]   Never said that ever again because I realized that's probably not the best thing to say.
[00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:34.420]   Never even say, "I understand how you're feeling," because sometimes you don't understand.
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.120]   You know what Elijah did?
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.340]   He sat there and listened.
[00:19:40.340 --> 00:19:43.880]   He took it all in.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.140]   He doesn't sit there and give her all the solutions because you know and I know sometimes
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:56.500]   when you're really mad and you're really angry, you know what you did is wrong.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:20:00.780]   You know what you're supposed to do.
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.460]   And you're not looking for people to tell you what to do.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.020]   You're looking for people to listen to you.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:09.420]   I had two close friends.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:15.960]   I had one individual who was going to retire early at 47 years old.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:19.820]   She was a paralegal and she had saved up her money at 47, 48.
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:25.060]   Her goal was to retire early and she bought her house, everything.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:32.300]   On the week she was supposed to retire early, she went in for a checkup because her insurance
[00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:38.260]   was about to be over and the doctor told her she had stage four cancer.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:44.460]   And now for the last since leaving her workplace, she's been in chemo, radiation every single
[00:20:44.460 --> 00:20:45.820]   week.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:53.500]   And we talk at least once a week and half the time, 80% of the time, it's her expressing
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:59.300]   anger and frustration over the situation and she's a Christ follower and she sits there
[00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.340]   and tells me how she's frustrated.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:06.220]   She doesn't know why this happened to her and what can you say but listen to her.
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:11.020]   I had another person, my wife's aunt, who is not a believer.
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.660]   Her husband went to bed that night.
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:18.580]   I remember that because we saw him at a family party and it was just before Thanksgiving.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:20.260]   He said, "We'll see you at Thanksgiving."
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:27.920]   He went home that night and he had a stroke and he passed away.
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:33.340]   And she calls me up because she knew that somehow or another I was kind of a pastor.
[00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:35.660]   How do you deal with all this stuff?
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:39.920]   And for subsequent times, once a month I have checkup on her.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:47.760]   She's not a believer and she tells me all her pain and all I could do is listen to her.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:51.600]   Because sometimes in the midst of all this stuff, you know what they need?
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:53.700]   Is it for you to give them advice?
[00:21:53.700 --> 00:21:56.160]   Is it for you to tell them God is there with them?
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.500]   Listen to all this stuff but just be there to listen.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:06.540]   Elijah took the brunt of this widow's pain because this widow said some things that she
[00:22:06.540 --> 00:22:09.460]   probably will regret if she looked back.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:12.940]   And he just listened to her and he says one thing to her.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.580]   "Give me your son."
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:27.440]   And he took him from her arms and he carried him up into the upper chamber where he lodged
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:31.040]   and laid him on his own bed.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:35.340]   And here for the next couple of verses, I'm going to show you Elijah's prayer because
[00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.000]   I find this prayer is so powerful.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.640]   We'll glide over it but in the future I was thinking maybe we could just dive into it
[00:22:40.640 --> 00:22:42.800]   a little bit more.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:47.040]   And he cried to the Lord, "Oh Lord my God.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:55.680]   Have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourned by killing her son?"
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.760]   He brings the boy to his bed and he cries out to the Lord, "Oh Lord my God.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.820]   What have you done?"
[00:23:03.820 --> 00:23:06.400]   Because he doesn't know.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.740]   He doesn't know why God killed her son.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.940]   He doesn't know the answers to all these things.
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:18.960]   And when you have a deep enough relationship with the Lord your God, you're able to come
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:26.760]   to God with your pain, you're able to lay it before him and say, "Help me understand."
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:31.120]   Because I don't know.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.060]   Why have you done this?
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:36.880]   Why is this happening?
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.500]   I don't know.
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:45.940]   Because sometimes understanding and following the Lord, we don't know why certain things
[00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.900]   happen.
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:51.820]   But then he also intercedes for the boy.
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:57.180]   He takes the widow's son and he intercedes.
[00:23:57.180 --> 00:23:59.840]   He comes to the Lord and says, "I don't know."
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.960]   But then he struts himself upon the child three times and cries to the Lord, "Oh Lord
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   my God.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.140]   Let the child's life come into him again."
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:13.040]   He intercedes on behalf of the widow's sons.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:14.600]   He wrestles with God.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.860]   He prays specifically for the boy's life to be saved.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.860]   But he's not afraid to pray for the impossible.
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.820]   Remember when we talked about Zerah for some of those guys who were here and for one of
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:25.820]   the things.
[00:24:25.820 --> 00:24:29.620]   One of the things that we talked about in that sermon is you have to overcome physical
[00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:31.700]   impossibilities.
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:39.180]   You have to believe that God sometimes in his realm will work miracles in your life.
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:45.180]   Elijah was not uncomfortable with praying for impossibilities.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.420]   He prayed for a miracle.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:52.700]   But he also realized God may not answer his prayer.
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:56.260]   And it's okay.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.280]   You're seeking God.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.220]   You're wrestling with God.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.300]   You're coming before him praying for answers.
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.260]   You're asking for miracles to happen.
[00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:09.300]   You're asking him to do the impossible.
[00:25:09.300 --> 00:25:17.260]   But you have to trust that he may or may not answer that prayer based upon that will.
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:20.900]   And you have to be okay with that.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:24.200]   See the widow's son who expresses her anger.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.580]   We see Elijah listening to what he has to say.
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.220]   He doesn't tell her what to do.
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:30.560]   He brings her, lays him on the bed.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.740]   He's also wrestling the same thing because he doesn't know.
[00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:38.220]   Comes before the Lord but he intercedes on behalf of the widow's son.
[00:25:38.220 --> 00:25:41.460]   And the Lord listened to the voice Elijah.
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.800]   And the life of the child came into him again.
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.660]   And the boy revived.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:53.160]   And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:56.540]   He delivered him to his mother.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.300]   And Elijah says see your son lives.
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:04.260]   And look at verse 24 if you get a chance to underline verse 24.
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:12.520]   And the woman said to Elijah, now I know you are a man of God and that the word of the
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.020]   Lord in your mouth is truth.
[00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:19.120]   Here's what she didn't say.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.520]   Now I know Elijah you are a powerful man.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.440]   Now I know Elijah I can trust you.
[00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.240]   Now I know Elijah man I need to worship you.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:33.800]   And that you have all this power that we can depend on.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.200]   That's not what she says.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:39.480]   She says now I know that you are a man of God.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:45.080]   And that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:53.320]   When people look at you, do they see something different in you?
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:58.440]   Do they see that it is God working in your life?
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:04.760]   They're not just seeing you but they see beyond and see God in the presence of your life.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.520]   That's the goal isn't it?
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.560]   That's the goal of why we do what we do isn't it?
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:17.360]   That when people when we do good and we allow and intercede for others, when we serve others,
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:22.960]   when we help others, all of these things, it's not because people say look at him.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   Look at me.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.160]   Look at how great I am.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.160]   Look at how perfect.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.560]   Our goal as stewards of the gospel is to say look at how great God is.
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:38.200]   Look at how amazing God is.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:43.200]   And Elijah had this what we call a confident humility.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.880]   He was confident in what God could do.
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.440]   He was confident in what God called him to do.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:56.040]   And he was humble enough to know that it was God working through him.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:03.760]   And everything that he did was to bring glory to God in all that we did.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:09.840]   If you guys are familiar with the name Tim Keller, Tim was a mentor of mine.
[00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:11.840]   I love Tim Keller.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:16.600]   If you are not familiar with Tim Keller, I encourage you to Google and look him up or
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.080]   read one of his books.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.680]   Tim Keller was a man, if you ever met him, he was a pastor in New York, started becoming
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.400]   famous with his famous book Reasoning with God at age 53.
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:33.120]   And as a result, we will look upon, he died two weeks ago.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:39.640]   When we remember Tim Keller, we will see him as such an influential leader who changed
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:46.160]   the church, the modern church as we know it today, that we will compare him to what Billy
[00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:51.640]   Graham did back in the 70s and 80s is what Tim Keller brought to us today.
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:56.560]   But on the side note, as a result, I didn't know Tim very well.
[00:28:56.560 --> 00:29:00.800]   I got a chance to oversee his Los Angeles conference, his big Chicago conference, and
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.240]   we interacted with each other very much so.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:10.040]   Tim was one of the brightest individuals you'll ever met.
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:17.080]   Tim was a pastor, Tim was a scholar, Tim was a theologian, Tim was a professor, Tim had
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:25.880]   a chance, he read so much, he thought so much, he engaged so much, but the man was humble
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.320]   in a way that I've never seen a person be.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.560]   Tim got famous when he was a little bit older, age 53.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:37.840]   One of my friends asked Tim one time and says to Tim, "Tim, how does it feel being famous
[00:29:37.840 --> 00:29:40.600]   and wanting everyone to sign your books and all that?"
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.640]   And Tim says to the woman, he says, "You should never ever feel comfortable that people worship
[00:29:44.640 --> 00:29:45.640]   you.
[00:29:45.640 --> 00:29:47.480]   You should just never do."
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:51.720]   Tim was a person who dialogued in the day when, I was just talking with Rachel about
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:55.200]   this, in the day when people were just funny about politics and race and all the other
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:00.280]   stuff, Tim would just listen and dialogue all the time.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:05.000]   Especially in the last three years of his life, people would just criticize Tim because
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.560]   he says, "You're not playing on one side, you're not on the right, you're on the left,
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:09.560]   so which side are you?
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:10.560]   Pick a side."
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:13.600]   And Tim would never engage in those debates.
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:18.680]   Princeton Seminary gave him an honorary doctorate, but Princeton Seminary had to rescind it because
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.480]   a lot of the students and faculty and some of their donors says, "Why are you giving
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:27.360]   this person who believes in marriage and who doesn't believe in LGBTQ, we're not giving
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.200]   him, we're not giving him this doctorate."
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:33.240]   So they had to rescind the doctorate from him.
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:38.880]   Tim wrote a kind, kind note that says, "Thank you for even considering me and giving me
[00:30:38.880 --> 00:30:40.240]   this honor."
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.840]   When people criticized him on social media, you would never hear Tim get on social media
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.800]   and criticize him back.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.160]   Many times Tim would just call that person and says, "I want to understand your views,
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   help me understand."
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:31:00.840]   One of the things that someone said to Tim, the most impressive thing about him was you
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:07.440]   never came away exclaiming, "Isn't Tim Keller amazing?"
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:15.080]   But when you looked at Tim Keller, all he wanted you to know is, "Isn't Jesus amazing?
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:17.600]   Isn't Jesus wonderful?
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.040]   Isn't Jesus beautiful?
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:23.080]   Isn't Jesus captivating?"
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.700]   That's our life as Christ followers, isn't it?
[00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:33.800]   We live like Elijah in which when miracles happen because of what God is able to do through
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:39.280]   us, that they're going to look at our life and say, "Wow, look at God.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:43.760]   Look at what God has done through him and shown him."
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:48.400]   Because that's what we're supposed to be called to do as Christ followers.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.580]   So let's go back to Hebrews 11.
[00:31:51.580 --> 00:31:55.540]   Why wasn't he in the hall of faith?
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:32:03.160]   And why instead are we told in verse 35 that the dead, women of the dead, and it says this,
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:06.520]   "Women received back their dead by resurrection."
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:13.560]   I really believe that the author of Hebrews was trying to honor Elijah well by not talking
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.280]   about Elijah, but rather about what he did.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.040]   Let me explain this.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:20.200]   Elijah was all about others first.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:22.360]   Elijah was never about himself.
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:27.560]   Elijah never did anything to give him the platform, but it was always about what he
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   did.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:36.200]   My theory is that a lot of times the author of Hebrews honored Elijah well by not talking
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:41.640]   about Elijah, but rather about what he did.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:48.560]   Because Elijah was never about himself, but always about other people.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.120]   That is the conclusion of chapter 17.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.120]   Four weeks in chapter 17.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:59.440]   We learn that God could use me wherever I come from.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:06.480]   He used Elijah to Tishbit from Tishbit in Gilead, a place of obscurity, a rural person
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:09.320]   that no one ever knew.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:12.720]   God could use me wherever I come from.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:15.920]   I am here by God's timing.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:21.360]   God used Elijah and called him to Ahab, he called him to Cherith, he calls him to Zarephath,
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.360]   all of these things.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:27.480]   I am here by God's timing because God sees me wherever I am.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:30.040]   Elijah goes and goes wherever he is called to do.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:32.960]   He obeyed him to go to Cherith.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   He obeyed him to go to Zarephath.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.320]   He seeks his will.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:44.920]   Before whom I stand is his motivation as we learn in chapter, in verse 2 of chapter 17.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:48.160]   He accepts what he is given.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.600]   He accepts the widow.
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:56.360]   He expects, he accepts whatever happens with the widow who had no flower, who had no oil,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:59.080]   who thought she was about to die.
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:01.840]   He intercedes for others.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:09.040]   He wrestles with God in an authentic way and he gives God the glory but never takes on
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.760]   the glory.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:17.640]   Miracles unfold in the hands of humble hearts.
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:20.320]   Elijah tells the widow go and do.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.240]   Go and do.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:28.240]   Go and do, go and do because miracles unfold in the hands of humble hearts.
[00:34:28.240 --> 00:34:30.840]   Go and do.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:32.560]   Let's pray.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:36.320]   Father, thank you for the life of Elijah.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:42.320]   Thank you for all that you have taught us through this chapter 17 full of riches of
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:50.200]   the adventures with Ahab, with Cherith, with Zarephath, with the widow's son, and ultimately
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:56.600]   a lot of times you reminded us this morning it is not about us and it will never be about
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:03.440]   us, but how God you work through and in us in our role as stewards to give you the glory
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.440]   in all that we do.
[00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:08.360]   May we learn from the journey of Elijah.
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:14.760]   May we learn what it means to intercede for others, to die for ourselves so that we may
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:22.280]   serve others every single day, but to give all glory and credit to you.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.140]   As we go forth, may you guide us every step of the way.
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:29.560]   May we go forth on this day in all that we do in our work, in our school, even for some
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:35.280]   of us who are on a summer vacation to honor you every step of the way.
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.680]   In Christ we pray, amen.
[00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:40.600]   Mark is back next week and have a good day.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.440]   Thank you.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:51.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
