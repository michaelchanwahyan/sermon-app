[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Hey, we are going to continue our mini-series on worship.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   And last time we were talking about Psalm 8, right?
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.320]   Yeah, and what a nice Psalm to reflect upon.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.780]   And today we're going to continue this series
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.200]   and we are at the beginning of the Bible.
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.440]   So if you have your Bible,
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.000]   turn to chapter two of the first book, Genesis.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.420]   Chapter two, Genesis, all right?
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.120]   We're going to read a part of scripture from chapter two.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.120]   And this is a passage that talks about Garden of Eden.
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.480]   Garden of Eden, all right?
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.520]   So let me read a couple of verses out of chapter two.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.480]   Chapter two, verse seven.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.480]   Then the Lord God formed the man from the dust of the ground.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.080]   He breathed the breath of life into the man's nostrils
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.560]   and the man became a living person.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.560]   Then the Lord God planted a garden in Eden in the east.
[00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.880]   And there he placed the man he had made.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.800]   The Lord God made all sorts of trees
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800]   growing up from the ground,
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.760]   trees that are beautiful, that produce delicious fruit.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.320]   In the middle of the garden, he placed the tree of life
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.520]   and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.160]   And verse 15, the Lord God placed the man in the garden
[00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.440]   of Eden to tend and watch over it.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.120]   But the Lord God warned him,
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.200]   "You may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the garden,
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.540]   "except the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.920]   "If you eat its fruit, you will surely die."
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.060]   Then the Lord God said,
[00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.040]   "It is not good for the man to be alone.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.200]   "I will make a helper who is just right for him."
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.240]   This is a simple passage, right?
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.040]   Seemingly very simple.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.520]   By the way, I'm reading from a New Living Translation, NLT,
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.740]   which is easier to understand for many of you.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.560]   And as we open the opening chapters of the Bible,
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.040]   we find a simple story, right?
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.600]   How many of you have seen or read a children's Bible?
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.960]   Children Bible, kid's Bible.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.880]   Yeah, right?
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.520]   Do you find this story in the children Bible?
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.080]   You do, right?
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.480]   Yeah, it's a must-read story, right?
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.880]   And you find a forest, Adam and Eve,
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.280]   two people in the garden.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.920]   And it seems like a very, very simple kid's story.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.780]   However, a closer reading,
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.200]   or if you read it more carefully,
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.080]   you raise a lot of difficult questions,
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.640]   a lot of different issues.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.440]   For example, did Adam have belly button?
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.200]   He's the first guy, right?
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.680]   And he was not born from a mother.
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.960]   Who's the mother of Adam?
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.000]   No mother, right?
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.280]   So how about Eve, right?
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.460]   Eve was born or came into existence
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:10.760]   in a very different way, right?
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.640]   So do they have belly buttons?
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.600]   Or when did they come about, right?
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.880]   I mean, a simple, literal reading of scripture
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.680]   will have us believe, okay,
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.880]   maybe Genesis 1 and 2,
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.660]   things that happened just a few thousand years ago, right?
[00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.040]   So we've come to the conclusion, probably,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.840]   that the earth is young, right?
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.080]   It's really, really young.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.040]   I mean, how many pages you got, right?
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.040]   From creation to Abraham, right?
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.880]   It's only 12 chapters, right?
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.680]   And what is Adam's DNA?
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.200]   Have you ever thought about it?
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.800]   Well, Adam is a real man, right?
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.200]   I mean, what's his genes, right?
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:58.080]   And Eve, and is the Garden of Eden on the Google map?
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.680]   Can you find it?
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.120]   Can you find it somewhere in the Middle East, maybe?
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.680]   In Iraq?
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.480]   Or let the archaeologists take it up, right?
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.120]   So a simple reading will have us believe
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.980]   this is a children's story.
[00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.760]   But a careful reading, it weighs a lot of questions.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.400]   And I think a lot of questions that we ask,
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:22.260]   or the questions that I ask,
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.240]   you can't find answer from Genesis 1, 2, and 3.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.600]   Because the scripture, Genesis 1, 2, and 3,
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   are not designed to answer some of our,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.400]   or many of our modern questions, right?
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.400]   It is designed to answer a couple of important questions.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.900]   Very important, more important
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.760]   than the questions that we ask, all right?
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.720]   So reading the Bible is kind of like this, okay?
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.880]   We have to come to a certain strategy,
[00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.220]   understand what the Bible is all about, right?
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.400]   Otherwise, we'll ask a lot of different questions
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.300]   that the Bible is not going to answer, right?
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.900]   So we have to listen to the text.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.080]   We have to listen to the Bible,
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.020]   listen to the word of God carefully,
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.740]   and let it dictate what it's trying to say.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.860]   And we are here to listen and to obey.
[00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:19.580]   That is our attitude in front of scripture, right?
[00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.660]   Before the Bible, we are servants,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.880]   and we listen to the word of God.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.220]   So how do we read Genesis 1, 2, and 3?
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.540]   Simple story, but actually a very deep story.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:36.580]   I think the story in Genesis 1, 2, and 3,
[00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.980]   and we'll spend some time in Genesis 2,
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.980]   are much like a symbolic story, you know, symbolic story.
[00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:48.500]   It's like a can full of different symbols,
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.060]   and these symbols have deeper meanings,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.660]   and we have to ask the questions,
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.180]   what do they point to, right?
[00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.180]   My analogy of reading the Bible is like reading a map, okay?
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.980]   Do you have Google Map on your phone?
[00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.540]   Or some sort of GPS app on your phone, right?
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.740]   And you key in your destination, and it will show you,
[00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.880]   you know, where to turn, right?
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:13.820]   Which road to take, which highway to take,
[00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:17.220]   which exit to take, Google Map, right?
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:20.340]   We all read maps, and sometimes when we read maps,
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.340]   we kind of intuitively, we understand what the map means,
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.180]   right?
[00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.100]   Reading the Bible is kind of like reading a map.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.460]   Let me give you an example.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.820]   I have three examples here.
[00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.580]   On the right is a Chicago map.
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:43.380]   Upper left is a map of Hong Kong, right, where I came from.
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:47.620]   And then lower left is, do you know where it is?
[00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.780]   It's Tokyo, Japan, right?
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.700]   Why do I put a Japan map on the screen?
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:54.900]   Because a lot of people telling me,
[00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.700]   oh, I need to go to Japan, you know?
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.260]   (audience laughs)
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.260]   Oh, the currency exchange rate is so good, right?
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.660]   Everybody's going to Japan, okay?
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.000]   So there you go, all right?
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.580]   So you read a map, we kind of, we read it intuitively.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.100]   We understand what it means, right?
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.900]   For example, upper left, the map in Hong Kong,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.860]   I add the layer of traffic.
[00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:16.540]   So you see all the highways, right?
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.060]   You see different colors.
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.420]   You know, red means it's very congested.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.220]   Black is totally stopped, right?
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.860]   Yellow is kind of congested,
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.740]   and then green is all smooth, right?
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.820]   Those are traffic map, right?
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.380]   So you add a layer, you understand the symbols,
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.360]   you understand the color of the lines,
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.620]   and then you interpret the map
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:41.140]   the way it is intended to, right?
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.560]   You got it?
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:47.380]   And then at the lower left is the Tokyo map.
[00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.980]   It's a terrain map, terrain.
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.240]   Where the mountain, where the valleys, right?
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.240]   You see Fuji mountain on the map.
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:03.780]   On the, it's at the lower left corner, right?
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:04.620]   Mount Fuji.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:07.980]   So it shows you where the hills are,
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.140]   where the mountains are, where the valleys are, right?
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.820]   And they color it, right?
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:17.300]   For the plane, for the level, ground level,
[00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:22.300]   or elevation zero, right, sea level, you see white.
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:26.300]   And then you climb the mountain, you see green,
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.500]   and then there's a black spot, right?
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.780]   Those are higher elevation.
[00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.420]   That's a terrain map, right?
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.220]   And then on the right is, of course, the Chicago map.
[00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.740]   Where are we?
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:41.780]   Where are we on the map?
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.140]   We're kind of in the near south.
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.700]   You see the pink color?
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:48.340]   You know where you are?
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:49.900]   Come on, guys, right?
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.860]   You know where you are?
[00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.180]   All right, you're not in green, okay?
[00:08:53.180 --> 00:08:55.060]   You're right by the lake, right?
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.420]   You see Navy Pier?
[00:08:57.580 --> 00:08:58.740]   You see that?
[00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:00.220]   Oh, come on, right?
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:03.900]   This is elementary questions, right?
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:06.700]   Yeah, we're kind of in the near south,
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.340]   the lower end of the pink region, right?
[00:09:10.340 --> 00:09:13.220]   So the map has you, different color, right?
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:16.500]   So the map is coded in such a way that you know,
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:18.540]   okay, this is the near south, this is the north,
[00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.220]   and this is the region, or how we call it, right?
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.660]   You don't take the map, this color map of Chicago,
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.220]   and you go out to the street and say,
[00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:29.060]   "How come it's not pink?"
[00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:29.900]   Pink!
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:33.780]   I'm expecting the road to be all pink, right?
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:36.540]   Because we're in the near south, right?
[00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:38.180]   We don't do that, right?
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.740]   Because we intuitively, we know that what it means is that,
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:45.220]   okay, the pink area is simple meaning,
[00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:50.220]   well, this neighborhood belong to the same region, right?
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.740]   To the same area.
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.780]   Now, we don't go out and use a Google map and say,
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:59.180]   "Oh, the line is blue, and I don't see any blue line," right?
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.660]   It shows you with legends, with different color coding,
[00:10:03.660 --> 00:10:07.420]   or different symbols to tell you some aspect
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.380]   of the reality, right?
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.540]   Now, no map can tell you everything, right?
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:15.020]   You cannot go back to the map maker and say,
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:17.540]   "Hey, why didn't you answer my questions?
[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.380]   "Why didn't you tell me the terrain?"
[00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.220]   Right?
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:21.820]   Well, it's not terrain map, right?
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:23.300]   It's a color code map.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:26.900]   It tells you all the 77 neighborhoods of Chicago,
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.080]   and what do they call, right?
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.180]   And that is the purpose of a map.
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:34.900]   Now, you cannot fault the maker by saying,
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.620]   "You don't tell me the reality comprehensively.
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.500]   "You don't answer all my questions."
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:46.500]   Now, it's much the same way when we read the Bible story.
[00:10:46.500 --> 00:10:50.540]   No Bible story will tell you everything.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.460]   No text in the Bible, no passage in the Bible
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:58.140]   will answer every single question that you have, right?
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.620]   Now, your questions or your concern
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.860]   when you read the Word of God is let that passage
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:06.740]   dictate the questions to ask.
[00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.580]   And listen to the passage, listen to the words.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.840]   What are they trying to tell you?
[00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:15.060]   Now, the Bible does not answer all the questions
[00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.660]   that we have, and you cannot say,
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:20.780]   "Okay, the Bible is flawed."
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.860]   That's not what it means, because it tells you
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.720]   some aspects of the reality.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.780]   So reading Genesis 2 is kind of like reading a map.
[00:11:28.780 --> 00:11:31.100]   We have to understand what kind of map it is,
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.720]   what kind of text it is.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.740]   I already told you the Garden of Eden story
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:39.940]   is highly symbolic story, and use different symbols,
[00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.960]   like a map, using different color codes
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:47.620]   to tell you some truths of the reality, all right?
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.700]   What I'm trying to suggest to you
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:54.260]   is that Genesis 1, 2, and 3, the opening chapters of Genesis
[00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.680]   or even the first 11 chapters, or many other passages,
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:05.420]   especially Genesis opening chapters,
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:08.880]   they are identity document.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:15.220]   The text is trying to answer the core question
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:17.700]   of identity, human identity.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:21.380]   In other words, who am I, right?
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.220]   Who am I?
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:25.020]   Okay, I'm Mark Chan, but who am I?
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:26.340]   Why do I even exist?
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:28.820]   What am I here for, right?
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:32.260]   What is the purpose of me being here?
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.620]   My existence, my purpose, you know?
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:38.700]   Now, so often we can make up answers
[00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:41.440]   to all of these identity questions,
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:46.100]   but the truth is we have to ask the creator God,
[00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:51.360]   he created you, and we owe our lives to him.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.420]   We have to ask him how to answer those questions.
[00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:57.620]   So there we go, we come to Genesis 2.
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:01.180]   It is a story on Garden of Eden.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:03.900]   It's a highly symbolic story.
[00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:06.940]   It doesn't, when I say the story,
[00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:09.180]   the Bible story is highly symbolic,
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.960]   it does not make it less historical.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:14.700]   It does not make it less real, okay?
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.380]   Just like the color code map,
[00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:20.340]   it does not make Chicago less real or less historical.
[00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:24.060]   It is telling you something about the reality of Chicago.
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:25.660]   It's a color code map.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:28.980]   It's the same way, Genesis 2, the Garden of Eden story,
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.580]   it's a real story.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.520]   It's written in such a way that it's symbolic,
[00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:37.420]   right, understanding a map, different legends and colors.
[00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.980]   So we read the story, we have to try to think,
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.100]   you know, what the biblical author,
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.700]   or what God is trying to say through this passage.
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.980]   Well, let me test you, all right?
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:49.340]   You like a pop quiz, right?
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.540]   Think of Garden of Eden.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:57.720]   Now, the Garden of Eden has an entrance, all right?
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.300]   Just like church has an entrance, right?
[00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.220]   Where, which direction does the entrance
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:05.580]   of Garden of Eden face?
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:09.300]   East, okay, very good, Jin Fang, very good.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:10.900]   Good student.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.260]   No question about it, right?
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.100]   East, right?
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.380]   Okay, second question.
[00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:19.760]   Who is guarding the entrance to Eden?
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.540]   Who is at the door?
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:24.600]   So you walk in our church, right?
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.580]   There is some people guarding the door, right?
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.540]   Some of the core team members,
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:31.420]   or some of the welcome team people.
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.140]   But who's guarding the entrance of the Garden of Eden?
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:35.980]   Who?
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:40.820]   What, I'm sorry?
[00:14:40.820 --> 00:14:44.220]   Give it a shot.
[00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:48.540]   Okay, anyone give it a try?
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:49.380]   It's cherubim.
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.600]   Who's that guy?
[00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:53.980]   Cherubim.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.020]   Cherubim is one of the angels, all right?
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.980]   Cherubim, all right, got it?
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.820]   Cherubim, say it, cherubim, all right?
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:03.420]   There are at least two cherubims
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.980]   guarding the entrance of Garden of Eden.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.060]   Now, you say, why is it important?
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:11.380]   All right, okay, the entrance of Garden of Eden
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.580]   is facing east, okay?
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:16.140]   The place of sunrise, all right?
[00:15:16.140 --> 00:15:18.660]   Now, in the Bible world,
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:24.200]   all the temples, all the sacred places,
[00:15:24.200 --> 00:15:28.860]   their entrances face east.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:31.160]   They all face east.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:36.020]   All the sanctuaries in the Bible world face east,
[00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:37.540]   the place of sunrise.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:39.940]   And at the entrance, facing east,
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:44.780]   is often guarded by some sort of angelic beings,
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.480]   some sort of creatures.
[00:15:46.480 --> 00:15:49.980]   Those creatures are shaped in such a way
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:53.840]   that gives you power,
[00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:55.940]   because who's guarding the door, right?
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.060]   It cannot be a little kid, right?
[00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.260]   It has to be someone who is strong and who is powerful, right?
[00:16:01.260 --> 00:16:03.740]   And cherubim is kind of like that, right?
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:07.620]   Now, let me tell you, much later in the Bible,
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:12.620]   a tabernacle, a tabernacle is actually a portable tent, right?
[00:16:12.620 --> 00:16:15.220]   Remember the Israelites came out of Egypt, right?
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.320]   They were in the wilderness, in the desert,
[00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:22.320]   and God is living among them in the form of tabernacle.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.980]   So he designed the tabernacle,
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:29.060]   and Moses and all those people, they built the tent, right?
[00:16:29.060 --> 00:16:32.660]   And you can pack the tent, and then you go somewhere else,
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.340]   and then you pitch a tent, and then God is there.
[00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:39.500]   And then when you are about to go to another station,
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:42.500]   and then you pack the tent, and then you pitch the tent.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:43.440]   That is tabernacle.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:48.420]   Tabernacle, the entrance of tabernacle.
[00:16:48.420 --> 00:16:50.780]   What direction does it face?
[00:16:50.780 --> 00:16:52.860]   What direction?
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:54.380]   The entrance of tabernacle.
[00:16:54.380 --> 00:16:55.220]   You know that?
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:58.340]   East, okay?
[00:16:58.340 --> 00:17:00.220]   East, yeah, I told you already, right?
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:01.500]   East, right?
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:04.380]   And then after the wilderness, many years,
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.180]   they came, settled down, the Israelites came,
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.060]   settled down in the land of Canaan,
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.300]   and eventually they made Jerusalem the capital.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:14.300]   And remember who built the first temple?
[00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.340]   Solomon, right?
[00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:18.340]   Solomon, come on, guys.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.820]   Solomon, wake up.
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:20.660]   Almost noon.
[00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:21.500]   Solomon, right?
[00:17:21.500 --> 00:17:22.660]   The son of David, right?
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.060]   He built the first temple, Solomon's temple, in Jerusalem.
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:30.100]   And the entrance of Jerusalem temple,
[00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:31.900]   which direction does it face?
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:34.020]   East, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.740]   Exactly, it face east, right?
[00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:40.740]   And then the entrances of tabernacle and temple
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:43.900]   are guarded by, who's guarding the door?
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:47.040]   What's his name?
[00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:49.420]   Cherubim, right?
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:50.860]   Cherubim, okay?
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:53.860]   So you find decoration of cherubim in the tabernacle,
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.060]   especially the entrance to the holy place.
[00:17:56.060 --> 00:17:58.300]   And then in the temple of Solomon,
[00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.220]   is also guarded by two cherubim, 1 Kings chapter six.
[00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:04.300]   There are two cherubims, angelic beings,
[00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.980]   guarding the door, right?
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:07.960]   Facing east.
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.940]   Now what did I say in the beginning?
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:13.620]   The God of Eden, facing east.
[00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:15.040]   Yes, yes, there you go.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.180]   And who's guarding the door?
[00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.140]   Cherubim, okay, cherubim.
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:22.140]   And then you find all sorts of different things
[00:18:22.140 --> 00:18:25.060]   in chapter two of Genesis.
[00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.320]   You got flowers, you got trees,
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:29.520]   you got all this beautiful nature,
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:34.500]   and gold and silver and all this precious stones.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:37.480]   Where did you find it other than God of Eden?
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:43.300]   You find decoration of all those things in tabernacle,
[00:18:43.300 --> 00:18:47.240]   and in much later, the temple of Solomon, right?
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.000]   So in that way, you understand
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.680]   the God of Eden is actually a sanctuary.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:56.320]   It is at least described in such a way,
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.320]   using later terms to describe the prototype
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:04.340]   of sanctuary, a holy place.
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:05.800]   Now what is a sanctuary for?
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.120]   For worship, yes, for worship, right?
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:11.340]   We're talking about worship in this series, right?
[00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.660]   So right at the beginning, God is telling us
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.400]   when God set up the universe,
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:21.400]   when God put man, humanity, in the God of Eden,
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:27.120]   his purpose is for men and women, humanity, to worship him.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.380]   You got it, right?
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:36.180]   So don't even come to the God of Eden story
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:38.900]   and say, "Oh, this is like my backyard, you know?
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:40.860]   "I can do barbecue here, right?
[00:19:40.860 --> 00:19:43.260]   "I can grow some flowers, you know, I can enjoy it."
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:46.000]   No, it's a sacred place.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.540]   It's like a temple.
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:50.140]   It's like a sanctuary, right?
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:54.100]   Facing east and guarded by cherub, who?
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.460]   Cherubim, okay?
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.180]   Cherubim, it's a sacred place.
[00:19:57.180 --> 00:19:59.580]   It's where God dwells.
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.860]   God lives there, right?
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:05.260]   Now you have heard me before, maybe some time before,
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:09.060]   when you read Genesis 1, you know, six day of creation
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:11.340]   or even seven day creation.
[00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.180]   What is that about?
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.940]   It's not answering some of the scientific questions
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:16.540]   that we have today.
[00:20:16.540 --> 00:20:18.860]   It's trying to tell you why it exists
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.180]   and what is the purpose of the entire universe,
[00:20:22.180 --> 00:20:24.300]   entire cosmos that God set up.
[00:20:24.300 --> 00:20:27.060]   Seven days, right?
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:30.340]   What other buildings would take seven period of time to build?
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:34.780]   Temples, temples.
[00:20:34.780 --> 00:20:37.420]   In the Bible world or even within the Bible,
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:40.260]   when Solomon built the temple,
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:44.860]   it spent seven period of time, right?
[00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:47.380]   And building the tabernacle.
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:51.220]   Seven paragraphs to talk about building the tabernacle.
[00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:54.780]   So Genesis 1, the first story,
[00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:59.780]   it's not about geology or science or anything that we ask.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:02.460]   It's about why this universe exists.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:04.900]   Seven day, God set up the cosmos.
[00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.020]   So the entire cosmos is like a temple.
[00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.860]   It's like God dwelling in the universe.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:15.260]   The entire universe, the entire cosmos,
[00:21:15.260 --> 00:21:17.460]   it's a sacred place.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:18.500]   It's like a holy place.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:23.500]   God meant to dwell in the midst of it, right?
[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.980]   Talking about creation care, right?
[00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.540]   Talking about environmental care.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.740]   You know, Genesis 1 already right off the bat telling you,
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:36.740]   you know, this world is the cosmos set up by God himself
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:40.620]   to create a design in such a way that is sacred, right?
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:43.140]   That is holy, that he can dwell in it.
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.380]   And then chapter two, the camera zoom in
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:50.140]   into one spot in the entire cosmos called Garden of Eden.
[00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.780]   It's the first sanctuary.
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:21:55.220]   It's the prototype of sanctuary.
[00:21:55.220 --> 00:21:57.420]   And did I say, did I tell you
[00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.620]   the document is the identity document?
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.340]   Right?
[00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:05.220]   So the passage is trying to answer
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:07.460]   questions about your identity.
[00:22:07.460 --> 00:22:11.020]   Who am I, right?
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.860]   Now, when you get to know someone, a new friend,
[00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:18.100]   how do you introduce yourself?
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.920]   You tell them kind of who you are, right?
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:24.080]   Where you're from, what do you do, right?
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:27.100]   And those answers are identity.
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.220]   Say for example, you're a student and you say,
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:32.100]   "Oh, hello, I'm a student."
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.980]   And maybe your career, right?
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.340]   I will tell people, you know, I'm a pastor.
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:38.380]   And they go like, "Whoa."
[00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:39.220]   Right?
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:42.140]   You may be an accountant.
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:43.380]   You may be a teacher.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:47.380]   You may be just a housewife or chef in a restaurant.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:50.660]   Or we answer the identity questions
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.700]   by telling people what we do.
[00:22:53.700 --> 00:22:55.060]   What we do.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.740]   But here's the problem.
[00:22:57.740 --> 00:23:01.860]   If we fix our identity, if we define our identity,
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.940]   anchor our identity simply by what we do,
[00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.220]   it's gonna change, right?
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.040]   It's gonna change.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   Before I was a pastor, I was a lab chemist.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.400]   You know, I work in a environmental lab
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.720]   and I do testing for water and all those stuff
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.960]   because I studied biochemistry in my undergrad, right?
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.720]   So, you know, thank God I graduated and I found a job.
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:31.000]   So I was working in a lab.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.520]   So every single day, eight hours, nine hours a day,
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:36.200]   I'm doing testing all the time, right?
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.440]   And I was called to ministry and then I went to seminary
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.240]   and I became a minister, right?
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:47.240]   See, my identity changed from a chemist to a pastor, right?
[00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:51.480]   And then someday I will retire.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:53.800]   After I retire, am I still a pastor?
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:57.760]   Well, yes and no, right?
[00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:02.760]   Yes and no, I'm not pay staff of a certain church.
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.000]   But, you know, maybe part of me is saying,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:08.160]   okay, I'm still a pastor.
[00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.200]   But, you know, you know what I'm saying, right?
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.040]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:14.400]   When you answer questions about your essential identity,
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.560]   you know, things change all the time.
[00:24:18.560 --> 00:24:22.780]   And Genesis 2 is trying to answer that question.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:26.240]   What is your essential identity?
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.280]   And the Bible gives us a solid answer.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.280]   I'm God's creation.
[00:24:30.280 --> 00:24:33.520]   I'm designed and created by God wonderfully
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:34.640]   and fearfully made.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:37.520]   I'm a child of God.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.600]   I'm in Christ, right?
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:42.760]   I'm part of the people of God, right?
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:44.320]   Would that change?
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.280]   Would that identity change?
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:49.620]   No, because God does not change, right?
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.460]   Once you are a child of God,
[00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:54.680]   you're always the child of God.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.200]   Yesterday, today, tomorrow, eternally.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.240]   You're always the child of God.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.140]   You're always worthy in God's sight.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:06.840]   You have worth from someone who never changed,
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.160]   God himself.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:09.900]   Once you anchor your identity
[00:25:09.900 --> 00:25:11.900]   into something that is unchanging,
[00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:14.240]   that is our eternal God, our creator God,
[00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.260]   God who loves you, God who cares for you,
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:19.620]   your identity is secure.
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:21.440]   You see what I'm saying, right?
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:24.680]   So we are the people of God,
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.720]   and you are a child of God once you are in Christ.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:32.480]   We are the church, and that anchor is eternal.
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.480]   That identity never change.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.920]   Now, back to this story.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.600]   God of Eden is an identity document.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:44.520]   What does it tell us about our identity?
[00:25:44.520 --> 00:25:47.240]   2.15, chapter two, verse 15.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:49.360]   "The Lord God plays the man,"
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:53.400]   and by the way, here is the man, right?
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:56.860]   The man, the Adam, right?
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.440]   The Adam, right?
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:00.160]   So Adam is kind of interesting.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.400]   He's a unique character, right?
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.560]   But Adam is actually, everyone is in Adam.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:07.520]   He represent the whole mankind.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:09.560]   He represent the whole humanity.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.240]   So when you read the story of Adam and even Eve,
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.520]   you're reading a story for every man and every woman, right?
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.180]   I read myself into it.
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.160]   What does it tell you about the essence
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:21.680]   of being a human being, right?
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.520]   Being Adam, right?
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.480]   Being a human being.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:29.540]   "The Lord God plays the man," the human,
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:34.540]   "in the garden of Eden to tend and watch over it," right?
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:38.820]   He said, "What is so important about those verbs?
[00:26:38.820 --> 00:26:43.520]   "To tend and to watch over it," right?
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:45.320]   Now, the early rabbis, the Jewish rabbis,
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:49.020]   already realized these words, this phrase,
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.600]   is kind of interesting phrase,
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:54.280]   because this phrase, "to tend and to watch over,"
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:59.280]   are used for priests who are working in the sanctuary.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:01.140]   Right?
[00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:04.380]   How do you describe the job description
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.220]   of a priest working in the temple or sanctuary?
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:10.000]   That's how they describe it.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.620]   In Numbers 3, verse seven, it talks about the Levites.
[00:27:14.620 --> 00:27:17.420]   Levites are those sacred personnel
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:21.540]   being called to minister in the tabernacle.
[00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:23.220]   It says, "They," the Levites,
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:25.880]   "will serve Aaron," the high priest,
[00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:26.940]   "and the whole community,
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.220]   "performing their sacred duties in and around the tabernacle."
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:35.360]   Now, I underline the word "performing."
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.740]   You can do some matching, and that is Genesis 2, 15,
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.100]   the word translated "ten," right?
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.260]   And the Italic word, can you see that?
[00:27:46.260 --> 00:27:48.620]   The Levites will serve Aaron.
[00:27:48.620 --> 00:27:54.360]   They will serve, the Italic word is matching, "watch over."
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.380]   In Hebrew, they are the same words, right?
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.340]   So it's very interesting.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:02.340]   We realize when you go to Genesis 2,
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:04.380]   talking about humanity,
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:06.780]   they're being placed in the first sanctuary,
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.660]   Garden of Eden, their job is like a priest,
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:12.740]   to worship God.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:16.580]   And what do the priests do in the sanctuary, in tabernacle?
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:19.420]   They offer sacrifices, they clean up the place,
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:20.900]   they make sure the temple,
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.100]   the sacred place is running, is operating,
[00:28:25.100 --> 00:28:26.940]   and to have fellowship with God.
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.220]   And most of all, the job of the priest
[00:28:29.220 --> 00:28:33.060]   is to guard the sacred place,
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:36.580]   guard the temple against anything evil,
[00:28:36.580 --> 00:28:38.720]   or anything secular,
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:42.380]   anything that does not belong to the tabernacle,
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.560]   guarding against those things coming in.
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:49.120]   So it's like setting a boundary,
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.260]   set a boundary around the sacred place,
[00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:52.900]   around the place of worship,
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.500]   so that unclean, profane, secular things
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.620]   will not enter the house of God,
[00:28:58.620 --> 00:29:01.580]   because the sanctuary is where God dwells, right?
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:05.220]   So now we understand, okay?
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.340]   Genesis 2 is talking about Garden of Eden
[00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.440]   is a sanctuary, it's like a temple.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.460]   And our identity being placed in the Garden of Eden
[00:29:13.460 --> 00:29:16.440]   is like a priest, right?
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.660]   Like a priest.
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:19.020]   We worship God.
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:21.280]   That is the original design.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.580]   You see, in the world of the Bible,
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:28.460]   the highest honor that a human person can have
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:30.980]   is being a priest.
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:35.380]   Someone who's close to God, right?
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.540]   Someone who has fellowship with God, to worship God.
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.440]   And in order to worship God,
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:43.820]   we must first have a right relationship with God.
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:45.520]   And who is God to you?
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.500]   That is also identity question, right?
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:53.500]   If God is your God, God is the one you worship,
[00:29:53.500 --> 00:29:56.340]   then you fix that identity,
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.580]   because I belong to God, and God created me,
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:01.840]   and I'm people of God,
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:06.780]   and worship flows out of that kind of relationship.
[00:30:06.780 --> 00:30:10.060]   I have God with a right relationship,
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.900]   and flows out of that relationship with God,
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:15.620]   I worship Him, right?
[00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.420]   In the 17th century, 1646, many years ago,
[00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:24.580]   many centuries ago, some centuries ago,
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.140]   there was a document called Salted Catechism,
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.580]   Westminster Salted Catechism.
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:31.240]   Now, what does it do?
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:33.720]   That's a pretty interesting word, catechism.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.820]   We don't use it anymore, right?
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:40.820]   It's actually a document that the Bible teachers draft
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:46.440]   in those days to help the new believers
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:49.160]   to get to know the basics of their faith.
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:55.040]   So catechism simply means question and answers.
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.460]   The form is always question and answer.
[00:30:57.460 --> 00:30:59.240]   So in this sort of catechism,
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.400]   there were about 100 questions,
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.580]   and then you ask a question,
[00:31:04.580 --> 00:31:06.940]   and then the new believer,
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:11.820]   when they even get ready to get baptized, right?
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.420]   It's like a membership card.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:15.660]   They have to answer those questions.
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:19.520]   So it's about 100 questions they have to answer correctly
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:23.200]   in order to get baptized and be a member of the church.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.040]   Isn't that fun?
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.520]   There's also a larger catechism,
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.520]   which is more detailed with all the Bible references.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:33.260]   Here, I give you a shorter catechism.
[00:31:33.260 --> 00:31:36.240]   It's a very valuable document to summarize
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:40.680]   the basics of the Christian faith, the biblical faith.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.360]   And question number one, ask the question.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:46.920]   Right off the bat, in the entire document,
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.880]   the first question is, what is the chief end of a person?
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:53.080]   The older translation is,
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:57.320]   what is the chief end, chief purpose of man?
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.880]   But today, we kind of distinguish that.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:03.720]   So I translate as, what is the chief end of a person,
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.160]   a human person?
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.840]   And the answer is, a person's chief end,
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.580]   your number one purpose is to glorify God, to worship Him.
[00:32:14.380 --> 00:32:16.380]   And to enjoy Him forever.
[00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:22.880]   Those two little words are very, very carefully chosen.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:26.500]   To glorify God in everything that we do,
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:28.940]   and worship is a big part of it.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:31.100]   And to enjoy Him, that little word
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.900]   is a very carefully chosen word.
[00:32:33.900 --> 00:32:36.060]   Because our relationship with God
[00:32:36.060 --> 00:32:39.180]   is characterized by enjoyment, right?
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:43.340]   You enjoy your relationship with God.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:46.060]   And you feel happy, you feel fulfilled,
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.300]   and you feel joyful,
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:50.860]   because you are related to God properly, right?
[00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:55.260]   So when you do quiet time,
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:57.220]   when you read the Bible, when you pray,
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:32:58.180]   do you enjoy it?
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:02.840]   Or you're like, oh my God, this is another thing I need to do.
[00:33:02.840 --> 00:33:04.620]   Okay, I need to brush my teeth.
[00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:06.580]   I need to read scripture, all right?
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.060]   Oh my goodness, okay, get it done, right?
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.260]   Or you don't even do it, right?
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:14.380]   So think about it, our relationship with God
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.340]   is supposed to be an enjoyment.
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.540]   And that's what Westminster Catholicism,
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:21.580]   this old document is telling us.
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:24.940]   We worship God, and we enjoy the relationship,
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.460]   because we are created to worship God Himself.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.140]   We are being put in the sanctuary, Garden of Eden,
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.820]   the first temple, the prototype of temple.
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:38.560]   And we are like a priest,
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.820]   the highest honor a man or a woman can get, right?
[00:33:42.820 --> 00:33:45.820]   We are all priests before God, and we worship Him.
[00:33:45.820 --> 00:33:46.980]   And secondly, in this chapter,
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:49.860]   I wanna isolate some of the facts,
[00:33:49.860 --> 00:33:53.820]   or some of the truth that the passage is telling us,
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:59.380]   is that we are created to be a community,
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.820]   a family, to worship God.
[00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:05.520]   2.18, "Then the Lord God said,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:08.700]   "It's not good for the man to be alone,
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:11.940]   "not good for the human person to be alone.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:15.380]   "I will make a helper who is just right for him."
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:18.540]   Again, it's NLT, New Living Translation.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.180]   It's an easier English translation.
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:22.260]   But He says, listen carefully,
[00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:26.300]   "I will make him a helper who is just right for him."
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:29.420]   And by the way, the word helper does not mean
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:34.420]   someone of lower status.
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.200]   Helper does not mean that.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:39.240]   You know why?
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:42.120]   Because many Psalms, many prayers in the Bible,
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:46.560]   we refer God as helper, right?
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.760]   God is not your servant.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.460]   God is not your maid servant.
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:55.640]   Many prayers in the Bible, particularly in the Psalms,
[00:34:55.640 --> 00:34:58.360]   asking God, "God, can you help me?
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:01.020]   "You are my helper, you are my fortress."
[00:35:01.020 --> 00:35:05.640]   Now, so the English translation here,
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:08.320]   helper, don't get the wrong connotation
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:12.960]   that, okay, all right, the woman is the lowest status.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.960]   No, I think a better translation is ally, alliance, right?
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.600]   In order for Adam to take care of the creation,
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.800]   to worship God, he cannot do it alone.
[00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:29.920]   He need another one corresponding to him.
[00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.660]   He needs another one just like him, in front of him.
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.900]   What it means, essentially, a copy.
[00:35:35.900 --> 00:35:38.180]   So you need another person, you need a community.
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:40.140]   And the most basic unit for community
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.180]   is the family, husband and wife.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:45.780]   So Genesis 2 is trying to answer the identity question.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.740]   We are not to be alone.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:49.260]   When we worship God, of course,
[00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:52.620]   we are first designed and created to be a priest,
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:56.600]   to offer sacrifices and to praise God together,
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:58.780]   but we cannot do it alone.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:01.000]   It's not good for man to be alone.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.860]   Have you realized we are different from your pets?
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:07.320]   Dog or cat, right?
[00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:09.260]   You realize that?
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:16.460]   When a dog looks into a mirror, they bark, right?
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.980]   They thought there's another dog in there, right?
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:21.300]   Do your dogs do that?
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.840]   Maybe your dogs are super dogs.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.360]   But animals are different from humans, right?
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:29.980]   We have the sense of, how do you call it?
[00:36:29.980 --> 00:36:33.740]   Awareness of self-existence.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:36.100]   I'm a being.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.140]   I'm different from other people.
[00:36:38.140 --> 00:36:40.780]   Hey, I'm alone, right?
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:42.840]   Now, the first time I really realized that
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   is that when we had Rachel, our daughter,
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.780]   and she was about probably one year old
[00:36:51.780 --> 00:36:55.820]   and started to walk, you know, trying to make troubles.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:57.580]   And I realized that one morning,
[00:36:57.580 --> 00:37:02.580]   she went in front of the mirror in the living room,
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:07.380]   and she kind of looked into the mirror,
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:11.800]   and she touched her face, moved her fingers,
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:14.860]   touched the mirror, and she did not bark.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:21.020]   She realized, hey, this is the reflection of me,
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.780]   and I am oneself, right?
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:28.500]   That sense of, you know, it gave me a sense of wonder.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:30.860]   You know, God created us as someone
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:34.140]   who are aware of our own existence.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.140]   And she realized that.
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:39.200]   A baby, a kid, realized that.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:44.300]   Now, here's what it's trying to say.
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:49.940]   The man, the human person, was being alone.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:53.660]   Exists by himself, right?
[00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:55.380]   And he aware of that, right?
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:58.660]   Now, in Genesis 1, if you realize,
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:02.260]   if you remember, this six day, seven day creation,
[00:38:02.260 --> 00:38:06.380]   there's a phrase that is repeated seven times.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:09.580]   When God did something, when God set up something
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:14.220]   in the cosmos, he said, "It was good," right?
[00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.540]   "It was good."
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:18.140]   And seven times he said that.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:21.100]   He appreciated his work, and this is operating,
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:23.780]   this is good, this is functional, right?
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.580]   And it was good, seven times.
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.420]   And the last time, the seventh time, it was very good.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:31.320]   That's all in Genesis 1.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.520]   In Genesis 2, here, this is the first time God says
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:37.140]   something is not right.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:40.060]   Something is not good.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:45.860]   And God sees a human person being alone and isolated
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:50.500]   and not connected to anyone, and that is not good.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:52.380]   Right, that is not good.
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.460]   So if you're living your life, you know,
[00:38:54.460 --> 00:38:57.140]   you don't connect with anyone in a deeper way,
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:59.800]   God said, "This is not good,"
[00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:02.740]   because God designed human existence
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:05.700]   to be connected socially, relationally,
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.140]   with other people, right?
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:12.200]   I think, you know, we praise God for modern technology,
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.500]   right, the internet, right?
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:18.440]   Online learning, online streaming, and all the stuff.
[00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:20.920]   Those are really, really wonderful things, right?
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:22.760]   The phone that we have, right,
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.520]   used to send Apollo, the rocket, to the moon,
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.520]   many years ago, the phone that we have.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:31.200]   It's so sophisticated.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.120]   So we praise God for all these tools
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.480]   and all these technologies.
[00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:39.480]   However, if we are not careful, we lose a lot of things.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:42.440]   We lose a lot of things.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:47.960]   You remember years of pandemic,
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:49.440]   everything goes online, right?
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:52.960]   Right, is it a blessing or a curse?
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:57.280]   Well, both, right, both.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.760]   Kind of like a blessing, right?
[00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:02.080]   You look at our YouTube channel, right?
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.120]   We got 16K subscribers, right?
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:10.120]   I mean, who, you know, it's just a blessing.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:12.200]   We can share some resources
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.520]   with other people around the globe.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:15.480]   But it's also a curse.
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:19.360]   It's also something, you know, not right.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.960]   You know, when everything goes online,
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:25.160]   yes, in some way, it's a blessing.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:26.560]   But, you know, if we're not careful,
[00:40:26.560 --> 00:40:27.660]   we lose a lot of things.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:32.000]   And one of the things that we lose is human interaction,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.060]   human interaction, like real-time interaction.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:41.840]   You know, I still remember when first the,
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:44.960]   when COVID hit, when pandemic hits,
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:48.880]   all the seminars go online, you know?
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:50.680]   And I saw one of the ads, you know,
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.360]   one of the commercials, one of the advertisement
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:58.080]   that says a certain seminar is offering a fully online,
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.600]   100% online Master of Divinity degree, you know?
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:04.880]   You know what Master of Divinity is?
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:06.920]   You know, everyone's preparing himself to be,
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:10.920]   or herself to be a pastor, to be a minister.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:14.320]   You have to at least complete the three and a half years
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:17.960]   or four years Master of Divinity curriculum, right?
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.840]   Now, why is it called Divinity?
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.760]   It doesn't mean who studied MDiv is more divine, you know?
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.100]   Again, it's an old word, right?
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:27.320]   Back in the 17th century,
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:29.120]   Westminster Confessional Faith,
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:31.680]   they called those who studied the Word of God,
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.240]   who studied the things about God, divine, right?
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:38.040]   Doesn't mean they're more sacred, right?
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:39.280]   But it's an old word, right?
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:42.960]   That's why the degree is called Master of Divinity, right?
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.360]   But you can do it totally online, right?
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:47.860]   Now, I totally oppose that.
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:50.520]   I oppose that.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:53.240]   Now, you can study other degrees online,
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:57.160]   but MDiv is to prepare people to be pastors,
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.360]   and ministers are to relate to other people, right?
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.360]   We got a rough shoulder with other people, right?
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.560]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:08.560]   I mean, a pastor is not a YouTuber, right?
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:11.840]   We don't do things online mainly.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.200]   We do things in real time, right?
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:18.600]   There's a Jewish psychotherapist.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:23.040]   She's Jewish, Esther Perl.
[00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:26.980]   Esther Perl has done a lot of works on human relationship.
[00:42:26.980 --> 00:42:30.820]   And I watched one of her interviews,
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:33.840]   and she laments the modern age,
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.340]   the loss of real human interaction.
[00:42:37.340 --> 00:42:40.280]   We lost it, right?
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.540]   We're always with our phone, right?
[00:42:42.540 --> 00:42:44.360]   We don't talk to each other.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.280]   We don't get our phone, right?
[00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:50.400]   Even we talk to each other, the one next to you,
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   you text them, right?
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.640]   You go through some of the device, right?
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.960]   So we lost that real time human interaction,
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.520]   and she laments that.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:01.400]   And she talks about the older generation,
[00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.740]   like me or people who are older than me.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:08.940]   I still remember those days we were kids,
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.200]   and we have to interact with other kids.
[00:43:11.200 --> 00:43:14.960]   We're on the playground, we're on the street, right?
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.060]   The interaction is real time.
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:19.680]   It's spontaneous.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:23.600]   It's instantaneous, right?
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:25.360]   You gotta respond to other people.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.920]   You gotta learn how to rub shoulders
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:28.440]   with other people all the time.
[00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:29.280]   Real time, right?
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:31.980]   There's no device in my days, right?
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:32.920]   So we were on the playground.
[00:43:32.920 --> 00:43:34.960]   We beat up some kids, you know?
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:36.400]   Real time, you know?
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   And the kids beat us up, right?
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   And we got in a fight, right?
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:40.740]   We got into a fight.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.120]   So that's how we learn.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.160]   That's how we learn how to interact with one another.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:47.280]   I'm sorry, my background is kind of rough, okay?
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.320]   I know you guys are very, very good, okay?
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.960]   You guys are very good, always at home,
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.440]   you know, always doing your homework,
[00:43:52.440 --> 00:43:54.720]   and you get 4.0 or whatever, you know?
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:56.720]   But you know what the problem is?
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:58.520]   It's that most of the social interaction
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:00.600]   are done online today.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.760]   Now think about texting.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:04.680]   Texting.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:07.200]   You can always wait, right?
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.400]   You receive a text, and you kind of think through it,
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.620]   how to respond to it, right?
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:17.640]   On Zoom, you don't turn on your camera, right?
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   Yeah, you're kind of absent, right?
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.240]   Are you there?
[00:44:21.240 --> 00:44:22.400]   Yes?
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.920]   No?
[00:44:23.920 --> 00:44:25.280]   Most of the time, you're not there, right?
[00:44:25.280 --> 00:44:27.720]   You disappear, right?
[00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:30.520]   And we lost that.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.240]   You know, we just don't know.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.480]   No, for people who are younger,
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:36.160]   especially much younger than you,
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.240]   we just don't know how to interact with other people,
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.200]   how to relate and rub shoulders with other people.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.080]   The other day, I was having a hot pot
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:46.120]   with some of the friends,
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.840]   and then I saw a few tables, you know,
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.720]   the other side of the restaurant.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:44:54.160]   They were doing solo hot pot.
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.680]   Now to me, this is inherently wrong.
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:02.040]   I mean, I understand you have, you know,
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:04.020]   it's a very good deal, right?
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.320]   But you know, you're facing one pot,
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.080]   and then tons of food,
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:10.600]   and then you consume the whole thing.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:12.560]   And it's all by yourself.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:15.000]   You don't talk to anyone, right?
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.040]   I mean, hot pot, essentially, is a community thing, right?
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:19.320]   Don't you agree?
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.880]   Right, don't you agree?
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.280]   I mean, we lost that.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.760]   You know, my wife works with Urban Christian Academy.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.000]   It's an after-school program,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.700]   and she always complained to me in the past two weeks
[00:45:29.700 --> 00:45:31.960]   is that the young students today,
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:35.600]   they don't have any social skills.
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.520]   They don't even talk to you.
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.080]   They don't say good morning.
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.080]   They don't say goodbye.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.080]   They don't say thank you.
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.600]   And they just lost all of this, right?
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:50.280]   And that is not good, according to God's design.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:54.280]   God designed us to not to be an island.
[00:45:54.280 --> 00:45:59.300]   We are created to be connected with one another.
[00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:02.300]   There's an innate desire in all of us,
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:03.960]   in every single one of us,
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.400]   to be related to other people, to a friendship.
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:12.800]   Part of a family, part of something bigger than myself,
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.340]   the community, the church, right?
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:19.200]   We have to relearn that.
[00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:20.900]   You know, we have to relearn that.
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:26.000]   And worship, in the biblical sense, cannot be done alone.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.960]   I don't know how great the experience is,
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:34.680]   all by yourself, watching a TV, watching a screen,
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:37.220]   and doing your worship or thinking about worship.
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.160]   That is not the ideal design.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:46.120]   God wants worship to be done in a corporate way,
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:49.560]   you know, collective way.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.440]   Sit with one another, seeing one another,
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:55.620]   and it's a corporate experience, to sing songs together.
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:56.800]   When you sing praises,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:59.560]   do you realize that you can use your years?
[00:46:59.560 --> 00:47:01.800]   Right, you do have two years, right?
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:03.680]   And you listen to other people singing as well.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:05.240]   Well, may not be singing so well,
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.440]   but the experience of worship is a corporate experience.
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:10.760]   We sing together.
[00:47:10.760 --> 00:47:14.560]   We don't come and listen to a song.
[00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:16.840]   We come and worship God together.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:20.600]   That is the meaning of worship.
[00:47:20.600 --> 00:47:23.760]   You're designed to be a worshiper.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.440]   God created you, put you in a temple,
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:28.800]   to be like a priest,
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:30.600]   to serve him and to worship him.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:34.260]   And we are being designed to do that,
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:36.640]   connected as a community, as a spiritual family,
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:40.140]   as a church, to offer our worship to God.
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.400]   Let us all pray together.
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:46.280]   Father, we come before you.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:52.120]   We repent of our sin of selfishness,
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.540]   our self-centeredness.
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:57.860]   Often we think of ourself
[00:47:57.860 --> 00:47:59.720]   and the culture will have us believe
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:02.780]   that we can just do life alone.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:05.880]   And we don't need one another.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:06.800]   We don't need other people.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.320]   We don't need our counselors.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:11.000]   We don't need our spiritual mentors.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:12.440]   We don't need our friends.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.920]   We don't need our brothers and sisters.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:14.760]   We just,
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:21.760]   we use the whole life into individualistic experience.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.520]   And we confess our fault and our sin before you.
[00:48:27.200 --> 00:48:29.820]   And I pray that your word will awaken us
[00:48:29.820 --> 00:48:32.740]   so that we will see that your original design,
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.860]   the beautiful design for us to exist
[00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:39.320]   is to be connected with one another in the community,
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.820]   to support one another, to pray for one another,
[00:48:42.820 --> 00:48:44.620]   to rub shoulders with one another.
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:48.540]   And thank you for your word reminding us
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:52.120]   our original purpose is to worship you.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.180]   Thank you for this highest honor
[00:48:55.180 --> 00:48:57.280]   you granted to all of us,
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:01.180]   that we can worship you in your presence.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:05.680]   And God, I pray that you will help us to recover
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:10.360]   not only the sense of wonder and awe,
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:13.040]   how great you are,
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:17.380]   but we'll recover the sense of togetherness,
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:21.180]   the sense of worshiping you, serving you together.
[00:49:21.180 --> 00:49:24.260]   And thank you for the opportunity we can have today
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:25.660]   to worship you together.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:29.780]   So as a church, we ask that you will continue to renew us
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:34.060]   as one body, as one community,
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.460]   to worship you and to present you offering
[00:49:36.460 --> 00:49:39.040]   and sacrifices that will please you.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:43.060]   Thank you for the time that we have.
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:45.460]   We ask that you will send us out
[00:49:45.460 --> 00:49:50.460]   to continue to live for you in our Monday to Saturday,
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.540]   challenge us and help us to follow you.
[00:49:54.500 --> 00:49:56.860]   And help us to connect with one another,
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:01.140]   to bear witness to our great God,
[00:50:01.140 --> 00:50:04.460]   our great and loving Savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:06.440]   In Christ name we pray.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:09.180]   Well, thank you very much for coming.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.260]   And next week we're gonna serve you,
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.780]   our serve God together, all right?
[00:50:13.780 --> 00:50:15.460]   We have refreshment, right?
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:19.980]   Yeah, please stay around for a time of interaction, okay?
