[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.640]   - Good morning, church.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.960]   - How do you like the new setting and new arrangement?
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.440]   - Well, let's give a hand to the worship team
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.600]   and thank you for leading us.
[00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.360]   And especially the backstage people,
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.840]   those people who are hiding back there,
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.720]   they're doing a lot of work, okay?
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.320]   Okay, I can speak a little bit, man,
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.560]   not for too long, okay?
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.560]   And then especially (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.880]   Okay, okay.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.480]   So we hope and pray that this is a new beginning
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.120]   for our church, especially this service.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.600]   And as you know, it's a beginning for our church
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.000]   and today we are trying to have this bilingual service.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.240]   And we announced it last Sunday.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.200]   And I wanna again thank all the staff
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.680]   and all the people who serve.
[00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.520]   As you know, the church is never a one man band.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.680]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.960]   And it's a family.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.440]   It takes every single one of us to work together,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:26.640]   to grow together.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.480]   As you know, nine years ago,
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.280]   when we launched our church in this small warehouse.
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.520]   And how many people we had?
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.760]   We had about, what, 30 to 40 people?
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:43.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.240]   And today, by the grace of God,
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.240]   and we have grown into a 100 plus adult community.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.760]   And this year, we wanna challenge you
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.760]   with this theme, crossover.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.200]   As you can see, break our barriers and our boundaries
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.560]   and join together to build up the church.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.720]   And to reach out to new people.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.560]   So that we and each and every one of us
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.080]   will be touched by the love of God.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.160]   Now, as we begin, I wanna ask one question.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.920]   What kind of church God want us to become?
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.640]   Now, same in this question,
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.720]   what kind of church God want us to become?
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.360]   You see, we have been studying the book of Acts.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.520]   And it's a book filled with wonderful stories.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.440]   It's a book filled with inspiring pictures
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.400]   of the first church, the first people of God.
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.680]   It's kind of like you take your iPhone
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.960]   and you go back, you time travel,
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   go back to the first century
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.080]   and try to take selfie of the church in Jerusalem.
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.440]   You take some selfies of the life of the church back then.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.320]   Now, those picture will tell you they are
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.920]   the ideal community.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.560]   And Acts 2 is a good example.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.040]   Let me read this passage.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.520]   Let me read that verse by verse and will be translated.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.920]   Verse 42, "They devoted themselves to church in Jerusalem,
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.840]   "the first church of God, to the apostles' teaching
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.280]   "and to the fellowship and breaking of bread and to prayer."
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.240]   "Everyone was filled with awe and many wonders
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.080]   "and miraculous signs were done by the apostles."
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.680]   "And look, all the believers were together
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.960]   "and had everything in common."
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.080]   "They sell their possessions and goods
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.760]   "and they gave to everyone that had need."
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.400]   "And every day they continued to meet together
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.120]   "in temple courts and they broke bread in their homes
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.840]   "and ate together with glad and sincere hearts."
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:30.800]   "They praise God and enjoy the favor of all the people
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.480]   "and the Lord add to the numbers daily
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.160]   "those who are being saved."
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.880]   "Now I wanna focus on this verse 42."
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.640]   "It says they devoted themselves
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   "to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship."
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.520]   "And you can imagine it gives you a picture
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.400]   "of Christians working hard and persistently together."
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.080]   "And see they're dedicated, they're devoted
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.600]   "to the teaching of the Bible."
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.000]   "And they overcome challenges and issues
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.360]   "to maintain the fellowship family together."
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.920]   "Now this is called commitment."
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.680]   "And what does it take to build a church?"
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.640]   "It is commitment."
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.440]   "Commitment is not based on your feeling, your emotions,
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.120]   "it's based on values."
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.400]   "It's based on what you keep doing something,
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.040]   "even when it doesn't feel excited anymore."
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.320]   "And today many people see church as gym membership."
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:52.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.320]   "Now how many of you have gym membership?"
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.040]   "Yeah, okay, very good, very good, yeah.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.040]   "We wanna encourage that, but to many people,
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:05.560]   "gym membership is you sign up and you go
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.480]   "when you feel like it."
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.680]   "And then you don't go, you disappear for weeks,
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.240]   "and then probably you come back when you feel like it,
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:17.680]   "and then hopefully you get some quick results."
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:20.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:23.560]   "And nobody sees you, nobody holds you accountable."
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.440]   "The commitment is not like that."
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.480]   "Commitment is having a training partner."

[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.280]   "It's not just membership, having a partner in training
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.800]   "is that you show up even when you are tired."
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.840]   "Because you know somebody's waiting for you."

[00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:21.240]   "Now I understand many of us are immigrants or foreigners."

[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.080]   "Now let me tell you a story.

[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.400]   "our place of stay."
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:58.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:05.120]   "That is our natural mode of survival."
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.240]   But for the first church in Jerusalem,
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.800]   for the first Christians in Jerusalem,
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.640]   life was hard as well.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:17.760]   They face challenges and even persecutions.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.520]   But surprisingly, they continue to grow
[00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.760]   and they continue to fly and expand.
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.760]   And now we have to ask why.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:30.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:33.840]   You know, because they were committed.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:36.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   Commitment says, "I am not just interested, I'm invested."
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.560]   "I'm not here just when life is easy,
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.000]   "I'm here because it matters."
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:58.760]   See, that's what happens when the Holy Spirit takes over.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:00.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.280]   And then people, their lives will cross over
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.520]   from fear to faith, from surviving to serving.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:11.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.840]   No, the entire Bible,
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:15.480]   God did not come to save individual people only.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.640]   The Holy Spirit came and formed a new people.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.760]   A new kind of community.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.080]   So here's my challenges for you today.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:34.800]   Be committed.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.960]   The Bible says the church is a family we belong to.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.760]   And I've served in different churches for years.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:45.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.560]   And I've learned one thing,
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.480]   my relationship with others in the church is reciprocal.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.520]   And the more I love the church,
[00:10:56.520 --> 00:10:57.520]   the more I serve the church,
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.200]   the church, interestingly, will love you back.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:06.440]   It's reciprocal because we need to grow in the community.
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:09.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.680]   So today my challenge for you is to create a new schedule.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.200]   And the new schedule says commitment.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.240]   It says Sunday worship is not negotiable.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:23.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.280]   Because you do talk about priority.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.440]   My priority is God.
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:29.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   Now, you understand Christians are always under spotlight.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.800]   We are always watched by the world.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.840]   Whether you like it or not,
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.560]   I give you an example of very vivid illustration.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:47.560]   Just last week, we are all, our social media,
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.680]   is all flooded by a video of a couple,
[00:11:50.680 --> 00:11:55.920]   a cop having an affair in a Coldplay concert, right?
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:59.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:02.880]   And sometimes, you know, stuff like this,
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:05.360]   you know, I think the most interesting thing
[00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.880]   is the comments.
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.960]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:13.280]   Now, one comment says, if they, the couple,
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.840]   had not tried to escape the camera
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:17.440]   or, you know, tried to get away from the camera,
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.920]   maybe everything would turn out fine, right?
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:25.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:30.320]   And another reply was very surprisingly and entertaining.
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:32.480]   It says, "You're already here,
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:34.760]   "and what is there to be afraid of?"
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:38.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:40.800]   In any case, I mean, you have to understand
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.440]   the church question, we questions,
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.280]   we are always in the public eyes.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:51.200]   And we need to rely on the grace of God
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.880]   to set a good example.
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:56.480]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.360]   And we questions, we, the church,
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.600]   need to be camera-ready all the time,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.840]   and we need to be always ready,
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.480]   and that calls for commitment.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:10.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:15.400]   And commitment says, "I'm interested, I'm ready, I'm live."
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.480]   And see, commitment says, "I'm going to worship God
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.320]   "and put God as my number one
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   "with other believers of Jesus in the community."
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.120]   And the second point, on top of being committed,
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:37.960]   is be connected.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:42.200]   Start to connect with other people in the church family.
[00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:46.520]   Now, you have to do your job,
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.320]   you have to take the initiative to get to know each other,
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.560]   and then pray for one another.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:53.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.560]   Now, on your way in, I think a Jinfan
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:57.920]   already gave you a slip of paper, right?
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   Have you got it?
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.280]   Okay, all right.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.000]   So you write your name in the slip of paper, right?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:06.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:07.680]   Did you?
[00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:10.120]   Okay, if not, we're gonna pass it to you right now.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:13.840]   All right, how many of you got it?
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.360]   Okay, this is something we wanna do together, okay?
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.560]   Now, you have your name on the slip of paper.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:26.120]   All right, and then we're going to mix it up, okay?
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:27.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.680]   All right, so Jinfan, please,
[00:14:29.680 --> 00:14:31.840]   you're gonna distribute it to all the people,
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.120]   and then when you get this slip of paper,
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.040]   write down your name.
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.520]   Don't scribble it, okay?
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:38.880]   Write down, you know, capital letters,
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.440]   or write clearly your name, okay?
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:44.680]   And then we're gonna mix it up.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:46.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.880]   And then when you pick up a slip of paper
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:52.160]   with someone else's name on it,
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:54.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.600]   and then you're gonna learn that name.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   Okay, and then, in this coming week,
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.880]   you're gonna pray for that person every single day.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:12.560]   Okay, should we do it now?
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:13.400]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:16.080]   Let's do it now, let's do something together, all right?
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:17.760]   So, there are some pens back there,
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:19.040]   some pencil back there.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:21.040]   You are free to leave your seat right now,
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   and go and get some pencil,
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.960]   and write down your name, and give it to Jin--
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:26.800]   Huh?
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.640]   - I already did it, I already did it.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.480]   - Some people already did it, okay, good.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.400]   - I did for them.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.520]   - Oh, you did for them, okay.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:32.360]   - Nice.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:36.400]   She's going to distribute some of the slips of paper
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:37.240]   to other people.
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:42.880]   Okay, so you pick up a slip of paper.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:43.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:44.560]   Check the name.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   Make sure the name is not your name, okay?
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.680]   You're not gonna pray for yourself, okay?
[00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.520]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.440]   Make sure the name is not your name, all right?
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:57.400]   Then it should go well, all right?
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.480]   And then, what do you do?
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.800]   Learn that name, all right?
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.920]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:05.400]   Well, learn to pronounce it.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.240]   - Yeah.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.240]   - Learn how to write it. - (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:09.920]   - Okay, that is the name you wanna keep
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:12.280]   that person accountable in your prayers.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:13.120]   This week.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.440]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:15.680]   Okay, everybody got it?
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.520]   Can you, can you raise your hand?
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:18.600]   Oh, okay, I got two.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.440]   - Thank you, thank you, I got it.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.280]   - Yeah, sure, yeah.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.720]   Let me check if this is my name.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.560]   - Yeah.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:23.680]   - All right, I got a very good name.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.520]   - Yeah.
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:27.360]   - All right, so this is what you do after the service.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.280]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:30.920]   You try to go to that person.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:33.920]   Are you this guy?
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:34.760]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:36.200]   All right, you're gonna ask, okay?
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.040]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:39.360]   See, it takes initiative.
[00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:41.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.680]   Okay, and then say hello.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:44.880]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.720]   Say hi.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.280]   All right, in the community, right?
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:49.440]   All right, so you pick up this name,
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:51.960]   you're gonna pray for that person every single day.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.640]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.080]   Now, you learn that name,
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.440]   and then maybe you can strike a conversation
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.600]   with the person.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:01.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:03.040]   And then you can ask,
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:04.760]   how can I pray for you this week?
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.240]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:07.280]   Okay?
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.920]   Now, you don't have to dig around for some,
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.360]   you know, you don't have to invade privacy, okay?
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.960]   Just pray for my work or something like that, okay?
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.800]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:18.280]   Be polite, okay?
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:20.400]   We're all adults, okay?
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.720]   You know, learn that person, I mean, it's gonna be fun.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.560]   - Yeah. - All right?
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:24.600]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.880]   Okay, so remember what you do?
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:27.720]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.360]   I'm gonna remind you after the sermon, okay?
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   - Okay.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.520]   - What I'm saying is be committed and be connected.
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:35.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.920]   And we can build the church together,
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.120]   we can serve God together.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:39.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:41.280]   Shall we?
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.720]   Shall we?
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:44.840]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:45.800]   Let us pray.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.480]   Thank you, Lord Jesus,
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:52.960]   you never held back your love for us.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.160]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.440]   And you are committed to us to redeem us.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:00.320]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.920]   And today we ask in our prayer
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.920]   to make us a committed people,
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.160]   faithful, devoted, and rooted in you.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:14.280]   And truly give us the courage to serve
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:16.440]   even when it is inconvenient.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.360]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.640]   And dear God, help us to love even when it's not returned.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.200]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:28.880]   And Jesus teach us to make you our number one priority.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.080]   With our time, our hearts, our gifts, and our whole lives.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.000]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.960]   Because we are yours.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.400]   Help us to live like that.

[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:44.400]   In your name we pray.
