 What is this?

102
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,720
 It feels slimy.

103

 (speaking in foreign language)

112
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:47,000
 Tastes like a ball of bao.

113
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,280
 But it doesn't have the ball of bao crust.

114
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:57,000
 But it's slimy in the middle.

115
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:04,000
 Don't worry, I'm the only one eating this bao.

116
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,320
 It's slime in the middle.

117
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,480
 What kind of bao is it?

118
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,400
 Okay, I have to take a look, okay?

119
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,880

 (speaking in foreign language)

125
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:30,080

 (speaking in foreign language)

134
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:46,640
 Woo-hoo!

 Is that it?

160
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,520
 That's it.

161
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,360
 Bread.

162
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,440

164
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,480
 Bread and wine.

165

288
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

289
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:56,480

 (speaking in foreign language)

300
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,480

 (speaking in foreign language)

330
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:31,520
 It's really a bao, just doesn't have the bao in it.

331
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:35,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

332
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,360

 That's why (speaking in foreign language)

339
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:26,520
 Hey kids, Chinese time.

 (speaking in foreign language)

344
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,480
 But it's not easy.

345
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,400

 Sandy witch.

352
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,600
 So, (speaking in foreign language)

353
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:23,520
 That's why it's called a bao, right?

354
