1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
 to a happy Mother's Day.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,200
 Let me begin by a word of prayer.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,240
 I don't know what kind of spiritual condition

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:11,560
 or what kind of emotional condition

5
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:13,720
 you're coming into the presence of God,

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:18,680
 but I want you to focus on God himself.

7
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,880
 I want you to come in, not to see anyone else,

8
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:23,760
 but God himself, all right?

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,760
 And know that God is for you.

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,760
 Know that God is present with you, all right?

11
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,600
 Let's pray.

12
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:31,080
 Father, we want to praise you.

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,720
 We want to come before you and bow our knees.

14
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,160
 And I pray that you will be with us

15
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:41,840
 and help us to sense that you are with us,

16
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,080
 you are present with us.

17
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:46,040
 I pray for each and every one of us.

18
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:51,040
 Perhaps we have been fighting our battles

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,960
 in the past week, our past few weeks.

20
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,680
 We are fighting our worries.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,040
 We are dealing with our challenges.

22
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:03,600
 And sometimes our problems in our lives

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,440
 seem insurmountable.

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,720
 It seems so big.

25
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:12,360
 But we come before you, we know that you are bigger

26
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,880
 and you're biggest.

27
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,080
 You're bigger than anything else.

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,080
 And you got the whole wide world in your hand indeed.

29
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,360
 And we pray that you will help us to put our trust in you

30
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,600
 and know that you are still in control.

31
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,040
 You are still our king and our leader.

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:35,000
 Pray that you will forgive our sins,

33
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,760
 our shortcomings, our weaknesses.

34
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,800
 And we come before you anew,

35
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,600
 knowing that your grace is always new every single morning.

36
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:48,960
 So we pray that you will renew our commitment to you,

37
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,320
 our trust in you.

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,480
 No matter what barriers we are facing,

39
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:58,280
 we know that you are bigger than all those challenges.

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:03,200
 And I pray that you're all powerful,

41
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,520
 you're all knowing and your attributes will encourage us

42
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,520
 to rely on you because you are worthy of our following.

43
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:15,400
 So we pray that you will grant us grace

44
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:20,400
 to deal with our own depressed, unhappy,

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,800
 discomfort or discouragement.

46
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,800
 And I pray that you will encourage each and every one of us

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,600
 in the spirit to continue to believe and trust in you.

48
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,520
 Knowing that as we follow you,

49
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,000
 we need to deny ourselves, bear our crosses,

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 just like what your son Jesus has done for all of us.

51
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,880
 And I pray that we will be a community

52
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:47,800
 to encourage one another.

53
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,320
 As we have a Bible study together today,

54
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,280
 we pray that in the word we'll grow together.

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,080
 In the word we'll encourage one another

56
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,880
 to build up one another.

57
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,800
 Build up your church for your namesake, for your glory.

58
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,920
 Also wanna pray for the mothers in our midst.

59
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,480
 I pray that you will bless and grant grace

60
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,080
 to every one of them.

61
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,760
 Thank you for our mothers.

62
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,840
 Thank you for your divine appointment

63
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,080
 that we have only one mother

64
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,160
 and the perfect mother for all of us.

65
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,400
 And I pray that you will bless every one of them.

66
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,800
 And thank you for using them, our mothers,

67
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:34,160
 to extend your love, to show your love.

68
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,560
 Yes, we are all imperfect,

69
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,560
 but you have shown us the perfect love on the cross.

70
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,840
 And thank you, Jesus, in Christ, we pray.

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,600
 All right, today we're going to begin

72
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:52,760
 our new mini-series on the Apostles' Creek.

73
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,120
 Now, James has told us we have our daily devotion

74
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,680
 on the Apostles' Creek.

75
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,440
 So let's read this together.

76
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,560
 All right, let's read this together

77
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,560
 and go through this together.

78
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,520
 We have the whole Apostles' Creek on the screen.

79
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,520
 Now I want you to read this verse with the mentality,

80
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,160
 with the motive to evaluate what we really believe, okay?

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:24,800
 Sometimes when we go to church for a long time

82
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,720
 and we've been to church for some time,

83
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,480
 we have gotten what we truly believe

84
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,800
 or we have truncated our own belief.

85
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,600
 We might have thought or we have truncated our belief

86
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:41,880
 into just one or two things, and we make up our own idol.

87
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,600
 And in doing that, we are not believing the gospel anymore.

88
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:48,160
 And sometimes it is always good

89
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,040
 to reveal what we truly believe.

90
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,040
 And the Apostles' Creek is written for such a purpose

91
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:01,560
 so that we'll do a daily or regular check

92
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,160
 of what you really believe, all right?

93
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,000
 Just like you go to the doctor.

94
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,040
 Now tomorrow, I'll go to the doctor for a regular checkup,

95
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,280
 okay, nothing wrong with me.

96
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,240
 You just have to do it once a year.

97
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,440
 But the doctor will tell me, okay,

98
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,920
 your blood sugar level or your blood pressure

99
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,320
 or anything wrong with me,

100
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,560
 anything I need to pay attention to, right?

101
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,200
 So the Apostles' Creek is doing exactly

102
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,960
 this sort of purpose, to check your belief, okay?

103
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,120
 The Apostles' Creek, let me read the left column.

104
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,760
 I believe in God, the Father Almighty,

105
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,680
 creator of heaven and earth.

106
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,080
 I believe in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord.

107
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,840
 He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit

108
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,080
 and born of the Virgin Mary.

109
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,760
 He suffered under Pontius Pilate,

110
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,000
 was crucified, died, and was buried.

111
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,960
 He descended to the dead.

112
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,000
 On the third day, He rose again.

113
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,600
 He ascended into heaven

114
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,440
 and is seated at the right hand of the Father.

115
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,880
 He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

116
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:14,880
 I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Universal Church,

117
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,640
 the chameleon of saints, the forgiveness of sins,

118
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:23,220
 the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting, amen.

119
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,120
 This is the Apostles' Creek.

120
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,800
 Now, it's a quick summary

121
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,480
 to tell you what our basic belief is.

122
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,560
 Of course, it's not just that,

123
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,680
 but it's good enough summary

124
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,680
 to tell you what you truly believe,

125
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:42,040
 what are the central core beliefs, okay?

126
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,760
 Now, how many of you have been to Chicago for some time,

127
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,520
 for at least one year?

128
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:47,340
 How many of you?

129
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,880
 All right, no one is new to Chicago, right?

130
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,600
 Now, if someone bump into you

131
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,840
 and say maybe someone who's new to Chicago,

132
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:56,480
 first time in Chicago,

133
00:06:56,480 --> 00:07:00,640
 and if that someone or your friend is a tourist

134
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,240
 bump into you and ask you,

135
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,760
 hey, how do you get to downtown?

136
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,480
 Can you tell him right away?

137
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,320
 Can you?

138
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,280
 (audience laughing)

139
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,920
 Who cannot?

140
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:14,480
 Who can tell the someone

141
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,000
 that is the way from here to downtown?

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,280
 Who can say that?

143
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,800
 None of you?

144
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,080
 Jesus. (laughs)

145
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,360
 How do you get to downtown from here, right?

146
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,520
 You can probably, immediately,

147
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,680
 you can answer the question, right?

148
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,480
 Now, if you cannot,

149
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,600
 you probably are deceiving yourself, right?

150
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,320
 You haven't been to Chicago, right?

151
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:42,000
 Perhaps you are being isolated for so long in COVID

152
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,120
 so you don't know the way, all right?

153
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:47,120
 Now, it's kind of like that, a puzzle squeak.

154
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:50,280
 It's to tell us what the Bible is all about,

155
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,800
 what the gospel is all about.

156
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,960
 No one can actually read the Bible

157
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,880
 from cover to cover in one sitting.

158
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:03,440
 No one can understand every single detail in the Bible, okay?

159
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,040
 I have been teaching the Bible,

160
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,120
 I've been studying the Bible,

161
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,280
 I've been reading the Bible almost every single day, all right?

162
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,040
 There are still a lot of things that I don't understand,

163
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,400
 I don't comprehend, all right?

164
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,880
 Amen?

165
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,360
 Amen, right?

166
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,440
 So there are a lot of things

167
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,000
 that I still trying to figure out,

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:23,360
 and I'm struggling with the meaning,

169
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,840
 the significance of some of the Bible passages, right?

170
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,320
 We're gonna have a Bible study later.

171
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:32,960
 We are going into the book of Genesis,

172
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:37,800
 the story of Isaac and Jacob, right?

173
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:38,640
 Right?

174
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,480
 Isaac and Jacob.

175
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,840
 Some of the familiar stories,

176
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,640
 but there were a lot of details probably you don't know,

177
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,840
 or you have no idea that's in the Bible.

178
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,840
 So no one can really understand the Bible

179
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,880
 or comprehend every single thing from cover to cover.

180
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,840
 But the Apostles' Creed is to give us a quick summary

181
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:04,840
 to tell you and tell me what believing in Christ truly is.

182
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,200
 All right?

183
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,920
 Now I want you to think about it.

184
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,520
 When did you come to faith?

185
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,760
 When did you come to, you know,

186
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,800
 accept Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior?

187
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,640
 When?

188
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:18,720
 All right, think about that.

189
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,520
 How many years ago?

190
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:21,640
 What day?

191
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:23,760
 What year, what month, and what day?

192
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,200
 And what circumstances?

193
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,520
 That you come to know Christ.

194
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,600
 All right?

195
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,440
 Now, how long have you been a Christian?

196
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,320
 It's a very crucial thing you need to ask yourself.

197
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,200
 Okay?

198
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,480
 Now, think about how long you've been a Christian,

199
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,960
 how long you have known the gospel.

200
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,600
 Have you really known the gospel?

201
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,760
 In the past two years, because of COVID,

202
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,400
 many of the young families in our church, okay,

203
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,960
 including some of you,

204
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,680
 and including some of those in the previous worship service,

205
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,400
 I haven't been able to, you know, see them face to face.

206
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:06,800
 And I know maybe two years ago, all right,

207
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,440
 two years ago when the lockdown came,

208
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,240
 some of the young families actually had babies.

209
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,320
 They had baby.

210
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,920
 Or they had infant before, right before the lockdown.

211
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,760
 All right?

212
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,360
 But when the lockdown came,

213
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,200
 I was not able to see them, right?

214
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,240
 Now, as the pandemic is easing out, hopefully,

215
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,360
 fading out a little bit,

216
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,240
 and then I see them again, right?

217
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,240
 Now, I did not expect the baby remain baby, right?

218
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,240
 It would be terrible.

219
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,520
 After two years, if the newborn that I've seen

220
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:49,160
 before the lockdown two years ago,

221
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:53,400
 and then two years later, they remain baby, right?

222
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,280
 That would be terrible.

223
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,400
 I need to call 911.

224
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:59,520
 That would be so sad.

225
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,680
 So after two years, when they show up again,

226
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,480
 when they come back to the church, right?

227
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,480
 No longer just seeing each other on Zoom or online.

228
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,880
 They show up and they bring their young ones.

229
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,320
 They are, what do you think?

230
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,840
 Should be walking, right?

231
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:17,480
 They should be taller, right?

232
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,320
 They should be tallest.

233
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,480
 And indeed, they are now tallest, right?

234
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,120
 And for those who were two years old before the lockdown,

235
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,360
 now they are four years old, right?

236
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:29,600
 Now, it's a very natural thing to see growth, right?

237
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,120
 At least in the physical sense, right?

238
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:36,160
 At least in the physical sense, they got taller.

239
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,920
 They got bigger, right?

240
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,320
 Before the lockdown, they could not talk.

241
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,480
 Now, they at least, right?

242
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:47,800
 At least they can have a conversation, right?

243
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,520
 Now, it is the same thing, isn't it?

244
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:54,920
 For Christians, for us.

245
00:11:54,920 --> 00:12:00,280
 Rewind the tape, two years ago.

246
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,640
 Where were you spiritually?

247
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:05,200
 Where were you in your relationship with God?

248
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,920
 How was it?

249
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,840
 Now, two years later, where are you?

250
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,640
 What do you truly believe?

251
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,120
 And have you been growing, right?

252
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:23,960
 Now, let me give you a very broad brush,

253
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:28,960
 a very just big picture of our faith journey, right?

254
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:35,120
 There are some aspects I'm going to tell you

255
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,600
 that if you know Christ,

256
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,520
 if you come to believe in the gospel,

257
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:45,560
 these aspects, you should see some growth, okay?

258
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,520
 The first one is your habit, all right?

259
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,560
 Your time management.

260
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,520
 Before you came to Christ, you were your own boss, right?

261
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:57,840
 Every single day, 24/7, you were your own boss.

262
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
 How do I use my time, right?

263
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,360
 How do I use every single minute that I have?

264
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,720
 After you know Christ, Christ is on the seat

265
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,720
 of ownership in our lives, right?

266
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,280
 He died on the cross to redeem us,

267
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,800
 and our life belongs to him.

268
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,520
 Habit.

269
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,160
 So two years ago, we went back, all right?

270
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,240
 Or how many years ago you come to know faith,

271
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,240
 come to know Christ?

272
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:30,040
 Your habits should have changed, right?

273
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,800
 In the, at least in the fundamental way, right?

274
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:38,760
 Before you know Christ, you used your time,

275
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:42,440
 you were your own boss, but after you know Christ,

276
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,920
 you need to relate to God.

277
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,160
 You need to build your relationship with God.

278
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,040
 You need to relate to him.

279
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,520
 Have you been reading the word of God

280
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,480
 or getting a better understanding?

281
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,280
 Better, remember, the emphasis is better.

282
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:57,040
 Have you been getting a better understanding

283
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,920
 of the word of God?

284
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,600
 Are you getting closer to God himself?

285
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,320
 Are you getting closer to the Lord and Savior?

286
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:08,480
 Week by week, we come to worship.

287
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,440
 It's not because we, there's a checkbox

288
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,440
 in our weekly activities.

289
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,320
 There's checkbox, okay, all right, I got it done, all right?

290
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,840
 And then I just put it aside.

291
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:25,160
 We come to worship because we bow before the true Lord,

292
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:26,040
 the true King.

293
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,480
 As believers, we are moving,

294
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,400
 should be moving in a progress.

295
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,320
 From seeker, before you know Christ,

296
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,880
 you may be interested in the gospel,

297
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,120
 may be interested in the church stuff,

298
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,200
 and you come and you try to listen,

299
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,200
 try to understand what Christian faith is all about.

300
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:50,000
 From seeker, you move on to a spiritual child,

301
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,040
 and then you move on to a spiritual adult,

302
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,400
 young adult or older adult.

303
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,760
 And then you should move on to become a leader, right?

304
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:05,840
 That is your faith journey.

305
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,680
 That is how your faith journey should be.

306
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,480
 So at least there are fundamental change in your habit,

307
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,080
 in your time management, how do you use your life

308
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,760
 and your hours and your minute, right?

309
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,880
 Second, it's your relationship.

310
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,120
 Relationship with other sisters and brothers in Christ,

311
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,040
 right?

312
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,560
 Interestingly, the Bible always tells us

313
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,080
 there were tons of verses that is about one and other.

314
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,800
 It's about community.

315
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,560
 When we come to know faith,

316
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,280
 we call each other brother and sisters

317
00:15:42,280 --> 00:15:45,240
 or family members in Christ, right?

318
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,480
 And this family, this spiritual family,

319
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,740
 is above all the most important thing.

320
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,120
 God will continue His redemptive work on earth

321
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,840
 through the church, not through the angels,

322
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,280
 not through the government, not through other agencies,

323
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,440
 but through the church, through the people of God.

324
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,240
 That is us, right?

325
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,400
 It's not about numbers.

326
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,120
 Remember in the first century,

327
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:16,600
 when you opened the pages of the New Testament,

328
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:21,600
 the churches that we encounter in Corinth, in Ephesus,

329
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,240
 in every single city in the Roman Empire,

330
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,160
 they were the small group church.

331
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,920
 They're very, very small, tiny cell churches.

332
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,920
 But God's plan is to use the church to extend His kingdom,

333
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,440
 extend His rule.

334
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:41,920
 How do we tell the gospel to the rest of the world?

335
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,760
 God did not use angels.

336
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:45,720
 God could have,

337
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:52,120
 but God choose to use His churches in every generation.

338
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,200
 So relationship-wise,

339
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,560
 we should have some fundamental change.

340
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,560
 There was some basic reconfiguration in our relationship

341
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,120
 when we come to know Christ.

342
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:06,800
 Now, before we came to know Christ,

343
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,000
 church is nothing to us.

344
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Maybe there's a cool thing, maybe there's a good thing,

345
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,480
 some sort of institute in the society

346
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,360
 that would help people to do better things or good things.

347
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,200
 But when we come to know faith, we truly know faith,

348
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,840
 there should be some fundamental change

349
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,640
 in how we see the church.

350
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,240
 Church becomes our priority.

351
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:31,000
 Third, your emotional life.

352
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:36,120
 There should be emotional growth in your own life as well.

353
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,640
 We know Christ through the gospel.

354
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,200
 We know that we are truly loved by God Himself.

355
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,360
 We're truly loved by the unconditional grace of God.

356
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,460
 Then we should learn, you know, in the progress,

357
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:56,400
 I am fully accepted by God Himself,

358
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:00,100
 and that is how I anchor my identity.

359
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:06,940
 My value, my dignity, is not defined by my popularity.

360
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,560
 It's not by how many friends I have.

361
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:12,180
 It's not by how much money I earn.

362
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:15,280
 It's not by my social status.

363
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:18,320
 My emotional growth should go from

364
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,800
 before I came to know Christ, it was unsecure.

365
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,860
 I'm trying to find things to anchor my identity.

366
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:30,720
 The figures on your paycheck, how big is your house, right?

367
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,280
 How much things do you own?

368
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,680
 How many friends do you have?

369
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:38,640
 How popular are you on IG or on Facebook

370
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,580
 or anything like that?

371
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:42,400
 That was before Christ.

372
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,960
 Now, after Christ, you came to know Christ,

373
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:49,960
 your emotional life should be always growing

374
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:54,960
 in light of the gospel, in light of how Christ loves us.

375
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:58,240
 Because Christ loves us unconditionally,

376
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,920
 then I am a secure individual.

377
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,920
 No matter how popular I am, no matter how unpopular I am,

378
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,140
 I know that I'm fully accepted by Christ, right?

379
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:16,140
 Now, since two years ago, because of the lockdown,

380
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,920
 because of the COVID, we have gone online, right?

381
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,600
 Now, you should know, right?

382
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,800
 Once you go online, your videos

383
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,320
 or whatever sermon you preach, right?

384
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,420
 Now it becomes something permanent, right?

385
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:37,200
 Now, I always get some comments on YouTube, right?

386
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,720
 Many, I would say, are positive.

387
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,320
 But quite a few are negative.

388
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,440
 Quite a few are negative, right?

389
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,120
 I've come to know this reality, right?

390
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,360
 This is the way it is, right?

391
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,720
 That's the world we live in, right?

392
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,720
 Now, in the beginning, you may feel very uncomfortable

393
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,120
 with some negative comments, right?

394
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:12,800
 Made by some users, made by some customers, right?

395
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,040
 Religious customers, that they have no commitment to you,

396
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:16,880
 right?

397
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,560
 They are somewhere else, I don't know where they are, right?

398
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,600
 They may be in Africa, they may be in Asia,

399
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,880
 they may be in Chicago, but they make some comments, right?

400
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,280
 They make some critical comments.

401
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:29,480
 And then you kind of, you know,

402
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
 you don't feel good about it, all right?

403
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:37,640
 But if you are totally secure in Christ,

404
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:42,440
 all you do in your worship, in your service,

405
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,240
 in everything that you do,

406
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,240
 you are securely anchor your value,

407
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:53,480
 your identity, your dignity in Christ alone.

408
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:56,440
 Then all these comments, will he, doesn't matter.

409
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,880
 You know what I'm saying?

410
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,600
 People can criticize you,

411
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:07,600
 or people can give you some negative feedback.

412
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:11,560
 But that should give you, you know,

413
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,440
 motives to improve even further, right?

414
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,560
 But you don't doubt yourself.

415
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,400
 You don't doubt your own identity,

416
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,960
 because I am truly anchor in Christ himself, right?

417
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,800
 Emotional growth.

418
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:30,520
 And then there's a purpose, fundamental change,

419
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,920
 in your purpose of your life.

420
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:37,600
 Your general, overall orientation of your life.

421
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,880
 Before you know Christ, you're all by yourself.

422
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,680
 You're living your own life,

423
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,160
 according to your own agendas.

424
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,480
 Now you belong to Christ.

425
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:52,320
 And the New Testament continues to emphasize one fact,

426
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:56,200
 that Christ has redeemed you on the cross,

427
00:21:56,200 --> 00:22:00,200
 with a great price, and you belong to him.

428
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,800
 And your life and your mission is to glorify him,

429
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:08,000
 is to extend his kingdom, to share the gospel.

430
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:11,680
 God is using you in your own way,

431
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:14,160
 that nobody else can replace you.

432
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:18,960
 And you are executing God's own mission,

433
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,640
 to glorify God in your career, in your family,

434
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,640
 in your community, in your neighborhood.

435
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,560
 That is a fundamental change in your purpose of your life.

436
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,600
 Finally, your understanding.

437
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,880
 Your understanding of the gospel.

438
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,160
 You know, what Christianity is all about.

439
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,200
 What does Jesus think it's all about?

440
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,720
 Before you know Christ, you probably were a seeker.

441
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:48,720
 You were beginners.

442
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,880
 After you came to know the gospel,

443
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,160
 you should have a better understanding,

444
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:56,800
 until you get a very solid understanding

445
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,840
 of what the gospel is.

446
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,320
 Now remember what I asked you very beginning,

447
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,000
 the first question, the way in Chicago, right?

448
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,320
 The way in Chicago.

449
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,840
 You have been in Chicago for some time,

450
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:11,180
 and you're familiar with the city, right?

451
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,760
 You can show other people the way.

452
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,960
 Now, I wanna apply this question to the Christian faith.

453
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,480
 If someone you bump into, know nothing about the gospel,

454
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,800
 and he asked you or she asked you,

455
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:25,640
 what this Christian thing is all about, right?

456
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,600
 How do I get there, right?

457
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,040
 How do I get to know Jesus?

458
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,760
 What is the way?

459
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:35,520
 Can you tell the person?

460
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,440
 Immediately, right away.

461
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,720
 Now what I'm saying is,

462
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,480
 not only you should get a better understanding yourself,

463
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,560
 you should be able to explain it,

464
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:49,400
 to tell other people, right?

465
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,200
 If you cannot tell other people,

466
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,240
 hey, what is the way to God, right?

467
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,600
 Then you probably have some work to do, right?

468
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:59,680
 And I encourage you to do that, right?

469
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:05,000
 So, these are some of the aspects

470
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,400
 that we need to ask ourselves.

471
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,280
 Our habit, how we use our time.

472
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,520
 Relationship, we configure in such a way

473
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:17,240
 that we'll enhance the kingdom work of God.

474
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:21,560
 The emotional growth for yourself,

475
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,800
 for your understanding of the gospel.

476
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,160
 Are you making progress?

477
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,840
 Are you making any progress?

478
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,080
 Are you making any step forward

479
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,560
 in your faith, in your faith journey?

480
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,320
 The book of Hebrews, one of the New Testament letters

481
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,480
 written by a pastor to the church.

482
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:48,400
 Most of them were Jewish Christians.

483
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,280
 512, he says, "For though by this time,

484
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:54,920
 "you ought to be teachers."

485
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:57,720
 You need someone to teach you again and again

486
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:00,720
 the basic principles of the oracles of God.

487
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,960
 "You need milk, not solid food.

488
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,920
 "For everyone who lives on milk is unskilled

489
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:12,840
 "in the word of righteousness, for he is a child.

490
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
 "But solid food is for the mature,

491
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,440
 "for those who have the powers of discernment,

492
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,680
 "trained by constant practice

493
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,880
 "to distinguish good from evil.

494
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,600
 "Therefore, let us leave the elementary doctrine,

495
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:33,920
 "the basic doctrine of Christ, and go on to maturity,

496
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:38,880
 "not laying again a foundation of repentance

497
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,960
 "from that work and all that."

498
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,800
 Foundation of faith toward God.

499
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,360
 We don't need the foundation anymore

500
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,760
 because you got the foundation already.

501
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,040
 You see the progress here?

502
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,400
 Back then, you should be having milk, right?

503
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,120
 It's like a baby.

504
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,640
 Well, you need a milk bottle to feed yourself.

505
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,760
 You cannot have solid food.

506
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,240
 But now, two years later at least, right?

507
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,960
 Two years later, you came to know Christ

508
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,280
 at least two years later before lockdown,

509
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,440
 before the pandemics.

510
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,040
 Are you making progress?

511
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,800
 Or you're still having spiritual milk?

512
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:19,320
 You should be taking solid food, right?

513
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:23,280
 Otherwise, that would be strange, right?

514
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,760
 It would be strange.

515
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:27,680
 Year after year, you're still staying

516
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,440
 at the elementary level.

517
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:32,200
 We cannot do that.

518
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:35,000
 The pastor says, "You need to make progress.

519
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:37,680
 "Stop making excuse in your life."

520
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:41,400
 You know, we always have our own reasons.

521
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,040
 Hey, I wanna postpone this or postpone that, right?

522
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:50,120
 God is our priority, and you should be making progress.

523
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:54,480
 Now, as I told you, no one can really comprehend the Bible

524
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,640
 cover to cover in one sentence.

525
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,200
 Nobody can.

526
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,200
 Now, of course, to be honest,

527
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,440
 the simple message of the gospel is easy to understand,

528
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,280
 right?

529
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,520
 A three-year-old, four-year-old can understand.

530
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:08,720
 God sold off the world, John 3:16.

531
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,760
 Everyone can understand the elementary doctrine,

532
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:15,040
 but we are not called to stay the same, right?

533
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,760
 That is why we have the Apostles' Creek.

534
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:21,440
 The Apostles' Creek is a quick summary,

535
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:26,240
 a useful summary of Christianity in 12 sentences,

536
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:29,560
 12 statements, and the creek itself,

537
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,360
 Apostles' Creek, has been around for 1,800 years.

538
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,200
 Can you believe that?

539
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,240
 1,800 years, 1,800 years.

540
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:41,600
 Even the Roman Empire did not last that long.

541
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,120
 1,800 years, since AD 200-something,

542
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:50,360
 we had the most basic form of the Apostles' Creek.

543
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:55,320
 Of course, it was not written by the first apostles.

544
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,080
 It was the rule of faith laid down by the early church,

545
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:01,000
 the first century church,

546
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:04,720
 or the second generation of the Christians.

547
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,680
 And because it goes back to a generation or two

548
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:12,160
 after the first apostles of Jesus,

549
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,560
 we call it Apostles' Creek.

550
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,840
 Now, when we go through the Apostles' Creek,

551
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:19,440
 there were a little, here and there,

552
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,480
 I want you to understand what it is all about,

553
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,040
 Apostles' Creek.

554
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,120
 Now, you can imagine in the first century,

555
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,680
 when the Christian church just started,

556
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,480
 they need some standard of faith

557
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,320
 for the Christians to grasp,

558
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,480
 so that they understand what the true gospel is all about.

559
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
 If you don't have the right content, you cannot grow.

560
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:51,080
 As I said, we truncate, or we reduce the faith

561
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,840
 into one or two things,

562
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,720
 you cannot grow strong as a Christian.

563
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:00,960
 Couple weeks ago, Steve, remember that guy?

564
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:05,480
 Steve, he talk about the letter to the Ephesians.

565
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,400
 Right at the beginning, he said,

566
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,600
 we need to love our Lord, our God,

567
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,560
 with all our heart and all our soul,

568
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:17,760
 and all our mind, right?

569
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,560
 Your thinking.

570
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:22,280
 If your thinking is wrong, is truncated,

571
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:25,680
 you cannot relate to God, all right?

572
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:30,680
 Now, let's read the first sentence of the Apostles' Creek.

573
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,880
 Okay?

574
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,440
 It says, "I believe in God, the Father Almighty,

575
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,960
 "Creator of heavens and earth."

576
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:44,000
 Did you hear that?

577
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:48,440
 I believe in God, the Father Almighty.

578
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,640
 Let me unpack that.

579
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:57,640
 First, faith, in the biblical sense,

580
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,760
 faith is not making something true.

581
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:05,120
 Faith is not making something true.

582
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,400
 Faith is affirming something that is true.

583
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,320
 Okay?

584
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:14,080
 Okay, let's do some intellectual exercise.

585
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,880
 Faith, believe in Christ, believe in the gospel.

586
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,200
 Faith is not making something true.

587
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:24,120
 Faith is affirming something that is already true.

588
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,920
 How many of you believe in ghost?

589
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:31,440
 How many of you are afraid of ghost?

590
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,520
 All right, how many of you believe in ghost?

591
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:34,800
 You believe in ghost, right?

592
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:37,920
 I believe in ghost because the Bible tells me so, right?

593
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,560
 You believe in ghost,

594
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:44,880
 have you ever hunt one of those?

595
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,280
 You go out to the haunting house and hunt one of the ghost?

596
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,080
 No, right?

597
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:54,800
 It stays in the intellectual level.

598
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,440
 You can believe in something, something that exists,

599
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,360
 the existence of something or someone,

600
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,400
 but you don't have the relationship.

601
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:10,480
 It's all a matter of intellectual only.

602
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,880
 That is how the apostles' quick begins.

603
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,880
 I believe, I believe means not just intellectual checkbox.

604
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,000
 I believe means I am believing into God.

605
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,600
 I'm committing on myself to the relationship of God.

606
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,200
 Now, how many of you know my wife?

607
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:37,120
 How many of you know my wife exists?

608
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,880
 She really does, she really does, okay?

609
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,760
 Even though sometimes I ignore it, all right?

610
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,440
 She really does exist, she really does exist.

611
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,160
 But the fact that you believe my wife exists

612
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,240
 doesn't mean you are committed to her, right?

613
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,800
 For me, it's a totally different thing.

614
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:01,840
 I believe she exists and I commit to her, right?

615
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,680
 You see the difference?

616
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,960
 Now, the Bible has two parts,

617
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:11,040
 the Old Testament and the New Testament, right?

618
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:14,000
 Have you ever wondered why there's a word testament there?

619
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,240
 The word testament comes from Greek word

620
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,920
 and that means covenant.

621
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:25,080
 It is a lifelong commitment, right?

622
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,360
 It's the same thing as intellectually,

623
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,720
 I know my wife exists,

624
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,760
 but in terms of life, in terms of my life commitment,

625
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,720
 I am committing myself to her,

626
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,680
 not just affirming she exists only,

627
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:44,480
 but I'm committing to her, right?

628
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,880
 I believe in God, the Father Almighty,

629
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:53,360
 means that I'm not just affirming the existence of God.

630
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,720
 There's no use, right?

631
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,160
 It doesn't impact your life.

632
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:01,600
 I believe in God, the Almighty,

633
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,080
 means I'm committing myself to Him.

634
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,800
 So the Christian faith is not about

635
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,120
 affirming the existence of God, right?

636
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,440
 I would be totally comfortable

637
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,200
 if someone check in our church,

638
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,200
 what do you believe in?

639
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,040
 What you don't believe in.

640
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,920
 If he asks what I don't believe in,

641
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,240
 what the church does not affirm,

642
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:27,080
 I would be totally comfortable to answer and say,

643
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,200
 we do not affirm the existence of God.

644
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,840
 Yes, we don't,

645
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,280
 but we affirm the God who exists and relate to us.

646
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,720
 You see, there's a total different thing, right?

647
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:44,760
 Many people come to faith thinking,

648
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,480
 oh, this is an intellectual checkbox.

649
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,880
 I believe in the existence of God,

650
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,520
 but it doesn't really impact your life.

651
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,600
 You're not believing in the biblical sense.

652
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,480
 You believe the God who commit himself to you.

653
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,560
 His son died for you on the cross,

654
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:05,200
 and that's why you believe in God who exists.

655
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,320
 It's a totally different thing

656
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,840
 than affirming the existence of God only.

657
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:11,720
 You see the difference?

658
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:14,680
 Genesis 1.1.

659
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:18,920
 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

660
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:23,720
 In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.

661
00:34:23,720 --> 00:34:26,440
 You open the pages of the Bible.

662
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:30,120
 Do you find it interesting?

663
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:32,560
 There's no intellectual argument in the Bible

664
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:36,320
 that you can find that would prove the existence of God.

665
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:38,840
 The Bible doesn't waste time doing that.

666
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,560
 The Bible simply assume,

667
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,720
 simply presuppose that only with God everything exists,

668
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:52,720
 only because of God himself, everything works.

669
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:56,920
 On this presupposition, you have to choose

670
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,680
 whether you come to faith in this God, creator, or not.

671
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:04,240
 That is what the Apostle Creeks is all about.

672
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,920
 So you open the pages of the Bible.

673
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,720
 You're always confronted with the God who created you,

674
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,880
 the God who exists,

675
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,320
 and he rules over the entire cosmos,

676
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,640
 entire life of yours.

677
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:25,000
 And what is your relationship with God who created you?

678
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
 You owe your life to him.

679
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,960
 How do you relate to this God?

680
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:36,920
 You're always confronted with this cosmic question.

681
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,880
 Who is God to you?

682
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:42,080
 Now what does it mean to believe in God?

683
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:42,920
 I believe.

684
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,480
 It means for us today that I will worship God and God alone.

685
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,840
 I show that in my use of time,

686
00:35:55,840 --> 00:36:00,600
 in my emotional status,

687
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,640
 in my configuration with the church, with other people.

688
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,720
 You cannot be double-minded.

689
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:13,040
 You gotta put your entire trust in him.

690
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,080
 And secondly, what does it mean for us

691
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,360
 when we say I believe?

692
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:21,240
 I will continue to seek God's will

693
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:23,640
 in all the decisions in my life.

694
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:29,400
 You ask God whether I should do this or do that.

695
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,400
 You always have that in your mind.

696
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,120
 Whether I should wake up today to worship him or not.

697
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,560
 I'm always confronted with this question.

698
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,560
 I set my orientation of my life to please God himself.

699
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,840
 And thirdly, it means I'm making a commitment

700
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:53,840
 to know God and know him better every day.

701
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,040
 I'm making a commitment to him.

702
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:59,480
 That is what it means I believe, all right?

703
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:06,200
 Let's end with doing the Apostles' Creed.

704
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:07,520
 Let's recite it.

705
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,760
 Let's all stand together.

706
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,280
 And then we'll close by prayer.

707
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,120
 Let's all stand.

708
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:18,560
 We're gonna read the English only,

709
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:21,040
 but you can do the other language if you want.

710
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,840
 Apostles' Creed, let's do it together.

711
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:29,160
 I believe in God, the Father Almighty,

712
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,440
 creator of heaven and earth.

713
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,160
 I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.

714
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:38,720
 He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit

715
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,920
 and born of the Virgin Mary.

716
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,240
 He suffered under Pontius Pilate,

717
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,280
 was crucified, died, and was buried.

718
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,240
 He descended to the dead.

719
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,480
 On the third day, he rose again.

720
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,000
 He ascended into heaven and is seated

721
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,920
 at the right hand of the Father.

722
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:58,440
 He will come again to judge the living and the dead.

723
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:02,680
 I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy universal church,

724
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:06,440
 the chameleon of saints, the forgiveness of sins,

725
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:10,200
 the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting.

726
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,560
 Amen.

727
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:12,760
 Let's all pray together.

728
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:16,760
 Father, thank you for the opportunity to get to know you.

729
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,960
 And I pray that every single one of us

730
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,640
 will make progress in our faith,

731
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,920
 to get to know you, to get to know your power.

732
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,640
 I pray that you will help us to commit ourselves into you,

733
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:38,120
 as you have committed yourself into us.

734
00:38:38,120 --> 00:38:42,280
 You show us on the cross, you show us on the empty tomb

735
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,240
 that you are the Lord and Savior.

736
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,720
 And I pray that our belief will continue to grow,

737
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:51,640
 how we see ourselves, how we see the world,

738
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,640
 how we see you as our king and our Savior.

739
00:38:55,640 --> 00:39:00,160
 So I pray that you will exercise your lordship in our lives.

740
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:03,720
 Yes, we face a lot of different problems in our lives.

741
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:07,200
 Our own personal growth, our own personal career,

742
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:11,320
 our relationship, our family, our future.

743
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:15,800
 But we know that you above all, you are God alone.

744
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,240
 And I pray that we will make our commitment into you

745
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,440
 and we'll grow into your word.

746
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:24,240
 And I pray that as we gather to study your word,

747
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,840
 your spirit will continue to speak to us,

748
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:31,840
 to build us up, that we will be a solid Christians,

749
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:35,040
 we will be solid church that will please you

750
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,560
 and worship you.

751
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,720
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

752
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,920
 Well, you may be seated.
