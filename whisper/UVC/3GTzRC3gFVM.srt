1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 On this Christmas Sunday, I'm sure if you reveal what has happened to you this year,

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:12,000
 it's going to be probably a very busy day for you, very busy year for you.

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:23,840
 [Chinese]

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,760
 Perhaps this year has been a very, very tough year for you.

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
 [Cantonese]

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,360
 For many of us at UV, it has been a challenging year.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:45,040
 You know, we have families dealing with sickness, dealing with death and crisis and difficulties,

8
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:50,560
 and our ministries are also tackling with different challenges, and in general,

9
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:53,920
 I think there are so many stresses in our life.

10
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:22,960
 [Cantonese]

11
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,360
 So I pray that the songs that we offer to you, the song that we are going to sing,

12
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:38,320
 the Christmas songs, the baptism testimony, the candle lighting ceremony that we're going to do

13
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,040
 later, will all remind you the real meaning of Christmas.

14
00:01:44,320 --> 00:02:12,960
 [Cantonese]

15
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,160
 Let me read this passage on screen.

16
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,080
 It is taken from the Bible, the Gospel of Luke, from chapter 2.

17
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,120
 [Cantonese]

18
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:33,760
 Here, the angelic choir is announcing the good news, the good news of the birth of our Savior,

19
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,840
 to the shepherds in the field in Bethlehem, the very good news of the birth of our Savior,

20
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,560
 Jesus Christ.

21
00:02:40,560 --> 00:03:02,960
 [Cantonese]

22
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:09,280
 Suddenly, the angel was joined by the vast host of other angels, the armies of heaven.

23
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,800
 They praised God and they say, "Glory to God in highest heaven,

24
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:19,280
 peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased."

25
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:34,480
 [Cantonese]

26
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:44,080
 Now, one of the Christmas traditions many Americans would do is to watch some movie,

27
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,120
 some Christmas movie.

28
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:57,920
 [Cantonese]

29
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
 And I don't know if you do that or not.

30
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,280
 [Cantonese]

31
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:06,720
 But, you know, many of the families, American families, will be watching

32
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,520
 Charlie Brown Christmas this season.

33
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:23,120
 [Cantonese]

34
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
 How many of you have watched this before?

35
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:27,200
 Charlie Brown Christmas?

36
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,760
 Raise your hand.

37
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,840
 Only a handful, okay?

38
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:30,560
 Only a handful.

39
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,600
 [Cantonese]

40
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,960
 All right, so in this movie, Charlie Brown, the main character,

41
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,040
 is doing his best to organize a Christmas play with the kids.

42
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:57,040
 [Cantonese]

43
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:06,560
 But as you can tell, Charlie Brown is trying to organize this play with other kids and

44
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,680
 kids are not listening to you, right?

45
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,800
 They run around and no one in the story is listening to Charlie Brown.

46
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,920
 And everyone starts to criticize Charlie Brown for his, you know,

47
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,680
 lack of organization or lack of leadership.

48
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:31,760
 So Charlie was very frustrated and nobody understands the real meaning of Christmas.

49
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:35,600
 So at the end, Charlie Brown almost gave up.

50
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:48,400
 [Cantonese]

51
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,960
 And by the way, we have some kids joining us today, which is great, right?

52
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,520
 This is great.

53
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,920
 They're noisy, they're running around, they're joyful and they want to express themselves.

54
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,120
 So as the story goes, Charlie Brown was very frustrated.

55
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:16,560
 [Cantonese]

56
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,360
 However, at the end, as the story goes, with all the chaos with the kids,

57
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:27,440
 Charlie Brown has a very wise friend called Ninus.

58
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:34,320
 So Ninus steps in and Ninus has always been a timid, shy, and, you know,

59
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,280
 less than confident character, less than confident kid in the story.

60
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:51,280
 [Cantonese]

61
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:00,960
 And that's why you, whenever you see Ninus in Charlie Brown stories or movies,

62
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:06,880
 Ninus has always has a security blanket in his hand.

63
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:14,240
 Okay, ring the bell, remind of this character, always has a security blanket in his hand.

64
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:23,040
 But, Ninus volunteered himself to tell the story of the Bible and the true meaning of Christmas

65
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,000
 under the spotlight.

66
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:44,000
 [Cantonese]

67
00:07:44,000 --> 00:08:02,880
 [Cantonese]

68
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,560
 Do you want to watch this movie?

69
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,880
 [Cantonese]

70
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:09,760
 Okay, I'll let you watch two minutes.

71
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:13,760
 [Cantonese]

72
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:24,160
 Okay, so we're going to watch two minutes of the most, most spectacular moment in this entire movie.

73
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:34,160
 [Cantonese]

74
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:35,360
 What about Charlie Brown?

75
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:42,720
 Do you enjoy the movie?

76
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,200
 Two minutes.

77
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,600
 [Cantonese]

78
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,040
 Now, I want to tell you guys, there's one little detail, one little detail in this clip,

79
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,720
 most of the people missed.

80
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:58,640
 [Cantonese]

81
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,840
 And that one little detail is that right in the middle of Ninus telling the story of Christmas

82
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,880
 from the Bible, telling other people the real meaning of Christmas, a child is born.

83
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,120
 You see, Ninus actually dropped his security blanket.

84
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:33,840
 [Cantonese]

85
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,640
 Now, I'm sure we all have our security blankets.

86
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:42,160
 [Cantonese]

87
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:51,120
 Things that give you peace, things that give you security, things that give you confidence.

88
00:09:51,120 --> 00:10:03,840
 [Cantonese]

89
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:14,400
 Maybe our bank account, the money that we have, our friends, our career, our identity,

90
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,040
 or some sort of certainty in our future.

91
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:31,040
 [Cantonese]

92
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:42,080
 And we all try to grab that thing, you know, or some things that will give us everlasting peace,

93
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:47,280
 to give us a little bit more peace, a little bit more, you know, confidence.

94
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:55,280
 But as you know, in reality, those things do not last.

95
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,880
 They often disappoint us.

96
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:15,840
 [Cantonese]

97
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:22,000
 Maybe health, maybe our well-being, maybe our future, our security, whatever that is,

98
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,240
 your security blanket.

99
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:36,720
 [Cantonese]

100
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,560
 And I want to tell you, you know, they often disappoint us.

101
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,560
 Nothing can be guaranteed.

102
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:50,800
 [Cantonese]

103
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,520
 Now, what Christmas is all about is a different kind of peace.

104
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,160
 It's a different kind of peace.

105
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,360
 It's a true, everlasting peace.

106
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,960
 It's peace with God our Father.

107
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:19,840
 [Cantonese]

108
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:30,080
 Peace in times of chaos, peace in times of difficulty, peace in times of challenge,

109
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:33,440
 knowing that God is with us.

110
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,440
 God is always with us in Jesus Christ.

111
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:49,440
 [Cantonese]

112
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,040
 And that is the everlasting peace.

113
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,040
 [Cantonese]

114
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,320
 The real meaning of Christmas.

115
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:12,880
 Glory to God in the highest heaven and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.

116
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:20,160
 [Cantonese]

117
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:28,000
 And the people that God is pleased with are those who have put their faith in Christ Jesus.

118
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:38,800
 [Cantonese]

119
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,520
 So how can we receive the gift of God in Christ Jesus?

120
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:48,640
 [Cantonese]

121
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,080
 Well, first thing we have to do is to let go.

122
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:57,600
 If you want to receive a gift, you have to receive it with open hands.

123
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:06,000
 But if we are holding on to our security blankets, our stuff, you know, our hands are not open

124
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:11,040
 and our hearts are not open, then we cannot receive the gift of God.

125
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:19,040
 [Cantonese]

126
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,600
 [Cantonese]

127
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:51,600
 [Cantonese]

128
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,200
 So how can you receive the gift of God?

129
00:14:55,200 --> 00:15:00,960
 Only by your hands not holding on to your security blankets.

130
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:14,160
 [Cantonese]

131
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,120
 How can we experience the gift of God if our hearts are filled with overwhelm

132
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,000
 with our stuff and our idols, our work, our overwhelmingly busy schedule?

133
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,800
 We etch out God in our life.

134
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,320
 The only way we can receive the gift of God is that we let go of this stuff.

135
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:42,160
 And with an open heart, we come to God and say, "Thank you for giving me the very son of yours."

136
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,160
 [Cantonese]

137
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:56,560
 [Cantonese]

138
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:02,400
 So at the end, I want to invite you, all of you, to take this moment,

139
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:10,240
 take this very moment to reconnect, to reconnect with God.

140
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,840
 God who created you, God who loves you, God who is always with you.

141
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:28,400
 [Cantonese]

142
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:36,400
 [Cantonese]

143
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:42,400
 [Cantonese]

144
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:58,400
 [Cantonese]

145
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:03,280
 Now let me read this prayer first before we recite it together.

146
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:08,800
 So I want to invite you to recite it with, you know, with your words or with your heart.

147
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:30,800
 [Cantonese]

148
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,800
 Dear Lord Jesus, the prayer says,

149
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,800
 I ask you to grant me peace.

150
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:42,800
 Peace in my heart when I feel, when it feels like the world all around us spins out of control.

151
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,800
 Help me stay focused on you.

152
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,800
 The son of God, born in a humble manger.

153
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:56,800
 I come to you, God, with an open heart.

154
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:00,800
 I know my need for your grace and your forgiveness.

155
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,800
 I ask you to be my savior and my Lord.

156
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,800
 Cleanse me from my sins and make me new today.

157
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:12,800
 Fill me with your peace and guide me in your way.

158
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,800
 In Jesus' name.

159
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:20,800
 [Cantonese]

160
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,800
 [Cantonese]

161
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,800
 [Cantonese]

162
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,800
 [Cantonese]

163
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:44,800
 [Cantonese]

164
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:50,800
 [Cantonese]

165
00:18:50,800 --> 00:19:02,800
 [Cantonese]

166
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,800
 Let's end today's service with the lighting ceremony.

167
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:12,800
 We're going to pass the flame to the candles.

168
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,800
 But we want to end and conclude with this prayer.

169
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:20,800
 Well, let's do it in English first.

170
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:24,800
 If you want to join me, go ahead, all right?

171
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:27,800
 But you can pray in your heart as well.

172
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,800
 Let's do that.

173
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,800
 Dear Lord Jesus, I ask you to grant me peace.

174
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:38,800
 Peace in my heart when it feels like the world all around us spins out of control.

175
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,800
