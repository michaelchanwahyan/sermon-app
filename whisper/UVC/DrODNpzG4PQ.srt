1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,800
 Well, today we have our guest speaker, our youth minister,

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,500
 Sammy, to give us the word.

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,300
 We want to welcome her.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:08,580
 All right.

5
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:15,280
 OK.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,920
 That was such a sweet. Nathan, wow.

7
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,320
 Yeah. What a crew.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,320
 I was blessed by that.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,400
 So last time I was here preaching at Urban Voice,

10
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,440
 I talked about how Jesus says I am the bread of life.

11
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,300
 And I mentioned how there are seven I am statements in the book of John.

12
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:40,800
 And I'm going to continue on that train today.

13
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,040
 And I want to talk to us today about how Jesus calls himself

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,520
 the good shepherd later in John.

15
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,020
 I'm really excited to be with you all today.

16
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,260
 I've been thinking a lot about how in the book of Haggai,

17
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,920
 which is this really small

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,000
 prophetic book in the Old Testament,

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,800
 God asked the prophet Haggai and the people of God

20
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,200
 at the time to consider their ways together.

21
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,440
 I've been reflecting on what a privilege it is to be here in this community

22
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,600
 with each one of you

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,280
 to consider our ways under the authority of God's word together.

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,140
 So I'm really thrilled to be here with you.

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,080
 And I've also been thinking a lot about why it's important

26
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,820
 to talk about who God says he is.

27
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,020
 It can be said that all sin in our lives is rooted in a lie

28
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,260
 that either God is not who he says he is or we are not who he says we are.

29
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,000
 Scripture says that our hearts are deceitful.

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,840
 Above all else, they lie to us. They suppress the truth.

31
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,280
 And so when we spend time meditating on who God says he is,

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,780
 we can destroy those lies in our hearts that distort our view

33
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,520
 of who God is. And we can only really do that by spending time in his word.

34
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,880
 That's our safeguard for our deceitful hearts.

35
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,000
 Yeah, so I am going to take some time to pray for us this morning

36
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,660
 before we jump in to talking about Jesus as our good shepherd.

37
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:16,060
 Heavenly Father, you are so good to us.

38
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,000
 You are mighty in all of your ways.

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,540
 It's with your rod and your staff that you lead and guide us

40
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:25,980
 to life and life in you that is abundant and eternal.

41
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,280
 Would you help us today

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,280
 to hear truth from your word that is bigger and greater than the lies

43
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,200
 that our hearts can tell us about who you are and how that you see us,

44
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,420
 your sheep, your people.

45
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,000
 We are so thankful we belong to you, and we ask that your word be mighty

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,100
 in our hearts today, that it would speak to us, that it would convict us

47
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,680
 of what it means to belong to you and to worship you.

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,600
 It's in your name, I pray.

49
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,180
 Jesus, the good shepherd. Amen.

50
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:06,060
 So two summers ago, I was working for a place

51
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,880
 that a lot of you are familiar with.

52
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:12,460
 It's called UCA, and my husband and I were trying.

53
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,760
 We had this really fun idea, along with the rest of the organization,

54
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,200
 to take 30 middle school students on the train to play mini golf.

55
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,500
 Just the two of us. Super fun.

56
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,740
 And to corral 30 students who aren't really familiar with the CTA

57
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,400
 and to get them downtown to Millennial Millennium Park

58
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,680
 on the hottest day of the summer was quite an adventure.

59
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:43,920
 Not only did we have to kind of like shield the children

60
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,820
 from the interesting people on the train, but also we had to pass around

61
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,800
 all these water bottles.

62
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,020
 We were basically throwing water at all these middle schoolers.

63
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:57,500
 And I think the only reason we made it, as I reflect on that experience,

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,460
 is because my husband is so tall.

65
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:02,440
 And so he stood out among the crowd of people.

66
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:06,140
 And I remember vividly just shouting, "Look for Mr. Brock!"

67
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:11,680
 And so when I think about a shepherd experience, I want you to consider

68
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,020
 that's one example of leading sheep.

69
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,880
 But Jesus is a much more competent and capable shepherd

70
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,760
 than this example of just someone being tall leading a crowd of kids.

71
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:31,140
 So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to start by reading our passage today.

72
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:36,040
 I've actually chose two passages again, because I think it's so rich

73
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:39,340
 how the Old and New Testament both reflect

74
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:41,740
 who Jesus says he is in the New Testament.

75
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:45,180
 So and I keep finding that these I am statements

76
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:49,320
 have parallel texts in the Old Testament, which is so cool.

77
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,080
 So today I'm going to read our passage over us,

78
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,520
 and I want you to listen and hear Jesus's deep love for you,

79
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,560
 his sheep, in each of these scriptures.

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,160
 OK, so I'm going to start with John 10, 10 through 18.

81
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,040
 And if you want to get there in your Bible, you can also keep a thumb in Psalm 23.

82
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,240
 So John 10, 10.

83
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,880
 The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.

84
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,980
 But I have come that they may have life and have it to the full.

85
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:25,620
 I am the good shepherd.

86
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,620
 The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

87
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:32,160
 The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep.

88
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,400
 So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and he runs away.

89
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,560
 Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.

90
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,140
 The man runs away because he's a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep.

91
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,800
 But I am the good shepherd.

92
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,180
 I know my sheep and my sheep know me.

93
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:52,180
 And just as the father knows me and I know the father,

94
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:54,180
 I lay down my life for the sheep.

95
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:59,020
 I have other sheep that are not of the sheep pen, and I must bring them in also.

96
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,060
 They too will listen to my voice and there shall be one flock and one shepherd.

97
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:09,260
 The reason my father loves me is that I lay down my life only to take it up again.

98
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,440
 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.

99
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,900
 I have authority to lay it down and authority to take it up again.

100
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,340
 This command I received from my father.

101
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:26,320
 And then moving on to Psalm 23, the Lord is my shepherd.

102
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,220
 I lack nothing.

103
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,320
 He makes me lie down in green pastures and he leads me beside quiet waters.

104
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:37,020
 He refreshes my soul.

105
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:40,260
 He guides me along the right paths for his name's sake.

106
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,420
 And even though I walk through the darkest valley, I won't fear any evil

107
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:49,940
 for you are with me and your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

108
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:55,580
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

109
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,180
 You anoint my head with oil and my cup overflows.

110
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,220
 Surely, surely your goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life

111
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,880
 and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.

112
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,620
 This is the word of the Lord.

113
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:15,020
 Wow, I just even just need to take a moment because those promises are for us.

114
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,860
 That is insane.

115
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,260
 That is how the good shepherd sees his sheep.

116
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:26,400
 And we're going to talk about three truths that we can glean

117
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,900
 from these scriptures that help us to know more of who God is

118
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,080
 and how he sees us.

119
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:38,220
 The first section today that I want to talk about

120
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:43,220
 is the good shepherd leads us toward abundant life.

121
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:47,280
 The good shepherd leads us toward abundant life.

122
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,800
 And zeroing in on those first couple of verses here, John 10, 10,

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,960
 the thief comes only to steal, kill and destroy.

124
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,440
 But I have come so that you may have life and have it in abundance or to the full.

125
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,640
 And then the first couple of verses of Psalm 23,

126
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:05,480
 the Lord is my shepherd, I lack nothing.

127
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,180
 Or other translations say no good thing.

128
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:11,140
 He makes me lie down in green pastures.

129
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,240
 He leads me beside still waters.

130
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:17,580
 He refreshes my soul and he leads me in paths of righteousness

131
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,580
 for his name's sake.

132
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,560
 The good shepherd leads us toward abundant life.

133
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,500
 So taking a look at this first verse,

134
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:29,860
 Jesus says that he is all about abundant life.

135
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:32,560
 In the first few verses of Psalms, just to repeat again,

136
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,840
 it says that the shepherd leads by green pastures and quiet waters.

137
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,080
 When you hear these terms, what kind of feelings does that evoke for you?

138
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
 What pictures in this life?

139
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,920
 OK, maybe in the city we don't have that many still waters or green pastures,

140
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,820
 but what what is that

141
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:52,880
 abundance look like?

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:57,060
 What do you think of when you consider what abundance

143
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,320
 in a person's life really means?

144
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,220
 And a deeper question, does following Jesus

145
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:08,460
 seem like it holds abundance for you?

146
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:14,000
 Jesus, as the good shepherd, promises that he leads us

147
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,860
 toward abundant life and not away from it.

148
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,300
 And this might feel really contradictory for some of us

149
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,680
 when we weigh the cost of following Jesus.

150
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:28,640
 It can be so easy to think about how following Jesus is very, very difficult.

151
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,980
 And let's be real, it can be and it is, especially in our society and culture.

152
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:39,080
 This isn't unique to just us here in this church or in this time.

153
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,920
 But Paul, the apostle, if you think about him in the book of Acts,

154
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,420
 he has a laundry list of ways that he is beaten, scorned, abused, mocked.

155
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:51,600
 And that's in the book of Acts laid out for us.

156
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,100
 And so sometimes the work of choosing to trust in God

157
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:59,140
 and that belief he will come through for his people is even exhausting to consider

158
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,300
 when we think about what our present circumstances are.

159
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:07,680
 And yet scripture says that he gives us everything we need for life and godliness.

160
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,080
 So sometimes we don't trust that God, in God, is all life in abundance.

161
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:18,180
 And we try to manufacture our own happiness or chase after things

162
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,120
 that make us feel happy and comfortable in the moment.

163
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,220
 We strive after that picture of abundance rather than asking God,

164
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:27,560
 what does it really mean to have abundance in our lives?

165
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:32,460
 Scripture promises that the way that seems right to man actually leads to death.

166
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:36,240
 Therefore, the opposite is true in scripture,

167
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,580
 that the way that doesn't seem right to man,

168
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,880
 the way that seems really hard and really difficult

169
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,380
 is actually the way that leads to life and abundant life.

170
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:49,960
 Jesus is talking about a spiritual reality here

171
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,480
 that is greater and better than our physical reality,

172
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,460
 and it actually fuels the whole rest of our lives

173
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,560
 and our journeys here on this physical earth.

174
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,860
 Jesus says in another passage to his followers

175
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:06,200
 who are worried about what they will eat or what they will drink or what they will wear,

176
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,140
 if they follow Jesus, they choose this cost,

177
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:13,900
 this costly journey of following Jesus where he leads.

178
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,980
 He says to those people, seek first the kingdom of God

179
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:21,280
 and then all these things that you're longing for will actually be added to you.

180
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:24,540
 I give you everything you need and just like Psalm 23 says,

181
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,940
 you will lack no good thing.

182
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,780
 Jesus isn't saying, OK, if you follow God,

183
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:34,220
 you automatically get to date that guy you were really hoping to date

184
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:38,460
 or get that meal you were really hoping that you would be able to afford,

185
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:44,660
 but rather he is the one who gives us ultimate and full peace.

186
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,440
 He gives us deep peace and he provides that stillness

187
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:53,300
 and security and life in himself and not in our present circumstances.

188
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:59,240
 Everything else God provides for us on top of us, on top of that, well, that's a bonus.

189
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:04,020
 Following this good shepherd, the one whose ways lead to abundant life,

190
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,020
 revives our souls when we start becoming weary of doing good.

191
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:12,260
 When the weight of following Jesus feels never ending and exhausting,

192
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:17,660
 trusting the good shepherd means leaning into the rest that knowing Jesus provides.

193
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,840
 Can you think of a time recently when you felt at the end of your rope,

194
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,040
 maybe you felt burnt out?

195
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,240
 Jesus sees you in the midst of this exhaustion.

196
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,240
 Of course, Jesus can provide us seasons of physical rest,

197
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:36,180
 but he also provides us a deep spiritual rest in himself

198
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:38,460
 in the context of a relationship with him.

199
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:42,560
 The good shepherd leads us toward an abundant life.

200
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:49,720
 So we are fine when he leads us by still pastures or leads us by quiet waters,

201
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:54,820
 but what happens when we are walking through the valley of the shadow of death?

202
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,360
 Yikes.

203
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,120
 Does our confidence in God begin to waver?

204
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,600
 The good shepherd is our defender in the darkness.

205
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:10,800
 The good shepherd is our defender in the darkness.

206
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,600
 Let's go back to our passage here.

207
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,380
 Next few verses of John 10.

208
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:18,680
 I'm having you flip back and forth a lot today, so sorry about that.

209
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,520
 John 10 verses 11 through 13.

210
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,020
 "I am the good shepherd.

211
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:25,680
 The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.

212
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,320
 The hired hand is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep.

213
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:33,460
 So when he sees the wolf coming, he abandons the sheep and runs away.

214
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:36,740
 Then the wolf attacks the flock and scatters it.

215
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:41,840
 The man runs away because he's a hired hand and cares nothing for the sheep."

216
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,380
 And then the next couple of verses in Psalm 23.

217
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:51,420
 "Even though I walk through the darkest valley or valley of the shadow of death,

218
00:13:51,420 --> 00:13:55,840
 I will fear no evil for your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

219
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,880
 You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.

220
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,300
 You anoint my head with oil and my cup overflows.

221
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,560
 The good shepherd is our defender in darkness."

222
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,660
 So I ask you again,

223
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,500
 what happens when you are no longer experiencing the highs of life

224
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,500
 or the peacefulness of a calm season?

225
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:21,640
 What happens when the what ifs you are most afraid of actually happen

226
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:25,420
 and your fears are realized before you

227
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:29,120
 in some of the most painful and traumatic moments of your life?

228
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,460
 How is the good shepherd both good and a shepherd in those seasons?

229
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,720
 Here in this passage,

230
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,800
 we see a mighty God who takes on the evil of the wolf fearlessly,

231
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,560
 who carries a rod and a staff.

232
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:50,940
 And takes the wolf who's trying to attack the sheep in his sheep pen

233
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,540
 by the teeth and throws him out of the pen.

234
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:57,380
 This is a depiction of mightiness and authority.

235
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:01,380
 This is the God who has fearlessly defeated any evil

236
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:05,480
 that can possibly triumph over our lives, whether that's our own sin

237
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,260
 or the sin of others that affects us.

238
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:13,300
 For some of you, maybe this mightiness in God has freaked you out,

239
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,500
 either now or in the past.

240
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,800
 Maybe you don't want to believe in a God who has complete sovereignty

241
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,600
 over your life because you're fearful about how God might use

242
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,240
 that rod and staff against you.

243
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,880
 But if you belong to God, if you're one of his sheep,

244
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:32,280
 then you must know that that rod and staff functions to protect you.

245
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:36,320
 If you've been walking with God for a while now,

246
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,620
 perhaps what used to be a fear of God's mightiness

247
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:44,460
 is something you now find comfort in, knowing that God has the final say.

248
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:48,300
 Maybe you feel safe and secure and comforting to know.

249
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:53,060
 But for all of us, the truth of this scripture can become comforting

250
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:57,060
 when we consider the good shepherd in the image of us

251
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,700
 walking through the valley of the shadow of death.

252
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:02,480
 In Israel, this is an actual place.

253
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:06,920
 And this might be wrong, and probably Pastor Mark knows the right answer for this,

254
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,220
 but I believe it's called the Valley of Hinnom.

255
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,160
 And I think that I've been there.

256
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,260
 And from what I remember of my memories, it's this rocky crevasse

257
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:18,600
 that has steep rocks on every single side.

258
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,600
 And historically, this would be a place where wild animals would run.

259
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,760
 Where outside of the old city of Jerusalem,

260
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:28,940
 they used to dump trash into this valley.

261
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:32,680
 So kind of a disgusting and dark place, and it makes sense

262
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:34,980
 why all these wild animals were roaming there.

263
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,220
 Pretty that, would you have complete confidence that you would be safe

264
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:43,380
 walking through that valley?

265
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:48,480
 What does it mean for us as believers to believe in a God

266
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,600
 that makes us fearless in the face of the valley of the shadow of death?

267
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,300
 How do we move from fear to confidence in God?

268
00:16:57,860 --> 00:17:02,140
 And how do we move from what if to even if this happens,

269
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:05,240
 my God will come through for me again and again?

270
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,700
 Here's how.

271
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:12,640
 We can trust that the Good Shepherd always destroys the wolf.

272
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,720
 The wolf of sin and death can make us afraid.

273
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,420
 It can come to make us intimidated or fearful that our own sin

274
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:23,280
 or the sin of others will be ultimately victorious.

275
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,460
 But the Good Shepherd, he's there to protect us.

276
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:35,600
 In Isaiah 118, it says, "Come now, let us reason together.

277
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,780
 Though your sins be scarlet, they will be white as snow,

278
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:42,080
 and though they be red as crimson, they will be as wool."

279
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:48,140
 This is a promise of God in our lives for how he deals with our own sin.

280
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,380
 His wrath was placed on Jesus so that his wrath is directed

281
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,660
 towards protecting us from our own sin.

282
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:00,660
 I don't know if any of you have ever seen

283
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,900
 like those people who play flutes for boa constrictors before,

284
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,940
 and they make, I'm not describing it well,

285
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:13,440
 but they play flutes and they make the boa constrictor dance.

286
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,780
 And they've always been amazed, like, how terrifying,

287
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:19,480
 in the face of a boa constrictor, you're just playing this cute little song.

288
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,180
 How can you feel safe and secure that the boa constrictor

289
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:26,920
 won't one day reach out and all of a sudden,

290
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,920
 how can you be sure that you're safe?

291
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,320
 Well, I learned recently that actually,

292
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,560
 these people who play the flutes for the boa constrictors

293
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,400
 glue the mouths of the boa constrictors shut.

294
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,860
 Now, that's kind of a disturbing thing to realize about that.

295
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,340
 But I think that picture can translate to how we can view

296
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,940
 the sin in our own lives or in the lives of others

297
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,980
 and the ways that it affects us, that God has complete control

298
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:03,820
 and ultimate victory over the sin and darkness in the world

299
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:04,980
 and the evil in the world.

300
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,420
 And because of this, we can be bold and courageous

301
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,500
 because we have the right man on our side.

302
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:16,400
 When Brock and I were seniors in high school

303
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:21,840
 and recent Christians, we had the opportunity to interact with,

304
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,500
 we had the opportunity to visit North Africa and sit with missionaries

305
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,220
 who spent their entire lives working with shepherds

306
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,720
 in the hills of this North African country.

307
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:37,820
 And one of the missionaries was telling us a story about his interactions

308
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:40,560
 when he first got to the country with one of the shepherds.

309
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,500
 He said he he had stored up all these stories in his mind

310
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:48,040
 that he'd heard from preachers over the years about how dumb sheep are.

311
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,100
 And he brought those to the shepherd

312
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:55,100
 and started telling him, I've heard that sheep are so dumb

313
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,880
 that they just kind of wander in the same patch of grass

314
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,480
 and they eat all the grass there.

315
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:02,620
 And instead of moving on to another patch, they just don't realize it.

316
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,920
 They just start eating each other's manure in a circle like,

317
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,480
 they are so dumb, aren't they so dumb?

318
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,400
 And I will never forget the missionary turning to Brock and I and saying,

319
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,720
 you know, that shepherd looked me right in the face.

320
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,460
 And he said, don't call sheep dumb.

321
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,840
 These are my sheep. They matter to me.

322
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,500
 The shepherd had incredible love for these animals,

323
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,440
 and it's the shepherd's love and care for these animals

324
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:36,140
 that helped me begin to see this passage differently.

325
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:39,680
 And I think one of the most beautiful truths from this passage

326
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:42,360
 is that the good shepherd is not a hired hand.

327
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,860
 He's not going to abandon us.

328
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,020
 He chooses to be with us. It's his choice.

329
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:50,160
 That's not something the father makes him do.

330
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,900
 As it says in the passage, he has his own authority

331
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,160
 to lay down his life and pick it up again.

332
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,900
 It's his choice, Jesus's choice to sacrifice everything for his sheep,

333
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:02,140
 for you, for me.

334
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,840
 And in the face of great evil, because he's not a hired hand,

335
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,640
 he will defend us again and again.

336
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,420
 This isn't just his job.

337
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:16,060
 It's his never ending love for us that compels his actions toward us.

338
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:20,460
 The good shepherd is our defender in the darkness.

339
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:27,300
 So God's word promises that his voice is powerful enough

340
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:31,240
 not to just defend us, but also to lead us.

341
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:35,740
 Let's take a look at the next few verses here as we wrap up our time.

342
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:40,940
 In John 10, verses 14 through 18 say, "I am the good shepherd.

343
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,580
 I know my sheep and my sheep know me.

344
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,880
 Just as the father knows me and I know the father,

345
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,180
 I lay down my life for the sheep.

346
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:53,880
 I have other sheep that are not of the sheep pen, and I must bring them in also."

347
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,560
 I'm just going to pause and say that means us.

348
00:21:56,560 --> 00:22:01,060
 If you are not an ethnic Jew who was born in Jerusalem,

349
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:05,120
 this promise is talking about Jesus is saying,

350
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,760
 "I'm going to bring others into my kingdom."

351
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,000
 So this is really sweet to realize Jesus is talking about you and me in this passage.

352
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,500
 So anyway, "I must bring them in also.

353
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:20,140
 They too will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock and one shepherd.

354
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:24,720
 The reason my father loves me is that I lay down my life only to take it up again.

355
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,060
 No one takes it from me, but I lay it down in my own accord.

356
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,960
 I have authority to lay it down and the authority to take it up again.

357
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:35,400
 This is the command I received from my father."

358
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:41,440
 And the last verse of Psalm 23, "Surely, surely, your goodness and love

359
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:49,120
 will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever."

360
00:22:49,120 --> 00:23:01,200
 The good shepherd leads us to everlasting life.

361
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:05,900
 For many of us, we have asked at various points in our lives,

362
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,180
 "What is the purpose of my life? What is God's will for my life?"

363
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:16,220
 I'm not saying these are in and of themselves bad questions.

364
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:21,580
 These are questions in which to sit with before God and faithfully ponder.

365
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:25,520
 But at one point in the book of Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah hears—

366
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:28,620
 and this is why it's good to sit and ponder with these questions—

367
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:34,360
 in the book of Isaiah, the prophet hears from God that if he walks down one possible path,

368
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:39,400
 and then another, he will hear a voice from the Lord saying, "This is the way. Walk in it."

369
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:45,840
 This is an illustration of what it looks like to faithfully discern the paths God might be leading you towards.

370
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:52,720
 However, sometimes it can be so easy to become so caught up in God's will or purpose for our lives,

371
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:57,720
 like, "What good task does God want me to do? What college does he want me to attend?

372
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:01,820
 Does he want me to take this promotion or stay in my current position?

373
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,420
 What do the next five, ten years of my life look like?"

374
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:10,460
 That we can actually miss the true life God has called us into,

375
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:16,800
 where we are deeply attuned to every wavelength of his voice in our lives.

376
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:20,980
 God desires our dependence on his voice.

377
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:27,380
 In this passage, we are promised that if we belong to God, we can know his voice.

378
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:31,320
 That's a really sweet promise to rest in.

379
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,360
 And we can trust his leading voice in our lives, because as the passage shares,

380
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:40,060
 at the end of this part in John 10, he has eternal authority.

381
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:46,160
 And at the end of Psalm 23, that this kind of authoritative leading goes beyond this life,

382
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,340
 but actually continues in the life to come, where if we belong to the shepherd's flock,

383
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:59,540
 we experience the goodness and love that will continue in our lives as we dwell in God's house for eternity.

384
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:06,180
 I've also heard stories about sheep before, that a shepherd will actually take a newborn sheep

385
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:12,960
 that can easily run away from him, because maybe the sheep isn't yet familiar with the shepherd's voice,

386
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,660
 and that the shepherd will actually break the legs of the sheep,

387
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:25,200
 and put the sheep around the shepherd's neck for a few years, until the sheep's legs heal.

388
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:29,540
 Now this might seem really cruel and unusual, and it is kind of scary,

389
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:33,580
 but the reason the shepherd does this is actually for the safety of the sheep.

390
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:37,180
 That while the sheep is around the neck of the shepherd,

391
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,960
 the sheep is learning to hear the voice of the shepherd.

392
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,220
 The sheep is learning the voice so that one day, when the shepherd leads the flock,

393
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:55,560
 that the sheep can't go astray, that he knows the voice of the shepherd, and is able to follow after him.

394
00:25:55,560 --> 00:26:00,500
 God's love in our lives compels us to hear his voice,

395
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:07,320
 and it's because of his love that he wants us to know his voice, his leading voice in our lives.

396
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:12,080
 A butcher would drive the sheep towards something,

397
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,820
 would try to get them to go into pen to be slaughtered,

398
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:19,960
 but a shepherd compels them to follow him.

399
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,760
 The voice of the Lord leading in your life is one of deep and everlasting peace and joy.

400
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:34,200
 It's from a place of deep and personal love for you, that he leads you and me.

401
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:41,120
 The good shepherd leads us to everlasting life.

402
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:45,980
 Jesus says in both of these passages that he is the good shepherd,

403
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:50,360
 and I believe that he longs for us to know him as the good shepherd,

404
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,760
 as one who leads us towards abundant life, those still waters and green pastures,

405
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:01,860
 as one who is our defender in the darkness, who destroys and defeats the wolf.

406
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:07,700
 He's already done that and will continue to defend us in the valley of the shadow of death,

407
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,700
 and as one who leads us, not just leads us in our day-to-day decisions,

408
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:18,140
 but toward everlasting life, which is ultimately found in him.

409
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:25,620
 Thanks be to God for that. Let's pray together.

410
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:31,760
 God, you are so merciful that we would be counted as yours.

411
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,360
 God, thank you for the opportunity we have to know you,

412
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:39,260
 and to be able to have confidence that if we know you and we belong to you,

413
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,300
 we can hear your voice.

414
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,300
 God, thank you that in the face of our worst,
