1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,680
 of God. And today, as we get together to worship together, I would like to share a few words

2
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:15,240
 with you. And the title of the sermon is "Following God in Tough Times." We're going to turn

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:22,320
 to the book of Job, chapter 1. If you have your Bible with you, please turn to your Bible,

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,820
 to the book of Job, which is found at the very middle of the Bible. Now, we are living

5
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:37,760
 in a tough time. The pandemic has entered the third year with no end in sight. We are

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:47,000
 having bad times whenever we are suffering, whenever we are not feeling good about what

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:54,320
 is happening in our lives. We sometimes think of the poor Job. We turn to the book of Job.

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:02,020
 Sometimes we want to find some wisdom. Job talks about something that is universal for

9
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:09,920
 the humanity, the universal question of human suffering. Suffering is real. I don't know

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:17,160
 what you are facing, but there are many facets of suffering. At least there are three areas

11
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:23,200
 we can think of about human suffering. The first one is personal suffering. Of course,

12
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,240
 we are all familiar with it. It comes with different forms and different kinds. Emotional

13
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,080
 suffering, mental challenges, loss of jobs, or you're facing the future, you find a lot

14
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:44,800
 of uncertainties, you just don't know how to cope with it. Sickness and disability of

15
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:51,920
 all kinds. These are personal suffering, and it is universal. Everyone is familiar with

16
00:01:51,920 --> 00:02:00,120
 it or gets some taste of it. The second category is disasters, natural disasters. COVID is

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:10,520
 one of them, although it was partly caused by human failures, but it is partly also a

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:18,160
 natural disaster. Think of what the Americans had experienced some weeks ago because of

19
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:26,400
 tornadoes. Their families, their houses got destroyed, and they became homeless and displaced.

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,000
 These are some of the universal experiences of natural disasters. The third category is

21
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,680
 systemic evil. Sometimes we don't think of that, but it is so real. Think of people living

22
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:46,800
 under oppressive regimes. Churches, minorities being persecuted, human rights being taken

23
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:56,000
 away from them. This is systemic oppression. We think of all these kinds of sufferings

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:03,920
 as we turn to the book of Job, because poor Job suffers a lot. Chapter 1 opens with this

25
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:12,800
 verse to introduce this main character called Job. Chapter 1. In the land of Uz, there lived

26
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:21,040
 a man whose name was Job. This man was blameless and upright. He feared God and shunned evil.

27
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,480
 He had seven sons and three daughters. He owned a lot of things, thousands and thousands

28
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,080
 of oxen and donkeys, a very rich man, and a large number of servants. He was the greatest

29
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:41,280
 man among all the people of the East. That's how the Bible introduced the character Job.

30
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:50,240
 Then the book talks about how Job was a blameless man morally or ritually or in terms of worship.

31
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:57,000
 He does everything he can to make sure he feared God. He is blameless in every single

32
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:06,880
 way imaginable. Then the book of Job turns the attention to heaven. All of a sudden,

33
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:15,400
 the focus turned to heaven. Verse 6 and following. One day the angels came to present themselves

34
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:22,520
 before the Lord, and Satan also came with them. The Lord said to Satan, "Where have

35
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:28,680
 you come from?" Satan answered the Lord, "From roaming through the earth and going back and

36
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,900
 forth in it." Then the Lord said, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one

37
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:43,360
 on earth like him. He is blameless and white. He is a man who fears God and shuns evil."

38
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:52,960
 Then the conversation continues with Satan asking a question. "Does Job fear God for

39
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,640
 nothing?" Satan replied. "Have you not put a hat around him and his household and everything

40
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:10,000
 he has? You have blessed the work of Job's hands so that his flocks, his herds, are spread

41
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:16,440
 throughout the land. But stretch out your hand and strike everything he has. He will

42
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:23,880
 surely curse you to the face." The Lord said to Satan, "Farewell. Then everything he has

43
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:30,040
 is in your hands, but on the man himself do not lay a finger." Then Satan went out from

44
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,160
 the presence of the Lord.

45
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:41,000
 This story continues in the later context. It talks about disasters and suffering one

46
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:48,480
 after another fell upon the life of Job. His children died one after the other in tragedies,

47
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:56,540
 and finally he fell really, really sick. This creates many tensions for us because whenever

48
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:07,280
 we suffer or we see someone suffer, we always ask the question, "Why?" "Why did Job suffer?"

49
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,960
 From this very short portion of scripture from chapter 1, it seems like we can blame

50
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,680
 it all on Satan, blame it all on the devil because of the evil one. He is doing something

51
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:29,160
 to destroy our lives. Does that explain suffering? Does it really answer the question, "Why

52
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:36,940
 we suffer? Why did innocent suffer?" It seems not because it seems like God allowed Satan

53
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:46,140
 to bring suffering to Job. So it really doesn't address the question of why Job suffered or

54
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:49,320
 why the innocent suffered.

55
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:56,740
 Now about this character Satan, there is also something that we need to pay attention to.

56
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:04,280
 The English word translated "Satan", if you check the Hebrew behind the word, it is not

57
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:13,440
 "Satan", it is "Ha-Satan". Now in Hebrew, you don't have to be an expert to understand

58
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:25,600
 this. In Hebrew, "Ha" is a definite article, in English equivalent to "the". And "Satan",

59
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:34,160
 of course we get it from Satan, right? "Satan" originally was Hebrew. Now it simply means

60
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:43,000
 challenger or adversary, someone who opposes, someone who raises a question. Now it can

61
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:52,040
 be a good character, it can also be an evil character, it can be neutral. So remember,

62
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,100
 Satan as we know it from the New Testament, the evil one, the capital evil one, from the

63
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:03,760
 book of Revelation for example, Satan does not become a personal name or a personal entity

64
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,040
 until the time between the end of the Old Testament and the beginning of the New Testament,

65
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,640
 so-called intertestamental period. Satan does not exist in the mind of the ancient Israelites,

66
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:23,300
 the ancient Jews, until the intertestamental period before the New Testament. So in this

67
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:31,000
 time in the Old Testament, there is no understanding of Satan as a personal character. So "Ha-Satan"

68
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:36,800
 is actually not a personal name, that's why it's "the Satan", right? So a better translation

69
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:48,440
 could be "the challenger". So a better translation would go, "Does Job fear God for nothing,

70
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:57,000
 the challenger in the heavenly court, ask the question?" So the challenger asking a

71
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:06,040
 neutral question, perhaps not an evil one, is a question which is legitimate, because

72
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:12,200
 the challenger is asking a question, saying, "God, if you continue to give good things

73
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,440
 to Job, of course he will fear you, of course he will worship you. If you keep on blessing

74
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:28,480
 Job, you will ruin his motive of being good, and eventually Job will fear you only because

75
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,960
 of the benefits he will receive from you." So the challenge is legitimate, right? The

76
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:40,960
 challenge is really legitimate. If you think about young children, you should understand

77
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:46,400
 that. Children will behave because they want rewards from you, they want benefits from

78
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:55,800
 you. And eventually, a child will behave only for the benefits he gets from you. So the

79
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,880
 challenge is a valid question, is a valid concern. And what is driving the righteousness,

80
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:09,920
 the worship of Job, right? That's the essence of the question. So the challenger is questioning

81
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:20,960
 how God operates the cosmos. Some sort of a challenge to God's way or God's policy

82
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:29,880
 of managing the universe. And then, from the later context, we know God readily accepts

83
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,560
 the challenge. God said, "Okay, Job is in your hand. His things is in your hand. Take

84
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:45,280
 his things out. Take his things away. See if he continues to worship you." So this

85
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:51,520
 short story kicks off the rest of the entire book, a very long book, the book of Job.

86
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:59,080
 Now let's take a look at this really long book of Job. What is it all about? The first

87
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:05,880
 three chapters' introduction is the suffering of Job. They have a dialogue between Hasatan

88
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:14,880
 the opposer, the challenger, which is a legitimate challenge that he presents, and then God himself.

89
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,640
 First three chapters is a short introduction. And then there's cycles of cycles of cycles

90
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:28,000
 of dialogue between three friends of Job. They're debating why Job suffered. And then

91
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:38,320
 chapter 28, there's a wisdom song. And then chapter 29 to 41, another cycle of speeches.

92
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:45,680
 Job and then there's a guy who popped up called Elihu. Probably he represents the ancient

93
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:53,000
 Israel, how they see suffering, why the innocent suffer. And then lastly Yahweh, God himself,

94
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:58,800
 show up and then conclusion. Now as you can see, a big chunk of the book is conversations

95
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:09,120
 or actually debates between Job and his friends. Why does the righteous suffer? The three friends

96
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:16,000
 are saying, and they insist, that Job suffered because he has done something wrong. He has

97
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:25,600
 sinned against God. If Job is willing, the friends argue, willing to confess his wrongdoing,

98
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,360
 whatever that is, something you can think of or you can just make it up, just confess

99
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,120
 your sin, Job, and then you will be fine. Now if Job confesses his sin, the friends

100
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:44,080
 are saying, your suffering will end and you will be okay and you'll get your stuff back.

101
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,600
 It's very simple, it's very easy. It should be the end of conversation. But of course

102
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,720
 not, right? Of course not that simple because Job, in the entire chapters, in the entire

103
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:04,200
 debate, Job is saying, I am innocent. I insist that I am innocent. I do not deserve this

104
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,560
 kind of suffering. I do not deserve this kind of pain. So the debate prolongs and continues

105
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,160
 and continues. Now let's pause and ask why this prolonged

106
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:24,840
 conversation is there and what it really means. As I have told you before, the Bible is not

107
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:30,560
 written to us. It was written to the ancient audience, right, in the Near East, in the

108
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:37,960
 ancient Middle East. Now in the ancient Middle East world, people believe that their relationship

109
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:45,680
 with God or gods, the false gods, follow some sort of principle and we can summarize saying

110
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:54,840
 the principle is retribution principle. Some sort of, you know, I relate to God in this

111
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:02,280
 kind of retribution dynamic. You scratch my back and I will scratch your back. You know,

112
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:10,240
 this kind of, I will do good things and then the gods will give me good things. If I do

113
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:17,160
 something wrong, I offend the gods, then I will suffer because I did some bad things.

114
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,040
 So good things lead to good stuff that I will receive. Good things lead to benefits I will

115
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:31,160
 receive from the gods. If I do something bad or unintentionally I step the toes of the

116
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:39,160
 gods, then I will suffer. If that's the case, then I have to do something better,

117
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:46,160
 do something good so I can appease the gods. So many times, as you can see, even in today's

118
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,880
 world, in the ancient world or in the contemporary world, this kind of principle is what we assume.

119
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,080
 Sometimes this principle works, right. We do good things, you know, there's a good

120
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:04,640
 return. But many times, as you can tell, it doesn't work, right. We are in the midst

121
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,240
 of pandemic, right. We are suffering because of other people's wrongdoing, right. Because

122
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:18,120
 of other people's mistakes. That's why in the entire book, Job continues to maintain

123
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:28,000
 his sinlessness, his integrity. He even demands to interview God because he, Job himself,

124
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:34,200
 he wants to understand why he suffers. He has done nothing wrong, he said. So after

125
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:45,040
 30 some chapters, God finally shows up. He did show up and answer to Job. But the way

126
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,560
 he answered is very interesting. It's not really answering the question of suffering.

127
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:57,120
 It's not really trying to explain the reasons why the innocent suffer, why Job suffered.

128
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:05,520
 Let's take a look. 38 verse 1 and 4. The Lord Yahweh answered Job out of the storm. So God

129
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:13,160
 showed up. Verse 4. He asked a bunch of questions. One of the first questions is, "Where were

130
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:20,400
 you when I laid the earth's foundation? Tell me if you understand. If you're wise enough,

131
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:28,320
 tell me where were you when I created the world? Since you question my policy of running

132
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:35,320
 the universe, running the cosmos, where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?"

133
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:41,680
 And a bunch of questions about creation, all the awesome things that God has done since

134
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:49,920
 the beginning of time. And then 38, 25. This is really interesting. It's a rhetorical question.

135
00:16:49,920 --> 00:17:00,160
 It means the answer is always assumed. 25. God presents the questions. "Who cuts a channel

136
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:07,080
 for the torrents of rain and a path for the thunderstorm to water a land where no man

137
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:17,840
 lives, a desert with no one in it, to satisfy a wilderness, a wasteland, a desolate wasteland,

138
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:24,480
 and make it sprout with grass?" You see what is going on here? God is saying, "Do you

139
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:31,880
 know the principle of rain in this earth?" God is saying, "Do you even notice there are

140
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:40,080
 times when rain falls on no man's land? No one will get the benefit. No one will get

141
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:49,720
 to drink the water." And God's way of operating the universe is beyond the so-called retribution

142
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:57,040
 principle. Good things lead to good return. Good things lead to good stuff and benefits.

143
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:05,000
 And God is saying, "Take a look at the rain and the snow. Sometimes it falls on no man's

144
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:10,400
 land. No one will get the benefit." Why? Do you understand why? It's way beyond the principle

145
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:17,800
 of retribution. And then 39, 13. This is one of my favorites. Talk about the big birds.

146
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:30,920
 Talk about the ostrich. 38, 39, 13. "The wings of the ostrich flap joyfully, but they

147
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:40,320
 cannot compare with the pinions and feathers of the stork. She lays her eggs on the ground

148
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:49,120
 and lets them warm in the sand." Understandable, right? Very wise. "But unmindful that a foot

149
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:56,920
 may crush them." Sometimes the mother ostrich crushes the eggs and kills the birds, kills

150
00:18:56,920 --> 00:19:03,160
 the babies. What is going on here? Sometimes a wild animal will come by and pick up the

151
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:13,200
 eggs and destroy the babies. If God creates everything out of his retribution principle,

152
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:20,720
 such things would not happen, should not happen. If God creates everything in his wisdom, we

153
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:26,760
 should be able to understand why. And this question is saying, we just don't understand

154
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:34,360
 why God would do such things. God would create stupid ostrich, right? They are so stupid.

155
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:42,040
 They are not of wisdom. And why God created them in such a way? Now all these questions

156
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:50,240
 God presents to Job is saying rhetorically, you know the answers? We just don't know.

157
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:59,320
 It's way beyond our finite wisdom. We just cannot comprehend, cannot fully understand

158
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:06,400
 the wisdom of God by which he managed the universe. And then at the end in chapter 40,

159
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:16,840
 verse 3, Job, after hearing all the questions being challenged by all these rhetorical questions,

160
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:23,520
 Job answered the Lord, "I am unworthy. How can I reply to you? I put my hand over my

161
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:34,720
 mouth. I spoke once, but I have no answer. Twice, but I will say no more." So why suffering?

162
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:43,400
 Why Job suffering? At the very end of the book, there's no answer. The book is not

163
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:51,360
 intent to help us how to think about suffering. It doesn't give reasons for suffering. It

164
00:20:51,360 --> 00:21:00,000
 doesn't really, it doesn't even defend the actions of God, right? Called theodicy. Defending

165
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:05,120
 the deeds of God, why there is suffering in the world if there is a good and all powerful

166
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:12,840
 God. Why evil exists? Why suffering exists? The book of Job doesn't really give a philosophical

167
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,680
 analysis of the question of suffering, the question of evil. So the book is not about

168
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:27,720
 how to think about suffering. The book is about how to think about God in our suffering.

169
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:38,000
 It's not to help us think about suffering. It's to help us how to think about God in

170
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:46,240
 our suffering. The book expands our theology, expands our understanding of God. Presenting

171
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:54,960
 to us God is wise, God's wisdom is infinite. How he ordered his cosmos, how God managed

172
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:02,640
 the universe is beyond our finite mind, is beyond our comprehension. We cannot fully

173
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,160
 understand it. God's wisdom is higher than our wisdom. It's ultimately incomprehensible.

174
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:16,560
 When I was in seminary, one of my teachers, one of the best teachers was John Frame. Dr.

175
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,320
 John Frame is one of the best theologians out there. He said one thing that changed

176
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:31,920
 my way of worship since then. One of his theology classes, he said, "God is incomprehensible."

177
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:37,600
 We were studying theology. We were studying the attributes of God, the character of God.

178
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,880
 We always focus on God is love, God is righteous, God is truth. All those things are good and

179
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:50,440
 they are all correct and biblical. But here, Frame says, "So often we forgot that one

180
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:58,000
 of the attributes of God is incomprehensibility." God is incomprehensible. And Frame continues

181
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,840
 to say, "If God is incomprehensible, his incomprehensibility is incomprehensible."

182
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:16,280
 How incomprehensible God is, is way beyond our comprehension. It's incomprehensible.

183
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:27,640
 We are finite and God is infinite. God is to be trusted and his wisdom is to be trusted.

184
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:33,720
 Even though we don't know all the answers, especially the answers for the question of

185
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:41,840
 suffering, the question of evil. Now, ultimately, the book of Job doesn't really offer much

186
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:50,160
 encouragement or comfort to suffering. Now, many Psalms in the Bible do, especially Laments

187
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:56,280
 or Psalms of Confidence and all those Psalms. You go to the book of Psalms, there are many

188
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:04,640
 Psalms that help us to get encouragement and comfort in our suffering. But the book of

189
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,440
 Job is not designed to do that. It just doesn't cut it. The book of Job doesn't really offer

190
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:18,360
 a defense of God in the midst of suffering. There's no philosophical analysis to human

191
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:25,480
 suffering. If you approach the book with such expectations, why I suffer, why the righteous

192
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:32,440
 suffer, why are we in the pandemic? We will be disappointed because the book is not about

193
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:38,440
 how we think about suffering. The book is about how we think about God in the midst

194
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:45,200
 of suffering. How do we think about God in tough times? How do we think about him, our

195
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:56,440
 theology? That determines our life, our ethics. Theology determines ethics. How we understand

196
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,760
 God determines how we behave, how we live our lives.

197
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:10,640
 Now, let's go back to chapter one, the valid question presented by Hasatan, the challenger.

198
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:20,080
 Verse 9, chapter 1. Does Job fear God for nothing? It's a valid concern, it's a valid

199
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:28,640
 question. The question is how we think about ourselves, how we relate to God in our suffering.

200
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:39,000
 Do you worship God because you get benefits from him? Does Job worship God, fear God for

201
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:48,760
 the benefits that he has? Or he really worships God and fears God for nothing, not for his

202
00:25:48,760 --> 00:26:01,960
 own benefit? Is there something called disinterest righteousness, disinterest faith goodness

203
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:09,960
 that is not concerned by our own benefits, the good things that we can get? Does Job

204
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:17,440
 worship God because he gets the benefits from doing so? Does Job worship God only when he

205
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:26,280
 experiences prosperity, blessing from God? Is Job's righteousness really disinterest?

206
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:33,920
 Does Job worship God no matter what, good times or bad times? That is the most important

207
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:44,920
 question we should ask. Do we follow Christ all because of the benefits that we have?

208
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:50,280
 Now, don't get me wrong, we got a lot of benefits from being in Christ, right? We believe

209
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:55,280
 in Jesus, we believe in Christ, we receive the redemption. I think there are a lot of

210
00:26:55,280 --> 00:27:04,080
 benefits that we have. Eternal life, spiritual blessings, the honour and dignity for being

211
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,120
 children of God, the privileges to approach God directly in Christ in prayers, the will

212
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:18,480
 of God that we know from the will of God. These are all the benefits that we have from

213
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:27,200
 being in Christ. But remember this, all of these benefits are not earned by us. We don't

214
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:41,000
 deserve them. And they are freely given to us in Christ, in the cross. The book of Job,

215
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:50,920
 essentially, is not a book on suffering. Again, there are no answers to the question, why

216
00:27:50,920 --> 00:28:00,920
 we suffer. The book of Job is not a book on suffering. The book of Job is a book on discipleship.

217
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:09,840
 Discipleship in the midst of tough times. The question, do you worship God, do you fear

218
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,360
 God for nothing? Or do you fear God because you want to get good stuff from him? When

219
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:25,240
 good stuff is taken away, we leave God alone. It's a book on discipleship. Discipleship

220
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:34,360
 in tough times. In calling us to follow Christ even in tough times, not just in good times.

221
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:42,640
 Perhaps this is the more important question we need to begin asking as we start a new

222
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:52,160
 year. Perhaps this is the most important question. Why do you worship God? Is it because of the

223
00:28:52,160 --> 00:29:01,480
 benefits that you receive? That's why you follow Christ? Or if God is God, he is worthy

224
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:10,400
 of our worship no matter what. He is worthy of our attention no matter what. He is still

225
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:17,440
 the centre of our lives no matter what. Do we follow Christ even without the benefits?

226
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:26,800
 This is a question of purifying our faith. Centring our faith on Christ alone. Not on

227
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:35,120
 the good stuff that we have we get from Christ. Again there are many benefits but remember

228
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:45,160
 we don't earn them. Freely given to us in grace. But do we really worship God for nothing?

229
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:52,840
 That should be the essence of faith. God is awesome. He is worthy of our worship. Christ

230
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:01,800
 is worthy of our following, of our faith and obedience no matter what. Thick or thin. That

231
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:08,320
 is the essence of faith. This is the most important question we should ask as we celebrate

232
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:16,880
 New Year. As we start a new year. We can set a lot of goals whenever we come to New Year.

233
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:25,120
 You want to lose weight. You want to live a healthier lifestyle. You want to hit this

234
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,640
 goal or that goal in your career or in your school. Those are really good and worthy goals.

235
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,960
 But the most important question we need to ask is presented by the book of John. Do you

236
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:50,000
 fear God for nothing? Is God really worthy of your worship no matter what? I read a New

237
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:59,080
 Year's prayer written by someone anonymous. I find this prayer really meaningful and I

238
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:11,160
 would like to end today's worship by reading this prayer together. A New Year's prayer.

239
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:18,600
 May God make your year a happy one. Not by shielding you from all sorrows and pain, but

240
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:27,880
 by strengthening you to bear it as it comes. Not by making your path easy, but by making

241
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:36,800
 you sturdy to travel any path. Not by taking hardships from you, but by taking fear out

242
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:45,880
 of your heart. Not by granting you unbroken sunshine, but by keeping your face bright

243
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,000
 even in the shadows. Not by making your life always pleasant, but by showing you when people

244
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:59,080
 and their causes need you most and by making you anxious to be there to help them. God's

245
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:09,280
 love, peace, hope and joy to you for the year to come. Let's all pray together.

246
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:20,000
 Dear God, you are the awesome and greatest God. You are the creator. You are everything

247
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:31,240
 and you are infinite and ultimately incomprehensible. You are worthy of our worship, worthy of our

248
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:43,320
 attention, worthy of our obedience. And God help us as we start a new year. As this prayer

249
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:51,320
 is not by praying that you take all these bad things and sickness and pandemic out of

250
00:32:51,320 --> 00:33:00,120
 our lives. Of course that's a worthy prayer, but that is not the main thing. It's that

251
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:09,020
 no matter what circumstances we find ourselves in, with sorrow or with pain, with darkness

252
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:21,600
 and struggles, we pray that you will grant us faith. Grant us obedience. Help us to follow

253
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:31,920
 you no matter what. In good times or in bad times. In good times or in tough times. Help

254
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,920
 us to follow you faithfully and worship you. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.

255
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:48,920
