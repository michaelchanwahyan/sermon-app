1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,840
 Hey family, here we are again enjoying this beautiful Chicago winter. You know

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:08,960
 for a while I thought we were gonna have a really mild winter this year and it

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,000
 seemed that way all the way up until about the middle of January and wasn't

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,760
 that cold, wasn't much snow, seemed like things weren't gonna be that bad and

5
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,040
 then winter just came roaring back and it has not let up since. It has been very

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:25,800
 cold. We've had a crazy amount of snow that we're all trying to dig out from

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,640
 under and we're shoveling snow every day and I know it's probably been a little

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,840
 bit tiring and challenging for all of us and I'm praying for you as you go

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,920
 through it, not just the challenges of shoveling snow and encountering those

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,760
 things but also just kind of the emotional challenges of being isolated

11
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:46,640
 and stuck in the house and not able to do things compounded with already being

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,400
 isolated because of the pandemic. I know sometimes in the winter it just seems

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,160
 dark and dreary and so I'm praying for you all as you encounter just all this

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,440
 winter weather that you'll stay encouraged and that you'll be able to

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,480
 enjoy it at least a little bit. And we're once again gonna be looking in Matthew

16
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,120
 today at the Sermon on the Mount. Today we're looking at Matthew chapter 7 so I

17
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,280
 just want to start off by commending you and encouraging you to give yourself a

18
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,600
 little round of applause or later on today make yourself a little trophy

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,280
 something like that because you've come a long way. The Sermon on the Mount is

20
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,920
 three chapters in the book of Matthew, Matthew 5, 6, and 7. It's the longest

21
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,520
 continuous sermon that's recorded in the Gospels, the longest continuous sermon of

22
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,960
 Jesus. There's a lot of content there and we've been going slowly through it

23
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,480
 taking it a verse or two at a time and so I know it's taken us a while to get

24
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:42,240
 through it. So I commend you for sticking with me, I commend you for your patience

25
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,660
 and perseverance and Matthew 7 is the last chapter we're starting in this week

26
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,200
 so there's a lot at the end of the tunnel, we're getting close to the end

27
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,680
 but Matthew chapter 7 is full of a lot of really good truth for us. I want us to

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,480
 really dig into this chapter and enjoy learning what God has for us and I know

29
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:03,320
 for me studying through the Sermon on the Mount it's it's really kind of life

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,160
 changing. There's so much deep and powerful truth in it and it's just been

31
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:12,000
 so transformative and such a blessing for me. I pray it's been the same for you

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,760
 and this Matthew chapter 7 is no different. In Matthew chapter 7 the first

33
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,560
 section of this passage Jesus is really talking about judging others and so

34
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,600
 that's what we're going to be talking about today, judging others and this is a

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,880
 really important topic and it's really important in our culture and so we're

36
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,920
 going to take our time and look at it over the next few weeks, go through it

37
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,880
 kind of slowly and try to really discover the truth that God has for us

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:41,440
 on this topic and really get a healthy understanding of what Jesus is saying in

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,240
 these verses. Today we're just going to look at Matthew chapter 7 verse 1 and

40
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:51,560
 verse 2 so let's read these together. Jesus says, "Judge not that you be not

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,440
 judged for with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged and with

42
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:03,200
 the measure you use it will be measured to you." Now these verses are very well

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,040
 known Bible verses. Matthew 7 1 is often said to be one of the most popular Bible

44
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:13,680
 verses in the entire Bible. A lot of people know this verse and sometimes

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,760
 people say it's the most popular verse of people who are not Christians, people

46
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,760
 who are not a part of the family of God because they love to quote it to say, "Hey

47
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:28,400
 don't judge, you can't judge, Jesus said don't judge lest you be judged." So you

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,920
 may have heard this verse before, maybe you've heard it as someone has said it

49
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,720
 to you or maybe you've heard someone on TV say it or something like that. It's a

50
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,320
 verse that people say a lot but it's also misunderstood in a lot of ways and

51
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:46,240
 it's difficult to interpret. And what I believe and what I want us to examine

52
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,960
 today is that Jesus here is not saying that we should not judge at all but he's

53
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,000
 saying that we should exercise right judgment when we judge and what he's

54
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,800
 really calling out is having a judgmental attitude. He does not want us

55
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,600
 to have a judgmental attitude and what I think what most people think of when

56
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:11,280
 they say judging is really a judgmental attitude. Obviously a lot of people in

57
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,760
 our culture have a very negative perception of judgment and of judging

58
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,320
 and so a lot of people say, "Well you can't judge others." But I think a lot of

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,240
 times what people are talking about is actually a judgmental attitude that is

60
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,440
 proud or that is hypocritical or that is self-righteous and those are definitely

61
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,200
 things that Jesus wants us to avoid and we're going to talk about that over the

62
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,000
 next few weeks. But Jesus is not saying that we shouldn't judge or that we

63
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,160
 shouldn't make judgments or that we shouldn't exercise discernment. I really

64
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,400
 don't think Jesus is saying that in this verse. And if you just have such a

65
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,920
 negative connotation with with the idea of judgment that it's hard for you to say

66
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,640
 the word or think about it judging something or some circumstance, then you

67
00:04:56,640 --> 00:05:00,760
 can just use the word discernment. Discernment is a biblical word and I

68
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:05,040
 think it's a really good word for us to think about. Discernment refers to being

69
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:11,320
 able to see or recognize or distinguish or apprehend things and so discernment

70
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,720
 is a synonym of judging and it's really an important quality for us

71
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,360
 Christians to have and to be able to exercise. So if you're uncomfortable with

72
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,920
 the concept of judging then you can talk about discernment. I'm going to use

73
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:29,880
 those two terms almost interchangeably as we discuss this. And I think to start

74
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:33,800
 it's helpful to think about what judgment is. We can say, "Well judgment is

75
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,320
 when you judge something, when you make a decision about something."

76
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,360
 And that's true, but I think on a deeper level it helps us to understand that

77
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,720
 judgment is ultimately comparison to a standard. It's when we compare something

78
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,960
 to a standard and say, "Does this line up with the standard? Is this right

79
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,160
 according to the standard?" And for Christians, for followers of Jesus, for

80
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:58,120
 the subjects of the kingdom that we've talked about in the Sermon on the Mount,

81
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:03,560
 that standard ultimately comes from God. It's God's truth. For people who are not

82
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,680
 followers of Jesus, that standard could be a lot of different things. It could be

83
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,040
 their own feelings, it could be what someone else has told them, it could be

84
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:17,240
 all types of different things. It could be cultural values. And for believers and

85
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,520
 people in the church, a lot of times that's true too. Instead of sticking to

86
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,280
 the standard of God's truth, we start to hold on to a lot of different cultural

87
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,680
 values or our own feelings or what someone else has taught us. And that's

88
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,000
 not always healthy. A lot of times that can lead to really unhealthy attitudes

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,120
 and unhealthy judgments. And that can lead to that judgmental attitude that we

90
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,120
 want to avoid and that Jesus is calling us to avoid in this passage. So we want

91
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,360
 to remind ourselves and to always be mindful of the fact that when we are

92
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:51,560
 thinking about discerning something or judging something, we're talking

93
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,440
 about comparing it to God's truth and to God's standard. And remember that God's

94
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,720
 judgment is always rooted in God's justice. God has a standard of justice

95
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,960
 that is above and beyond ours and God's justice transcends our idea of justice.

96
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:10,200
 And we need to understand that. That God's judgment is always rooted in God's

97
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,840
 standard of justice, not ours. And we also need to understand that God's justice is

98
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,560
 rooted in His love. And so even when God exercises judgment, when He compares

99
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,000
 something to a standard, when He asks us to compare ourselves to a standard,

100
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,280
 that's always rooted in love for us. God does not do that to punish us. God does

101
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,560
 not do that to expose our weakness or our failing. God does that because He

102
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,640
 loves us and He wants to grow us and strengthen us and transform us into

103
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,960
 something more beautiful than what we have been in the past. God's judgment and

104
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,800
 justice are always rooted in His love. Now you might look at this verse on the

105
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,640
 face of it and say, "Hey, judge not that you be not judged." I don't see anything

106
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:55,280
 in there about having a judgmental attitude. So why am I saying that Jesus

107
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,600
 is calling out having a judgmental attitude, not just calling out exercising

108
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:04,160
 judgment in this passage? I want to remind you of how we interpret passages

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,760
 in the Bible. We talked about this with some of the other passages in the

110
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:10,200
 Sermon on the Mount that are a little bit more difficult to interpret. There's

111
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,600
 a lot of passages in the Bible we may look at and say, "I don't fully

112
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,560
 understand it," or "it seems confusing," or "is it saying this because it seems like

113
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,440
 that doesn't agree with other parts of the Bible?" And so there's a lot of

114
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,000
 principles of biblical interpretation. We went through some of those when we

115
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,720
 talked about some of those other passages, so we're not going to go

116
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,240
 through all of them again today. But I'm just going to point to a couple that we

117
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:35,880
 can really see in this passage. And that is it's always important to examine

118
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:39,440
 verses in their context, in the context of the verses around them. And that's

119
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,760
 really helpful to look at the passage and see what the passage is saying. And

120
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:47,320
 it's also helpful to examine verses in light of other scripture and other

121
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:51,240
 verses and passages throughout scripture and compare and say, "Okay,

122
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:56,460
 did these agree?" And that helps us to interpret a verse that may seem unusual

123
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:01,020
 to us when we first see it. And this is one of those verses. If we just look at

124
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,300
 Matthew 7, we say, "Judge not that you be not judged." Jesus is clearly

125
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,980
 saying that we should never exercise judgment. But when we look at the context

126
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:14,740
 of this passage, this section in Matthew 7, Jesus is clearly talking about judging

127
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,440
 others and is clearly not saying that we shouldn't do it. He's just calling us to

128
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,160
 do it in the right way. So in verse 6, he's talking about judging and knowing

129
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,680
 when it's appropriate to say something or to reveal something to someone else.

130
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:32,400
 That's an issue of judgment. In verses 15 to 20, he's talking about identifying

131
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,560
 false teachers by the fruits and by the actions of their life. That's clearly

132
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,880
 something where he's telling us to exercise judgment and discernment. So the

133
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,240
 context helps us to see that, but the rest of scripture helps us to see that

134
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,480
 too. Throughout the scripture in the Old and New Testament, God calls on us to

135
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,720
 discern, to exercise judgment. He just wants us to do it in the right way.

136
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,600
 There's even a verse in John 7, verse 24, where Jesus says, "Do not judge by

137
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,560
 appearances, but judge with right judgment." So again, I think the focus of

138
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:09,840
 this passage is not that we should not judge at all, but it's rather that we

139
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:13,920
 should not have a judgmental attitude. And having a judgmental attitude is

140
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,440
 really unhealthy. It's really terrible. It causes a lot of problems. And having a

141
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:23,440
 judgmental attitude is when we make judgments or just try to discern things

142
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,200
 with a spirit of pride and arrogance, when we don't exercise grace towards

143
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,320
 other people, when we don't see how much God has forgiven us, when we don't, we're

144
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:35,320
 not meek, when we're condemning of other people, when we try to sentence other

145
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,320
 people or hold other people accountable, when we judge based upon what we can see

146
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:45,040
 and think that we know someone's intent or heart based upon the outward

147
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,920
 appearance, all those things are wrong. And they lead to hypocrisy and

148
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:53,360
 self-righteousness and all of these hurtful things. And sadly, a lot of that

149
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:57,440
 type of judgmental attitude is found in the church and has been found in the

150
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:02,000
 church. And so Jesus is not saying that he doesn't want us to exercise discernment.

151
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,640
 He's saying he wants us to avoid that judgmental attitude. And we're gonna

152
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:09,560
 examine all of those things over the next few weeks. But today specifically, I

153
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:13,400
 want us to start off by looking at some unhealthy attitudes about judgment that

154
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:18,200
 we probably have on some level. And these are attitudes in the church. They're also

155
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:22,440
 attitudes in culture at large. And sometimes they can kind of slip into our

156
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:25,920
 way of living and our way of thinking and we don't even realize it. But they

157
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
 can cause us to be unhealthy in different ways. So the first thing I want

158
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,040
 us to think about is just the attitude that, you know, no judgment at all is

159
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,560
 acceptable. And this is a pretty common cultural attitude that it's wrong to

160
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:44,280
 judge anything or anybody. It's unkind in some way. And it can seep into our

161
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:47,160
 life. Sometimes in the church as believers we can find ourselves saying,

162
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,680
 "Is it okay for me to even make a decision about certain things or to even

163
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:57,280
 try to discern what's right or what's wrong?" And I think it's clear that

164
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:02,160
 judgment is a necessary part of life. It's an essential part of our daily life.

165
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,960
 You probably already made a lot of judgments this morning. When you woke up,

166
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:10,760
 you probably looked at the alarm clock and based upon what time it was, you made

167
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:14,520
 a judgment decision as to whether or not you could go back to sleep or whether

168
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,240
 you had to get up and get ready to do whatever it was you wanted to do today,

169
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,040
 including get on your computer or your phone or your device so that you could

170
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,680
 view the stream. You made a judgment decision. If you went outside or

171
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,280
 if you're going to go outside later, you'll make a judgment decision then.

172
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:33,560
 You'll look at your phone or something else that tells you the temperature or

173
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,920
 maybe you'll stick your head out the door and just determine the temperature

174
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:40,480
 that way and you'll make a judgment decision based upon that about what you

175
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:45,960
 need to wear in order to stay safe today. And so all of us make judgment decisions

176
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:50,060
 all of the time and ultimately they're essential for our life. We couldn't

177
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:54,480
 function without them. We have to make them in order to be safe and that's

178
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:00,640
 important. And we have to realize that the reality of our world as God has

179
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:05,200
 created it is that not all actions have the same outcome. And that's something

180
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:10,640
 that we don't always want to admit. We want to try to make a world in our own

181
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:14,840
 minds where even if we do something that's not a good idea or it's

182
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,640
 unhealthy, it's still going to turn out great for us. But we can't make a world

183
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,600
 like that. We can't make our world be that way because that's not the world

184
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,320
 God created. God created a world where not all actions have the same outcome.

185
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,440
 And to go back to the illustration I used just a moment ago, if you go outside

186
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,040
 on a day like today in shorts and a t-shirt, that is not going to have the

187
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:42,280
 same outcome as if you go outside in a warm coat. Those are two different

188
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:47,760
 actions and they're going to feel very different depending upon which one you

189
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,080
 choose. And so making judgments helps you choose the action that's going to be

190
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:57,880
 healthy and right for your life and that's a good thing. We need to do that

191
00:13:57,880 --> 00:14:02,560
 as humans and God wants us to do that. And the reality is that all people make

192
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,360
 those types of judgments. So saying that, "Well, we can't make any type of

193
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:11,800
 judgments. We can't discern anything that to even try is unhealthy or unkind

194
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,720
 or something like that." That's not really a good argument because all of us have

195
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,240
 to make those types of judgments about life just in order to function and to be

196
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,240
 safe and to do all the things that we need to do. But maybe we say, "Okay, so

197
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:30,440
 yeah, we have to make judgments about our daily life so that we can function. We

198
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,960
 get that." But the problem is when we begin to judge other people and we begin

199
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:42,840
 to maybe say something that is not affirming of someone else. Well, again, I

200
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:47,240
 would say that that's an unhealthy attitude towards judgment because we

201
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,760
 have to discern things and make decisions about other people. That's a

202
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:56,520
 reality of life. Every relationship that you're in involves making some level of

203
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,440
 discernment and judgment in that relationship. Why? Because relationships

204
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,340
 involve trust. And to trust someone you have to have some knowledge about them.

205
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:09,840
 And so any relationship, whether it's a friendship or someone at work or someone

206
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:16,080
 at school or a much deeper relationship like a marriage, is going to involve

207
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:20,240
 communication. It's going to involve response to that communication. And during

208
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,440
 that process you're discerning, you're saying, "Hey, is this person someone that

209
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,120
 I can trust? If I share the secret with them, are they going to share it with

210
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,200
 someone else? If I become transparent or vulnerable in this way, will I be safe?"

211
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:40,800
 Those are judgment decisions and all of us do that in relationships. All of us

212
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,040
 have to make decisions about who we can trust and who we can share our life with

213
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,600
 and what level we're going to share things with. And there's nothing wrong

214
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:53,760
 with that. That's a necessary part of living life and forming relationships in

215
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:57,720
 the world that we live in. And ultimately relationships would be impossible without

216
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,760
 some form of discernment and judgment. All of us understand that in our

217
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:07,240
 relationships. And again, not all actions have the same outcome. So at some point

218
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:11,120
 we have to be able to discern what's going on in the life of someone else. A

219
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:16,280
 simple example of this is like driving. If you pull up to a four-way stop or a

220
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:20,960
 red light, one of the things that you do is you're looking at the other drivers

221
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,320
 as they come up to the stop. And even if you have the right-of-way and it's your

222
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,960
 turn to go, if you see a driver that isn't slowing down and looks like

223
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,360
 they're going to blow through the stop sign or that they're going to go through

224
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:36,040
 the light even though it's red, then you make a judgment call to protect yourself

225
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,760
 and anyone who's riding in the car that you're in. And you say, "I'm not going to

226
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:43,600
 go even though I have the right-of-way, even though it's my turn to go. I'm not

227
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,640
 going to go because I see the action of someone else and it could harm me or it

228
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:54,400
 could harm the people around me." That's a judgment call and we have to make

229
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:59,880
 those. They're a part of our life. And even in the last year with the pandemic,

230
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:04,440
 we've seen ourselves as humans making so many judgment calls where we look at

231
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,920
 other people and their actions and say, "Hey, are their actions going to protect my

232
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,640
 health? Are their actions going to protect the health of the people around me?" And

233
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:16,160
 we make decisions based upon that. We say, "Okay, well here's what I need to do

234
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,880
 because of what I see someone else doing." Or, "Here's a situation that I can't be

235
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:23,760
 in or something that I can't go to because it might endanger my health." And

236
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,920
 so the reality is we're all making those types of judgments and discernment-based

237
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:34,440
 decisions all the time, even when they involve the actions of other people. And

238
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:39,320
 that's not wrong. It's okay to make those types of decisions. Again, what we want

239
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:44,800
 to avoid is being judgmental in a wrong way towards other people. So maybe we say,

240
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:49,160
 "Well, okay, I get that we need to make judgments in life and even some

241
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,000
 judgments about the actions of others are acceptable, but the problem is moral

242
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,720
 judgments that when we judge things as good or bad, that's really a problem." And

243
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:02,600
 I think that's a criticism that has been leveled at Christians and at the church

244
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,080
 a lot that people have said the problem with Christians is that they make all

245
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,040
 these moral judgments and they're always trying to say what's good and bad and

246
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,920
 that's really the problem. And it just turns people off and it

247
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:17,720
 makes people upset. Well again, I would say that that argument's not really a

248
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,080
 great argument to say that no moral judgments are acceptable. The reality is

249
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,220
 that everyone has a moral standard in their life. And honestly, sometimes we can

250
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,720
 see our moral standard or someone else's moral standard much better by our

251
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:37,760
 reactions than by our actions. What do I mean by that? Well, I mean, we might

252
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,600
 say, "You know what? I get really irritated at someone else because they judge me and

253
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,240
 I took some of their food out of the fridge, my family member, and they're so

254
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,800
 mad at me about it. What's the big deal? It's just a little bit of food." We might

255
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:54,280
 say, "It's not a big deal. My actions aren't that much of a problem." But

256
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:59,720
 our standard is revealed by our reaction. If someone takes something from us, that's

257
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:03,640
 when we reveal our true standard. We might say, "Oh, my standards are easy." But

258
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:08,400
 when someone wrongs us, how do we react? And when someone steals from us, suddenly

259
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,800
 we're angry and they need to be held accountable and they need to

260
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:17,520
 pay everything back to the last penny. A lot of times we can see our moral

261
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,480
 standards more by our reactions than by our actions. And the reality is everybody

262
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:25,880
 has a moral standard. Everybody has things that they think are right and

263
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,640
 things that they think are wrong. And everybody makes moral judgments.

264
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,080
 Everybody looks at things in life and says, "Hey, this is right or this is wrong."

265
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,640
 We again have seen that so much in the last year in our politics. You know, as I

266
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,560
 said, a lot of times this claim about moral judgment not being good or healthy

267
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,160
 is leveled against Christians and people in the church. But we've seen a lot in

268
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:53,720
 the last year, a lot of moral judgments. People saying what is good, what is bad,

269
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,320
 what is right, what is wrong. And the majority of those people are not

270
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:01,000
 Christians. They're not people in the church. Many of them are not even

271
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,240
 religious people, but they've made very strong statements about what is right

272
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:10,960
 and what is wrong. And that shows us that all of us have some standard of morality,

273
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,120
 some standard of what we think is right and is wrong. And we're willing to make

274
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:21,200
 judgments based on that standard. So the real question is, what standard are we

275
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,560
 going to compare to? It's not a question of whether or not we're going to compare

276
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:28,880
 things to a standard, whether or not we think anything is right or wrong. All of

277
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,160
 us have some things that we think are wrong and off-limits for humans. And all

278
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,840
 of us have other things that we think are good and healthy for humans. So

279
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,240
 that's not the question. The real question is, what standard are we

280
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,360
 comparing to? Whose standard are we going to use? And as I said at the beginning,

281
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,760
 for followers of Jesus, our standard is God's truth. For other people, there's a

282
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,800
 lot of different standards. But for followers of Jesus, we want to go back to

283
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:59,040
 God's truth. And we have to understand as believers that making moral judgments

284
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:02,640
 and discernments is actually an essential part of our faith. Again and

285
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,600
 again in Scripture, we're called to not be deceived. We're called to cling to the

286
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
 truth. We're called to be obedient to God. We're called to live righteously. All

287
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:16,360
 this stuff. Well, how do we do that if we are not able to make moral judgments and

288
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,480
 decisions that involve discernment, decisions that involve seeing and

289
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,360
 recognizing and distinguishing and apprehending right from wrong? And so

290
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,440
 ultimately, we have to make moral judgments in life. And Jesus is not

291
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:34,360
 banning us from doing that. He's just calling us to do it in the right way and

292
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:38,280
 in a healthy way and in a way that is not unkind to others. In a way that's

293
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,720
 respectful of others. And as we said at the beginning, in a way that is rooted

294
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:46,120
 and grounded in God's love and grace. God's love and grace for us and God's

295
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,840
 love and grace for others in the world. So like I said, I want us to close out

296
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,960
 here seeing that Jesus is calling us to exercise right judgment and to not have

297
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,280
 a judgmental attitude. Next week, we're gonna get more into the specifics of how

298
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,240
 to avoid having a judgmental attitude. But for this week, I just want us to see

299
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,940
 how important it is that we are able to discern things in life and that we're

300
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:13,560
 able to make healthy judgments and healthy decisions and that we are able

301
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:17,160
 to discern what is right and wrong. What's good for us and what's not good

302
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,680
 for us. And that we're able to look at the world around us and have some

303
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:25,480
 clarity about what's happening. That's so important and Jesus is calling us to

304
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:28,560
 that in this verse. And that's something that we should desire and that's

305
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:31,520
 something that we should practice and something that we should grow in as

306
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:36,200
 believers and as followers of Jesus. We should grow in our ability to discern.

307
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:40,140
 It's something that we can practice and it's a skill that we can develop by

308
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:47,360
 God's grace. And so we want to do that. Let's pray. God, thank you that you give

309
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,160
 us the ability to discern things, to see, and to distinguish, and to recognize. And

310
00:22:52,160 --> 00:23:00,160
 God, we are so weak and limited in ability, God. Our vision is so short and

311
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:04,920
 so God, we need your help. We need your help so much in discernment, in making

312
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,720
 judgments, in understanding what's right and wrong. And so God, I pray that you

313
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,480
 would help us. That you would help us to grow in our ability to do that. That you

314
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:19,680
 would help us to grow in our ability to look at your word and to see what your

315
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:23,200
 word is saying about the issues of our life. That you would help us to grow in our

316
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,520
 sensitivity to listening to the Holy Spirit and how you want to use the Holy

317
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:32,600
 Spirit to speak to us. God, please help us to grow in discernment and in making

318
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:36,160
 right judgments so that we can distinguish right from wrong in our

319
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,640
 lives and we can have loving relationships with others. And God,

320
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,560
 please help us to not be judgmental and unkind and disrespectful in any way to

321
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:50,360
 the people around us, God. Help us to exercise right judgment and right

322
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:55,800
 discernment as we go through life. In Jesus' name, Amen.
