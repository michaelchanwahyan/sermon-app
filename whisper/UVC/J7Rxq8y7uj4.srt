1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:04,640
 - Good morning, church.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,960
 - How do you like the new setting and new arrangement?

5
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

6
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,440
 - Well, let's give a hand to the worship team

7
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,600
 and thank you for leading us.

8
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,360
 And especially the backstage people,

9
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,840
 those people who are hiding back there,

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,720
 they're doing a lot of work, okay?

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,320
 Okay, I can speak a little bit, man,

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,560
 not for too long, okay?

14
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,560
 And then especially (speaking in foreign language)

15
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:43,880
 Okay, okay.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,480
 So we hope and pray that this is a new beginning

17
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:50,120
 for our church, especially this service.

18
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,600
 And as you know, it's a beginning for our church

20
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:01,000
 and today we are trying to have this bilingual service.

21
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

22
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,240
 And we announced it last Sunday.

23
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,200
 And I wanna again thank all the staff

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,680
 and all the people who serve.

26
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

27
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,520
 As you know, the church is never a one man band.

28
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
 (speaking in foreign language)

29
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:20,960
 And it's a family.

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,440
 It takes every single one of us to work together,

32
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,640
 to grow together.

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,480
 As you know, nine years ago,

35
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,280
 when we launched our church in this small warehouse.

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

37
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,520
 And how many people we had?

38
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,760
 We had about, what, 30 to 40 people?

39
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

40
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:45,240
 And today, by the grace of God,

41
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,240
 and we have grown into a 100 plus adult community.

42
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:55,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

43
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,760
 And this year, we wanna challenge you

44
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,760
 with this theme, crossover.

45
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,200
 As you can see, break our barriers and our boundaries

47
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,560
 and join together to build up the church.

48
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

49
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,720
 And to reach out to new people.

50
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

51
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,560
 So that we and each and every one of us

52
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,080
 will be touched by the love of God.

53
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,160
 Now, as we begin, I wanna ask one question.

55
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

56
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:28,920
 What kind of church God want us to become?

57
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

58
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,640
 Now, same in this question,

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,720
 what kind of church God want us to become?

60
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

61
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:39,360
 You see, we have been studying the book of Acts.

62
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

63
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,520
 And it's a book filled with wonderful stories.

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

65
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,440
 It's a book filled with inspiring pictures

66
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,400
 of the first church, the first people of God.

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:55,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

68
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
 It's kind of like you take your iPhone

69
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,960
 and you go back, you time travel,

70
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,960
 go back to the first century

71
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,080
 and try to take selfie of the church in Jerusalem.

72
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

73
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:11,440
 You take some selfies of the life of the church back then.

74
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:17,320
 Now, those picture will tell you they are

76
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,920
 the ideal community.

77
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,560
 And Acts 2 is a good example.

78
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,040
 Let me read this passage.

79
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

80
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,520
 Let me read that verse by verse and will be translated.

81
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,920
 Verse 42, "They devoted themselves to church in Jerusalem,

82
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,840
 "the first church of God, to the apostles' teaching

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,280
 "and to the fellowship and breaking of bread and to prayer."

84
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

85
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,240
 "Everyone was filled with awe and many wonders

86
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,080
 "and miraculous signs were done by the apostles."

87
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

88
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,680
 "And look, all the believers were together

89
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,960
 "and had everything in common."

90
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

91
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:04,080
 "They sell their possessions and goods

92
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,760
 "and they gave to everyone that had need."

93
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:10,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

94
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,400
 "And every day they continued to meet together

95
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,120
 "in temple courts and they broke bread in their homes

96
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,840
 "and ate together with glad and sincere hearts."

97
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:22,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

98
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:30,800
 "They praise God and enjoy the favor of all the people

99
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,480
 "and the Lord add to the numbers daily

100
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,160
 "those who are being saved."

101
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

102
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,880
 "Now I wanna focus on this verse 42."

103
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

104
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:49,640
 "It says they devoted themselves

105
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
 "to the apostles' teaching and to fellowship."

106
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

107
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,520
 "And you can imagine it gives you a picture

108
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,400
 "of Christians working hard and persistently together."

109
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

110
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,080
 "And see they're dedicated, they're devoted

111
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,600
 "to the teaching of the Bible."

112
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

113
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
 "And they overcome challenges and issues

 "to maintain the fellowship family together."

 (speaking in foreign language)

116
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,920
 "Now this is called commitment."

117
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

118
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,680
 "And what does it take to build a church?"

119
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

120
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,640
 "It is commitment."

121
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

122
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,440
 "Commitment is not based on your feeling, your emotions,

123
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,120
 "it's based on values."

124
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:36,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

125
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,400
 "It's based on what you keep doing something,

126
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,040
 "even when it doesn't feel excited anymore."

127
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

128
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,320
 "And today many people see church as gym membership."

129
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

130
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
 "Now how many of you have gym membership?"

131
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

132
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,040
 "Yeah, okay, very good, very good, yeah.

133
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,040
 "We wanna encourage that, but to many people,

134
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:05,560
 "gym membership is you sign up and you go

135
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,480
 "when you feel like it."

136
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

137
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,680
 "And then you don't go, you disappear for weeks,

00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:15,240
 "and then probably you come back when you feel like it,

139
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,680
 "and then hopefully you get some quick results."

00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

141
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,560
 "And nobody sees you, nobody holds you accountable."

 (speaking in foreign language)

143
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,440
 "The commitment is not like that."

00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

145
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,480
 "Commitment is having a training partner."

 (speaking in foreign language)

147
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,280
 "It's not just membership, having a partner in training

148
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,800
 "is that you show up even when you are tired."

00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

150
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,840

152
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,600
 "And you and the partner will push

 (speaking in foreign language)

160
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,200
 "It's the people you work with."

 (speaking in foreign language)

162

166
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,080
 "Now let me tell you a story.

 "My family, my family,

168

 "we came to the United States in 1990."

169
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,760
 That's how many years ago.

170
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

171
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,400
 "So we came to the United States as immigrants, foreigners,

172
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,560
 "and we came in 1990 and life was really hard

 "My goodness, we work around the clock."

184
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

185
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,320
 "We save every penny, we are scavengers,

186
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,280
 "we try to take everything possible for our benefit."

187
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

188
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,840
 "Now this mode of living is like, it's a mode of survival."

189
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

190
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,400
 "Now it's very understandable

191
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,840
 "and there's underlying feeling of fear."

192
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

193
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,480
 "You see, we foreigners, we immigrants,

194
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,120
 "at least we, my family, we work hard and we stay quiet

195
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,440
 "and we want to protect ourselves."

196
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:43,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

197
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,680
 "We don't trust other people."

198
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

199
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,920
 "We don't share with other people."

200
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

201
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,960
 "Because we want to survive because of fear,

202
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:53,120
 "fear of losing our money, our asset, our security,

203
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,400
 "our place of stay."

204
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

205
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:05,120
 "That is our natural mode of survival."

206
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,240
 But for the first church in Jerusalem,

207
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,800
 for the first Christians in Jerusalem,

208
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,640
 life was hard as well.

209
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

210
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,760
 They face challenges and even persecutions.

211
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

212
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,520
 But surprisingly, they continue to grow

213
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:24,760
 and they continue to fly and expand.

214
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

215
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,760
 And now we have to ask why.

216
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

217
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,840
 You know, because they were committed.

218
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

219
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:41,040
 Commitment says, "I am not just interested, I'm invested."

220
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:45,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

221
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,560
 "I'm not here just when life is easy,

222
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,000
 "I'm here because it matters."

223
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

224
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:58,760
 See, that's what happens when the Holy Spirit takes over.

225
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

226
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,280
 And then people, their lives will cross over

227
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,520
 from fear to faith, from surviving to serving.

228
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:11,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

229
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,840
 No, the entire Bible,

230
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,480
 God did not come to save individual people only.

231
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

232
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,640
 The Holy Spirit came and formed a new people.

233
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

234
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:27,760
 A new kind of community.

235
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

236
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,080
 So here's my challenges for you today.

237
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

238
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,800
 Be committed.

239
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

240
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,960
 The Bible says the church is a family we belong to.

241
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

242
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:43,760
 And I've served in different churches for years.

243
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

244
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,560
 And I've learned one thing,

245
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,480
 my relationship with others in the church is reciprocal.

246
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

247
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,520
 And the more I love the church,

248
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,520
 the more I serve the church,

249
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:00,200
 the church, interestingly, will love you back.

250
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

251
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:06,440
 It's reciprocal because we need to grow in the community.

252
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

253
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,680
 So today my challenge for you is to create a new schedule.

254
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

255
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,200
 And the new schedule says commitment.

256
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,240
 It says Sunday worship is not negotiable.

257
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:23,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

258
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,280
 Because you do talk about priority.

259
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,440
 My priority is God.

260
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

261
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,960
 Now, you understand Christians are always under spotlight.

262
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,800
 We are always watched by the world.

263
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

264
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,840
 Whether you like it or not,

265
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,560
 I give you an example of very vivid illustration.

266
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,560
 Just last week, we are all, our social media,

267
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,680
 is all flooded by a video of a couple,

268
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,920
 a cop having an affair in a Coldplay concert, right?

269
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:59,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

270
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,880
 And sometimes, you know, stuff like this,

271
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,360
 you know, I think the most interesting thing

272
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,880
 is the comments.

273
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,960
 (speaking in foreign language)

274
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,280
 Now, one comment says, if they, the couple,

275
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:14,840
 had not tried to escape the camera

276
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,440
 or, you know, tried to get away from the camera,

277
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,920
 maybe everything would turn out fine, right?

278
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

279
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:30,320
 And another reply was very surprisingly and entertaining.

280
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
 It says, "You're already here,

281
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,760
 "and what is there to be afraid of?"

282
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:38,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

283
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:40,800
 In any case, I mean, you have to understand

284
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,440
 the church question, we questions,

285
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,280
 we are always in the public eyes.

286
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

287
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,200
 And we need to rely on the grace of God

288
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,880
 to set a good example.

289
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,480
 (speaking in foreign language)

290
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,360
 And we questions, we, the church,

291
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:01,600
 need to be camera-ready all the time,

292
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,840
 and we need to be always ready,

293
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,480
 and that calls for commitment.

294
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

295
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,400
 And commitment says, "I'm interested, I'm ready, I'm live."

296
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:20,560
 (speaking in foreign language)

297
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,480
 And see, commitment says, "I'm going to worship God

298
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
 "and put God as my number one

299
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:28,320
 "with other believers of Jesus in the community."

300
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

301
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:36,120
 And the second point, on top of being committed,

302
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:37,960
 is be connected.

303
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

304
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,200
 Start to connect with other people in the church family.

305
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

306
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,520
 Now, you have to do your job,

307
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,320
 you have to take the initiative to get to know each other,

308
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,560
 and then pray for one another.

309
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

310
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,560
 Now, on your way in, I think a Jinfan

311
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,920
 already gave you a slip of paper, right?

312
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

313
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,200
 Have you got it?

314
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,280
 Okay, all right.

315
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:06,000
 So you write your name in the slip of paper, right?

316
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

317
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,680
 Did you?

318
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,120
 Okay, if not, we're gonna pass it to you right now.

319
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

320
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,840
 All right, how many of you got it?

321
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,360
 Okay, this is something we wanna do together, okay?

322
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

323
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,560
 Now, you have your name on the slip of paper.

324
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

325
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,120
 All right, and then we're going to mix it up, okay?

326
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

327
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,680
 All right, so Jinfan, please,

328
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,840
 you're gonna distribute it to all the people,

329
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,120
 and then when you get this slip of paper,

330
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,040
 write down your name.

331
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,520
 Don't scribble it, okay?

332
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,880
 Write down, you know, capital letters,

333
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,440
 or write clearly your name, okay?

334
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

335
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,680
 And then we're gonna mix it up.

336
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

337
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,880
 And then when you pick up a slip of paper

338
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,160
 with someone else's name on it,

339
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

340
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,600
 and then you're gonna learn that name.

341
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

342
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,840
 Okay, and then, in this coming week,

343
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,880
 you're gonna pray for that person every single day.

344
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

345
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,560
 Okay, should we do it now?

346
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

347
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:16,080
 Let's do it now, let's do something together, all right?

348
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,760
 So, there are some pens back there,

349
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,040
 some pencil back there.

350
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,040
 You are free to leave your seat right now,

351
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,040
 and go and get some pencil,

352
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,960
 and write down your name, and give it to Jin--

353
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,800
 Huh?

354
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,640
 - I already did it, I already did it.

355
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,480
 - Some people already did it, okay, good.

356
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,400
 - I did for them.

357
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,520
 - Oh, you did for them, okay.

358
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,360
 - Nice.

359
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,400
 She's going to distribute some of the slips of paper

360
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,240
 to other people.

361
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

362
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,880
 Okay, so you pick up a slip of paper.

363
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:43,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

364
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,560
 Check the name.

365
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,560
 Make sure the name is not your name, okay?

366
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,680
 You're not gonna pray for yourself, okay?

367
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,520
 (speaking in foreign language)

368
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,440
 Make sure the name is not your name, all right?

369
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

370
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,400
 Then it should go well, all right?

371
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,480
 And then, what do you do?

372
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

373
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,800
 Learn that name, all right?

374
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

375
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,400
 Well, learn to pronounce it.

376
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,240
 - Yeah.

377
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
 - Learn how to write it. - (speaking in foreign language)

378
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,920
 - Okay, that is the name you wanna keep

379
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,280
 that person accountable in your prayers.

380
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,120
 This week.

381
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,440
 (speaking in foreign language)

382
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,680
 Okay, everybody got it?

383
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,520
 Can you, can you raise your hand?

384
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,600
 Oh, okay, I got two.

385
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:19,440
 - Thank you, thank you, I got it.

386
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,280
 - Yeah, sure, yeah.

387
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,720
 Let me check if this is my name.

388
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,560
 - Yeah.

389
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:23,680
 - All right, I got a very good name.

390
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,520
 - Yeah.

391
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,360
 - All right, so this is what you do after the service.

392
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,280
 (speaking in foreign language)

393
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,920
 You try to go to that person.

394
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

395
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,920
 Are you this guy?

396
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,760
 (speaking in foreign language)

397
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,200
 All right, you're gonna ask, okay?

398
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,040
 (speaking in foreign language)

399
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,360
 See, it takes initiative.

400
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

401
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,680
 Okay, and then say hello.

402
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:44,880
 (speaking in foreign language)

403
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,720
 Say hi.

404
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,280
 All right, in the community, right?

405
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:48,120
 (speaking in foreign language)

406
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:49,440
 All right, so you pick up this name,

407
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,960
 you're gonna pray for that person every single day.

408
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:55,640
 (speaking in foreign language)

409
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,080
 Now, you learn that name,

410
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,440
 and then maybe you can strike a conversation

411
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,600
 with the person.

412
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

413
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,040
 And then you can ask,

414
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,760
 how can I pray for you this week?

415
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,240
 (speaking in foreign language)

416
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,280
 Okay?

417
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,920
 Now, you don't have to dig around for some,

418
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:12,360
 you know, you don't have to invade privacy, okay?

419
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,960
 Just pray for my work or something like that, okay?

420
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,800
 (speaking in foreign language)

421
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,280
 Be polite, okay?

422
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,400
 We're all adults, okay?

423
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,720
 You know, learn that person, I mean, it's gonna be fun.

424
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,560
 - Yeah. - All right?

425
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,600
 (speaking in foreign language)

426
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:26,880
 Okay, so remember what you do?

427
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,720
 (speaking in foreign language)

428
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,360
 I'm gonna remind you after the sermon, okay?

429
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
 - Okay.

430
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:33,520
 - What I'm saying is be committed and be connected.

431
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

432
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,920
 And we can build the church together,

433
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,120
 we can serve God together.

434
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

435
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,280
 Shall we?

436
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,720
 Shall we?

437
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

438
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,800
 Let us pray.

439
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

440
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,480
 Thank you, Lord Jesus,

441
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,960
 you never held back your love for us.

442
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

443
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,440
 And you are committed to us to redeem us.

444
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,320
 (speaking in foreign language)

445
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,920
 And today we ask in our prayer

446
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,920
 to make us a committed people,

447
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:06,160
 faithful, devoted, and rooted in you.

448
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:10,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

449
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:14,280
 And truly give us the courage to serve

450
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,440
 even when it is inconvenient.

451
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,360
 (speaking in foreign language)

452
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,640
 And dear God, help us to love even when it's not returned.

453
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,200
 (speaking in foreign language)

454
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,880
 And Jesus teach us to make you our number one priority.

455
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,080
 With our time, our hearts, our gifts, and our whole lives.

456
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,000
 (speaking in foreign language)

457
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,960
 Because we are yours.

458
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

459
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,400
 Help us to live like that.

460
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:43,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

461
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,400
 In your name we pray.

462
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,400
 (speaking in foreign language)

463
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,240
 Amen.

464
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,160
 - Amen.

465
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,000
 - Amen.

466
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,480
 Okay, so one more reminder.

467
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,360
 You got that?

468
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,760
 Okay, now is a good time, okay?

469
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,080
 I'll give you five minutes, you know,

470
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,040
 you can mix and match and find that person, okay?

471
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:57,880
 Find it.

472
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,000
 If you don't know, ask about it, okay?

473
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,840
 (speaking in foreign language)

474
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,480
 All right, so you can get up and go around the room

475
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:05,720
 and learn that person's name, okay?

476
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,920
 (speaking in foreign language)

477
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:09,760
 All right.

478
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,000
 (audience laughing)

479
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,320
 And by the way, we have some refreshments outside

480
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,160
 and you--

481
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:19,080
 (speaking in foreign language)

482
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:22,240
 (audience chattering)

483
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:26,160
 (speaking in foreign language)

484
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:30,760
 (gentle music)

485
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:34,180
 (gentle music continues)

486
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:37,600
 (gentle music continues)

487
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,020
 (gentle music continues)

488
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:45,040
 (gentle music continues)

489
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:47,620
 (upbeat music)

490
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:50,200
 (upbeat music)
