1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,840
 - Well, good morning.

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:04,640
 It's fantastic to be here and enjoying worshiping

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,480
 with you all.

4
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,280
 Thank you to the worship team for leading us

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,980
 in worship this morning.

6
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:09,820
 I'm excited to be here.

7
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:11,360
 I love being at UV.

8
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,500
 I love Christmas time.

9
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,500
 This is a really fun time of the year.

10
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,520
 And to begin with, I'm gonna ask you

11
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,320
 to use your imagination for just a moment

12
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,680
 and imagine one of the announcements that we just heard,

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,600
 the Christmas dinner, the UV Christmas dinner.

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,940
 It's been a few years since I've been to one,

15
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:30,400
 but I used to be at the UV Christmas dinner every year.

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,320
 And so just imagine that in your mind,

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,280
 or if you haven't been to one,

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,400
 you can imagine another feast that you've been at.

19
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,400
 Think about all that food that is there

20
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,420
 just spread out on the mini tables,

21
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,340
 and it's so amazing and so good.

22
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:45,440
 One of the problems that I have

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,160
 when I get to a feast like that

24
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,680
 is there's so much good stuff and I wanna eat all of it,

25
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,240
 but I know that I physically cannot,

26
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:55,120
 so I have to kind of choose what I'm gonna eat, right?

27
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,060
 And there's so many options, so many choices.

28
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:00,620
 And the reality is we all have favorites.

29
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,540
 We all have kind of our go-tos,

30
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,300
 especially at a big feast like that,

31
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:05,860
 the things that we want.

32
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:09,460
 And so sometimes, at least what I do,

33
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,820
 is I go to the things I know I really enjoy,

34
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,260
 to my favorites.

35
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,420
 And even though there's other really good stuff,

36
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,420
 I never actually get to it.

37
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,060
 I never try some of those other things

38
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,460
 just because I always end up eating my old favorites

39
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:23,900
 and I can't eat it all.

40
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,560
 And so there's something off to the side

41
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,440
 that I forget about.

42
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,900
 And sometimes that happens to us

43
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,840
 with the themes and the stories of Christmas and Advent.

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,420
 It's literally like a feast.

45
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,200
 There's so much to think about

46
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,360
 in terms of theologically and spiritually

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,960
 in terms of Advent and Christmas.

48
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,400
 And there's so many beautiful themes here

49
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,300
 of Jesus coming to earth.

50
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:53,720
 We have the marvel of the miraculous virgin birth,

51
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,640
 supernaturally conceived by the Holy Spirit.

52
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,800
 We think about the miracle, the incarnation,

53
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,560
 that the word was made flesh,

54
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,320
 God was made human, Emmanuel, God with us.

55
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,920
 That's one of my favorite themes, such a powerful theme.

56
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,840
 We think about the unveiling of Jesus as Savior

57
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:13,680
 and the verse that we heard earlier from the worship team

58
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,400
 where the angel spoke and said,

59
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,660
 "This is good news for the whole world."

60
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,040
 All of those themes are so beautiful

61
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,520
 and they're the heart of the gospel.

62
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,120
 And so we should enjoy them,

63
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,220
 just like our favorite foods at the feast.

64
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,520
 We should go to those places every year

65
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,600
 and be encouraged and blessed by them.

66
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:35,040
 But we can't forget about some of the other themes.

67
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,680
 And that's what we're gonna talk about today,

68
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,880
 a theme that is here in the story

69
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,060
 that maybe sometimes we just forget about

70
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,240
 because some of the other themes are so thrilling to us.

71
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,180
 And that is that Jesus came as king.

72
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:50,400
 That when Jesus came to the earth,

73
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,120
 the king was born, the king of the kingdom.

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,480
 And what that means for us,

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:00,800
 because the incarnation and the nativity story is beautiful,

76
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,440
 but it didn't just stop there.

77
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:05,080
 It went on, obviously, to the cross.

78
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,340
 But during the ministry of Jesus,

79
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:09,000
 he talked about the kingdom of God a lot.

80
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 He talked about the kingdom that was and is and is coming.

81
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,720
 And Jesus gave us this theme.

82
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,400
 So that's what we're gonna consider this morning.

83
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,920
 We're gonna look at it in Matthew chapter two,

84
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:23,480
 because interestingly enough,

85
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,520
 even though there's a lot of people in the Christmas story

86
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,940
 who didn't say anything about the king,

87
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,880
 didn't seem to get that,

88
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,180
 this one group of people did.

89
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,560
 These people from a whole 'nother land,

90
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,820
 these Gentiles from another land, they were not Jewish,

91
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:43,480
 but they understood that the coming of Jesus

92
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,320
 was the coming of a king.

93
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,920
 And they traveled all this way to come see him

94
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,480
 as the wise men or the magi.

95
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,120
 So we're gonna look at the verse 12 verses

96
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,160
 of Matthew chapter two.

97
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,240
 It says, "Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea

98
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,680
 "in the days of Herod the king,

99
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,720
 "behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,860
 "saying, 'Where is he who has been born king of the Jews?

101
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,560
 "'For we saw his star in the east

102
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,480
 "'and have come to worship him.'

103
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,760
 "When Herod the king heard this,

104
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,440
 "he was troubled and all Jerusalem with him.

105
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,060
 "And assembling all the chief priests

106
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,040
 "and scribes of the people,

107
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,560
 "he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

108
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,520
 "They told him, 'In Bethlehem of Judea,

109
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,120
 "'for so it is written by the prophet,

110
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,520
 "'and you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,

111
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,140
 "'are by no means least among the rulers of Judah.

112
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,640
 "'For from you shall come a ruler

113
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,160
 "'who will shepherd my people Israel.'

114
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,960
 "Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly

115
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,040
 "and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared.

116
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,200
 "And he sent them to Bethlehem,

117
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,640
 "saying, 'Go and search diligently for the child.

118
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,720
 "'And when you have found him,

119
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,520
 "'bring me word that I too may come and worship him.'

120
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,240
 "After listening to the king, they went on their way.

121
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,400
 "And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose

122
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,440
 "went before them until it came to rest

123
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,660
 "over the place where the child was.

124
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,800
 "When they saw the star,

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,480
 "they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy.

126
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,660
 "And going into the house,

127
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,640
 "they saw the child with Mary's mother.

128
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,860
 "And they fell down and worshiped him.

129
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,040
 "Then opening their treasures,

130
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,620
 "they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.

131
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,620
 "And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod,

132
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,900
 "they departed to their own country by another way."

133
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:17,220
 Well, these guys, this is an amazing part

134
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,940
 of the Christmas story and supernatural and miraculous,

135
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:22,180
 like so many other parts of the Christmas story.

136
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,500
 And there's a lot of stuff we could talk about here.

137
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,860
 We could talk about the star.

138
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:28,020
 That's one of my favorite parts

139
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,200
 of the story of the wise men.

140
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,860
 We could talk about just them.

141
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,100
 They're very interesting

142
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,260
 'cause there's so little information about them.

143
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,780
 Obviously, in tradition,

144
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:40,380
 people assume there was three of them,

145
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:44,780
 but that's not told to us in the scripture.

146
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,860
 It's just the three gifts.

147
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,740
 So people assume there was three people.

148
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,340
 But there probably actually were more.

149
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:54,200
 They probably would have traveled in a much larger group.

150
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:56,700
 And even if there were just three,

151
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,320
 they would have had a lot of servants with them.

152
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,660
 So this was not just a couple of people.

153
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,780
 This was a large group of people,

154
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,500
 which is one of the reasons that it says in verse three,

155
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,460
 "When Herod the king heard this,

156
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,400
 "he was troubled in all Jerusalem with them."

157
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:10,740
 Whatever was going on was big enough

158
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,220
 that throughout the city of Jerusalem,

159
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:13,680
 people were taking notice.

160
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,260
 So this was a large group of people that came.

161
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:18,960
 But think about the journey that they went on.

162
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,620
 These are not Jewish people.

163
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,920
 We don't know exactly where they're from.

164
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,800
 They're from the east,

165
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:29,160
 but probably from the region of Persia,

166
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,220
 which there was a large Jewish community in Persia

167
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:35,500
 that had been there since the time of the exile.

168
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,080
 And so that's probably how these men had been exposed

169
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,560
 to the scripture and to the prophecies.

170
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,560
 But they traveled an enormous distance at enormous cost,

171
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,800
 gave up months of their life to pursue something

172
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,160
 that they couldn't see,

173
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:01,160
 that they didn't really know what they were pursuing after.

174
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,000
 And they were doing it on the basis

175
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,980
 of their faith and belief

176
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:10,060
 in the prophecies of the Hebrew scripture.

177
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,940
 And so these are actually pretty extraordinary individuals

178
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,760
 in an extraordinary part of the story.

179
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,560
 And one of the things that's really interesting

180
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,420
 is that here they come into Jerusalem

181
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:24,380
 with all these people who are Jewish,

182
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,600
 who know the scriptures,

183
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,540
 who have been anticipating the Messiah,

184
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,020
 and yet they're not getting it.

185
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:36,140
 They're not seeing that the king is being born

186
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,180
 and that this is happening right now.

187
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:41,740
 And the guys who do get it are these people

188
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,740
 from a distant land

189
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,300
 that God has supernaturally drawn and brought.

190
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,060
 And one of the things that lets us know

191
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
 when we think about the king,

192
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,420
 Jesus as the king and the kingdom that he came to bring,

193
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,780
 is that if we're gonna see the king

194
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,060
 and know what's happening,

195
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,260
 we've got to believe in the kingdom.

196
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:03,820
 That was one of the real differences

197
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:06,380
 between the wise men, the Magi,

198
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:09,260
 and the rest, Herod and the rest of the people

199
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,700
 who just didn't know what was going on.

200
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:14,380
 The Magi obviously had been drawn by the spirit of God.

201
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,020
 They didn't just come up with these things on their own.

202
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,960
 God drew them through the scriptures

203
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,400
 and drew them towards God's truth,

204
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,620
 and they believed it by faith.

205
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:29,840
 They had to have enormous faith to begin this journey

206
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,980
 and to continue on this journey.

207
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,380
 When you think about how long their journey was,

208
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:38,540
 they had to start at some point,

209
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,980
 had to have a lot of faith just to start,

210
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,740
 but then they traveled through the desert

211
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,300
 and traveled and traveled and traveled,

212
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,280
 and they had a lot of faith to keep going, to continue,

213
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,380
 to not say, okay, this was a fun camping trip,

214
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,160
 we enjoyed it for a while, but it's time to go back

215
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,460
 because it's not making sense to me anymore.

216
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,580
 Things are getting tough, things are getting challenging.

217
00:08:55,580 --> 00:09:00,580
 These men believed in the kingdom.

218
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,980
 They believed that it was real.

219
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,500
 They believed that they were going to see,

220
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,580
 as they said in verse two,

221
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,900
 where is he who's been born king of the Jews?

222
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,940
 They believed that this king was being born.

223
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,340
 That's why they were traveling.

224
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:17,140
 And if they didn't, they wouldn't have made this journey.

225
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:22,300
 But the other people who didn't see it, who didn't get it,

226
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,580
 didn't believe in this kingdom.

227
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:29,300
 They thought the kingdom of the Jews was Herod.

228
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,940
 They thought the king of the Jews was right in front of them.

229
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,660
 Herod certainly thought that.

230
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,380
 They didn't see the kingdom that God was beginning,

231
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,460
 and so they didn't have any idea

232
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:41,180
 that the king was being born.

233
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,100
 They didn't believe it, they didn't see it.

234
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,100
 Now, that's not surprising.

235
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,500
 Jesus, in John 18, 36, he's talking to Pilate.

236
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,340
 This is at the very end of his life.

237
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:56,340
 Jesus answered, "My kingdom is not of this world.

238
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,700
 "If my kingdom were of this world,

239
00:09:57,700 --> 00:10:00,020
 "my servants would have been fighting,

240
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,780
 "that I might not be delivered, O, to the Jews,

241
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,460
 "but my kingdom is not from this world."

242
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,580
 So it's not surprising that a lot of people missed it

243
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,980
 because Jesus was coming to set up a spiritual kingdom,

244
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,180
 not a physical kingdom.

245
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:13,260
 But that's something that we need to understand.

246
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,220
 That's a challenge for us, too.

247
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,540
 Because the kingdom of God is not a physical place,

248
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,500
 it's not a country on the map,

249
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:25,940
 we can miss out on how significant it is,

250
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,520
 and the world around us certainly doesn't see it,

251
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,660
 certainly often doesn't believe in it.

252
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,940
 The kingdom of God is a kingdom that has come,

253
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,700
 and that is coming, and that will come.

254
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:39,220
 It's the rule and reign of God,

255
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,580
 and it's existed since before the world began,

256
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:45,540
 and Jesus made it real in every way when he came to Earth

257
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,540
 and perfectly lived out the values of the kingdom of God,

258
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,100
 and by his life and death, opened the way for us

259
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,660
 to have relationship with God.

260
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:55,940
 The kingdom has come in that sense,

261
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,600
 but it is coming because it is not yet

262
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,780
 fully manifested here on Earth.

263
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:06,500
 It is partially manifested in us.

264
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:11,500
 Since Jesus came and died and started this new group

265
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:17,540
 of people, this new kingdom that we call the church,

266
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:20,620
 as we live under the rule and reign of God in our lives,

267
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,100
 and we live out the values of the kingdom,

268
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,260
 the love, the joy, the peace that God has called us to,

269
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,320
 we manifest the kingdom of God, right?

270
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,740
 We manifest the rule and reign of God in our lives,

271
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,900
 but there's a whole lot of people on our world

272
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,480
 who are not living under the rule and reign of God,

273
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,700
 and so the kingdom of God is not fully manifest,

274
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:44,140
 and that's why we continue to have a lot of problems,

275
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,140
 a lot of brokenness, a lot of injustice and war

276
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,220
 and all these terrible things,

277
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:52,140
 because the kingdom of God is not fully manifest,

278
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,740
 so even though it has come in Christ, it is still coming.

279
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,300
 It is not fully manifest yet.

280
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:59,780
 It will be fully manifest one day in heaven,

281
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,180
 and we know what the scripture says

282
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,100
 in Revelation chapter 21, these verses that say,

283
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,140
 in verse four, "He will wipe away every tear

284
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,180
 "from their eyes, and death shall be no more.

285
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,860
 "Neither shall there be mourning nor crying

286
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,820
 "nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.

287
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,280
 "And he who was seated on the throne said,

288
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,220
 "Behold, I am making all things new."

289
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,860
 The kingdom will be fully manifested in the future,

290
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:26,580
 and every brokenness will be healed,

291
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,660
 and there will be no more tears,

292
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,580
 and there will be no more death or sin or injustice,

293
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:36,940
 but we're not there yet, so the kingdom has come.

294
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,180
 It is coming right now through us,

295
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,860
 and it's coming in the future in heaven,

296
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,860
 but because it's not a physical kingdom,

297
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,900
 to believe in it requires faith,

298
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,180
 just like the wise men had to really believe

299
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,760
 that at the end of their journey,

300
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,180
 they were gonna find this king,

301
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,920
 otherwise they would have never stayed on the journey.

302
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,820
 We have to believe by faith that God's kingdom is real,

303
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,900
 and we have to believe that what God has said

304
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:10,380
 in his word is true, that God did lovingly create us

305
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,460
 in his image, that we have fallen away because of our sin,

306
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,660
 that we need a redeemer and a savior,

307
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,220
 that God in his love sent Jesus to be that savior.

308
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,260
 We have to believe those things by faith.

309
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,340
 If we don't, we're not gonna see the kingdom.

310
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,660
 We're gonna miss it.

311
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:27,500
 We're gonna miss what's happening right in front of us,

312
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,460
 just like Herod and all the other people.

313
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,820
 It was happening right in front of them,

314
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:32,620
 and they totally missed it,

315
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:35,420
 because they weren't looking with eyes of faith

316
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,700
 to see what God was doing,

317
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,540
 and so we have to look with eyes of faith and say,

318
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,580
 yeah, we believe what God is saying.

319
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,260
 There is a kingdom here.

320
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,040
 It's a spiritual reality that's bigger

321
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,540
 than anything in our physical reality,

322
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:53,540
 but it's not visibly manifested right in front of us,

323
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:56,720
 but we believe it by faith,

324
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,720
 and because we believe it by faith, we can know the king.

325
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,380
 That's the next thing that we see here,

326
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,260
 is that if we want to know the king,

327
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:09,460
 then we have to surrender to his reign.

328
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:13,000
 It's one thing to believe in the kingdom and to say,

329
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,180
 okay, I believe that it's real,

330
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:20,220
 but it's a whole 'nother matter to say,

331
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,000
 not only do I believe the kingdom is real,

332
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,120
 but the king is my king,

333
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,060
 and I'm gonna surrender to the reign of this king in my life,

334
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,620
 and if we think about what it means

335
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,840
 to be a follower of Jesus,

336
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,380
 that's what it means to follow after him.

337
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:38,760
 That's what it means to be a Christian.

338
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,440
 To come into the kingdom is what happens by grace

339
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,620
 through faith, where we acknowledge and say,

340
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,820
 I know I've sinned, I need a savior,

341
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:50,260
 and we trust in Christ to be our savior.

342
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,520
 That's how we come into the kingdom,

343
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:56,100
 but to live day by day as a follower of Jesus,

344
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:59,500
 we have to consistently, moment by moment,

345
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,060
 live out this process of surrender and saying,

346
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,300
 God, you're the king of my life,

347
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,300
 and I wanna live under your rule and reign,

348
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,340
 and that means I'm gonna live according to your values

349
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,520
 and your ideas, not my own or not anyone else's,

350
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:17,560
 and if we're gonna know the king, that's what we have to do.

351
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,960
 Now, that makes us uncomfortable, right?

352
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,920
 Even thinking about living under someone's reign

353
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,720
 makes us uncomfortable.

354
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,080
 There's a lot of reasons for that.

355
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:31,860
 Part of that is cultural, 'cause we live in America

356
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,640
 where we're very uncomfortable with monarchs, right?

357
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,640
 And there's nothing wrong with that.

358
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,800
 We're uncomfortable with monarchs for a good reason, right?

359
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,760
 Because we're very familiar with tyrannical forms of rule,

360
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,040
 and we're very uncomfortable with that,

361
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,100
 but this is a different type of kingdom.

362
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:51,000
 The kingdom of God is a perfect reign

363
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,160
 from a perfect kingdom with a perfect king.

364
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,800
 There's no tyranny involved at all.

365
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:00,540
 In Matthew 20, Jesus speaks about the type of leadership

366
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,380
 that he gives.

367
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:02,400
 He's talking to the disciples.

368
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,880
 He says, "You know that the rulers of the Gentiles

369
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,340
 "lorded over them, and their great ones

370
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,760
 "exercised authority over them.

371
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:07,960
 "Shall not be so among you,

372
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,800
 "whoever would be great among you would be your servant."

373
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:12,960
 And then he says, "Even as the Son of Man

374
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,040
 "came not to be served, but to serve,

375
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,520
 "and to give his life as a ransom for many."

376
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:21,600
 Jesus himself said he didn't come to dominate people.

377
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,320
 He came to serve.

378
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,760
 This is a different type of king.

379
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,040
 But just because he's a servant,

380
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,120
 don't think that he's not a king.

381
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,280
 We sang that Andrew Peterson song earlier, "Is He Worthy?"

382
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,200
 And that song quotes some of the scripture

383
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,680
 from Revelation 4 and 5.

384
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,680
 In Revelation 4 and 5, you have this vision.

385
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:42,720
 John has this vision of heaven and what's going on there.

386
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,680
 And in chapter four, he talks about the throne

387
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,360
 and the worship of the creator.

388
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:48,320
 I'm not gonna read it right now,

389
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,480
 'cause there's a lot of verses.

390
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,620
 But if you have time, you can look at it later.

391
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,120
 And he describes these amazing creatures,

392
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,800
 these amazing angelic creatures,

393
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,640
 that are worshiping God every moment of every day.

394
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,920
 It says they do not cease to worship God

395
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,760
 in verse eight of chapter four.

396
00:17:06,760 --> 00:17:08,520
 And all they say is, "Holy, holy, holy

397
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,680
 is the Lord God Almighty,

398
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,000
 who was and who is and who is to come."

399
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,380
 And there's just this amazing scene

400
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,960
 of power and majesty and worship going on.

401
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,680
 And then in chapter five,

402
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:26,640
 it describes Christ, who's sitting on the right hand of God.

403
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,160
 And there's this angel in verse two

404
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,600
 who's proclaiming with a loud voice,

405
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,720
 "Who's worthy to open the book and to break the seals?"

406
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,240
 And it says, "No one," verse three,

407
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,320
 "No one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth

408
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,700
 was able to open the book and to look into it."

409
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:40,820
 No person, no human, no angel, no demon,

410
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,560
 no force, no power, anyone in the entire universe

411
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,680
 has the power to open this book.

412
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:51,440
 And John begins to weep in verse four,

413
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:54,480
 because no one can open the book.

414
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,880
 And one of the elders says to him, verse five,

415
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,720
 "Stop weeping.

416
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,880
 Behold, the lion, this is from the tribe of Judah,

417
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,440
 the root of David, has overcome,

418
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,980
 so as to open the book and its seven seals."

419
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,740
 And then we go on in the chapter,

420
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:12,360
 and the book is opened, and in verse 11,

421
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,040
 it says, "And I looked and I heard the voice

422
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,440
 of many angels around the throne,

423
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:16,840
 and the living creatures and the elders,

424
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,440
 and the number of them was myriads and myriads

425
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,880
 and thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice,

426
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,440
 "Worthy is the lamb that was slain

427
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,480
 to receive power and riches and wisdom

428
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,280
 and might and honor and glory and blessing."

429
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,240
 Every being, every power in heaven

430
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:38,120
 begins to praise Jesus, because of his worthiness,

431
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:41,480
 the worthiness of his sacrifice, the lamb who was slain.

432
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,480
 And then verse 13, "And every created thing,

433
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,760
 which is in heaven and on the earth

434
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,720
 and under the earth and on the sea,

435
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,000
 and all things in them, I heard saying to him

436
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,360
 who sits on the throne unto the lamb,

437
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,080
 be blessing and honor and glory and dominion

438
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:54,800
 forever and ever."

439
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,360
 Everything else in creation joins this song of worship.

440
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,760
 First you have all of the heavenly beings

441
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,960
 and the heavenly powers praising Jesus,

442
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:08,160
 and then you have everyone on earth and every creature

443
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:12,600
 and everything on earth begins to join this song of worship.

444
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,060
 Verse 14, "And the four living creatures kept saying,

445
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:19,080
 "Amen, and the elders fell down and worshiped."

446
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,080
 Every thing in the universe worships the king.

447
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,960
 So yes, Jesus is a servant.

448
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,400
 He loves us, he cares for us,

449
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,320
 but don't think that he's not a king, because he is.

450
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,180
 Scripture makes that so clear.

451
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:43,880
 And the world tempts us to choose to surrender

452
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:47,760
 to other things and tries to get us to serve

453
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,540
 other imposter kings, other false kings.

454
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:54,240
 And the world lies to us, the world says,

455
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,920
 "Well, the choice is between either serving God

456
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,800
 "and obedience to God and freedom."

457
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,220
 It gets old to serve God, it gets old to be a part of church,

458
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,740
 there's stuff that you're supposed to try to live right,

459
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,040
 and that's not fun.

460
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,960
 Be free and come over here and do whatever you want, right?

461
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,200
 That's the false choice that the world gives us.

462
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,340
 Well, that choice is a lie.

463
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:18,200
 It's a lie because there's no freedom from

464
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,240
 without a freedom to.

465
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,800
 And it's not a choice between serving God and being free.

466
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,720
 It's a choice between serving God

467
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,620
 and serving some other imposter king, that's the choice.

468
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:33,160
 Are you gonna serve the true king,

469
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,040
 who by the way as we just read is a loving and good king,

470
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,680
 who will lead you into, in a loving and good way,

471
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:43,160
 into abundant life, or are you gonna serve

472
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,420
 some imposter king?

473
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,540
 Are you gonna serve self, or serve materialism,

474
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,720
 or serve power, or money, or achievement,

475
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:55,200
 or the influence of other people?

476
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,520
 You're gonna serve somebody, right?

477
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,640
 Bob Dylan wrote a song about it.

478
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,680
 It's actually a pretty good song if you've never heard it,

479
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,040
 you can listen to it sometime,

480
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,280
 called "Gotta Serve Somebody,"

481
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,400
 and that's the point of the song,

482
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,600
 is saying listen, you're either gonna serve God

483
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,120
 or the devil, but it doesn't matter who you are,

484
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,680
 you can't get around it.

485
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,080
 You're gonna serve somebody in the end.

486
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,620
 And it's true.

487
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,680
 That's the choice.

488
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,400
 It's not between surrender to the reign of the king

489
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,920
 and freedom.

490
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,480
 It's between surrender to the reign of the king

491
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:28,400
 and serving somebody else, or someone else.

492
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,040
 And what we will find is that every one

493
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:33,080
 of those imposter kings, no matter what it is,

494
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:36,280
 will end up being a tyrannical ruler in our lives,

495
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:40,080
 and will harm us and ultimately destroy us.

496
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,860
 The only good king is King Jesus.

497
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,200
 He's the only one.

498
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:52,400
 And the New Testament talks about the kingdoms,

499
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,680
 it uses this metaphor of the kingdom of darkness

500
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,480
 and the kingdom of light.

501
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,360
 Colossians 1, 12 to 14 says this,

502
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,160
 "Give me thanks to the Father who has qualified you

503
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,280
 "to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.

504
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,600
 "He has delivered us from the domain of darkness

505
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,400
 "and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,

506
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:11,360
 "in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins."

507
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,120
 And that's the king and the kingdom that we wanna be in.

508
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,560
 The kingdom of light, the kingdom of his Son.

509
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:22,160
 Now this passage doesn't tell us

510
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:24,640
 that the wise men made this surrender.

511
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,080
 We know they believed in the kingdom enough

512
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,960
 to come see the king.

513
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,480
 We don't know necessarily if they, by faith,

514
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,200
 trusted in Jesus.

515
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:34,560
 Perhaps they did.

516
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,400
 I think you could make that argument, certainly.

517
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,880
 We don't know for sure.

518
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:42,480
 They certainly were sensitive to God and obedient to God.

519
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:47,480
 But for us, obviously salvation is a one-time event.

520
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,200
 We don't have to do that over again.

521
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,840
 We come and we put our trust in Christ.

522
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,840
 That happens once.

523
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,960
 But the surrender to the king is a moment-by-moment process.

524
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,080
 That's not a one-time event.

525
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,600
 We don't say, "Okay, Jesus, I wanna follow you.

526
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,120
 "I'm surrendering to your reign.

527
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,960
 "I'm done.

528
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,200
 "I'm never gonna be tempted to walk out

529
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,400
 "out of bounds ever again."

530
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,520
 No, it's a moment-by-moment process of saying,

531
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,920
 "God, I need to surrender to you in this area of my life.

532
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,020
 "I'm tempted to follow some other imposter king.

533
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:18,400
 "Maybe it's me.

534
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,720
 "Maybe it's something else, but I've gotta surrender to you."

535
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,720
 We've gotta constantly be checking where our allegiance is.

536
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,920
 And it's a repeated surrender.

537
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,600
 And if we live under the reign of the king,

538
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,800
 then we experience the blessings of the kingdom.

539
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,360
 There's so many things that we could talk about,

540
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,000
 and the most significant ones are the forgiveness of sins,

541
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,920
 the transformed life that comes through Jesus,

542
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,840
 the eternal life that's promised.

543
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,480
 But even if you think about the advent themes

544
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,880
 that we often talk about during advent,

545
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,960
 the candles that represent hope, peace, joy, and love,

546
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,560
 those are things that come to us

547
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,160
 as we live under the reign of the king.

548
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,820
 We have hope because the kingdom has come,

549
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,660
 and it is coming.

550
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,360
 We have peace because the king who loves us

551
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,520
 is in perfect control of our world, and we are his.

552
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:07,400
 That gives us peace.

553
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:11,280
 We have joy because every need is met

554
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,880
 in our relationship to the king.

555
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,680
 We have love because we're freed

556
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:20,520
 from the transactional nature of broken relationships

557
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,440
 that we experience in this world,

558
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:25,520
 and we're free to truly love the king and others

559
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,980
 without fear.

560
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,500
 We can experience true love.

561
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,280
 Now, the world desperately needs the blessings

562
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,120
 of the kingdom.

563
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,940
 We want 'em as individuals,

564
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,560
 but the world desperately needs that, right?

565
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,600
 We look at our world, and we see war,

566
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,320
 we see suffering, we see injustice,

567
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,000
 we see all these terrible things,

568
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:43,120
 and sometimes our heart cries out,

569
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,400
 and we say, "God, why is this happening?

570
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,240
 "How long?

571
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,300
 "When are you going to change things?

572
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,260
 "If only there was some way

573
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:52,360
 "that we could be changed as human beings.

574
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:56,080
 "If only we could be transformed to be a lot less selfish

575
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,060
 "and stop hating each other and fighting each other.

576
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:01,480
 "If only there was a way for this to happen."

577
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,480
 And God says, "Yeah, I've made a way,

578
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,400
 "but if you wanna experience the blessings of the kingdom,

579
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,040
 "you gotta surrender to the reign of the king."

580
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:14,180
 And we need to understand that.

581
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,840
 We desire the blessings of the kingdom.

582
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,340
 We crave them.

583
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,400
 We chase after them.

584
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,680
 But we all wanna find them

585
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,100
 by building our own tower of Babel to heaven

586
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,720
 instead of just going and surrendering to the king

587
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,580
 who is gonna offer those blessings to us.

588
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,240
 So as we close out, I just wanna be practical for us.

589
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,280
 How do we continue in this process

590
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,480
 of surrender to the reign of the king?

591
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,160
 If it's a process, moments by moment,

592
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:40,360
 we say, "Okay, well, if I'm a follower of Jesus,

593
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,200
 "I wanna do that."

594
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,620
 What does that look like in our lives?

595
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:43,720
 How do we do that?

596
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:47,520
 In the scripture, in the Old Testament and the New Testament,

597
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,680
 there's this metaphor that's used so much

598
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,640
 about the path or the way

599
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,400
 that describes the lifestyle of following Jesus.

600
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,360
 And the early Christians actually were called

601
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,440
 followers of the way.

602
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,280
 And so that metaphor is really strong in our faith.

603
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,800
 I think that's a good illustration for us

604
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,720
 to think about following Jesus kind of as a map,

605
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,240
 as a pathway, right?

606
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,480
 And scripture gives us turn-by-turn directions.

607
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,280
 Like if you think about GPS or your Maps app,

608
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,600
 it tells you how to get somewhere,

609
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,440
 it gives you turn-by-turn directions, right?

610
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,200
 Scripture gives us all kinds of turn-by-turn directions

611
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,760
 about how we're to relate to God,

612
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,000
 how we relate to one another,

613
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,400
 how we're to live our lives

614
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,000
 in all these different areas of our lives, right?

615
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,360
 And God's given us the Holy Spirit to speak to us

616
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,800
 about staying on course

617
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,360
 and staying in fellowship with Him,

618
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,240
 just like the Map app talks to you, right,

619
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,280
 when you miss a turn

620
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:42,600
 and tells you that you missed the turn, right?

621
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,680
 The problem is a lot of times we don't,

622
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:49,720
 in the illustration that we're using here,

623
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,320
 we don't consult the Map app

624
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,840
 and we don't listen when it tells us

625
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,680
 we've made a wrong turn.

626
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:55,800
 We just keep doing our own thing, right?

627
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,080
 And that's what it means for us

628
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,180
 to moment-by-moment surrender to the King,

629
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,120
 to continue to soak ourselves in Scripture

630
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,880
 and go back to what God has said and say,

631
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,840
 "God, am I living under your rule and reign,

632
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,260
 "or am I following some other alternate map

633
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:16,160
 "that's provided by me or by my friends

634
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:19,140
 "or the world around me or culture or some celebrity?

635
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,240
 "Am I following another map, or am I following your map?"

636
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,920
 And we listen to the Holy Spirit,

637
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,700
 and the Holy Spirit is good,

638
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,200
 and He lets us know when we're out of fellowship

639
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,700
 and we feel spiritually distant from God

640
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,560
 or we don't wanna be in church, we don't wanna worship.

641
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,560
 God lets us know.

642
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:38,800
 But we have to listen to that

643
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,000
 and not be like I am sometimes when I miss my turn

644
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,980
 and then I drive 10 more miles, right?

645
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,520
 Sometimes in life, I get out of fellowship with God

646
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,080
 and six months later, everything's unhealthy,

647
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:54,560
 and I finally figure out, oh yeah, something's wrong.

648
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,120
 And God's like, "Yeah, I've been trying to let you know

649
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:58,120
 "for the last six months.

650
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,160
 "You made a wrong turn back there, way back there."

651
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,000
 Right?

652
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,380
 And so that's how we surrender

653
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:06,700
 to the reign of the King moment by moment.

654
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,020
 We keep going back to Scripture and saying,

655
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,300
 "God, am I aligning with what your map is for my life?"

656
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,460
 We listen to the Holy Spirit.

657
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:17,100
 "God, can you communicate to me in my heart

658
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,840
 "and let me know when I'm making a wrong turn

659
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,860
 "and get me back on course?"

660
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,740
 And then we surrender to it, we obey it.

661
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,220
 We say, "God, you know what?

662
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,380
 "I don't really like what I'm reading right now.

663
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,260
 "I don't really like what the Holy Spirit's telling me.

664
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,740
 "I don't want to be unselfish.

665
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,920
 "I don't want to care about someone else.

666
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,460
 "I wanna make this about me,

667
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:37,360
 "but I'm gonna surrender to it because you're the King

668
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,340
 "and I wanna live under your rule and your reign."

669
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,800
 Let's pray.

670
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:49,440
 God, we just thank you that you came as Savior.

671
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,240
 You came to rescue us, to redeem us.

672
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,620
 But we also thank you that you came as King.

673
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:58,640
 Help us to not just receive you as Savior

674
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,340
 and rejoice in the forgiveness of our sins and stop there.

675
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:06,740
 Help us to go on to acknowledge that you're the Lord,

676
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,580
 you're the King, you're the ruler,

677
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,860
 and help us to choose to live under the rule

678
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:13,420
 and reign of your kingdom,

679
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,720
 to manifest the values of your kingdom in our lives

680
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,140
 to those around us, God.

681
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,840
 In Jesus' name, amen.
