1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,500
 Good morning family. I'm excited that we get to be together again and open God's Word again today.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,700
 We're continuing on in Matthew chapter 7, the end part of the Sermon on the Mount here.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:17,000
 And today we're going to be looking at verses 21 to 23. So let's read these together.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,500
 "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven,

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,500
 but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:36,000
 On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name

7
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,500
 and do many mighty works in your name?' And then I will declare to them,

8
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:47,500
 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"

9
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:52,000
 These are some really good verses but really challenging verses, really scary verses.

10
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Jesus is showing us that not everyone who thinks they know God actually does know God.

11
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 And that's what we're going to talk about today, how we can know that we know Jesus

12
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,500
 and know that we have a genuine and authentic relationship with Him.

13
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,500
 And I'm going to remind us that in this part of the Sermon on the Mount,

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:13,500
 Jesus is wrapping up the Sermon on the Mount and He's giving us words of application.

15
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,500
 We've been talking about that the past few weeks.

16
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,500
 And so this is an important application to our own hearts.

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:26,000
 And in this passage, Jesus is shifting the focus from evaluating others to evaluating ourselves.

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,500
 If you remember the verses that we read last week and the message that we talked about last week,

19
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:34,500
 Jesus was talking about evaluating false prophets or false teachers

20
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:39,000
 and how we could evaluate their lives and their teaching to discern

21
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,500
 if it's something that we should allow to influence us.

22
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 And these verses are the verses that immediately follow the passage we read last week.

23
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,500
 It's definitely related, but Jesus is shifting the focus.

24
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,500
 He's encouraging us now to evaluate ourselves, to evaluate our own hearts

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:02,000
 and think about our own relationship to God and our own standing in the kingdom of God.

26
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 And Jesus is teaching us that kingdom values are not simply about good works.

27
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,000
 We've been talking about kingdom values for almost a year now.

28
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
 We've been in this study and it's been really good.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,000
 But one of the things I want us to see and see very clearly as we discuss this passage today

30
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,500
 is that kingdom values are not just a list of do's and don'ts.

31
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:28,000
 That to be a follower of Jesus, we just have to check the boxes and do the right stuff

32
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,000
 and stay away from the wrong stuff. That's not what kingdom values are about.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:39,500
 We can get that idea sometimes because as humans, we want to make our faith into a ritualistic religion.

34
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,500
 It's just a part of human nature. All of us want to do that.

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,000
 We gain security and a feeling of safety if we feel like we know exactly what we're supposed to do

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,500
 and we're doing it. And so we always try to do that.

37
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,000
 We see that everywhere in the world in religion.

38
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 We see people trying to make it about works and doing good things and checking boxes and keeping the list.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 And we just want to do that.

40
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 But Jesus is showing us here that that's not what kingdom values are about

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 and that's not what a relationship with God is about.

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,500
 And I want to remind us here that Jesus, as he's speaking in the Sermon on the Mount,

43
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,000
 he's speaking to a very diverse crowd like we talked about when we began this study.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
 But he's speaking to a lot of people that are very devout.

45
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:28,000
 So Jesus is speaking to religious people, people who are serious about their faith

46
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 and serious about following God.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,000
 And many of these people would have been Jewish people who were trying to please God

48
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
 through the system of the Old Testament law.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 And we know that some of the Pharisees would have been in this crowd

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
 and the Pharisees had created this works-based religion.

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,500
 But it was not true to God's faith that was revealed in the Old Testament.

52
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,500
 That's one of the interesting things.

53
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:56,000
 If you go back and look at the Old Testament, you see that God, even in the Old Testament,

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,500
 was calling people into relationship with him.

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,000
 The men and women who were heroes of the faith in the Old Testament

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 are men and women who walked with God and who had a relationship with him and who trusted him.

57
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 You can see that.

58
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 Look at their lives and read about their stories.

59
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 They are pointed to in the Old Testament because they knew God and had a relationship with him,

60
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 not because they checked all the boxes and kept a list of good works and bad works.

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 They were obviously righteous people that honored God and loved him and followed him

62
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 and they did good things.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
 But that was not the reason that Scripture points to their lives in the Old Testament.

64
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:38,000
 So even in the Old Testament, God is calling us into relationship to him.

65
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 But by the time Jesus was on the earth, many people misunderstood that.

66
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 The Pharisees had twisted the Old Testament law into this works-based religion.

67
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:52,000
 So a lot of Jesus' listeners in the Sermon on the Mount were coming from that paradigm

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 of a really works-based religion.

69
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 They were very serious, they were very devout, but they were very focused on good works.

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 Jesus is pointing out to them that being his follower, living in the kingdom of God,

71
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 being a Christian, is not about a works-based religion.

72
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 It's about a relationship with God and ultimately with Jesus.

73
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
 And it comes through the work that Jesus was here on earth to do.

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 And we're going to talk about that today.

75
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
 But I want to point us to this truth first.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 I want us to consider this, that following Jesus is not simply a matter of correct understanding

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 about truth or correct doctrine or correct thinking.

78
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 It's not simply a matter of correct understanding.

79
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Now that's important for us to get.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
 Understanding is important.

81
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
 We need to have a correct understanding of truth.

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 In fact, you can't know Jesus without a correct understanding of truth,

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
 of the truth of who he is and why he came to the earth.

84
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
 You can't know him.

85
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
 But here's the thing that we need to understand.

86
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 You can have a correct understanding of who Jesus was and of the truth about Jesus

87
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 and still not know Jesus.

88
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 And that's really significant.

89
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 We need to see that here.

90
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 We don't know Jesus simply because we're orthodox in understanding of truth or doctrine.

91
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
 That's not what brings us into salvation.

92
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 That's not what brings us into relationship with God.

93
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 And Jesus is pointing us to that here in verse 21.

94
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 He says, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven,

95
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
 but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven."

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Jesus is referring to people who are acknowledging that he is Lord.

97
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 These are not people who don't believe in Jesus.

98
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,000
 These are not people who don't believe that he existed or that he was the Son of God.

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
 These are people who have a correct understanding.

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 And Jesus is saying there are people who will have a correct understanding.

101
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 They will understand that he is Lord.

102
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
 They will understand that he is God, but they still will not fully believe

103
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 and will not actually know God.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 They will understand things correctly, but not know God.

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 And Jesus is pointing us to that.

106
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 Romans 10, 9, which is a really important verse about salvation,

107
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 tells us how we enter the kingdom of God, how we enter into relationship with God.

108
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
 It says this, "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord

109
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

110
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 And there are two really important factors in that verse.

111
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 We have to understand it.

112
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
 We have to understand the truth about Jesus, that he's the Lord, that he's the Savior,

113
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 that his death on the cross paid the penalty for our sins.

114
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 We have to understand that.

115
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 But we have to go beyond simply understanding it,

116
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 simply giving it mental assent and saying, "Yeah, I can assent to the fact that that is true."

117
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 And we have to believe it.

118
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:48,000
 We have to put our trust in that truth and in that reality.

119
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 And that's what Jesus is pointing us to here in verse 21.

120
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 He's saying there are people who will understand that I'm the Lord.

121
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:00,000
 They will understand who they are before me, but they are not believing it.

122
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 They are not putting their trust in it.

123
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
 And because of that, they don't actually know me.

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 There's a verse in James 2 where James is talking about our works

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 and the relationship between our faith and our works.

126
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 And he says this really interesting thing.

127
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:24,000
 He says in verse 19, "You believe that God is one, you do well, even the demons believe and shudder."

128
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
 And what's James saying in that verse?

129
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,000
 He's saying, "Hey, if you believe correctly about who God is, that's great.

130
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,000
 But that doesn't mean you have a relationship with God just because you understand the correct nature of who God is."

131
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
 He says, "Even the demons know who God is.

132
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
 They tremble. They are afraid of God because they know exactly who He is.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 They know exactly how powerful God is.

134
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
 They have a correct understanding of who God is and who Jesus is as the Son of God

135
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
 and of the power of God and of the sovereignty of God in the universe.

136
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 They understand that, but they don't have a relationship with God.

137
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:05,000
 Obviously, they are full of evil works and full of terrible things.

138
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 And that's a really important thing for us to see.

139
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 Because sometimes in the church, we think, "Well, I'm pretty sure I know Jesus.

140
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 I know God because I understand some things about God.

141
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 I know some of the truth. I know some of the right doctrine.

142
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
 I have an orthodox understanding of who God is."

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,000
 But Jesus is telling us here that it's not just enough to have a right and correct understanding.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,000
 That we need to have belief and trust in Jesus, and we need to have relationship with God.

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 Another way that helps me think about this is if you think about the difference between knowing about someone and actually knowing them.

146
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 You can think about someone that you admire, maybe a famous person that you admire in our world.

147
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 Maybe it's a celebrity, maybe it's an athlete or a musician or someone who's in the movies.

148
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 Or perhaps it's someone who is some famous intellectual or an author that's written books that you love.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
 But think about someone that you admire in our world.

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 You may know a lot about that person.

151
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 You may know when they were born.

152
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
 You may know something about their personal life.

153
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
 Maybe you've read on Wikipedia about them or from other sources.

154
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 And so you know something about their marriage or their family or when their birthday is.

155
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 You may know all kinds of things about that person.

156
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 And if you're in a conversation with someone else, you may be able to tell those things.

157
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 Say, "Yeah, this person, they were born here and they grew up here and they spent five years in this place.

158
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
 This is where they went to college."

159
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,000
 You may even give the impression to someone else in a conversation that you know that person because you have so much information about them.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 But that doesn't mean you know them.

161
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 That doesn't mean that if they were walking down the sidewalk and you saw them, that you could go up to them and say,

162
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
 "Hey, it's great to see you," and that they would have a conversation with you like a friend.

163
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:06,000
 Because you can know all kinds of things about someone but not actually know them and have relationship with them.

164
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 And I think that's a helpful illustration of what Jesus is saying to us in this verse.

165
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,000
 He's saying it's not enough just to know about God.

166
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 Even if you know the right stuff, even if you have a correct understanding of who God is and who Jesus is, that's not enough.

167
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 He needs to go beyond that to belief and to trust.

168
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And if you want to be sure that you know Jesus, then you have to do more than just know about God and have a correct understanding.

169
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 You need to have your trust in Him.

170
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:40,000
 You need to be believing in Him for salvation.

171
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 The next thing I want us to see is that following Jesus is not simply a matter of doing good works.

172
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
 And this is so important. This is hugely important.

173
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 In verse 22, Jesus says, "On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name and do many, many works in your name?'

174
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,000
 Then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me.'"

175
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 The people in verse 22 are people who had done some really good works.

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 And they said that they'd even done those works in the name of Jesus.

177
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 But Jesus says that they don't know Him.

178
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,000
 And we have to understand that. We have to wrap our minds around that.

179
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 And the church, as followers of Jesus, as people who are trying to live out the values of the kingdom, we have to understand

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 that following Jesus is not simply a matter of doing good works.

181
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 We don't know Jesus because of the good things that we do.

182
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
 And that's really important for us to understand.

183
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:53,000
 As I said earlier, it's so easy for us as humans, as a part of our nature, to try to make our faith about some type of system of good works.

184
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
 And about a checklist and about things that we can see and tangibly do.

185
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 And say, "I know I'm right with God. I know it's okay because I can see it.

186
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 And I tangibly did this. And I tangibly did that. And that makes me feel good."

187
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,000
 And that's not the basis of our salvation in Christ.

188
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 It is not through our works or through our efforts or through our performance or through anything that we do.

189
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 That is not how we know God.

190
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,000
 And Jesus is pointing us so clearly to that right here in this passage.

191
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 And this is important for us to understand, especially in our modern day.

192
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
 Especially for young people in the world that we live in.

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,000
 There is so much focus on doing the right thing on morality in our world.

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And that's a good thing because we want to be right before God.

195
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
 We want to do what's right.

196
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
 As followers of Jesus, that's an important focus for us to have.

197
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 But often, the emphasis that our world gives us, especially for younger people,

198
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 is on doing the right thing, advocating for the right causes, volunteering in the right places, being a part of these things.

199
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,000
 And that if we do that, then that makes us a good person.

200
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
 And we can feel like everything is okay.

201
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
 Now those things are morally therapeutic.

202
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And what I mean by that is they make us feel good morally.

203
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 They make us feel like, "Yeah, I am a good person. I volunteered and I helped someone else.

204
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 I am a good person. I advocated for this cause."

205
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Or, "I am a good person because I went to this protest or I was a part of this event."

206
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 Or, "I tried to help in this way."

207
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,000
 Those things are morally therapeutic. They make us feel good.

208
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,000
 But they do not mean that we know Jesus.

209
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
 And they do not get us into heaven.

210
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
 And we need to understand that.

211
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
 Jesus is describing people in this verse that have done not just small works, but amazing good works.

212
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 And said they were doing them in His name.

213
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 These people said they had prophesied.

214
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 They had spoken words from God about the world around them in the name of Jesus.

215
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
 They said they had cast out demons.

216
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
 They had done supernatural miracles in the name of Jesus.

217
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
 And many mighty works.

218
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 They said, "We have done this big, huge, difficult, hard, supernatural, amazing things in your name.

219
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:10,000
 That is why you should let us into heaven.

220
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 That is why you should believe that we know you.

221
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 That is why we should be okay with you, Jesus.

222
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 Because we have done all this mighty stuff in your name."

223
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 And Jesus says, "I do not know you."

224
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 That is one of the powerful and deeply challenging things about being a follower of Jesus.

225
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,000
 And about the ethics of being a Christian.

226
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
 The ethics of the values of the kingdom.

227
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 Is that in Christian ethics, God calls us to do the right thing.

228
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 And to do it for the right reason.

229
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 And that stands apart from other moral systems in our world.

230
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:51,000
 Other religions and other moral systems say, "As long as you do the right thing, you are okay."

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 If you give to the poor, then you did a good work.

232
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 You gave to the poor and that is all you need to do.

233
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,000
 It is fine if you give to the poor out of a selfish motivation because you are trying to look good in front of other people.

234
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Or if you give to the poor out of a selfish motivation because you want to gain something from it.

235
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 That is okay. You did the good work and that is all you need to do.

236
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:18,000
 But our faith, the values of the kingdom say, "No, you have to do the right thing and do it for the right reasons."

237
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
 In 1 Corinthians 13, Paul talks about doing good works.

238
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,000
 And he talks about the fact that if we are not motivated by the love of Christ and the love of God,

239
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 then those good works are ultimately in vain.

240
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 That they do not have the meaning that we think they do.

241
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 They do not have the significance that we think they do.

242
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:38,000
 He says that they are just like banging cymbals together.

243
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,000
 They are just like making a bunch of noise.

244
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
 But they are not actually having any deeper significance.

245
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 And that is because God is calling us to do the right thing with the right motivation.

246
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 God is calling us to do something that is coming out of our relationship to Him.

247
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Not because we are trying to prove our relationship to Him.

248
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 Not because we are trying to gain a relationship to Him.

249
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,000
 Not because we are trying to please God in some way.

250
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:09,000
 But God is calling us to do good works that are an overflow of our relationship to Him.

251
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,000
 Now good works are really important.

252
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
 Obviously, the values of the kingdom matter.

253
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
 We have been talking about them for a long time.

254
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
 So they are very important.

255
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,000
 And we want to walk in them and we want to live them.

256
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,000
 But we want to walk in them and live them for the right reason.

257
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
 We do not want to walk in them and live them because we are trying to prove that we are right with God.

258
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
 And we are trying to earn salvation.

259
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,000
 We want to walk in them and live with them because they are an evidence of God's salvation.

260
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 They are an evidence of what God is already doing in our life.

261
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 And they are an overflow of that change that God is bringing about.

262
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 We do good works because we are saved.

263
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
 Not in order to be saved.

264
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 And we need to understand that as followers of Jesus.

265
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 That is clear in this verse.

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,000
 If we think we are doing good things in order to be right with God,

267
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 then we are missing the point and we are not right with God.

268
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,000
 But if we are doing good things because we are right with God,

269
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 because Jesus saved us and redeemed us,

270
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
 and those good things are an overflow of that relationship,

271
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 that is the place God wants us to be.

272
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 And I want to say this.

273
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
 You cannot know Jesus without doing good works.

274
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
 The verses we read last week make that clear.

275
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 That if you know Jesus, if you are a genuine follower,

276
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 and you genuinely love Him,

277
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 then good works are going to come.

278
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 You cannot know Jesus without doing good works.

279
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 But you can do good works without knowing Jesus.

280
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 And that is really important for us to understand.

281
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 Just like the matter of correct understanding.

282
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 You cannot know Jesus without a correct understanding of who He is.

283
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 But you can have a correct understanding and not know Him.

284
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 The same is true in our actions.

285
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 If we know Jesus, we are going to please Him with our lives.

286
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 It is going to happen.

287
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 He is going to work in our hearts and change us,

288
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 and we are going to do things that are pleasing to Him.

289
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 But we can do things that look good and not know Him.

290
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
 And that is what verse 22 is telling us.

291
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:08,000
 So if following Jesus is not just about a correct understanding and doing good works,

292
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
 then what is following Jesus about?

293
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 How do we know that we know Jesus?

294
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 Well, the Bible is clear.

295
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 It is much more simple than we can imagine.

296
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Following Jesus is simply a matter of trust in the forgiveness and grace of the cross.

297
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,000
 Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone.

298
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
 What I mean by that is it is by grace alone.

299
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 We do not deserve it.

300
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
 We do not earn it in any way.

301
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 It is an unmerited gift that God gives to us in His grace and love for us.

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 And it is by faith alone.

303
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,000
 Because we do not grab hold of it by anything that we do.

304
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,000
 We simply trust in the sacrifice that Jesus gave on the cross.

305
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
 We trust in the fact that God loved us.

306
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 That Jesus came into our world because of that love for us.

307
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 That God wanted a relationship with us.

308
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 That Jesus came into our world because of God's desire for a relationship with us.

309
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,000
 And that Jesus lived a perfect life, did not sin, and because of His perfection,

310
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 He was able to give His life in our place as our substitute on the cross as a perfect sacrifice.

311
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 And that because of what He did in our place as our substitute,

312
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 that all of our sins can be forgiven by God.

313
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:26,000
 That God placed His justice and His wrath on Jesus on the cross.

314
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 The stuff that we deserve, Jesus took it in our place.

315
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
 And because of that, we can experience complete forgiveness,

316
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,000
 complete healing and freedom from sin.

317
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 That is the good news of the gospel.

318
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
 And we believe that by faith.

319
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
 We do not grab hold of it by our good works or by anything else we do.

320
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 We believe it by faith.

321
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:51,000
 We say, "God, I trust You that that is why I have a relationship with You."

322
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 Because of what Jesus did, not because of anything that I do.

323
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 We know Ephesians 2, 8 and 9, it talks about it's not our works.

324
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:02,000
 It's not anything that any of us have done.

325
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 It's not anything that any of us can brag about or boast about.

326
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 It's because of Jesus and His gift of giving His life for us on the cross.

327
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 Following Jesus is simply a matter of trust in the forgiveness and grace of the cross.

328
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 That's how we come to salvation.

329
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:20,000
 That's how we begin relationship with God.

330
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 And if you've never done that, then that is open to you at any time, at any moment.

331
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:28,000
 Even right now, you can begin that relationship with God

332
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,000
 through believing that Jesus is who He says He is.

333
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
 Having the correct understanding, but then putting your trust in it and saying,

334
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 "God, I believe it's true. I believe that Your forgiveness covers me.

335
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 I believe that Your grace covers me."

336
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 It's as simple as that.

337
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
 But what about our life in Christ?

338
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 After we begin that relationship and we're saying,

339
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,000
 "Okay, I'm a Christian and I'm trying to live out the values of the kingdom.

340
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 I'm trying to follow Jesus."

341
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 Well, even then, following Jesus is simply a matter of a relationship to God.

342
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
 We see that in Galatians 2, 20.

343
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
 It says, "I have been crucified with Christ.

344
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.

345
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God

346
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,000
 who loved me and gave Himself for me."

347
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 That verse is clear that even after we know Jesus and we walk in a relationship with Him,

348
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
 the life that we live is Him living through us.

349
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 It's that relationship with Him.

350
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
 John 15 talks about abiding in Christ.

351
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Verse 4 says that we abide in Him and as we do, we bear fruit.

352
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:41,000
 So those things that we talked about last week, the fruit, the good works that come out of our life,

353
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,000
 they are important.

354
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
 But they come from Jesus working through us.

355
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
 They come from us living in relationship with Him.

356
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
 Not us trying harder or us figuring out more stuff

357
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
 or us coming up with a way to be a better person or us rehabbing ourselves.

358
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,000
 They come from God doing work in our life to transform us and to live His life through us.

359
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
 And the New Testament is clear.

360
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
 God gives the Holy Spirit to every believer.

361
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
 When we come into relationship with God, the Holy Spirit comes into our life and is present with us.

362
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 And the Holy Spirit teaches us and empowers us to begin to become like Christ

363
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
 and to begin to live in the way that Jesus wants us to.

364
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,000
 Through that relationship with Him.

365
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
 Unlike any other relationship in our life, we can't neglect it.

366
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
 We have to give it time and attention and focus.

367
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:36,000
 That's why I always talk about giving our time to God and time in prayer,

368
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
 time in God's Word, time in worship and doing that every day.

369
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
 That's something that we have to give time to for that relationship to be healthy and flourish.

370
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
 But as we give ourselves to that and as God begins to work in our life

371
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:56,000
 and that relationship is healthy, that's how we begin to live out the values of the Kingdom

372
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
 and to be obedient to Christ.

373
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:06,000
 Ultimately, following Jesus is simply a matter of surrender to God's work in me and through me.

374
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,000
 It's simply a matter of surrendering to God's work in me and through me.

375
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,000
 2 Corinthians 5, 17 and 18 says this,

376
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,000
 "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.

377
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:18,000
 The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.

378
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
 All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself

379
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:25,000
 and gave us the ministry of reconciliation."

380
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,000
 The work of Jesus after we come to salvation, after we begin relationship with God,

381
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:33,000
 the work of Jesus is to make a new creation in us

382
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:37,000
 for the old selfish desires and parts of us to pass away

383
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:41,000
 and to be replaced with love and service to others.

384
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
 And that's what God is doing.

385
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,000
 So yes, good works, Kingdom values, they're very, very important.

386
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
 But they come as a result of the work that Jesus does in us.

387
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,000
 And we have to surrender to that work and say, "Okay, God, I want you to be at work in my heart."

388
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
 And at times it may be difficult.

389
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
 At times it may be hard to let go of those selfish desires.

390
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:05,000
 At times it may be hard to not just seek what I feel like is best for me.

391
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,000
 It may be hard to obey you.

392
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,000
 It may be hard to be counter-cultural and go against the grain of what everybody else is doing.

393
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,000
 Like we talked about a few weeks ago when we talked about the narrow path.

394
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:18,000
 Those things are not easy, but as we surrender to them,

395
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:22,000
 God works in our life and makes something new and something beautiful

396
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:26,000
 and something that is conformed to the image of Christ, we become more like Jesus.

397
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:31,000
 And those good works and those Kingdom values start to flow out of our life.

398
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,000
 Galatians chapter 3, the beginning of the chapter, Paul says this,

399
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:37,000
 "O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you?

400
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:41,000
 It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified.

401
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:46,000
 Let me ask you only this, did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?

402
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:52,000
 Are you so foolish, having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?"

403
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,000
 What Paul is saying in that chapter is saying, "Listen, you were saved through your faith,

404
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
 by the grace of God, and now that you're in relationship with God,

405
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 do you think suddenly it's about your works and that you're going to become pleasing to God

406
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,000
 through learning it and through trying hard and through keeping the law?"

407
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,000
 Apparently the Galatian church had gotten confused about that,

408
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
 and Paul is calling them back and saying, "Look, you got saved by the grace of God

409
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,000
 and through faith in that grace.

410
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:23,000
 And you continue in your relationship with God by the grace of God

411
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,000
 and through surrendering to the work of God in your life, not through your own effort."

412
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,000
 And we need to understand that as well, that we know Jesus through grace

413
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:39,000
 and we live as followers of Jesus and we live out the kingdom of values through grace

414
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,000
 and through surrendering to the work of God in our life, not through our own effort.

415
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
 So how do we know that we know Jesus? How do we know those things?

416
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,000
 I would point us to a couple questions here as we close

417
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:58,000
 and call us to evaluate ourselves like Jesus does in these verses.

418
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:03,000
 It's scary to think about the fact that there are going to be people who think they know God,

419
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:09,000
 but they don't, and they don't find out until this day that Jesus speaks of.

420
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:13,000
 And we obviously don't want to be in that position.

421
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:19,000
 And so I would encourage us to ask ourselves, "What is our faith or our confidence based on?"

422
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:22,000
 If someone were to ask you, if I were to ask you right now,

423
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
 "How do you know that you're going to be in heaven?

424
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
 How do you know that you are in relationship with God?

425
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,000
 How do you know that you're in the family of God? How do you know that you belong to Jesus?"

426
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,000
 What would your answer be?

427
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:39,000
 If your answer is something like, "Well, I'm a good person. I've done good things.

428
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,000
 I've gone to church a lot. I know a lot about the Bible. I know a lot about truth.

429
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:51,000
 I know a lot about church and I know a lot of Christian songs and I do good stuff."

430
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:59,000
 If that's what you would answer, then your confidence is in the wrong place.

431
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,000
 Your faith is ultimately in yourself and in your understanding and in your works.

432
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,000
 And that's a misplaced confidence. That's a misplaced faith.

433
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:13,000
 The only answer we have to how we know that we're in relationship with God

434
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,000
 and how we know that we'll be in heaven someday is because of the grace of Jesus

435
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
 and what He's done for us.

436
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,000
 And the same question goes for our growth in Christ.

437
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,000
 How do we know that we're growing in Christ?

438
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
 And how do we know that God is at work in our life?

439
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:35,000
 Is it based upon, "Well, I'm doing all this good stuff and I'm doing better than other people

440
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:40,000
 and I feel like I'm a pretty good person and here's the things that I do that are good."

441
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
 Hey, all those good works are great.

442
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
 But if that growth is not based upon the work that God is doing in your heart,

443
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:50,000
 then it's ultimately in vain like Paul talks about in 1 Corinthians 13.

444
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,000
 It's based on the fact that you are trusting in the work of Christ in your life.

445
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,000
 You're trusting in God's work to renew you, to change you.

446
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,000
 You're being empowered by the Holy Spirit to live out the values of the kingdom

447
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:03,000
 in a way that you couldn't on your own.

448
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:07,000
 Then that's a solid foundation.

449
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,000
 But if your confidence is in yourself for your growth in Christ, then that's misplaced.

450
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:17,000
 If you're just trying to check boxes and keep lists and do all the good things

451
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:22,000
 so that you can be a good Christian, if you're just trying to keep the law in some way,

452
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
 then that's misplaced.

453
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,000
 Our salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, and our growth and our relationship to God

454
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:33,000
 is through surrender to His work in our life.

455
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:36,000
 And we need to know that and we need to continue to point ourselves to it.

456
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
 Even if you've known Jesus for a long time,

457
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
 you can begin to slowly turn back towards doing good things

458
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
 and towards walking in the law and towards trying to keep the checklists.

459
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
 And we need to constantly be pointed towards the fact that it is only through Christ

460
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,000
 that we know God, it's only through Christ that we are changed and that we grow in knowing Him.

461
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,000
 And that's how we know, that we know Jesus.

462
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,000
 If we're confident and trusting in the work of Jesus in our heart,

463
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
 we're going to have a relationship to Him and for growth

464
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
 and for living out the values of the kingdom

465
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:16,000
 and for the good works that God wants to do in our life.

466
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
 Let's pray.

467
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,000
 God, thank You for Your truth.

468
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,000
 Thank You for the way it challenges us and points out our weaknesses

469
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:28,000
 and points out the wrong things that we're tempted to believe.

470
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,000
 And God, I pray that You would help us to be careful that we're not trusting in ourselves

471
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,000
 and that we're not trusting in our relationship to You,

472
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:44,000
 that we're not trusting in just what we know about You or our understanding of the truth,

473
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
 that we're not trusting in the good works that we feel like we've done.

474
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,000
 God, help us to make sure that we are trusting in You and You alone

475
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,000
 and that we understand it's nothing that we could do to gain salvation.

476
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:03,000
 It's by Your grace alone and it's through our faith and trust in what You've done alone.

477
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,000
 God, we live in relationship with You and as we have a desire to live out the values of the kingdom,

478
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
 which is a good and beautiful desire,

479
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:12,000
 help us not to try to make that happen in our own strength

480
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:18,000
 and help us not to try to live out good works through our own effort,

481
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,000
 but help us to try to be surrendered to You and to allow You to work in our hearts

482
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:27,000
 so that You can bring to pass the works that are truly honoring to You

483
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,000
 so that You can bring kingdom values out of our lives,

484
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:35,000
 so that they literally overflow from our lives into the lives of the people around us, God.

485
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:40,000
 God, may we know that we know You and may we live for You in a way that glorifies You

486
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
 and in a way that loves others.

487
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
 In Jesus' name, Amen.
