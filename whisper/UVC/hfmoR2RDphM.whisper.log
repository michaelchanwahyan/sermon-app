[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400]   All right, thanks, Kelly.
[00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.900]   Well, today's marathon, you guys in the race?
[00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.200]   You wish, right?
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.140]   You wish.
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.480]   I was talking to someone in the morning service, and
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.180]   he's a veteran.
[00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.340]   He's actually ran, I think, five races in the past 10 years.
[00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.380]   So he's a veteran.
[00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.040]   He doesn't have to do the draw to to join the race.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.640]   So so I was I was I was looking at him.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.540]   He was here and I was talking to him and said,
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.040]   Why are you here?
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.400]   Was supposed to be a running.
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.740]   Right. And he said, No, I'm not going to run today.
[00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.200]   I mean, this year and he's running, you know, every every other year.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.740]   So we do have some runners.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.800]   We do have some runners in our congregation.
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.840]   In any case, good to be with you.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.900]   And I know the traffic is kind of crazy, especially if you're coming
[00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.100]   from the downtown area and the South Loop area.
[00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.080]   But, you know, it's great to be here.
[00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.180]   We will go to the last letter of the seven letters to the seven churches.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.080]   So if you have the Bible, please turn with me to chapter three,
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.480]   chapter three of Revelation.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.840]   We are finally coming to the last letter.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.880]   Remember, there were seven letters.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.440]   Jesus sent letters to seven churches
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.040]   and from Ephesus, the first one and all the way to
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.940]   Lilladahshir today and Lilladahshir is kind of inland.
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.080]   It's about 40 miles southwest of Philadelphia.
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.200]   Remember, we talk about the latter to Philadelphia as well.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.840]   And also is 100 miles east of Ephesus.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.580]   So it's situated in a valley.
[00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.880]   It's a very fertile valley.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.940]   And what is known for in Lilladahshir
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.380]   is that it's a traffic hub. It's kind of like Chicago, right?
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.900]   It's kind of like Chicago.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.140]   We are right at the center of all the traffic.
[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.840]   That's why we always have a traffic jam all the time.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.180]   And it's getting worse with all the road constructions and all that.
[00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.040]   And back in the first century,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.300]   there was a Roman highway going through from right to left
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.980]   and it passes through Lilladahshir.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.900]   So as you can see, it's a traffic hub.
[00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.300]   It's also a banking hub, a financial hub.
[00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.500]   And it's also famous for textile industry and medical schools.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.580]   You know, back then they have medical schools
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.540]   and they have fairly famous
[00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.340]   medicine for eye diseases.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.080]   If you have some eye diseases in those days, you go to Lilladahshir.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.900]   In those days, you go there to be a doctor.
[00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.140]   You go there to earn money.
[00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.840]   So as you can imagine, the city is very, very rich.
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.200]   And all the people there are very rich.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.700]   And I'll tell you a story in the first century, about 1860.
[00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.200]   So about 30 years after Jesus' death and resurrection.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.200]   And it's within the period of the early church.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.340]   And there was a massive earthquake
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.100]   happened around the region of Lilladahshir.
[00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.540]   And if you remember, the letter of
[00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:29.300]   revelations were written in 1890, late first century.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.000]   So 30 years before this letter was written,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.080]   this massive earthquake happened in Lilladahshir.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.840]   It was 1860.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.140]   And some of the towns were destroyed as well, like Sardis.
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.080]   Can you see Sardis right there?
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.900]   Sardis, Philadelphia, Sardis.
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.000]   Sardis was completely wiped out.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.540]   And Rome has to use the federal fund to help rebuild Sardis.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.280]   However, Lilladahshir is such a remarkable city, and
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.180]   they didn't need any funds from Rome.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.880]   And they rebuilt the city themselves.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.800]   It's pretty cool, right?
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.300]   In the past few weeks, we heard about the hurricane
[00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.780]   in southeast of United States, Florida.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.740]   Well, just imagine the towns are being just tragic
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:25.740]   and everything is wiped out and you need federal money
[00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.040]   to pump into the region and to rebuild everything and to clean up everything,
[00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.040]   to rebuild the lives of the people.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.380]   Lilladahshir back then said to the Roman government,
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.780]   saying to Rome, we don't need your federal money
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.300]   because we have enough money to rebuild after the earthquake. Right.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.680]   Pretty cool, right?
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.940]   And you can imagine the people in the church in Lilladahshir,
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.240]   they should have that kind of pride and financial resources.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.380]   And that go into the culture, that go into the church.
[00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.440]   And I would say it is very true for our church as well.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.940]   Yes, we don't have a lot of people, but aren't we all pretty resourceful?
[00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:16.440]   I think we are.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.700]   In some way or the other.
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.080]   So this letter is written to the church in Lilladahshir and also to us.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.940]   Let's read it through. It's a fun letter to read through.
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.940]   Verse 14 and following.
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.880]   To the angel of the church in Lilladahshir write.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:38.640]   Jesus said to the church in Lilladahshir, the Christian in Lilladahshir.
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.280]   These are the words of the Amen.
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:47.000]   The faithful, true witness, the ruler of God's creation.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.600]   I know your deeds and you are neither cold nor hot.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:56.540]   I wish you were either one or the other.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:06:02.300]   So because you are lukewarm, neither hot nor cold,
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.960]   I am about to speak you out, out of my mouth.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.600]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.140]   Jesus interceded himself as the Amen.
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.160]   Well, you know, Amen.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.260]   What does it mean?
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.360]   Was pray and end with this cold, cold word.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.640]   Right. This cold word.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:21.660]   Amen. What does it mean?
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.400]   Truth. Right.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.600]   Sincere, truthfully.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.100]   Amen. Amen. I said to you, Jesus said to the people all the time in the gospels.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.340]   Amen. Amen.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:35.060]   I said to you and English translation is truly, truly.
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.860]   I said to you, no, God does not lie.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.160]   God cannot lie.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.800]   And what God says must be true.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:47.340]   And it has to be true.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.300]   This is who God is.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.500]   Jesus said something about our lives, about the church in Laodicea,
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.300]   and he gave his evaluation and the evaluation has to be right,
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.800]   has to be truthful, has to be according to the facts.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:07.000]   And his evaluation is kind of interesting.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.800]   He said, you guys are lukewarm.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.460]   I would rather you guys are hot or cold,
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.360]   but you guys are lukewarm, you are neither cold nor hot.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.160]   That's interesting.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:25.700]   Sometimes we use this verse as as if, you know, God is wanting us to
[00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:29.440]   not to be lukewarm, we either be hot or cold.
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.140]   And you think about it, it's very interesting if you use this verse this way,
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.060]   because, you know, aren't we required to increase our spiritual temperature,
[00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.700]   our passion for God, right?
[00:07:43.700 --> 00:07:44.840]   Our passion for God.
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.160]   If if this verse is about our heart temperature for God, our passion for God,
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.900]   willing God prefer us to be, of course, hot, right?
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.300]   And of course, warm, warm is better than cold.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:03.440]   Hot is better than warm.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.000]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.800]   You know, you take the temperature of the congregation and God is saying,
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.900]   hey, you know, you guys are lukewarm.
[00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:12.160]   I just don't want you guys, I'll spit you out.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.460]   But if hot, meaning we have passion for God,
[00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:20.340]   then of course, God prefers that.
[00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.800]   But if cold in that sense is being lack of passion for God,
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.000]   then that sounds kind of strange.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.240]   But the Christians in the little desire are lukewarm.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.900]   They're not too hot, not too cold.
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.140]   Lukewarm, it's just like a glass of water.
[00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:46.100]   Like a glass of water, you know, between 100 Fahrenheit to 60 Fahrenheit
[00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.400]   is kind of considered hot, right?
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.100]   I consider it lukewarm because the temperature,
[00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:56.140]   if raises above 100 Fahrenheit, it can burn you.
[00:08:56.140 --> 00:08:57.540]   It can burn your tongue.
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.500]   If it's below 60, it's kind of cold.
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.960]   So room temperature is kind of like 60 to 100 Fahrenheit.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.960]   So we always take this word as the measurement of our spiritual temperature,
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   our passion as Christians.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:20.800]   And God will be saying, you know, I do not prefer you to be lukewarm.
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.100]   Now, if that's the case, I think it's kind of strange, right?
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:29.000]   As I said, wouldn't God prefer us to be warmer than cold?
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.760]   But this word says neither cold nor hot.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:37.900]   I would rather you guys, you know, be cold or be hot, you know,
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:39.240]   just don't be lukewarm.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.160]   So, you know, there has to be some other way to understand this verse.
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:49.460]   And I think if we get this right, it applies to all of us.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:54.060]   Now, in order to understand this, we have to understand geography.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:55.460]   Geography.
[00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.760]   Here on the map, you can see Heropolis.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:06.500]   Heropolis is on the left, upper left, right?
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.800]   Heropolis.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.600]   And then on the right is Colossae.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   And then right in the center is Laodicea.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.160]   Now, what am I talking about?
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:22.400]   Now, since this passage is about water in Laodicea,
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:27.500]   so we have to take a look at the region, about the water supply.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:35.440]   Now, Heropolis on the upper left is about eight miles north of Laodicea.
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:41.500]   It is a city and it's still a very, a city alive today
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.840]   because they are famous for hot mineral springs.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.500]   Hot mineral springs.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:50.140]   Just like you go to Yellowstone National Park,
[00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:54.240]   you see all kinds of, you know, hot springs.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.940]   Or you go to hot spring in the Arkansas,
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:03.940]   there's a place called Hot Springs because they are known for hot springs
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.240]   and people will enjoy it.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.600]   And you can see in the picture, it's still alive today.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.240]   And tourists will go there and just dump yourself into a hot spring
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.040]   and you just enjoy your time, right?
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:14.900]   Cool.
[00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:18.540]   So that's the water supply in Heropolis.
[00:11:18.540 --> 00:11:22.400]   In the east, on the right, is Colossae.
[00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:28.200]   It is situated at the foot of a snow-capped mountain.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.340]   It's called Mount Katmos.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:35.040]   And because you are right there, Colossae,
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   you are right below or right at the foothill of the snow-capped mountain,
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:40.700]   what do you get?
[00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:42.740]   You get cold water.
[00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:45.240]   Therapeutic water.
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.840]   And you can take a bath even.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.240]   And you can drink the pure, pure water.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.440]   It's like you get a bottle of water today,
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.100]   it says whatever mountain, whatever spring that it comes from,
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.600]   probably it's fake.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.700]   But you get pure water in Colossae.
[00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:08.300]   So you got hot water on the left, upper left, hot spring.
[00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.900]   And then you got cold water on the right.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.640]   So as you can see,
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:17.500]   the verse is referring to the other city.
[00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:23.800]   God said to Laodicea, "I would rather you guys be hot or cold,
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.500]   but you guys are lukewarm."
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.900]   Let's take a look at the description of lukewarm water.
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:36.000]   Laodicea had, it's known in history,
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.700]   Laodicea did not have reliable water supply.
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:46.500]   Because the water has, by the time the water from the hot spring
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.200]   coming to Laodicea to the south,
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   the temperature decreases, right?
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.100]   Hot water becomes lukewarm water.
[00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:02.700]   And remember, if the water becomes lukewarm,
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:04.300]   you cannot use it as hot spring.
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:05.400]   It's not hot spring anymore.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:06.800]   It's called lukewarm spring.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:09.300]   But it's not therapeutic anymore.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:12.000]   It's not for medicine anymore.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And the water from hot spring
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:18.300]   usually carries a lot of minerals.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:23.700]   And when that mineral rich water reaches Laodicea,
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.100]   it will clog up the water pipes.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.300]   It will clog up the water pipes.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:31.500]   Today, we call it hot water.
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.200]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.600]   It's common sense, right?
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:39.200]   Yeah, it's common sense.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.800]   That's why you need filter water.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:46.100]   You filter out the dirt or the mineral in the water
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.300]   so that you can drink it.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.500]   Now, that's what happened in Laodicea.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:52.300]   All they got is hot water, lukewarm water.
[00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:53.500]   You can't drink it.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   And it's bitter to drink it.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.100]   So you have to spit it out.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.100]   So now you got it.
[00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.600]   Here are some of the pictures from Laodicea,
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.700]   and you can still see some of the broken pipes.
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:12.100]   They have some pipes, you see the white stuff.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.100]   Around the pipes, those are from, you know,
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:20.500]   hardened, solidified minerals of the lukewarm water.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:23.900]   So if you're a plumber in Laodicea,
[00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:25.200]   you got good business.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.200]   Because every house needs your service every now and then.
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.300]   Because you have to clean up the pipe.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:34.900]   You have to clean up all the plumbing system
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:38.000]   so that you get water coming into the city.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.700]   So they don't have fresh water.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.600]   So God is saying, "You are right in the middle."
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.400]   Right?
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.200]   I put a plumber there
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:50.500]   because it's gonna be bad to live in Laodicea.
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:54.200]   You always have to drink from bottles of water.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.300]   You don't, you can't, you can't just, you know,
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.500]   turn on your tap and get some water to drink.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.000]   So much different from Chicago.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.600]   God is saying, "I would rather you guys be hot on the left.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.500]   Be hot spring, so you're functional.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:13.100]   You can bring benefit to other people.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:18.300]   Or to the right, the cold water, people can drink it."
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:22.600]   He's talking about not the temperature of the water.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.100]   It's the functionality, the functions or purpose of the water.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:29.400]   Right in the middle of Laodicea,
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.600]   the water has no use.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.000]   You have to spit it out.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.300]   It's totally no use.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:42.900]   He's referring, using this metaphor to talk about Christians in Laodicea.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:45.000]   And they are nominal Christians.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   What does it mean, nominal Christians?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.400]   That, okay, you profess that you are Christians,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:53.100]   but you don't live like one.
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:56.400]   You don't live out the gospel.
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.300]   You don't have a living relationship with Christ.
[00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:02.100]   You just go through the motion and you just don't care.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:06.800]   Right? You come here, okay, all right, then, you know, Monday to Saturday,
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:08.100]   I just care about myself.
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.400]   You just don't care about your relationship with God.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.000]   You don't have a living relationship with God.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.100]   You don't have the life to show other people.
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.500]   So you cannot bring benefits to other people.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:22.900]   God is saying, "I would rather be left or be right.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:28.500]   Be cold or be hot, so that people can use you.
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:34.300]   God can use you to be his instruments, to be a witness to him."
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:37.300]   So we got that clear up, right?
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:39.200]   We got that clear up.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:41.700]   It's not talking about spiritual temperature.
[00:16:41.700 --> 00:16:45.300]   It's talking about spiritual function.
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:47.800]   It's malfunctioning Christians.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.100]   It's malfunctioning Christians in Laodicea.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:55.100]   You're not doing what you're supposed to do.
[00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.600]   You're not living a life you're supposed to do.
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:01.000]   Because when we believe in the gospel, we should have changed,
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.400]   at least fundamentally, our value system,
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:09.900]   our schedule, our life, our function,
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:12.400]   and our relationship with God and to other people.
[00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:14.500]   Everything has to be reconfigured.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:19.800]   But in Laodicea, all those Christians are nominal Christians.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.100]   They are not functioning, malfunctioning church.
[00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:30.800]   Now, as you can see, you know, what does Christ want in our lives?
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:36.100]   Christ wants, Christ desires a living relationship with you.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:43.700]   God desires most about your relationship with God himself, with Jesus.
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:48.300]   In order to be fruitful, in order to be functional,
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.800]   you cannot be lukewarm.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.500]   God has to use you.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:57.300]   What is your function?
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:02.800]   Jesus said, "If you abide in me, if you have a living relationship,
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.100]   fellowship with me, then I can dwell in you.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:12.800]   If you love my word, if you abide in my word, then I can live my life through you."
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:19.500]   Christ desires, Jesus wants your whole heart worship,
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.700]   your service, your time, your talent, your treasure, your life,
[00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:29.100]   God's life, eternal life can live through you.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:32.400]   And you can do things out of love for God.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.800]   That's what Jesus desires.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:40.300]   He doesn't really look at how rich you are or how well off you are.
[00:18:40.300 --> 00:18:45.200]   If you are not generous, you present no functions to other people.
[00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:49.800]   You are not being used by God's eternal kingdom.
[00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:52.200]   That's what Jesus wants.
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:55.300]   He wants you to have a living relationship with him.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.600]   And secondly, this passage says, God decides to dwell in your heart.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:07.700]   Because without Christ dwelling in our heart, without Christ dwelling in our heart,
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.600]   we cannot live out the gospel.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.500]   This letter continues, 317.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:17.100]   Jesus said, "You say, I am rich.
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:19.800]   I have acquired wealth and do not need a thing."
[00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:25.600]   But Jesus said, "You do not realize you are actually wretched.
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:27.300]   You're wretched.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.900]   You're pitiful, poor, blind and naked.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:38.900]   I counsel you to buy from me gold with fire in the fire, so you can become rich.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:44.700]   And buy from me white clothes to wear, so that you can cover your shameful nakedness.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.900]   And then you can heal your eyes so that you can see."
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.700]   You see, this is all local languages.
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.500]   Laodicea is famous and well known for all of this stuff.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:59.400]   Their gold, their treasure, their wealth, and their power.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.200]   The textile industry.
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:05.300]   Their eye medicines.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:09.700]   That's a spirit of self-sufficiency.
[00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:14.500]   That we think we can do life without God.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:16.800]   Ask questions.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.300]   I'll make money.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:20.000]   I'll save up money.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.800]   I don't need Jesus.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.400]   I mean, come on, Jesus is just a footnote to me.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.000]   The main content, I'm going to write my life.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.200]   I'm going to write every chapter.
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.700]   That's my main content.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:31.700]   And where's Jesus?
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.700]   I mean, maybe it's just a little bit footnote.
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:38.700]   Jesus said, "You are actually pitiful.
[00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:43.100]   You're poor and you're blind and naked."
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:46.300]   319.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.800]   "Those whom I love," Jesus said, "I would bilk and discipline.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.300]   So be earnest and repent.
[00:20:55.300 --> 00:20:58.900]   Here I am, I stand at the door and knock.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:03.100]   If anyone hears my voice and open the door, I will come in
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:07.400]   and dine with him and he with me."
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:10.100]   You see the language of fellowship here?
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:13.800]   Eating together in the ancient world is so important.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.700]   It's also important today.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:18.500]   It is even more important in those days.
[00:21:18.500 --> 00:21:21.300]   In the ancient world, intimate fellowship, you know,
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.600]   dining together and sharing a meal together.
[00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.600]   To have friendship.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.000]   To have a living relationship.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:31.500]   So we can eat together, we can talk together,
[00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:32.800]   we can have fellowship together.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:35.300]   You see, good friends, what do good friends do?
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:37.300]   They eat together.
[00:21:37.300 --> 00:21:40.900]   But do you eat with your enemies?
[00:21:40.900 --> 00:21:42.400]   No, you don't.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:45.300]   You eat with your good friends and you talk to them
[00:21:45.300 --> 00:21:46.400]   for hours.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.700]   You can talk to your good friend for hours and hours
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.600]   and it feels like eternity.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.900]   That's what Jesus desires.
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:00.000]   Jesus is knocking on your door, knocking on our door.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.300]   And Jesus said, "Please listen to my voice.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.700]   I want to renew my relationship with you.
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.700]   I'm here all along, I'm knocking."
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:12.100]   And what's wrong with this picture?
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.300]   Jesus is being kicked out of the house.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:20.600]   But He is there knocking.
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.300]   It's not because He doesn't have power to open your door.
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.700]   He does have power to open the door.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:30.500]   Jesus is not saying, "Okay, I'm going to beg you,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.700]   I'm going to love seek without you.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.900]   I have to come in and have fellowship with you
[00:22:34.900 --> 00:22:38.900]   and otherwise I feel like less of myself."
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.800]   No, Jesus is not like that.
[00:22:41.300 --> 00:22:43.300]   Remember the first verse of this letter,
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:47.100]   Jesus said, "I am the Amen, I'm the ruler of the creation.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.500]   I'm the Cosmos guy, you know.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.200]   I create the cosmos.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.700]   I create the universe and I am in charge of the universe."
[00:22:55.700 --> 00:22:59.200]   However, Jesus is saying with gentle words,
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:06.100]   "I am standing outside and I'm knocking on your door.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:11.200]   I desire fellowship, relationship with you."
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:14.900]   Verse 21, "To him who overcomes,
[00:23:14.900 --> 00:23:20.600]   I'll give the right to sit with me on the throne.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:26.500]   Just as I overcome and sat down with my Father on His throne.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:32.000]   He who has ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.200]   As we close and finish off this series,
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.000]   this is the seventh letter
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.300]   and this is the most, my beloved letter
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   because it says so much about us.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:46.400]   It says so much about me as well.
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:50.300]   Sometimes I just busy with my work
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:53.800]   and I forgot that what Jesus really desire
[00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:56.600]   is a moment with me
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:00.400]   so that I can read His word.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.800]   I can listen to His voice and have fellowship together.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:11.000]   When was the last time you really enjoy relationship with God?
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   And you just spend hours and hours
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:20.200]   praying and nurturing the relationship,
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:26.800]   talking, talking to Christ, someone who loves us.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:31.000]   Just this letter is filled with warnings,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.200]   is filled with builds.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.100]   There's no praises here.
[00:24:35.300 --> 00:24:38.400]   But you know, don't misunderstand.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.000]   You know, God sometimes has some hard words for us.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.100]   It's not because He hates us.
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:47.500]   It's not because He wants to condemn us.
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:53.400]   Some of those hard words, tough words are tough love.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:58.700]   Jesus said, "I want to sit down with you
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:01.600]   to have a meal."
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:05.000]   Meal, quite no agenda.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:07.500]   It's like a close friend.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:09.700]   Intimacy.
[00:25:09.700 --> 00:25:13.700]   We come before Christ today.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:16.200]   Let us turn and repent.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:21.200]   God looks at us now.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.700]   God looks at your heart right now.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:28.100]   He doesn't count you, how much you have accumulated
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.800]   or how much achievement for Him at this moment.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   Jesus said, "I'm knocking on the door."
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:41.200]   Knocking on the door of your heart, open,
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:45.400]   and I'll come in and have intimacy, fellowship with you.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.000]   Let's all pray together.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:56.500]   Father, we confess that sometimes we treat our faith
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.200]   as just a concept of philosophy or idea.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:05.700]   No matter how good the idea sounds,
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.300]   that is not the point, that is not the core.
[00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.100]   The core is coming before you
[00:26:11.100 --> 00:26:14.300]   and know that you love us
[00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:19.900]   and know that we respond with love.
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:24.800]   I know you are knocking on our door every single day
[00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:28.700]   and we confess that sometimes we pretend
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:31.900]   that we don't hear it.
[00:26:31.900 --> 00:26:36.000]   We just go about our lives without you
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.800]   and treat you as a footnote.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.800]   So we've confessed our sins.
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:44.200]   We just confess our weaknesses.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:48.400]   And at this time, we just pray that your Spirit
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:52.000]   will speak to us and turn our hearts back to you
[00:26:52.900 --> 00:26:57.600]   so that we will enjoy our relationship with you,
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:01.300]   so that our lives will abide in your Word,
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:04.500]   our lives will abide in your love,
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.600]   that your life, your eternal life,
[00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   the life of Christ, the life of the gospel,
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.700]   can live through us.
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:18.500]   So Jesus, we open the door.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.600]   You come into our hearts
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:26.500]   and be our Lord, be our ruler,
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:30.500]   just as you are ruler of the entire universe.
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.700]   So yes, we come before you
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:37.400]   and thank you for being our loving God.
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:40.300]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:45.300]   Well, we're gonna close off with our verse of the month.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.740]   All right?
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.500]   Verse of the month.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.000]   I hope you have that memorized.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.400]   If not, we're gonna recite it together.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:58.300]   Now, this is a relevant promise
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:28:00.900]   out of the letter of 1 John.
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.100]   And it's a very appropriate closing
[00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:07.400]   for the last letter of the seven churches.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.200]   1 John 1, 9.
[00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:10.900]   Why don't we read together?
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.100]   "If we confess our sins,
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.600]   He is faithful and just
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.900]   and will forgive us our sins
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.000]   and purify us from all unrighteousness."
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   If we confess our sins, He's faithful and just.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   He is righteous and He will forgive us in Christ.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.300]   All of our sins and clean us up
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:37.700]   from all the unrighteousness,
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:39.900]   all the injustice, all the sinfulness.
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:43.900]   And God is gonna live in our hearts.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:46.900]   Today, if you echo with my prayers,
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.300]   I do wanna urge you,
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:53.900]   let us spend more time with God.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:59.500]   Now, every day, you know, take 10 minutes, 15 minutes,
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.800]   you know, rather than, you know, scrolling through our phone
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:05.300]   and, you know, looking at TikTok videos,
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:10.500]   Instagram updates or whatever crazy news out there.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.600]   Know that God is in control.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.500]   Spend some time of intimacy with Him
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.700]   because God always desires your heart.
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.700]   Right? Let your heart be open to Him.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.800]   So we do that.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.200]   And today, as we end our service,
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:28.400]   and we're gonna have some refreshment,
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   and please stay, please stay for Bible study.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.200]   You know, don't treat Bible study
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.900]   as an intellectual exercise only.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:39.700]   Your faith needs the Word of God.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:42.100]   If you wanna grow,
[00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.400]   there's no way that you can just go through the motions.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:47.600]   You need the Word of God to dwell in your heart.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.100]   All right?
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:51.500]   So we do invite you to stay
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.400]   for about an hour of Bible study,
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   and we're going to chapter two of the Book of Romans.
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:00.900]   And I'll lead the English group,
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.400]   and Paul is gonna lead the Chinese group.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.100]   And we're gonna enjoy our time and have fellowship
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:09.700]   and abide in God's Word.
