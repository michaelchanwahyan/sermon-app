[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   Good morning family and welcome. I'm glad and excited that we get to open God's
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.080]   Word together again this morning. I want to remind you as always that we'd love
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.120]   to hear from you. We'd love for you to connect with us. You can reach out, send
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.840]   us an email at info@urbanvoicechurch.com. If there's any way that we can pray for
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.800]   you and encourage you, we'd love to know that. Or if you just have comments or
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.320]   questions, we'd love to hear those as well. So please reach out to us. We'd love
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.800]   to hear from you. This morning we're going to be looking at Matthew chapter
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.520]   7 verses 13 and 14. These are really significant verses in the Sermon on the
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.980]   Mount and really significant verses in our lives and in our faith and our
[00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.520]   journey as followers of Jesus. And they're important in understanding the
[00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.080]   application of the values of the kingdom to our lives. So I want us to examine
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.960]   these closely today and to really see what God has to say to us this morning.
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.080]   Let's read these together. Matthew chapter 7 verses 13 and 14. "Enter by the
[00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.640]   narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.040]   And those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:19.160]   that leads to life. And those who find it are few." Now what is Jesus saying here?
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.560]   What's going on in this passage? The metaphor is pretty obvious here. He's
[00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.640]   talking about two paths that are very different. One that is narrow and
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.320]   challenging. Another one that is broad and wide and easy. And Jesus is pointing
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.200]   us to an important truth about what it means to be a follower of Jesus, to be a
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.240]   subject of the kingdom, and to live out the values of the kingdom. At this point
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.200]   in the Sermon on the Mount, this is towards the end, Jesus is beginning to
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.040]   kind of wrap up the sermon and he's giving us some application. So this
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:58.280]   section, these verses, are really speaking to what it looks like for us to begin to
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.120]   live out the values of the kingdom that he's already been speaking about for the
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.720]   last almost three chapters of the book of Matthew here. And Jesus is giving us a
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.960]   description in this metaphor and it's almost a warning of what it looks like
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.840]   to live out the values of the kingdom in our world. That it's not going to be easy,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.960]   it's not going to be simple, it's not even always going to feel great. And Jesus is
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.680]   telling us that. And I think it's important to understand that Jesus is
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:32.480]   telling us that up front because Jesus was never trying to talk us into doing
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.080]   something. Jesus was never trying to pull a bait-and-switch. The gospel has always
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.840]   been up front about the commitment that is involved. And sometimes us, Christians,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.960]   believers, followers of Jesus in the church, when we share the gospel, we
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.800]   kind of want to hide that. We kind of want to obscure that and make it seem
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.680]   really easy to people and say, "Hey, it's going to be great. You'll get everything
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.520]   you ever want." And that is true. The rewards of the gospel are indescribable.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.640]   They truly are. But that doesn't mean that it's easy. There is very real
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.480]   commitment involved and there's often suffering involved. And that's what Jesus
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.760]   is telling us here. Jesus is being very honest, very direct, very up front with us
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.360]   about what it means to live out the values of the kingdom in our broken
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.680]   world. And that it's not going to be easy. It's not going to be simple. And Jesus is
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.040]   telling us some hard truths here. And I love that Jesus does that. There's so
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.960]   many beautiful things that Jesus tells us. So many beautiful things in the
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.320]   Gospels. So many beautiful things right here in the Sermon on the Mount that
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:40.280]   Jesus tells us and describes for us. But Jesus doesn't just tell us the good
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.640]   stuff. He also tells us the challenging things. Jesus also says to us what we
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:48.800]   need to hear but don't want to hear. Jesus tells us the hard truths and I
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.640]   love that. And that's what he's doing in these verses. You know God's Word is
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.920]   oftentimes encouraging and comforting to us. But it's also oftentimes challenging
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.400]   to us. Sometimes it's both at once. And this is one of those passages that is
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.920]   challenging. There is comfort and encouragement in it as well. We'll see
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.840]   that today. But it's challenging. It is really challenging. So in these verses I
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.800]   think there's some important things for us to understand that Jesus is
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.080]   communicating. And first of all I want us to consider the fact that Jesus is
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:24.080]   telling us the narrow way is not easy. That's what Jesus is saying. The narrow
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.000]   way is not an easy way. You know part of the reason the narrow way is not
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.080]   easy is that it's in opposition to our natural desires and selfishness. Following
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.520]   Jesus, living out the values of the kingdom, is really in opposition to the
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.440]   things that we naturally want to do. We've been talking about this for so
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.160]   long now as we study these values of the kingdom. But living a life of humility, of
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.240]   poverty of spirit, that's in opposition to our natural desires which are
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:05:00.840]   towards pride and self inflation and self promotion. Things like that. Being
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.480]   humble and living out poverty of spirit is in opposition to our selfish desires.
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:10.720]   So many of the values of the kingdom really oppose our natural desires and
[00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.280]   for that reason it is not easy to walk in the narrow way. It is not easy to live
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:22.440]   out the values of the kingdom. And the reality is that this verse communicates
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.120]   that there are times when when the narrow way feels closed in. It feels
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.920]   tight. It feels difficult to maneuver through. In verse 13 this word for narrow
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.560]   the Greek word gives us this this idea of narrow or straight. And narrow or
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.560]   straight because there are obstacles on the sides. It's kind of you can think of
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.600]   like a narrow corridor through a stone passageway in a castle or something like
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.200]   that. Or you can think of maybe walking on a trail. I don't know if you've ever
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.720]   hiked a trail like this but I've hiked on some trails where you're walking
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:03.440]   through cliffs kind of and you're on a trail where it's just straight wall on
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.120]   this side and straight wall up on that side. It's very narrow and very closed in.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:12.400]   And that's part of what the Greek word in verse 13 is communicating. That there
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.640]   are times when it's gonna feel tight. It's gonna feel difficult to navigate.
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.840]   It's gonna feel difficult to go on through because it's not necessarily
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:26.400]   easy. And Jesus is telling us that. He's being up front with us about that. And
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   this concept of the narrow way also communicates the fact that there is
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.600]   suffering involved. In verse 14 where it says for the gate is narrow. That's
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:42.280]   actually a completely different Greek word from the word in verse 13. And the
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.680]   word in verse 14 is a word that communicates suffering. It's a word that
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.240]   is translated in other parts of the New Testament as affliction or as trouble or
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:00.040]   as suffering tribulation. And so it's saying that this gate is not just
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:05.560]   narrow. It's difficult. That there's suffering involved. This path is
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.640]   challenging to travel. It's hard to travel at times. Just like verse 14 says
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:16.560]   the way is hard. It's not easy. And Jesus is being up front with us and telling us
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.760]   that. That if we are going to commit to live out the values of the kingdom. If
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.360]   we're gonna commit to really being a follower of Jesus. If we're gonna commit
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.960]   to really being serious about obeying him in our life. Then it's not always
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:34.000]   gonna be easy. It's gonna be in opposition to our own natural desires.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   And there are times when it's gonna feel tight and closed in. And we're gonna
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.720]   feel like it's hard to push on through. But there's also times when it's gonna
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:46.160]   involve suffering. And when it's not gonna feel good in the moment. And when
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:51.200]   it's going to hurt. And it's going to involve affliction. That word in
[00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:58.720]   verse 14. The Greek word as also carries this idea of being pressed. Just like
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:05.560]   grapes were pressed to extract the grape juice. It's a word that gives us
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.320]   that word picture of being pressed. So that something is gonna be extracted.
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:15.880]   And sometimes that's what following Jesus means. God lets us go through
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:21.720]   difficulty and challenges and affliction. So that he can extract impurities and
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.920]   things that are not healthy from our life. And fill us with goodness. So
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:31.060]   that he can refine us. And there is this concept of suffering that's carried in
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:35.320]   these words and in these verses. Another thing we see in these verses is that
[00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:40.800]   this is a narrow gate and a narrow way. And that's important for us to
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.560]   understand. Because sometimes we might think of following Jesus as like a
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.160]   funnel kind of. Or maybe as an uphill climb. And we might think of it as it's
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:55.520]   wide open and easy in the beginning. And everything's great. And then as we get to
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:59.840]   more advanced levels it gets a little bit tougher. Or that's when it gets
[00:08:59.840 --> 00:09:05.320]   challenging. And it is an uphill climb. The journey of faith. Of following Jesus.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:10.320]   So that's not necessarily a bad metaphor. But we need to understand that it's
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:17.120]   narrow and straight from beginning to end. And Jesus is letting us know that in
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.200]   this verse. That there's only one way to heaven. Jesus himself said that he is the
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.320]   only way to the Father. He's the way the truth and the life. It's narrow in the
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:32.600]   beginning. It's narrow to get in. It's only by God's grace and by faith in
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.920]   Jesus that we can come into salvation. It's a narrow way. It's pretty
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:42.440]   exclusive to get in that narrow gate. But then as we travel on it, it's still
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:48.120]   narrow. It's not something that as we grow more advanced then maybe we'll
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:53.960]   have an experience of challenge or affliction or trouble. No. God wants to
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.320]   grow us from the very beginning. And he's gonna allow adversity in our lives to
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.600]   stretch us and to grow us from the very beginning. And so we may say, "Well I
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.200]   wasn't expecting this. I wasn't ready for this. Sure I thought maybe someday in my
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.040]   journey of following Jesus that I'd have to deal with something challenging or
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.360]   something difficult. Or God would let me face something that was was difficult.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.320]   But I wasn't expecting this right now because I'm young or I haven't been a
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:23.920]   believer very long." But it's not a funnel. It's something that from the beginning
[00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:28.120]   God wants to grow us. And God wants to challenge us. And God wants to stretch us.
[00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:32.760]   And we need to understand that. And it doesn't have moments in the middle where
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.960]   we just say, "Okay I've been on the narrow way for a while so now I get to just
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:43.080]   take some time off and float." And that's not there. It's always going to be a
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.160]   narrow way beginning to end. Now that doesn't mean that it's not full of
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.720]   blessing and reward and joy because it is. We're gonna discuss that a little bit
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:56.000]   later on. So don't get the wrong idea that following Jesus is just some type
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:02.480]   of difficult drudgery and it's always just sad and hard. That's not the
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:06.000]   reality of what it means to be a follower of Jesus. But understand that
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.720]   the way is narrow and it is from beginning to end. You know it requires
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:15.720]   commitment. And that's why Jesus is telling us this up front. Why he's
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:20.000]   telling us this in the beginning is that it requires commitment for us to step
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.920]   onto the narrow way, to choose to follow him, and to stay on the narrow way. To
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:30.400]   continue to follow him. Jesus is speaking to people that were very familiar with
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:34.880]   faith, very familiar with the Old Testament, very familiar with God. But
[00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:37.920]   they weren't necessarily familiar with the values of the kingdom that he was
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.000]   giving them. And he was being honest with them up front and saying, "If you want to
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.440]   step into this life, if you want to begin to live out these values and
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:50.280]   follow God in the way that I'm calling you to, it requires commitment. And you've
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   got to understand that." And that's just as true for us. We need to understand
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:59.840]   that there's a commitment required to enter the narrow gate and to walk on
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.920]   the narrow way. And that brings us to the next thing I want us to consider. And
[00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:09.440]   that is that the narrow way requires intentional pursuit. The narrow way
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:15.160]   requires intentional pursuit. Now this is an obvious point and it's not something
[00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:21.640]   that I need to belabor or explain a lot because it's pretty clear. But I just
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.120]   want to bring it out for us and remind us that if you are not intentionally
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.680]   staying on a narrow path, then you're off the path. I think a good illustration is
[00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:38.840]   if you think of maybe being on a small path in the forest that's not real well
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.080]   marked. I've done a lot of hiking. I love to hike with my family and we do that a
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:47.040]   lot. And we've hiked a lot of different types of trails. And some trails you hike
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:52.240]   on that are pretty wide and maybe they're even a gravel trail or they're
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.080]   partially paved. It's really easy to see where the trail is and stay on it. But
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.440]   some trails you hike that are not well traveled and they're not well marked,
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:05.880]   they may be a very small path. It's not very wide. Just a little footpath through
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:10.360]   the woods. And if there's been leaves blowing around and branches that have
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.320]   fallen and things like that, it's easy to lose the path. Sometimes trails like that
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:20.200]   are marked on, they have little marks of paint on the tree or something else on a
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:24.160]   tree to let you know where the path is. But the point is you have to be
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:28.640]   intentionally pursuing that path to stay on it. You have to be looking at the path
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.320]   to know where it's going and you have to even be looking at the trees and
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:38.520]   other things around you for markers of where that path is. And if you're not paying
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:41.640]   attention, if you're not being intentional, you will get off the path.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.560]   And that's just as true in our journey of following Jesus. There are so many
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:52.040]   distractions from the narrow way. There are so many temptations that the devil
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:55.480]   puts in front of us to try to pull us off of the narrow way. There are so many
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:14:00.040]   off-ramps that the devil puts in front of us and says, "Hey, here's an easy way to
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.800]   just get off the narrow way and start traveling on the broad way." And the
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:11.080]   narrow way requires intentional pursuit. We have to be intentional about staying
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:14.920]   on it. Be paying attention. We have to be intentional about our relationship with
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:18.640]   God and keeping it healthy and our connection to Him and staying in His
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.040]   Word and praying and staying connected with other believers in the church and
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.160]   checking all of our beliefs against Scripture and against God's truth so
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.280]   that we don't start to believe erroneous things or things that are going to hurt
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.520]   us or hurt someone else. We've got to be intentional about all that stuff because
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.120]   if we're not intentional about staying on the path, then we're going to be off
[00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:44.480]   the path. It's just as simple as that. Another thing that's really important
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.920]   for us to understand, especially for us as younger people that live in our
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:55.960]   modern culture, is that the narrow way is deeply countercultural. The narrow way is
[00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:01.320]   deeply countercultural and that's reflected in these verses. Jesus says in
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:08.640]   verse 13, "The gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction and those
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.440]   who enter by it are many." Those words, the word for wide means that it's broad,
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:19.320]   it's flat, it's easy to travel on, and the word for easy means that it's
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:25.760]   spacious, there's lots of room, it looks really nice. And there's a lot of
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:30.520]   people on this path. Verse 13 is very clear about that. That means the narrow
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:37.040]   way is not popular. It's not a path that is going to be crowded and it's probably
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.400]   not the path that many of your friends and acquaintances and co-workers and
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.960]   classmates and the people around you are going to be on. And it's probably not the
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:50.600]   path that your friends and classmates and co-workers and acquaintances and
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:54.200]   maybe even family members, the people around you, it's probably not the path
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:57.640]   that they're going to encourage you to go towards. It's probably not the path
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:02.400]   that they're going to support you in walking in. If anything, they're probably
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:07.960]   going to try to pull you away from the narrow way and encourage you to walk on
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.720]   the Broadway because it seems so much easier, right? They say, "Hey, this road is
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:17.560]   flat and easy to travel. It doesn't have the challenges. It doesn't oppose your
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.440]   selfish desires. On the Broadway, you do whatever you want. If you feel like
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:25.880]   doing something, you do it. If you feel like gratifying yourself in some way,
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:32.380]   then you engage in that activity. It's easy. And look, there's so many people on
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.640]   the Broadway and we're having a great time and this is where you want to be.
[00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:41.960]   It's great over here. All the cool kids are here. So come here. Come to
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:47.320]   this way. Don't try to walk on that narrow, difficult path." That's the
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:52.160]   metaphor that Jesus is putting in front of us. And if we're honest, that's the
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:57.480]   world that we live in. Most of the people around us are not on the narrow way.
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:03.440]   They're on the broad path and they are calling to us, sometimes implicitly, but
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:08.680]   sometimes explicitly in things that they say to us. They're calling to us to leave
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:14.320]   the narrow way and to come walk on the broad path. The narrow way is not
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:19.260]   supported by our culture and by the values of our culture. The values of the
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:23.720]   kingdom are upside down and backwards to the values of our culture. And so our
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.400]   culture does not encourage us to live out and walk in the values of the
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:33.160]   kingdom. That's just the reality. If you don't believe me, let's just take a
[00:17:33.160 --> 00:17:36.460]   second and go through some of the kingdom values that we've been talking
[00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.920]   about. Let's just look at the Beatitudes themselves. Think about these.
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:43.800]   The very first one, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:49.760]   heaven." Think about that. If you say, "Okay, I'm ready to start a humility club at my
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.160]   school or at my job and I'm going to say, 'Hey, this club is all about poverty of
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:00.080]   spirit and humility. Let's sign up. Let's do this.'" How many people
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:04.840]   do you think are going to be excited about joining the humility club? No one.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:09.360]   That's not a value of our culture. If you want to start a club to promote
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:12.720]   yourself, then probably a lot of people would be interested in learning about
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:18.800]   that. But humility is not a value of our culture. What about purity of heart? Is
[00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:22.080]   that a value of our culture? Is that a value that your friends are going to
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:27.560]   encourage you to walk in and to live out? No, it's not. These things that Jesus
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.800]   talks about in the Beatitudes are really upside down and backwards to what we
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.840]   live out and practice in our culture. What about being meek and gentle? Is that
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:41.720]   a cultural value? It's not. What about hungering and thirsting after
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:47.600]   righteousness? Is that a cultural value? What about being a peacemaker? In our
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:55.040]   modern moment of turbulence and anger and frustration and division, everywhere
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:59.140]   you look, it is not a cultural value to be a peacemaker. And if you try to be a
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:02.780]   peacemaker, some people are going to be very upset at you and very angry at you.
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.800]   Look at what's going on in our politics and in our society here in the
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:12.600]   United States. People make money. People fundraise. People get votes and get
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:17.800]   elected off of division and fear. And so if you're spreading peace, people don't
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.240]   want to see that. People in power want others to experience division and fear
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:26.520]   because that keeps them in power. And so if you're a peacemaker, that's not going
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:31.440]   to be a popular value. What about these values later on in Matthew chapter 5
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:36.800]   where Jesus talks about loving our enemies and turning the other cheek to
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:42.480]   someone who has wronged us? Are those popular values? Do you think you can get
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:47.160]   those off the ground with anybody in our culture? No. No one wants to hear that.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.480]   Certainly no one wants to practice it. But people don't even want to hear that
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:57.080]   expressed. People oftentimes don't even want to hear forgiveness expressed in
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:02.200]   our culture because we are a culture that wants to take revenge and seek
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:06.520]   retribution anytime that we've been wronged. No one wants to hear someone say,
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:11.000]   "Hey, Jesus calls us to forgive." No one wants to hear that value in our
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:15.920]   culture. What about in Matthew chapter 6 later on where Jesus talks about
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:21.080]   storing up treasures in heaven? Do you think that's a value in our culture? Do you
[00:20:21.080 --> 00:20:23.400]   think that's something that people are going to be excited about and encourage
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:29.920]   you to live out? Is making decisions on earth with your finances that have
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.280]   eternity in mind? Is anyone going to think that's a good idea? No. People are
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:38.280]   going to say, "Hey, this is for you. You use this to take care of you. You
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.440]   don't use this to store up treasures in heaven. That doesn't make any sense."
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:46.400]   What about in Matthew chapter 5 when Jesus talks about anger and lust and he
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.160]   says, "Hey, you should not even entertain these thoughts in your mind because
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.840]   that's sinning." What if you try to live those out? Think about that. Young people
[00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:58.520]   think about that. If you have a conversation with your friend and you
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:04.600]   explain to them, "Hey, I'm trying to even avoid sexual sin in my mind, to not even
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:09.280]   have thoughts of lust in my mind because I feel like that's sinful. And so because
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:14.360]   of that I want to avoid pornography or because of that I'm really careful about
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:18.680]   the situations I put myself in." That's something that people will make fun of
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:23.080]   you for. I've had those conversations. I've been made fun of that. If you say,
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:30.000]   "Hey, I want my sexuality to honor God and because of that I'm only going to have
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.160]   certain types of relationships or I'm going to wait until I'm married to
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:38.600]   engage in sexual activity." That's something that people will mock you for.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:43.680]   That is not a cultural value and we need to understand that. If we are serious
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:47.400]   about living out the values of the kingdom, the culture around us does not
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.240]   share those values and is not going to support them and it's not going to
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:55.000]   encourage them and a lot of times will oppose them and mock them. And that's a
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.640]   part of walking on the narrow way and we need to be ready for that. The narrow way
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.840]   often leads to persecution. Jesus told us that in Matthew 5 verses 11 and 12
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:11.880]   when he said that we were going to experience persecution. And here he's
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.560]   expanding on that and letting us know why. Because we're walking on a way that
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.720]   doesn't make sense to people who don't know God. We're walking on a way that is
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:26.600]   narrow and difficult and everyone else is on the broad and easy way. Another
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:30.080]   thing I want us to see here in these verses is that Jesus only describes two
[00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:35.000]   paths. He says there's the narrow way and the broad way and he doesn't describe
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.040]   anything else. And that's important for us to understand as well. There is no
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.400]   middle way. Sometimes we think, "Well I can kind of keep a foot in both worlds. I
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.640]   can kind of do both. I can kind of be involved in following Jesus and
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.600]   in living out kingdom values a little bit. But I can also be involved in
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:54.800]   living out the values of the world around me." But there is no middle way and
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.920]   Jesus has already talked to us about that in the Beatitudes when he told us
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:02.360]   no one can serve two masters. So that's not really an option even though we
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.080]   want it to be an option. It's not. Jesus doesn't give us that option. He only
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:11.000]   talks about two paths and he's clear that only one path leads to life. One
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:15.600]   path leads to destruction and there's no ifs, ands, or buts about it. Jesus makes it
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.240]   clear the broad way, even though it's easy and popular and seems great, it
[00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:28.480]   leads to destruction both in this life and in eternity. And the only way that
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:33.520]   leads to life is the narrow way. And that's what I want us to see as we close
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:39.060]   this out. That there is a reward to the narrow way. Now so far the things we've
[00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:43.280]   talked about can seem discouraging and burdensome like, "Wow this sounds so tough
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:48.000]   and I don't know if I want to be on the narrow way because it just sounds really
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.360]   grim and it's something that I really want to live out." But we need to
[00:23:54.360 --> 00:23:59.600]   understand that there is a reward to the narrow way and it's an amazing and
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.200]   indescribable reward. Now first of all there's a reward of everlasting life.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:12.800]   Jesus says that the narrow way leads to life and that word has multiple
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:17.040]   connotations here and so it means everlasting life. Scripture is clear
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.440]   about that. If you think about John 3 16, it says Jesus is the way to eternal life.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:27.120]   John 5 24, where Jesus says that eternal life comes through believing in
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.400]   him. There's many other verses that talk about Jesus being the way to eternal
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:36.120]   life. But that is a part of the reward. That when our earthly life is over and
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:41.600]   our body dies, our soul will not die but will go into the presence of God in
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:46.880]   heaven and live eternally in a perfectly beautiful place with no sin, no
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:51.960]   injustice, no disease, no tears. All the terrible things that we experience in
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.360]   this life will be gone and we'll have eternal life in the presence of God. That
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:01.600]   in and of itself would be reward enough even if life was full of suffering and
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:06.640]   challenges to achieve that. It would be reward enough. But that's not the only
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:13.560]   reward. Jesus is clear that there is life in this life that is a reward here. Like
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:17.440]   I said, this word that the narrow way leads to life has multiple
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:22.240]   connotations and it refers to our life in the here and now as well. In John 10
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.920]   10, Jesus talks about that. How he came so that we could have abundant life. That
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:31.760]   word abundant means have life to the full and we could experience what we
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:36.880]   were truly created to experience. And that is a part of the reward of the
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:42.000]   narrow way that we get to experience and live out if we follow God and live out
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   kingdom values. We experience that in this life. Life to the full. The life that
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.540]   we were created for. A life of perfect and healthy fellowship with the God who
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:58.000]   made us and a life of healthy fellowship with the people around us. And that's
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.640]   something significant because what truly gives meaning to life? Is it the food we
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.640]   eat? Is it the money we make? Is it the things that we go do? I think all of us
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:14.840]   if we examine for very long we can see that what truly gives meaning to our
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:19.160]   life is the relationships that we have. That's why we enjoy the food if we're
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.880]   enjoying it with with people that are important to us. That's why we enjoy the
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.960]   experiences and the concerts and the events that we go to is if we're doing
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:31.640]   them with people that we love. That's what makes life meaningful is those
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:37.720]   relationships and the narrow way living out the values of the kingdom gives us
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:43.440]   the opportunity to experience truly healthy relationships. Like we talked
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:47.240]   about last week a truly healthy relationship with God the one who made
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.760]   us as we love him first and out of that we can start to live the golden rule and
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:55.360]   truly love the people around us and experience truly healthy relationships
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:27:00.680]   in our marriages, in our families, in our communities, in our cities, in our world.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:09.200]   So this promise of life is for the here and now as well and it also gives us
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:13.760]   something significant in the suffering and adversity that we face and that is a
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:18.440]   purpose. The reality is everyone experiences suffering and adversity in
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.240]   this world because our world is broken by sin. Even if you're not a follower of
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:25.960]   Jesus you're gonna go through some difficult times and if you are not a
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.000]   follower of Jesus if you're not living out the values of the kingdom then it's
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.560]   so difficult to find the meaning and the purpose in that suffering. It feels like
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.840]   there is no meaning and purpose in it. Why does this even happen? And that's
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:41.840]   why so many people can end up angry at God and say, "God why would you allow evil
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.000]   to be in our world? Why does this stuff happen? Why do you let any of these bad
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.320]   things take place?" But for a follower of Jesus, for someone who's living out the
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:54.320]   values of the kingdom, we can see that God is using that adversity and that
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:58.520]   suffering in our lives to grow us and to stretch us and to make us more like
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:03.160]   Jesus and to make us more able to love God and to love others. And so that gives
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:07.960]   purpose even in the challenging difficult moments of our life and that's
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.080]   a huge part of the blessing of walking in the narrow way. It's not that the
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:18.640]   narrow way is easy, it's challenging, but we see the meaning in the challenges. We
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.720]   see the purpose in the challenges that God brings into our life and it gives us
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:28.000]   that sense of shalom that we talked about last week. It's so powerful that
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:31.880]   God desires for us to have that sense of wholeness and that sense of
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:38.200]   health and prosperity and peace and justice and of permanence in our
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:42.280]   life because that only comes through right relationship with God and through
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:47.280]   seeking to live out the values of the kingdom. And I want us to see this, I
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.600]   don't want us to miss this because this is really big. We are not alone on the
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:57.520]   narrow way. Verses 13 and 14 tell us that there are many people on the broad
[00:28:57.520 --> 00:29:03.600]   way and sometimes when we read that and then read the words that follow we just
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.840]   assume that well I guess the narrow way means you're by yourself. It doesn't say
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:12.960]   that. It says those who find it are few. It doesn't say that those who find it
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.560]   are alone. And so even though there are times when the narrow way can feel
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:23.280]   lonely because it is countercultural and we're not encouraged to
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:27.600]   walk on that way by many of the people around us, we are not alone. First of all
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.920]   we have that relationship with God that strengthens us and sustains us and keeps
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:36.880]   us going. But secondly God through his body, through the church, through the
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:41.840]   the family of God as the New Testament calls us, puts all these people around us
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:46.160]   who love us and care for us and support us that we can fellowship with, that we
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.320]   can be encouraged by, that we can be cared for by, and that we can in turn
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.280]   care for them and encourage them and serve them and help them. We are not
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:59.840]   alone on the narrow way and that's encouraging to us in the times of
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.440]   challenge and it also is a part of that that abundant life. Life to the full is
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:09.440]   experiencing those truly healthy relationships that God gives us in in
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:14.280]   the family of God and the church. And then we have the opportunity to truly
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:18.240]   love the world around us. We talked about that last week when we were discussing
[00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:22.440]   the golden rule that it's so hard for us as humans to love and care for anyone
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:28.280]   else in a truly unselfish way. We always have some type of selfish motivation at
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:32.880]   the heart of what we do but through the work of Jesus in our heart and the power
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.600]   of the Holy Spirit in our lives we can actually be a conduit of God's love to
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:40.960]   others and we really can love the people around us, the people who don't know
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:46.160]   Jesus. We really can love and serve them in a truly unselfish and loving way and
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:51.280]   have life-giving relationships with people who are outside the church and
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.440]   that's a part of that life to the full. So there is great reward to walking in
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:01.840]   the narrow way. It is totally worth it and God calls us to it. We need to
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:05.360]   understand that it's not easy. We need to understand that there's commitment
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:08.840]   required. We need to understand that there's intentionality required that we
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.640]   have to pay attention and stay focused to stay on that path. We need to
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.120]   understand that it's countercultural and that we are not going to be encouraged
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.680]   in the narrow way by most of the people around us but we need to understand that
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:28.240]   it is full of reward and beauty and goodness because God loves us and he is
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:32.680]   full of grace and he's extending that grace to us even as he calls us to walk
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:38.880]   on the narrow way. Let's pray. God thank you for this truth and just for how
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:45.320]   clearly and directly you lay it out in this passage that you call us to walk on
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.560]   the narrow way. It's not an easy way. It requires commitment. It requires
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:55.280]   intentional pursuit. We have to follow after you and God it is full of
[00:31:55.280 --> 00:32:01.080]   challenges. There's a lot of difficulties in life but there is so much reward and
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:05.080]   so God I pray that we would not be surprised by the challenges or the
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:08.920]   adversity of our life. We would see what you're saying here and understand that
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:13.040]   that it's going to be challenging at times and we would understand the
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:16.300]   commitment and the intentionality that's required and we would
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.780]   dedicate ourselves to having that commitment and living that out
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:25.560]   intentionally and God as we do I pray that we would experience your reward in
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:29.560]   our lives. That we would really begin to be so saturated with the values of the
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:33.720]   kingdom that they're flowing out of our life in a life-giving way to others. That
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:37.080]   we would live out these values of the kingdom that when it's difficult, when
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.520]   we're made fun of, or when people don't understand or oppose us that it would
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:44.480]   not stop us from living out the values of the kingdom and God that we would
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:49.120]   experience your life to the full. We know we'll experience that one day in heaven but
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:52.600]   even now in this life that we would experience it to the full. That we would
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:58.040]   live in healthy relationship to you. That you would just pour your love and your
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.000]   life into us and that we would be a conduit of your love and your life to
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:06.680]   others. That we would be able to to have healthy and life-giving relationships
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:11.680]   with those around us. God in Jesus name, Amen.
