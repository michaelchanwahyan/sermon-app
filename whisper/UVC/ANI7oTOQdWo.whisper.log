[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   And I love that a lot of the songs we sang this morning were centered around the glory
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   of God, the glory of Jesus.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   And I love that a lot of the songs we sang this morning were centered around the glory
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   of God, the glory of Jesus.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   And I love that a lot of the songs we sang this morning were centered around the glory
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   of God, the glory of Jesus.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And I love that a lot of the songs we sang this morning were centered around the glory
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   of God, the glory of Jesus.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   And I love that a lot of the songs we sang this morning were centered around the glory
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   of God, the glory of Jesus.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   Most minds of fiction on the planet can't even begin to comprehend or understand how
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   great things are going to be, how glorious our future is, our hope in heaven is, where
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   our bodies and minds are perfected, the heavens and the earth perfect, perfect justice, perfect
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   peace, perfect love, utter perfection.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   And according to Paul, all of this is utterly glorious.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   And therefore, our present sufferings are nothing but a mere drop in an infinite ocean
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   of glory and perfection.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   And so that right there is why he can endure suffering and why he can say it's only temporary
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   and it's only light, because he knows something is coming that is so much greater.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   And then Paul continues.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   He doesn't stop there, although he could, but he continues to explain how great this
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   future glory is that allows us to persevere through suffering.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   The next two verses, Paul says this.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   "For the creation waits with eager expectation for the children of God to be revealed.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   For the creation was subjected to frustration, not by its own choice, but by the will of
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   the one who subjected it in hope."
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   So, Paul continues by painting this picture, he gives us this analogy that all of creation,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the hills, the oceans, everything is waiting
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   for this coming moment in anticipation.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And the reason that it's waiting is because it has been subjected to frustration, it says.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And the reason that all of creation, as good as it is, has been subjected to frustration,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   we see all the way back in the beginning, in the opening chapters of Genesis, when God
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   subjected creation.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   You see that when the fall of man happened, when sin entered the world through Adam and
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   what him and Eve did in the garden, God not only cursed Adam and Eve, but he also cursed
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   the ground.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   He cursed creation.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   And the reality that creation has been subjected, it's evident everywhere you look in a lot
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   of different ways.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Like I said before, our bodies are always breaking down, but the earth itself, all of
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   creation is also breaking down and things are not right, they're not as they should
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   be.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   And so you can think in creation, what examples of this do we see in nature?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   Earthquakes and tsunamis that destroy so much.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   Forest fires and droughts where you have whole nations burning for days, weeks on end.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Those things, we call them natural disasters, but they're not really natural.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   That's not the original way God created the earth.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   That came when sin came, when God subjected the world.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   You can also see this, if any of you guys in here are like into physics, maybe you're
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   a little bit nerdy like me, you know about the second law of thermodynamics?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Anybody know what I'm talking about?
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Okay, okay, I'll break it down for you guys, I'll break it down for you guys, okay?
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   So the second law of thermodynamics, simply put is that everything is winding down.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   Everything is going from a state of order to disorder.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   So things are always breaking down.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   As soon as you buy a car, you drive it off the lot, immediately loses its value.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   You buy a house, over time it breaks down, the pipes, they're leaky, the roof needs
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   to be replaced, everything is always breaking down.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   And this is true even in our own lives, I'll give you guys a little bit of an example
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   for myself, I'll be honest.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   As the years go by and I look back at pictures of myself from college or from high school,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I'll always ask my wife, Kiamia, just be honest with me, Kiamia, you know, look, is
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   my hairline falling back, okay?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I have to wonder, because everything is winding down, eventually all these beautiful locks
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   will be gone.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   My dad is bald, my grandpa's bald, it's coming for me one day.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   That's just the reality, and it's goofy, it's kind of silly, but it's true.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Everything in creation is winding down.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   But even in this frustration, there is a hope.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   Even for creation, there is a hope.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000]   And so what is that hope?
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   Paul explains in the next verse.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   That the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   the freedom and glory of the children of God.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And so this hope, even for creation, is the emancipation of all creation from the bondage
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   to corruption.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   That there is a certain glory that all of creation, like the children of God, will freely
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   receive when God makes all things new.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   And it is this beautiful new creation that you can see in Revelation chapter 21, chapter
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   22, when the universe will no longer trend in the direction of death, disease, and decay.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   There will be no more disorder.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   All things will be restored to perfect order.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And this future is so great that Paul gives us this picture of all creation waiting, anticipating
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   to see what is brought about when that glorious future comes to fruition.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And again, Paul just continues building upon this picture, building this metaphor to underscore
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   the greatness of the glory to come.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   And I want to explain here the reason that Paul is doing this.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   He's explaining how great it is and the glory to come and that creation is growing.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   And because this is all building into that very first point of how we can deal with our
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   suffering is by looking to a future hope.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   So I want you guys to kind of get a sense of this weight of the future glory, how awesome
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   it is.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Paul really, really goes to great lengths to get his readers to understand how great
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   it's going to be because that will help us deal with suffering.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And so he says in verse 22 and 23, "We know that the whole creation has been groaning as
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   Not only so, but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the Spirit grown inwardly
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   as we wait eagerly for the adoption to sonship, the redemption of our bodies."
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   So Paul gives us this, and I think this is like the perfect metaphor for what he's teaching
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   here about suffering, is the metaphor of childbirth.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And as I mentioned before, my wife, 38 weeks pregnant, we've been doing these childbirth
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   education classes once a week.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   And we go to the class, and we have to learn how to prepare, what labor is like, how to
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   get ready, make sure your bag is packed, make sure you have the car seat in the car.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   And one of the things that I've had to watch is childbirth videos.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And, okay, if there's any moms, fathers in here, even if you're not a mom or a father,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   you know a mom, okay?
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And so there's just something about childbirth that if I were to describe it, I would say
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   that it's not a quiet situation.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   It's not the most peaceful, serene, quiet environment.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   It's kind of a noisy thing.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   And a lot of these videos I've seen, these women when they're in labor, they're just
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   groaning is the best word you can say.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   They're not really saying words.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   They're just groaning in anticipation.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   And I was thinking that maybe I would give you an example, but I'm not going to do that.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   I'm not going to, you know, that's loud.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   But you get the idea.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   It's just this groaning and it's wordless, but they're just longing and waiting for this
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   baby to come into the world.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   And so we can learn from childbirth some beautiful truths about our own suffering.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   And months and months of pain and sickness and suffering, it teaches us something that's
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   true for everyone.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   And so when we think about childbirth, we think about this beautiful way in which God
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   has designed us to bring life into the world.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   There's three things we can learn from this about our own suffering.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   The first is that it is absolutely temporary.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   So for all the moms out there, could you imagine living in a world where you did not know that
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   nine months was like the limit?
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   Imagine living in a world where you could be pregnant for nine months, but you could
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   also be pregnant for nine years, and you just didn't know.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Okay?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You just did not know when it was going to come to an end.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Imagine how hard that would be.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Okay?
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   And as tough as those nine months are, you always have this thought in the back of your
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   head, "Okay, 40 weeks.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Okay, if I can get to 40 weeks, okay, I can handle it.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   I got two weeks left.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   I got one week left.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   I can do this."
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   Right?
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   And so the fact that the suffering is temporary, it gives you some peace as you bear it.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   It gives you some hope and some encouragement.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And the second thing is that suffering is absolutely purposeful.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   When a woman is pregnant, all that, the sickness and the aching and the pains, it's not pointless.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   All of it is a part of God's beautiful process of bringing life into this world.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And so all of that pain is purposeful.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   And so it just, it allows you to suffer it and bear it a little more because you know
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   God is using all of this for a beautiful and glorious purpose.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   And that none of my suffering is purposeless.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And the last thing, and I think the most beautiful thing, is that all that suffering is absolutely
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   worth it.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   I've talked to so many moms over the past few months, getting advice and asking them
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   about their experience.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   And the one thing they'll always tell me, well, two things.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   The first thing, they'll always agree that it is difficult, that it is not easy.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   But the second thing they always say is that that moment when they first saw their little
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:20.000]   baby girl, or they first held their baby boy to their chest, all the pain, all the suffering,
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   it just melts away.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   It becomes one of the happiest moments of their life.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And the pain is replaced with pure joy, right?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   And so all of that suffering is absolutely worth it.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And so this is true in childbearing, but it's also true in creation.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   And it's true for us that suffering in this fallen world is only temporary and it's not
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   purposeless, but it will be absolutely worth it.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   And so we can know confidently that this future day of glory is coming, not just for creation,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   but for us also.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And we can know that, Paul says, because God has given us a guarantee.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   He has given us a down payment, and that's the Holy Spirit.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   He says that the Holy Spirit is the first fruits.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   And this is a concept we get from Scripture where when the produce came, when it was time
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   for the harvest, the Israelites would give a first fruit offering to God, knowing that
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   He would make sure that their crops came in again during the next harvest and they had
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   enough food to eat.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And so that first fruit offering, it was like this trusting in God, this guarantee of what
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   is to come.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   And so the Holy Spirit serves a similar purpose for us.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   He is a guaranteed down payment.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   He is a promised portion of a coming fullness.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   And again, that fullness, that glory, that future hope allows us to persevere when we
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   suffer in this life.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Paul continues, verse 24 and 25, "For in this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   is no hope at all.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Who hopes for what they already have?
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   But if we hope for what we do not yet have, we wait for it patiently."
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   So we're hoping, we're waiting for this future glory.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   We may not have it yet.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   We may not see it yet, but we know it's coming and we have the confident assurance that it
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   will come.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And I want to make a point to explain that when you read in the Bible about hope, that
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   biblical hope, true hope, as Paul is talking about here, it is not just like a regular
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   sense of hope.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   It's not like a kid who writes a Christmas letter and is hoping to get his favorite toy
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   and he might get it, but he might not.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   That's not the kind of hope we have.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   We have a hope that is grounded in the promises of God, a God who doesn't lie, who doesn't
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   change his mind.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   And so we have a hope that is assured, that we know will come to pass.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   It's a confident assurance that we have.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And it's because of that confident assurance of the future glory to come that we can eagerly
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   and patiently wait through our sufferings.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   So, all of that metaphor and analogy and word picture Paul gives us leads us to our first
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   answer, our first answer to the question of suffering, how can we deal with suffering?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   It is by knowing and believing in this future hope to come, this glory that's unimaginable,
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   that outweighs any suffering you can experience in this life.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   That coming glory is so great we can bear under any suffering and difficult circumstances
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   in this life.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   But Paul continues, and we're going to see now a second reason how we can endure suffering
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   in this life.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   Verses 26 to 27 says, "In the same way, the Spirit helps us in our weakness.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   wordless groans.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   for God's people in accordance with the will of God."
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   And the beautiful thing about this is that we do not suffer alone.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   A lot of people have this, a lot of people in the world who reject the idea of God.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   They say things like, "I just can't believe in a God who allows suffering.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   I can't believe in a God who just sits back and does nothing while people suffer."
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And the truth is, I would not believe in that kind of God either, because that is not the
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   kind of God we have.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   We have a God who, one, not only entered into the world to suffer as the world suffers,
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   but we have a God who in the Holy Spirit is with us in our weakness, in the midst of our
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   suffering, so that we don't have to be alone.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   And even when we don't know why we suffer, even when we don't know quite what to pray
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:49.000]   for or how to respond to suffering, Paul says that the Holy Spirit knows what we need, and
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   the Holy Spirit is going to God the Father, interceding on our behalf, because on one
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:59.000]   hand, the Holy Spirit who's inside of us knows exactly what we need.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   On the other hand, the Holy Spirit knows the mind of God, and He knows the exact will of
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   God, so we can be confident that even when we're in a moment of weakness and we don't
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   know what to say to God, how to pray, what to do, the Holy Spirit who knows us and knows
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   the Father's will goes to God on our behalf.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   And those things that we need, those requests taken to God, in His will, will be done.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   And so we have that confidence that God is with us, God is always working about His will,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   and that's exactly what we need.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   A question that can arise that Paul's going to answer in this next verse, though, is what
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   exactly is the will of God?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   If the Holy Spirit, when we don't know what to pray for, is interceding, working for us
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   to achieve the will of God, what exactly is the will of God for us in the midst of our
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   suffering?
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Paul says in verse 28, "And we know that in all things, God works for the good of those
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   who love Him, who have been called according to His purpose."
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   So God's will is our good.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   God is working all things out for our good.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   And that can be difficult to imagine.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Just think about it.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Do we truly believe that God is working all things for our good, that God is working cancers,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   criticism, rejection for our good?
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Just as much as He is working beautiful things, pleasurable, amazing things for our good,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   God is working all things for our good.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   And therefore, even when we suffer, our suffering is not meaningless.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   It is not purposeless, because God is even using suffering for our good.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   And I think that's such a beautiful truth, that our suffering is not meaningless and
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   is not purposeless, because take a second and think about a world in which there is
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   no God.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   And for many people on the planet, this is the world that they think they live in, a
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   world with no God, no Creator, no ultimate meaning, no ultimate purpose, no right or
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   wrong.
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   In that kind of a world, our suffering is totally meaningless.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   In that kind of a world, we're just creation, we're just accidents, not even created.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   That sometime in the past, there was just something that happened in the midst of nothingness
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   and created the world, but there's no intended order or no design.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   And so we ultimately have no purpose, we have no Creator.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   And so when we suffer, we just suffer.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   It's not good, it's not bad, it just is what it is.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   That kind of life is depressing and it's sad, but that is not the reality we have, because
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   we do know there is a God in heaven, and He's sovereign, and He rules and reigns over
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   everything and uses all things for our good.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   So even when we suffer, there's a meaning, there's a purpose behind it, and we can be
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   comforted because we know that meaning and purpose is for our good.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   One thing I do want to say about this verse, because it's a very popular verse, and it's
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   easy to pull this verse out of its context, and it's easy to try to spin this verse into
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   a way Paul did not intend.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   So what Paul is not saying is that God is going to do whatever you think is good, that
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   God is going to give you whatever you think is good, and that if you think money and riches
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   and car and all success and every avenue of life is what's going to happen, that's not
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   what Paul is saying, because Paul is somebody, again, he knew what it was like to suffer.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   He knew what it was like to be rejected, to be despised, to be hated, to be hungry, but
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   that's not because Paul was outside of God's will or disobedient to God.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   He was obedient to God and still experienced those things.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   The truth of what God really wants for us, and that's not to say that He doesn't ever
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   want us to have nice things and have good things.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   There are times when He does, but the ultimate good that God is working out, and what Paul
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   is talking about here, is not exactly what the world may define good to be.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   Paul is going to define what that ultimate good is.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:12.000]   In the very next verse, he says this, "For those God foreknew, He also predestined to
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brothers
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   and sisters.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   And those He predestined, He also called.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Those He called, He also justified.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Those He justified, He also glorified."
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   So you can see what Paul is saying here is that our ultimate good is to be conformed
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   to Christ, is to become like Jesus Christ.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   That is the ultimate good that God always desires in every situation, and God uses everything,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   all things, every situation to that end, to make us like Jesus Christ.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   That is the ultimate goal of our lives, as followers of Jesus Christ, is not to get rich,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   is not to be the most popular, or the most well-liked and respected, but is to be like
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   Jesus Christ.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   No matter what circumstances we find ourselves in, we should long to be like Christ, to think
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   like Christ, to love like Christ.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   That is what God wants for our lives.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   And we see that not only do these verses reveal what God is working all things for in our
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   lives, but it also reminds us the reason that we can be confident of these things, that
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   we can be absolutely assured that God's got us, is because in this verse, in this passage,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   we see what, for generations, for centuries, the church has celebrated, and it's often
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   called the golden chain of salvation.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And it's the reason that we can be confident that God has us, and gives us assurance that
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   he's holding us, he's keeping us safe, like an anchor who holds a boat down.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   God has this, because Paul says, "Those whom God foreknew, he predestined to be conformed
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   to the image of his Son.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   And those he predestined, he called.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Those he called, he justified.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Those he justified, he glorified."
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   And Paul is writing these verbs here, called, predestined, justified, glorified.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   And even though that glory we know is a future glory, Paul's writing about these things as
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   if they've already happened, as if it's a present reality that we already are glorified.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   And what Paul is doing is telling these readers that if you have been predestined by God,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   foreknown by God, which doesn't mean that he just knew of you, which is true of everyone.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   God knows everything, and therefore, from the beginning of time, God knew everyone.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   But those who God foreknew, he loved in a special way.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   He knew in a special, intimate way.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   And those who he foreknew, he predestined.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Those he predestined, he called.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   Those he called, he justified.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   Those he justified, he glorified.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   That's a confident thing, that if you have been foreknown by God, it's already a done deal.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   You're glorified by God, as if it's already happened.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   And so that is how we can be so confident of these things.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Even when we suffer, even when it seems like things are not going right, this right here
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   gives us so much hope.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   And so we see here that second reason that we can suffer.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   One is because there's a future glory coming that is so great, no amount of suffering can
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   even begin to compare.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   And number two is that we are never alone in our suffering.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   God's always with us.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And he has been before the world was even created.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And now the third reason we see here of why we can endure this suffering is because none
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   of our suffering is meaningless.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   It all has a reason.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   It all has a purpose.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And so those are three things that are just so encouraging in the midst of our suffering.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   God's working all things for our good, so our suffering, it is not meaningless.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   There's a reason behind it that is good for us, that's great for us.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   And that truth that many worldviews, many philosophies and religions don't have this
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   hope in the midst of suffering that we have.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Those three things that can keep us grounded in the midst of our suffering.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   And I think that there's a beautiful example of this all the way as far back as, again,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   the book of Genesis and the life of Joseph.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   We see these truths at play when Joseph, loved by his father but hated by his brothers, was
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   betrayed, thrown into a pit, sold into slavery, goes into the land of Egypt, and then he's
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   harassed and falsely accused by his master's wife.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Then he's put in jail, and he's left in jail, and he helps these two guys who were formerly
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   working in the house of Pharaoh.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   He helps one of them get back into Pharaoh's good graces.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   And Joseph tells this cupbearer of Pharaoh, "When you get back into Pharaoh's household,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   tell him about me so that I can get out."
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   And when the man gets back into Pharaoh's household, he forgets about Joseph.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   And Joseph spends even more time falsely accused, wrongly imprisoned.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   All of this, through all this suffering, we see God is still with Joseph.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   God never leaves Joseph.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   God never lets Joseph suffer for no reason.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   We start to see that God is working in the midst of all this because the time comes when
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Joseph is called up.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   He gets his chance.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   He goes before Pharaoh.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   He interprets Pharaoh's dream favorably.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   It comes to pass, and he gets elevated to the second most powerful position in Egypt,
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   all because God was always working through his suffering.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   And a famine comes across all the land, and because Joseph, through God, saw it coming,
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   he had stocked up grain and food.
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   So when all the different peoples in the nations around Egypt have to come receive grain,
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   his brothers, who set this whole thing in motion, throwing him in the pit, selling him into slavery,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   they come to him now to get help from him so they can live.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   And they don't really realize it's him.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   There's this kind of back and forth that occurs.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   But in the very end of this narrative, we see that he is kind of restored to them.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   He accepts them.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   He reveals himself to them, to his father.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   There's joy.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   They're celebrating.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   But when their father, Jacob, dies, the brothers get scared, because now they think that Joseph
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   is going to get revenge.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   There's no one to stop him.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   But when they come to him in fear, trembling, he tells them not to fear.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   And he gives this beautiful verse, I think sums up the story, the life of Joseph so perfectly,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   and it exemplifies what we're talking about in Romans chapter 8.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   Joseph tells them, "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good, to accomplish
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   what is now being done, the saving of many lives."
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   So we see that God is sovereign over everything.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   And it's not that what his brothers intended for evil, God used for good, as if God had
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   to create a plan B and scramble to figure out, "How can I turn this bad situation out for good?"
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   What he says is that, "You intended to harm me.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   God intended it."
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   So God was already sovereign over their decision, over their choices, using it for Joseph's good.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   That's exactly what Paul is bringing out in Romans chapter 8.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   That's the same thing God does for us.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   He's always working, he's always using all things, suffering included, for our good.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   So when we think about this beautiful truth, one, that God is using all things for our
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   good, which means our suffering is never purposeless or meaningless.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Two, the Holy Spirit is working on our behalf, always interceding, so that when we suffer,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   we're never alone.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   And three, when we suffer, we have on the other hand, this future glory that is so great,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   it makes all our suffering pale in comparison.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Those three truths give us a new perspective on how to handle suffering in this life.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   And so when we suffer now, we don't need to ask the question, "Why me?
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Why am I suffering?
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   How could I ever get through this?"
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   We should ask ourselves, "What can I do now in my suffering with these beautiful truths,
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   with what God has revealed?
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   How can I apply them to my life to persevere through the suffering, or to encourage someone
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   close to me who is also suffering?"
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   So I want to leave you guys with three final questions and three final exhortations to
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   take this word to heart, that we could all use it, be encouraged by it, and apply it
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   in our lives to the glory of God.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   So, brothers and sisters, when you suffer, are you tempted to give up hope?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   Are you tempted to lose faith?
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Remember that your suffering is temporary.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   It will not last forever.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   It cannot last forever.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   And not only that, but the future glory to come, which will replace that suffering, is
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   guaranteed to come, and it's so amazing.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   It's so great.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   It's perfect.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   It's glorious.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   And it totally outweighs any suffering you can face in this life.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   So look beyond your suffering.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Fix your eyes on the glory that is to come, and keep your hope in that which is unseen.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   When you suffer, are you tempted to believe that you are alone, or that no one is there
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   to help you?
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Are you inviting the Holy Spirit in the midst of your suffering and weakness to help you?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   Remember that even in your weakness, the Holy Spirit is there for you, interceding on your
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   behalf, taking your needs to God, and the will of God will be done in your life.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Rely on the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Depend on His working in and through your weakness.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Turn to Him when you suffer.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   And lastly, when you suffer, are you tempted to believe it's all for nothing?
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   Do you truly believe that God works all things for your good, that your suffering is not
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   meaningless?
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Remember that, as Paul says, the truth is that God does work all things for your good.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   For those who love God and have been called according to His purpose, and we saw that
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   this purpose has been in play from before the foundation of time.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   And that's how you can be confident that God is and will work all things for your good.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   And this means that your suffering is never in vain.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   God's always working for you in eternal weight of future glory, even in the midst of your
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   suffering.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Know that your Heavenly Father is good.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   He's taking care of you.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   No matter what we go through in this life, God is there for us, and He's got us for all
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   eternity.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   Trust in Him.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   Will you please pray with me?
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Heavenly Father, Lord our God, I just want to thank you.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Thank you that you have given us this perspective on suffering, that you have given us a future
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   hope that we cannot even fully comprehend, but we know it is so great, so glorious.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Any suffering we face in this life utterly pales in comparison.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   Thank you, God, that you do not leave us to suffer alone, but that you have given us your
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Holy Spirit who helps us in the midst of our weakness, who takes our request to our Father
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   in Heaven, and that His will will be done in our life, that all things will be worked
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   out for good.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   And we thank you, Father, that none of our suffering is meaningless, none of it is in
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   vain or futile or purposeless, but that you are using it all for your good, which is our
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   good.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Help us, Father God, to in all things become more like Jesus Christ.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   Please take this word, hide it deep in our hearts so that when we suffer, we will know
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   that we have hope, or when that someone near us is suffering, we will be able to share
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   that hope with them.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And please, Father God, put a burden in our hearts to take this good news, to take this
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   gospel of hope to a world that desperately needs it, so that those who do not know about
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   this hope, who don't know that there is purpose in all suffering, that all things can be worked
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   for good, help us to take this gospel to them, Father God, that they would receive the blessings
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   and the hope that is found in no other name than Jesus Christ.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   We thank you for this day.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   We thank you for this opportunity to be here to hear your word, Father God.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   Just pray that you would sanctify us by your word.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   And I ask all these things in Jesus' precious name.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Amen.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
