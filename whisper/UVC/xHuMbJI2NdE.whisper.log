[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   And here is it, let's welcome Pastor Mark for today's sermon.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Hey, good morning guys.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   I had a really good Thanksgiving week and we ate a lot in Toronto.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   We spent five, six days, right?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   From Monday to Saturday.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Right, how many days?
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   And we ate a lot of good food and we spent a great time there.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Nine of us went there.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   So we did a lot of shopping.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   I started to think in the third day or fourth day,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   I started to think my main job is actually just driving and paying,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   using my credit card to pay all the good stuff, right?
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   So, you know, it just got so good, right?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   So Thanksgiving is just over and it's a holiday
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   or it's a time of the year to remind us God has been good to all of us,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   you and me, and we need to give thanks, right?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   There are some calendar markers along the year to remind us
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   what God is doing in your life
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   and when to respond positively to God's good work.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And today we continue this series to talk about the festivals,
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   the special days in the Bible.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And we talk about Passover, we talk about Sukkot,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   now we talk about Pentecost, what we call Shofoot.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Shofoot simply means weeks in plural, so many weeks.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   So in the Old Testament calendar, it's seven weeks,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   seven Sundays after the Passover.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   So it's the 50th day is the day of Shofoot, the day of Pentecost.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   That's why we call it Pentecost in Greek, 50, right?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It's a day that is special in the sense that there is nothing
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   related to God's miracles in the history of His people in Israel.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   We talk about Sukkot, right?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Tabernacles, it has to do with God's miracle works
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   in the wilderness, right?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   God is guiding His people out of Egypt and through the great
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and fearful wilderness for 40 years and giving them manna, right?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Giving them food and water, miracle works, you know, for 40 years.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   That's why they celebrate Sukkot and they make temporary shelters
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   and they live in it for a week to remember what God has done
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   in their history, in their lives.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   And then the second example I give you is that most of the
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   biblical calendar, most of the biblical festivals have to do
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   with God's miraculous work in the lives of the people.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And Sukkot is one of them, Tabernacle is one of them,
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and Purim is another one.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Purim, if you remember, is a holiday that is set aside
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   by the end of the book of Esther, right?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   When the Jews were separated or scattered across the Persian Empire,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   they were persecuted and God, you know, saved them and rescued them, right?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   And then the third one is mentioned in the Gospel of John,
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   chapter 10, is called Hanukkah, right?
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Hanukkah is around the time of Christmas.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Sometimes we call it Festival of Lights.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   It has to do with the Jewish people in the year of 160-something BC
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   when they fought against the Greek Empire who persecuted them,
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   oppressed them, and they won.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   They won the battle and they gained their political independence.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   That's why they cleansed the temple and they rededicated the temple.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   They call it Hanukkah, right?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   The fourth festival we talk about is the Passover.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Passover, it has to do with Exodus, right?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   The 10 plagues, God defeated the oppressor Pharaoh
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and saved his people out of Egypt.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   Now, all these examples have to do with God's great works.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   You know, he has done some signs and wonders to save his people.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   But Pentecost almost has nothing to do with miraculous work of God.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Now, let's take a look at this verse from Leviticus 23.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   It says, "From the day after Sabbath,"
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   now, the previous context was talking about Passover, Passover.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   "When Passover is done, from the day after the Shabbat,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   count off seven full weeks and then keep counting until the day after Sabbath,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   which is 50 days later.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Then present your grain offering to the Lord,
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   whatever your harvest is, your first fruit, you present to God in the temple."
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   So, it has no miracles.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   It has to do with farming, harvest, you know, agricultural festival.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   50 days after the Passover, the Pentecost,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   they bring in the wheat harvest and being reminded God is the provider.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   God is faithful.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Now, as I said, there's nothing to do with the saving works of God.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   No exodus, no wilderness, no miracles in the Bible, but they celebrate it.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Now, between the Old Testament and the New Testament,
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   there are about a few hundred years in between.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   We call it intertestamental period.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   After the Old Testament, before Christ came in the New Testament,
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   there were about a few hundred years.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   The Jewish people in the land of Palestine,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   they would merge some of the dates of festival together.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   So, in between the Old Testament and New Testament,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   the Jewish people would take the day of Pentecost to Sheffield
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   as remembrance of God's giving the law to His people.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Now, it's about the same time, right?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Because if you remember the people of Israel,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   they came out of Egypt at the twilight of Passover,
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   and then exactly two months later, they arrived at Mount Sinai,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and God gave them the law, right?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Part of the law is Ten Commandments.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   So, it's two months after Exodus, they came to Mount Sinai,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   they received the law, right? They became a covenant people.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   They became people of the law.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And then the Sheffield O is 50 days after Passover,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   so they kind of merged that, right? It's around the same time.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   So, they would use this time to remember God giving them the law,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   the revelation.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   That's why in Pentecost, in between the Old Testament and New Testament,
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   they sometimes call it Pentecost, but also called the Festival of Revelation.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   God is giving them the law, His regulations, His will to His people.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   So, it makes sense around this time they merged these things together.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   But there's one note we need to make.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   What is the law? What is the Torah?
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   Now, this becomes problematic for us,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   because in modern translations, usually we translate the word Torah,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   which is Hebrew, into law or regulations in English, right?
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Or, you know, in some other modern translations.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   You get the sense that law has nothing to do with relationship, right?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   You see a stop sign, you ran a stop sign, right?
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   And then you got pulled over.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   There's nothing relational about it, right?
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   The police officer will give you a ticket, right?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Or it hurts your wallet, right?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   You got fined, but there's no relational dynamics involved, right?
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   You just violate some regulations.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   You see the speed limit, 55 miles per hour.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   You know, you went over it, and too bad if you got pulled over.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   You know, it hurts financially, but there's nothing relational about it.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   But in the Bible, Torah is not impersonal.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   It is relational.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   It has everything to do with your relationship with God, right?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   A few weeks ago, I was in Kansas City, and I was taking one of the seminars.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   So we were talking about how we should translate the word Torah,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   because definitely it does not mean the modern sense of law.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   How do you translate Torah?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   I think one of the examples given by the instructors, the professors,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   is really appropriate.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   He says, you know, Torah in the Bible, law and regulations in the Bible,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   is like how, you know, if you're a parent, you tell a child,
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   "Don't touch the stove," all right?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   "Don't touch the stove."
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   You know, one-year-old, two-year-old, "Don't mess with the stove," right?
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Now, this is like the law, right?
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   For a two-year-old, that makes sense, right?
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   You don't touch it.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   But when the child grows up, if it's simply,
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   "Remember, just stay away from the stove," for the rest of his life,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   I think he obviously does not understand what it means.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   When the parents tell the child, "Do not touch the stove,"
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   what does it really mean?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   It means use the stove properly, right?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   So when the child goes up, when the boy goes up,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   he knows how to cook, right?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   He will approach the stove and cook a good meal, right?
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   That's what it means.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   That's the essence of don't touch the stove, right?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   So as you grow up, you understand, you know, so-called the Torah.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Actually, you have to interpret it and apply it with wisdom.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   As you grow up, you need to understand this is the essence of the law.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Now, think about Ten Commandments.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   Ten Commandments.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I'll give you examples.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   "Thou shalt not murder," right?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Well, what does it mean?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   Does it mean, "Okay, I just don't kill anyone," right?
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   "I don't murder anyone, so I'm fulfilling the law," right?
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   No. No.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   That's not what it means
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   because it means to nurture a life-giving society,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   a life-giving culture.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   That's why in other regulations,
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   when they unpack what it means "Thou shalt not murder,"
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   they will say you have to protect, you know, the innocents.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   You have to protect other people who are weaker than you
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   because God loves every life, every human being.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   "Thou shalt not commit adultery."
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   What does it really mean?
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   You cannot imagine a husband going home every night and say,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   "You know, I did not commit any extramarital affair.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   I love you," right?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   No. That's not what it means.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   It means culturing or nurturing a good relationship,
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   a good family, a good marital relationship, right?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   That is what the commandment means.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   It's relational.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   "Thou shalt not steal."
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   That does not mean, okay, I don't take anyone else's goods
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   or I don't take their stuff.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   No, it means to promote generosity.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   What I have is not just fulfilling my needs and my wants.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I will give. I will give back to God
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   because God is giving you abundantly.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   That's why you make your offering.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   That's why you want to use your resources to bless other people.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   That goes beyond just calculating, okay,
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   "Oh, it has an offering, you know, 10% and all that stuff."
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   You know, that simply means that we do not understand the Torah.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Just like the example, "Don't touch the stove."
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   So if you think about the Torah,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   you think about the law of God given at the time of Pentecost.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   You understand there is something we need to, you know,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   interpret and we need to understand, right?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   It's relational and there is some essence you need to understand.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   That's why today in Jewish synagogues,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   during the festival of weeks, the Pentecost,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   they will read two passages from the Bible.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   Now, one of them, of course, is what I have already explained,
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   is 10 Commandments.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   They will read this portion of Scripture
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   to remember God has revealed Himself.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   God has revealed His character by His law.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   That's why as the people of God, we need to follow
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   and to understand and apply the law of God in their lives
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   to live out the life of God.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   That's why they recite the 10 Commandments in the synagogues.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   And another passage they will recite during this festival,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   festival of Pentecost or Shavuot,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   they will recite the Book of Ruth.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   The Book of Ruth.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   And why?
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   If you remember the story of the Book of Ruth,
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   it was the time of judges
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   when the Israelite society was in chaos.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   And Ruth was a Moabite.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And she left her own country
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   and confessed faith in the true God Yahweh.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And she lived in the land of Israel.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   And she was poor, right, with her mother-in-law.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   They went through a lot of difficulties
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   trying to settle down in a foreign land,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   in the land of Palestine.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Now, what does it have to do with Pentecost or Shavuot
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   or, you know, the time of harvest?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Well, it happened that in Chapter 2,
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Ruth the girl met her future husband, Boaz,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   in the time of Shavuot, in the time of harvest.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Chapter 2, "One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi,"
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   her mother-in-law, "Let me go out to the field,
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   the harvest field, right, that people are harvesting, right?"
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   This is the time of Pentecost. This is the time of Shavuot.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   "Let me pick up the stocks of grain
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   left behind to anyone, anyone who is poor,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   and is kind enough to let me do it."
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   So she went. And Naomi said, "Yeah, go ahead."
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And as it happened, by chance, by God's providence,
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   she found herself working in the field that belonged to Boaz,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   the relatives of her father-in-law.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   So it just happened she ended up in the field of Boaz
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   in the time of harvest, in the time of Pentecost.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   So the book, Ruth, the story of Ruth,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   is actually a harvest story, kind of in late spring,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   you know, in our calendar, May or April,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   for a foreigner to be able to settle down
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   because of Boaz's generosity.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   He is good to her and to her family.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   He's generous enough to let her pick up the crops
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   so she can live, she can flourish.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   That is why the Jewish synagogues will recite the book Ruth
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   in times of the festival of weeks,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   festival of Pentecost,
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   because one of the most important themes in this season,
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   in the festival, is how to practice generosity.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Remember, that's about the time
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   the people of Israel had their harvest.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   They got their paychecks.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   It is right at this time they remember a story like this,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   to be generous because God is generous,
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   to be good to others,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   to be kind to others.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   Now I told you I spent a week in Toronto, right?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   Now people ask me, "What did you do in Toronto?"
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   It's the same thing, right?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Typical stuff, right?
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   We just eat, eat, eat, and eat, right?
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And then shop, and shop, and shop, right?
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   I spent some time with some of the friends.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:10.000]   Some of them I've known for years, for years.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   I met this--I had dinner with one of my friends from Hong Kong.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   I haven't seen him for almost 30 years, almost 30 years.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   So he just moved with his family from Hong Kong,
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   moved to Toronto.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   He got a job there.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   And you probably know some of the politics of today, right?
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Canada has this lifeboat programs,
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   you know, for people from Hong Kong.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   They kind of like a refugee status
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   because of the political change or political hardship in Hong Kong.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   So this friend of mine is part of that wave of immigrants,
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   wave of people that left Hong Kong.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   They went to Toronto a couple months ago
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   and tried to settle down, you know.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   Now, so often, we visitors, we are travelers,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   you know, especially we are holding U.S. dollars.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   We go in Toronto, "Wow, everything is so cheap.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Everything is so cheap."
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   Every meal is like, "Dude, I can eat 10 meals here.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   I'm using U.S. dollars because U.S. dollars is so strong, right?"
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And we go buy stuff, right?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   We go to the shopping mall or the outlet.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   "Wow, everything is so cheap.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Oh, man, this is such a great trip," right?
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   But you talk to the locals, you hear their stories.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   It's the other side of the coin.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   They had difficulties.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   With all the inflation after COVID,
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   with all the financial hardship they are going through, you know,
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   I think as we spend good time in Toronto,
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   spend good time as a traveler, as a tourist,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I think we need to open our ears at least to know some stories, right?
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   To listen to their stories.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Can you imagine someone who has been his whole life in Hong Kong
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   and he and his family has to be re-rooted in a foreign land, right?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   It's a tough life, you know?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   You use U.S. dollars in Toronto, it's a good deal, right?
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   But for those who earn money, try to settle down there,
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   it's a totally different story, right?
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   It's kind of like a story of Ruth, right?
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   You know, I was talking to a couple who just spent a couple weeks in Hong Kong
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   after the service, the previous service.
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   They were talking to me.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   They spent two weeks in Hong Kong.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   They said the whole society has changed.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   It's not the one they used to know.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   They told me they stayed in an area near a university in Hong Kong
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   and they go to the subway every day, right?
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   And the police officers were picking on all the college students,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   all the young people, for no reason.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   They said everything has changed because of politics, right?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Think about people like this.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   They have to leave.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   It's not because it's a better life out there.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   They got to go, right, for the kids or for the family or whatever reason.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   They just can't stay there.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   I was talking to someone in the morning.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   He was updating me about what's going on in China.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   You cannot imagine living in a place like this, you know,
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   where COVID is almost over, but the government is not willing to step down.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   It's not willing to change the policy, right?
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   I just Googled, you know, BBC News, China COVID,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   protesters, you know, from Beijing to Chengdu, Chengdu,
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   protesters openly urged Xi Jinping to resign over the COVID policy.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   All over the place, you know, people are protesting.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   You cannot imagine living in a place like this, and you have to go.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   You go to somewhere else, right?
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   So I met some friends in Toronto.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   They have the same stories, right?
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Yeah, we have a happy time, but, you know, they have a tough life, you know.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   That's why in the Torah, when it mentions Shavuot,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   the time of harvest, the time when you get your paychecks, right,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   it continues to talk about how we should live with all we have.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   So we read part of the passage from chapter 23,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   the book of Leviticus.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Let's continue.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Verse 22.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Now it's talking about Shavuot, right, Pentecost.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   You have to bring your grain offering to the Lord.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And then verse 22, it says, "When you harvest your crops of your land,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   do not harvest the grain along the edges of your fields,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   and do not pick up what the harvesters drop.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Live it for the poor and the foreigners, the aliens living among you.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   Be kind to them. I am the Lord, Yahweh, your God."
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Now, listen to this law, this Torah.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   It is essentially relational, right?
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   It flows out of your relationship with God
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   because God is giving you good things.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Now you can harvest, you can get your paychecks, right?
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   And then from your blustered life,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   you flow out the kindness of God to other people who are needy around you.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Who is the first reader of this Torah, of this regulation?
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   It's not the poor.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   It's not the needy.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   It's written for those who have a lot, right?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   Who has land, who has harvest, who has workers working in the field, right?
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   23, 22, when you harvest your land, right?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   So you own the land, right? You have a farm.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   You have harvest, you got your money, you got your paycheck, right?
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Don't just think about, "Okay, I want to buy this," or "I want to buy that."
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   Just fulfill my needs and fulfill my wants, right?
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   After Thanksgiving, after Black Friday, and then we think about,
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   "Okay, Cyber Monday, what should I buy? What do I want?"
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   This regulation is telling you, as the people of God,
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   we need to think about those around us who are in need.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Leave them.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   The edges of your field, you know, when you cannot harvest everything,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   just leave it there.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Share with some other people, right?
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   Leave it there.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   When you drop something, leave it there
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   so the people following you, behind you,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   just like Ruth, the girl, the moorbyte,
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   leave it for the poor and the foreigners living among you.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Be kind to them.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   Always think of when you harvest, when you get your paycheck,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   how can I be generous to those in need?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Everything has to do with relationship.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   Torah, the law, is imitating God.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   God is generous.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Look at the universe around us.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   God is generous.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   He made a huge universe for us to explore, for us to enjoy.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   This is the life of God.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   That's why the life of God's people
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   needs to be generous and gracious
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   to imitate the character of God.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   The last verse I want to share with you is Acts 2.1.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Now when we think about Pentecost,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   when we think about the festival weeks, the harvest,
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   we always think of Pentecost,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   what happened was the Holy Spirit
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   descending into the lives of people,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   and then there were signs and wonders, right?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   People speaking in tongues and all this.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   Miracles happening in the early church.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Now listen to what it says, 2.1.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   2.1.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   When the day of Pentecost arrived,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   first phrase, first sentence.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   A better translation is actually
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   when the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   It's being fulfilled.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   What is being fulfilled?
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   It's the spirit, the essence of the festival,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   the harvest, and being generous.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Now we often, as I said,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   we often pay attention to the signs and wonders, right?
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   But if you trace the story of Pentecost
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   up to chapter 4, 4.34,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   it describes the life of the early church,
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   the early Christians, the early Jewish Christians.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   In the day of Pentecost, when it is fulfilled,
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   when the Holy Spirit came upon His people,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   and they shared their things with one another, right?
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   Those who were well-off,
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000]   they shared their own properties.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   They shared their own goods
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   with those who are in need around them.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   4.34, there were no needy people among them.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   That is the miracle.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   That is the true sign and wonder.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   It's not speaking in tongue.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   It's not just enjoying,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   okay, we have a high worship time, high life, right?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   It's the fact that they are being generous to one another, right?
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   If you check the phrase, "no needy people among them,"
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   this phrase is in the book of Torah,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   the book of Deuteronomy.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   When the people of God is really applying,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   you know, the Torah of God,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   being generous, living the life of God together,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   there's no needy people among them.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   That's what the early Christian church experienced.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   No needy people among them.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   So I invite you to go back to the Bible
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   as we check the--as we study the festival of Shavuot, Pentecost.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Think about how God has blessed you so much, abundantly,
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   and how you can bless other people,
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   and you can be generous to other people, right?
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   Look around the world, you know, pray for those who are in need.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Pray for those who are under oppression.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   You know, I hope you understand I'm not talking about early politics.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   I'm talking about the kingdom of God,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   full of justice, compassion, and righteousness.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   That's what God wills, right?
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   That people will respect one another, to love one another,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   under the Torah of God, to participate in the life of God.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   I'm talking about that.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   I'm talking about heavenly politics,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   justice, and compassion, right?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Think about, you know, past week,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   we spent a great time, Thanksgiving,
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   we ate a lot, we probably threw out a lot of food.
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   Just learned plenty.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   How we can bless other people and exercise generosity.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   Let's operate together.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Father, we give you thanks because you have blessed us abundantly.
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   Thank you so much for your blessing.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   The life that we have, the stuff that we have, is more than enough.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Thank you for being our good God and faithful God.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   And most of all, thank you for giving your son, Jesus Christ,
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   to give us eternal life, give us forgiveness of sin.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   And boy, we pray for not only being thankful,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   pray that we can be kind and generous and compassionate toward other people.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   Those who are heartbroken, those who live in places of oppression,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   those who are struggling with settling down in a foreign land,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   the needy people around us.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   Open our eyes, God, that we don't just see and so focus on our needs and our wants.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Because you have indeed blessed us so much.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Open our eyes so that we can see the needs around us.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   No matter if it's churches, it's ministries, it's other people that we know,
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   help us to be generous.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Help us to give.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Help us to bless other people.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   And we pray that we will be a people living under your Torah
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   to know your will and apply your will in our lives.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And we pray that you will send us off this week
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   so that we will go to our corners, go to our own places,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   our situation in our lives, that we can be a blessing to other people.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   And what a privilege we can participate in the life of God.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   What a privilege we can share your grace, share your blessing to other people.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   May our lives be an instrument of your grace.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Well, God bless you, and we'll see you next week,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and continue to worship and learn about God.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   All right, God bless.
