1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Welcome to all of you.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
 I have a very short message to you.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 This is a very important message, okay?

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
 Even though it's a short message, but a very, very important message.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,000
 And this verse in the Bible says,

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,000
 "Give thanks in all circumstances,

9
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
 for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you."

10
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

12
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
 Now, you have to pay attention.

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
 The Bible does not tell us that we have to give thanks for everything,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 including evils, including injustice, including sufferings in our lives.

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 The Bible is not telling us to do this.

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 The Bible does not tell us to give thanks for everything.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

20
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,000
 The Bible is telling us, "Give thanks in all circumstances,

21
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
 including unhappy circumstances,

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
 including some of the painful moments that we have."

23
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 We can give thanks, and we have the resource

24
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 to give thanks in all of these circumstances.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 That's what the Bible is talking about.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

27
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Now, we thank God.

28
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
 We can thank God to be with us,

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 to be present with us in hard times, in difficult times.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

31
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
 And we can thank God that nothing,

32
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 including unhappy moments, all of this happened outside,

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 nothing outside of his wisdom for us.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:45,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:50,000
 I don't know if you have played this game called "I Spy."

36
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 And I give you an amazingly detailed picture,

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
 and you have to find what I want you to find.

38
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
 Have you ever played that, "I Spy"?

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 Something like this.

40
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
 In a very complicated picture,

41
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 you have to find the happy, smiling onion, all right?

42
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
 Can you see that on the right?

43
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
 You can find it, right?

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 Why don't we do this game right now?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:30,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
 Of course, you can find it right now,

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 but I'm going to show you a picture, the first picture,

48
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,000
 and you have to find me the happy, smiling onion, all right?

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:49,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
 Why don't we do it by table, okay?

51
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 Why don't we do it by table, okay?

52
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

53
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,000
 See if the people around the table can find the happy onion, all right?

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
 The first one is this one, all right?

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
 So let's find the happy onion, all right?

56
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 Happy onion.

57
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
 If you find it, raise your hand, okay?

58
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,000
 Now, I must tell you there are three.

59
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
 There are three happy onions here, okay?

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 Where is it?

61
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
 Where is it?

62
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
 Okay, is it on the right?

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 Is it on the right?

64
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
 On the right or on the left?

65
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 Okay, there's a big one right there,

66
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
 and then there's a right one in the lower right.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 And can you find the third one?

68
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
 This table can find the third one.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
 Where is it?

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
 Bottom left, yes, yes, yes.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
 Can you find it?

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
 Yeah, these are the happy onions.

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

74
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
 Okay, now you have to pay attention.

75
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
 Okay, now how many of you couldn't find it?

76
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
 I'll give you a second chance, all right?

78
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 Second one, ready?

79
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
 Okay, we do it by table, all right?

80
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
 Here's the second one.

81
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:16,000
 All right, I'm sure you can find the first two.

82
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
 Yeah, where's the third one?

83
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 Where's the third happy onion?

84
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

85
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
 Where is it?

86
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
 You can find it?

88
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 Okay.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
 Why is it taking so long?

90
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
 Oh, you got it?

91
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 Where is it?

92
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

93
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
 Oh, there are many.

94
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
 Okay, all right, here we go.

95
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
 All right, there you go, there you go.

96
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 How many of you find it?

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

98
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 Go on, happy onion.

99
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

100
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
 Well, let me give you the last one, okay?

101
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
 Let's try it, all right?

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
 Ready?

103
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

104
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 Here.

105
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
 Where are the onions?

106
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 Of course, you can find the first one and the second one.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
 Where is the third one?

108
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

109
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
 Again, you guys?

110
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Oh, because they're closest to the TV, all right.

111
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
 Yeah, right there.

112
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,000
 Wano, where is it?

113
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 It's like right there, right there.

114
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
 Okay, all right.

115
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
 Here are the onions.

116
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,000
 The happy onions, happy onions.

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,000
 Well, this is something what we do when we give thanks, all right?

118
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,000
 The exercise of giving thanks or finding things to give thanks for

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,000
 is kind of like finding the onion, the happy onion,

120
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
 in the complicated picture.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

123
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

124
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

125
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

126
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 Now, it's much the same way, okay?

127
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,000
 The Bible is not trying to tell you positive psychology.

128
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

129
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 The Bible is telling you there is an understanding of God

130
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 behind giving thanks.

131
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

133
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 God has everything in control.

134
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:30,000
 Now, what happened this year for you,

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 I'm sure it's kind of like this picture, very complicated.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
 So I want you to do one thing for me,

138
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 to look for ways that you should be thankful for this year.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,000
 So far, we have gone through 11 months in this year.

140
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

141
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 Now, you have to think.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 You have to rewind.

144
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 Rewind what happened this year.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

146
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 And look for things you might have missed.

147
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

148
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 And things you can be thankful for.

149
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

150
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
 Now, this is what the Bible says.

151
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 It's a cultivation of your life.

152
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
 Cultivate your spirit so that you can center on God

153
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,000
 who is in control and God who is leading you all the way through.

154
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

156
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 There's a famous African-American writer called Alex Haley.

157
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

158
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:04,000
 And in the office of Alex Haley, he's a very famous novelist.

159
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:10,000
 And in his office, there was a picture called "Turtle on Fencepost."

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,000
 "Turtle on Fencepost."

161
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

162
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
 And why does he hang this picture in his office?

163
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 He says, "Every time I begin to feel proud of myself,

164
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,000
 I look at the turtle on top of the fencepost,

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
 and remember, the turtle did not get there on his own.

166
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 He had help."

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

168
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:10,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

169
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 Now, I think this is the perfect analogy for our life.

170
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

171
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,000
 Of course, this phrase "post-turtle" is often used politically.

172
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 Talk about dumb politician.

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,000
 But this is an analogy for our life.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 We didn't get there by ourselves.

176
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
 We had help.

177
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,000
 And ultimately, God has helped you.

178
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 God has brought you to this place, to this spot.

179
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

180
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
 So, in the season of Thanksgiving,

181
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 we can call this "Give Thanks Because Of."

182
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 Give Thanks Because Of, because every time you look at this picture,

183
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 as Alex Haley said,

184
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 we don't get there by ourselves.

185
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
 We had help.

186
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
 And ultimately, God had helped us.

187
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 That's why we thank God.

188
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:45,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

189
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:54,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

190
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
 Now, we can call this Thanksgiving exercise

191
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,000
 "Give Thanks Because Of."

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
 Give Thanks Because Of.

193
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,000
 You have success and you have come to this place

194
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:10,000
 because of the well-being God has granted you,

195
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 because of shelter and security.

196
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 That should not be taken for granted.

197
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,000
 Because of the opportunities that is right in front of you

198
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,000
 so that you can grow, and that is granted by God.

199
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And the small joys in your life,

200
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 that should not be taken to be granted.

201
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 And ultimately, Jesus Christ and His cross,

202
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 the love of God, the grace of God to be with you,

203
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 that should not be taken granted for.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

205
00:12:48,000 --> 00:13:16,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

206
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 This is what we call "Give Thanks Because Of."

207
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 Right?

208
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
 So try to rewind this year.

209
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
 What had happened to you?

210
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 What have you gone through?

211
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
 Think about the grace of God.

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 Think about the providence of God.

213
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 And then there's another level of giving thanks.

215
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Not only giving thanks because of.

216
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
 It's giving thanks even though.

217
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 Giving thanks even though.

218
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

219
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,000
 Even though there were challenges and setbacks in your life,

220
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
 there's more inconveniences, frustrations that happened this year.

221
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 Unanswered prayers, perhaps many of those.

222
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Imperfections in your life.

223
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 Imperfection struggles, flaws that make you more real.

224
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Make people more real.

225
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 Make your family and your relationships more real,

226
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 more authentic.

227
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 So think about some difficulties you have faced this year

228
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
 to help you grow in resilience,

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 to help you grow in patience.

230
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

232
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

233
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

234
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
 [speaking in Cantonese]

235
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,340
 the encouraging prayers

236
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,460
 that knows how to be rejected.

237
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,300
 These things...

238
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,480
 God gave to us.

239
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,760
 God made us go through

240
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,880
 these trials and 1957

241
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:20,980
 these hardships when we were university student so we could go forward

242
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:45,300
 [speaking in Cantonese]

243
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,740
 We must remember Jesus Christ and His cross

244
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,700
 even though all this happened

245
00:15:53,700 --> 00:16:04,100
 [speaking in Cantonese]

246
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,540
 A life of thanksgiving

247
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,660
 Now as we close our today's worship

248
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:12,060
 [speaking in Cantonese]

249
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:15,220
 I want to invite you to give thanks

250
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,940
 [speaking in Cantonese]

251
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:21,700
 And we want to do something together as a church, as a family

252
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,420
 as a spiritual family

253
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:26,820
 [speaking in Cantonese]

254
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,620
 And on your tables

255
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,580
 you find some ribbons

256
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,780
 some broken ribbons

257
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,780
 some strips of ribbons

258
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,820
 these ribbons are for gifts

259
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,340
 okay, wrapping up a gift

260
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:43,900
 [speaking in Cantonese]

261
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:48,420
 [speaking in Cantonese]

262
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:53,740
 [speaking in Cantonese]

263
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:56,780
 Now I want you to do something together

264
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,740
 let's do something together

265
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,740
 let's rewind what had happened this year

266
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,020
 [speaking in Cantonese]

267
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:05,740
 What is worthy of giving thanks?

268
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,500
 Right, either setback or challenges or opportunities

269
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,340
 or something that is good

270
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,900
 some blessings in your life

271
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,540
 count the blessings and count the things that we should be thankful for

272
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,820
 and I want to invite you to use the permanent marker

273
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,940
 to write it on the ribbon

274
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:27,700
 alright, this is your gift of giving thanks

275
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,540
 alright, let's take a moment

276
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:36,740
 to think about what we can give thanks for this year

277
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,020
 and think about it, it takes time

278
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,820
 look into the details

279
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:45,220
 [speaking in Cantonese]

280
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:53,980
 [speaking in Cantonese]

281
00:17:53,980 --> 00:18:00,260
 Now I want to invite you to do so right now

282
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,740
 it can be very general

283
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:07,580
 in the well-being, health, success

284
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,540
 small successes in your life

285
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:24,940
 [speaking in Cantonese]

286
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:30,940
 I want you to write it on the ribbon

287
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:34,980
 I want you to do one thing today

288
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,940
 if God has reminded you

289
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,180
 at least one thing you should be thankful for

290
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:46,700
 maybe one thing you have missed to give thanks for

291
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:52,140
 I want you to write it on the ribbon and then you bring it up here

292
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:56,860
 you can leave your seats and after you have written

293
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,380
 the items of Thanksgiving on the ribbon

294
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,940
 you can hang it on the cross in front of me

295
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:10,740
 [speaking in Cantonese]

296
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,300
 or do a small prayer

297
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,980
 you say, "God, thank you"

298
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,860
 you write it down and bring your ribbon

299
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:21,340
 and hang it on to the cross in front of me

300
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:29,980
 [speaking in Cantonese]

301
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:34,980
