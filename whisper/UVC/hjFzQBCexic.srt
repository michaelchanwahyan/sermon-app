1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 - Good morning, thank you very, very much.

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,000
 All right.

4
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,240
 Well, happy July 4th.

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,840
 Mark, it's good to have you back from Israel.

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,040
 Last time I was here, you were missing,

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,440
 and it is always good to be back here at UV.

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,160
 We've been in this whole series

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,760
 about the life and times of Elijah,

10
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,800
 and one of the things I encourage you

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,120
 that I've really enjoyed doing is studying,

12
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,720
 taking a character, taking a book of the Bible,

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,280
 and just digging down into it.

14
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,520
 We spent the last three, four times I've been here

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,820
 talking about 1 Kings chapter 17.

16
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,840
 There is nothing like sitting there

17
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,520
 and just reading the same verses over and over again,

18
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:44,120
 and thinking about it throughout the week,

19
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,040
 and saying, "Lord, what is it

20
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:47,100
 "that you're trying to teach me?"

21
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,720
 Today, we're gonna look at 1 Kings chapter 18,

22
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,120
 but before we do, let me just give a summary

23
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,600
 of where we've been for those who are new,

24
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,040
 for those who've been with us,

25
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:00,400
 just a refresher, and as we look at Elijah,

26
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,320
 we started off in 17.1, where we talked about,

27
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,960
 literally, Elijah means, his name means,

28
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,080
 my God is Jehovah.

29
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,160
 Elijah is a Tishbite of Tishbe in Gilead.

30
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,240
 What does that mean?

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,920
 He literally came from obscurity.

32
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,600
 No one knew where Tishbe was.

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,360
 They knew where Gilead was,

34
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,760
 but they didn't know where Tishbe was,

35
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:22,360
 a small, little city, and so he came from obscurity,

36
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:25,840
 and somehow this prophet who came from obscurity

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,640
 got to the capital city of the northern kingdom of Israel

38
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,520
 in Samaria, and he gets a meeting with King Ahab,

39
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,360
 and he tells him, "Hey, look,

40
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:35,520
 "there's gonna be a drought.

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,100
 "There's gonna be a long, long drought,

42
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:40,840
 "and actually, that drought will last about three years."

43
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,440
 And he says, "Neither dew nor rain,

44
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:45,040
 "except by my word," and the motivation

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,520
 in the early parts of 17 is,

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,900
 "the God before whom I stand."

47
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,280
 That becomes a theme in his life,

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,880
 a theme in this chapter of Elijah's life.

49
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,600
 It's the God before whom I stand,

50
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,920
 and just like that, as he confronts Ahab,

51
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
 he gets ushered away to Cherith,

52
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,160
 a place where he is in solitude.

53
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,040
 He's fed by ravens, and he is also,

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,980
 drinks from the brook over there.

55
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,920
 Well, in time, he doesn't just stay there for a short time.

56
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,800
 He stays there for a long time,

57
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,100
 and now, later on, the brook dries up,

58
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,620
 and then now the second part of 17,

59
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,680
 God says to go pack up, leave Cherith, and go to Zarephath,

60
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,120
 and when he goes to Zarephath, he says,

61
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,380
 "Hey, look, I see you.

62
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,360
 "I know where you're gonna go."

63
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,600
 It reminds us all the time that God sees us

64
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:33,080
 wherever we're at, and God knows where we need to go.

65
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,680
 Sometimes we may not know where to go,

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,640
 but God knows where we need to go.

67
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,460
 He also knows what you need, 'cause he says,

68
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,500
 "When you get to Zarephath,

69
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,840
 "you're gonna meet a widow there," and he does.

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,720
 He meets a widow there, but the problem

71
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,640
 with this widow is she's collecting sticks,

72
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,680
 and she says, "I only have a little flour.

73
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,340
 "I have a little oil, and I'm collecting sticks

74
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,180
 "so I can go in and make some bread,

75
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,080
 "and then from that point on,

76
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,800
 "my son and I are gonna eat it and die."

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,280
 Really, that's who you want me to sit there?

78
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:02,380
 Yes, because sometimes God knows what we need,

79
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,260
 and what we need is different than what we think we need

80
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,880
 or what we want, but God knows what we need.

81
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:12,280
 Along the way, just like the story with the widow,

82
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,920
 we're gonna have to overcome first impressions

83
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,640
 or expectations.

84
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,600
 We're gonna have to overcome physical impossibilities.

85
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,920
 It's literally a widow who is poor,

86
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,840
 who's gonna feed him, who thinks she's gonna die

87
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,540
 because she only has a little flour and a little oil,

88
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:31,960
 but somehow God makes that oil and that flour

89
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:34,720
 just keep going and going and going,

90
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,120
 but yet at the same time, this is the last story

91
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,160
 that we looked at when I was last here.

92
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,160
 Sometime later, as he stays with the widow,

93
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,480
 the widow's son dies, and the widow blames Elijah,

94
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,160
 "That you brought this upon my family."

95
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,040
 Elijah grabs the son, he brings it, and there we see,

96
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,520
 we looked at Elijah's prayer to the Lord,

97
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,320
 a genuine prayer where he wrestles with the Lord

98
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:59,320
 because he doesn't know what happened.

99
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,800
 He sits there and he yearns and he prays

100
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,780
 in a genuine fashion, the fashion that God wants us

101
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,760
 to wrestle with him in our own prayer life.

102
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,240
 He prays the impossible, but he also knew

103
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,920
 that God could say no.

104
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,680
 That's what it means to walk with the Lord.

105
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:17,560
 There is a deep relationship that you have

106
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,980
 with your prayer life.

107
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,600
 It's not just sitting there in your prayer

108
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,720
 and just asking God to provide all the things

109
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,400
 that you want, but you're wrestling.

110
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,000
 There's a natural, there is a genuine relationship

111
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,160
 with the Lord, and God chooses to heal the son.

112
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,840
 And I love what verse 24 and 17 tells us.

113
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,760
 Now I know that you are a man of God,

114
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:42,160
 and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.

115
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,480
 She never says to him, "Now I know that you are

116
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,760
 "a great man, now I know that you are a powerful man."

117
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,860
 That's not what she says to him.

118
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:52,640
 She says, "Now I know that you are a man of God,

119
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:55,460
 "and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth."

120
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:59,920
 Because everything that Elijah does in 17,

121
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,760
 and we're gonna see it in 18, is as if he is a servant

122
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:06,720
 and a steward of what God has given him.

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,060
 And that's what a servant does.

124
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:12,680
 He gives light, he gives credit to his master.

125
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,400
 I know that you are a man of God.

126
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,400
 We talked about the theory behind Hebrews 11.

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,760
 Some of you guys who may not be familiar with Hebrews 11

128
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,260
 is the Hall of Faith.

129
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:25,880
 It talks about all these Old Testament characters,

130
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,440
 and you know who is not mentioned in the Hall of Faith?

131
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,060
 Elijah is never mentioned by name.

132
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,800
 There is one verse that does describe Elijah.

133
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,880
 It's this, in verse 35 of Hebrews 11,

134
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,920
 "Women receive back their dead by resurrection."

135
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,040
 One of the things that we talked about

136
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,600
 when we were last here is why in the world,

137
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,880
 in the Hall of Faith, Elijah plays such an important role

138
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,520
 that he was never listed in the Hall of Faith.

139
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,080
 Now, I do wonder if the writer of Hebrews,

140
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:58,640
 in order to honor Elijah, never mentions who Elijah is,

141
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,840
 but rather what he does.

142
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,320
 Because Elijah was never about himself,

143
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,360
 but always about being a steward,

144
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,120
 always being a spouse, servant,

145
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,740
 always giving credit to what God is doing.

146
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,740
 Which leads us today to the confrontation in Mount Carmel

147
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,620
 in 1 Kings 18.

148
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,560
 And there today, we're gonna look at five questions

149
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:28,940
 that emerges from these in this chapter,

150
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,500
 as we look at 1 Kings 18.

151
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,460
 And let me read it to you.

152
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,220
 It's gonna be a long one,

153
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,820
 so we're gonna just go on little different passages

154
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,980
 in different verses, and try to get through it

155
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,980
 as soon as we can in the next 20 minutes.

156
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,320
 18, verse one.

157
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,540
 After many days, the word of the Lord came to Elijah.

158
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,460
 In the third year, saying, "Go, show yourself to Ahab.

159
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,220
 "It's been three long years of this drought,

160
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,940
 "and I will send rain upon the earth."

161
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:58,080
 So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab.

162
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,740
 Now, the famine was severe in Samaria,

163
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,820
 the capital city of the northern kingdom.

164
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,560
 And Ahab called Obadiah, who was literally the chief of staff

165
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:11,540
 over Ahab's kingdom, and called Ahab,

166
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,820
 who was over the household.

167
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:17,020
 Now, Ahab was feared the Lord greatly.

168
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,940
 And when Jezebel, Queen Jezebel,

169
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:21,020
 cut off the prophets of the Lord,

170
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,820
 Obadiah took 100 prophets and hid them by fifties

171
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,340
 in a cave, and fed them with bread and water.

172
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,280
 Let's go to verse 11.

173
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,380
 Obadiah now says to Elijah,

174
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:37,080
 "And now you say," Obadiah says to Elijah,

175
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,660
 "Go tell your Lord.

176
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,560
 "Behold, Elijah is here.

177
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,620
 "And as soon as I have gone from you, Elijah,

178
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,560
 "the spirit of the Lord will cure you.

179
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,020
 "I know not where."

180
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:48,740
 Because he literally went from Samaria

181
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,500
 to Cherith and Zarephath, and this entire time,

182
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,540
 they're all looking for him, but they never found him.

183
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,620
 And so they're always wondering

184
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,860
 where this guy disappeared to.

185
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,400
 And so when I come and tell Ahab,

186
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,500
 and he cannot find you again,

187
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,340
 you know what he's gonna do?

188
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:03,900
 He's gonna kill me.

189
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,300
 "Although I, your servant,

190
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,060
 "have feared the Lord from my youth."

191
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:10,500
 And Elijah says, "As the Lord of hosts lives,

192
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,200
 "before whom I stand."

193
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,740
 Same theme as in the beginning of chapter seven,

194
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,220
 "Before whom I stand."

195
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,780
 That is a constant theme of Elijah's life.

196
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:23,260
 "I will surely show myself to him today."

197
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,140
 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him,

198
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:29,180
 and Ahab went to meet Elijah.

199
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:32,520
 When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him,

200
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:36,020
 "Is it you, you troubler of Israel?"

201
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,180
 Verse 18, pay attention to this.

202
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:43,120
 "And he answered, 'I have not troubled Israel,

203
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,620
 "but you have, in your father's house,

204
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,500
 "because you have abandoned the commandments of the Lord

205
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,600
 "and followed the bells.

206
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,340
 "Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me

207
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,980
 "at Mount Carmel and the 450 prophets of Baal

208
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,340
 "and the 400 prophets of Asherah,

209
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:06,740
 "total of 850 people who eat at Jezebel's table."

210
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:10,780
 So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel in verse 20

211
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:13,900
 and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel.

212
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,220
 And Elijah came near to all the people and says,

213
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:20,500
 "How long will you go limping

214
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:25,140
 "between two different opinions?"

215
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,260
 First question that we see

216
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,220
 comes in this very verse that I just read.

217
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,020
 "How long will you be limping

218
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,620
 "between two different opinions?"

219
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:36,700
 The first question that emerges, I ask you,

220
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,300
 "Are you limping through your faith?"

221
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:42,220
 That's the first question that emerges.

222
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,560
 Are you limping through your faith?

223
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:50,380
 Three characters and three perspectives arise.

224
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:54,660
 There's a character Ahab, as we see in chapter 18.

225
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:59,660
 Ahab, we don't even know where his faith journey is,

226
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,500
 how he got out to worshiping Baal, all of that stuff.

227
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,940
 We have an idea it really is through the influence

228
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:08,060
 of Queen Jezebel.

229
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:12,500
 Ahab, out of the 19 kings in the northern kingdom,

230
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:15,120
 they said Ahab was probably the worst.

231
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,420
 Queen Jezebel actually ends up being the main villain,

232
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,600
 the main person who disrupts everything.

233
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,860
 She was the worst of even all of the kings.

234
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,980
 Now, at the same time, we do have some idea

235
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:31,980
 that at one point or another, Ahab was following the Lord.

236
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,340
 Here's why.

237
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,100
 When Ahab dies, his two sons take over.

238
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,780
 His two sons, the first son is,

239
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,200
 I'm gonna butcher this, so I've been trying to practice this

240
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,300
 for the whole weekend, I still butcher it.

241
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,700
 Ahaziah, all right?

242
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:48,020
 Ahaziah is one of the boys.

243
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,580
 His name literally means "owned by Jehovah."

244
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,220
 Interesting, "owned by Jehovah"

245
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,140
 is what his first name's son means.

246
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:59,860
 The next one is Jerhoram,

247
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:03,940
 which means "Jehovah is exalted."

248
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,220
 So why in the world are your kids' name,

249
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:09,260
 it means "owned by Jehovah" and "Jehovah is exalted,"

250
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:13,420
 if at one point or another, you weren't following the Lord?

251
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:17,340
 And somehow or another, Queen Jezebel, who you married,

252
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:21,180
 really wanted to make Baal the state religion,

253
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,540
 and as a result, suddenly, all the prophets were killed,

254
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,660
 and now there's 450 prophets of Baal,

255
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:30,380
 400 prophets for Asherah.

256
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:33,100
 There's also Obadiah, the next character that we see.

257
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,660
 Obadiah is the chief of staff, as we mentioned.

258
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,980
 He's the one who oversees the entire household.

259
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,260
 He's the one, when Jezebel was trying to kill

260
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:45,260
 the 100 prophets, he rescues 50 and puts 50 in each cave,

261
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,380
 total of 100.

262
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:50,440
 Well, but this time, he is scared of Ahab.

263
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,820
 When he confronts Elijah, he says,

264
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,540
 "Hey, look, if you send to me and Ahab can't find me,

265
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,660
 "he's gonna kill me."

266
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,700
 And then you have the third folks.

267
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,700
 Those are the Israelites.

268
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,900
 The Israelites were also scared of Ahab and Queen Jezebel.

269
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:10,400
 But then also, it's been a long three years, hasn't it?

270
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,520
 The drought has taken for three years.

271
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:17,060
 God has not responded in those droughts.

272
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,660
 And probably the Israelites says,

273
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:21,640
 "Hey, look, if our God doesn't respond,

274
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:25,080
 "then let's give Baal a try.

275
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,120
 "Let's give the God of fertility,

276
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,360
 "the God of harvest a try.

277
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,580
 "What can we lose?

278
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,220
 "Our God's not paying attention to us as well, too."

279
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:39,380
 When we allow our fear, our pursuit of other things

280
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:44,380
 become our focus, we find ourselves limping

281
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,460
 through our faith.

282
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:49,460
 When we allow our fear, when we allow our pursuit

283
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:52,020
 of other things become our focus,

284
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,100
 we find ourselves limping along

285
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,920
 and limping through our faith.

286
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:59,460
 I'm not sure for some of you guys who are listening

287
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:01,880
 on screen or those who are sitting here,

288
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,620
 have you ever been canoeing before?

289
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:08,940
 Canoeing is fun and you're constantly going downstream.

290
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:11,720
 It is hard to canoe upstream.

291
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,720
 You're constantly going downstream.

292
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,480
 There is a downward pull on all of our lives

293
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:23,240
 as Christ followers to pull us downstream.

294
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,080
 There is a downward stream, there is a downward pull

295
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,640
 on all of our lives to pull us downstream,

296
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,360
 to affect our faith and to allow us

297
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,000
 to live in a state of limbo.

298
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,480
 It's like an ocean current as well, too.

299
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,200
 You ever sit in an ocean current?

300
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,500
 If you ever sat in an ocean current for 30 minutes,

301
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,580
 you just sit on the sand right near the edge

302
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,160
 where the ocean's coming.

303
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,840
 If you weren't paying attention 30 minutes later,

304
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,880
 where would you have gone?

305
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,880
 A different place because the ocean current

306
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,520
 would have moved you from one place to another

307
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:01,840
 and you would have never known.

308
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,280
 In our work culture today,

309
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:07,060
 here's a term that also describes where we are.

310
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,840
 If you are working right now,

311
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:12,760
 Harvard Business Review calls this the quiet quit.

312
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:16,140
 It's not the great resignation, it's the quiet quit.

313
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,340
 I'm not sure if you ever heard that term as well, too.

314
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:20,980
 Post-COVID, it's been very, very popular.

315
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,500
 So literally, a lot of times,

316
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:27,500
 workers in corporations realize that I hate my job,

317
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,620
 I hate my boss, I don't like what I'm doing,

318
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:35,020
 but until I find a new job, I'm not gonna quit.

319
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,980
 I'm just gonna sit here and collect a paycheck,

320
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,220
 do minimally what I have to do,

321
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:46,340
 and that is the quiet quit.

322
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:50,620
 It has affected so many corporations at this time.

323
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:52,700
 I'm not gonna be dumb enough to quit

324
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:56,860
 and not get the paycheck, but I will get the paycheck.

325
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,460
 I will do as minimal as I can.

326
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,620
 You tell me what to do, I will do it.

327
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,900
 I am not gonna go above and beyond.

328
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,180
 I am not gonna do anything more,

329
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,960
 and anything that you ask me that's not part of my job,

330
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,940
 I'm not going to do it.

331
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,660
 My whole goal is to collect the paycheck.

332
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,860
 I wonder how many of us approach

333
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:24,260
 the Christian life like this,

334
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:28,840
 that we approach it with this quiet quit mentality,

335
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,500
 where we sit there and we sit and we said,

336
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,420
 "Hey, look, we're gonna go through the routines.

337
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,500
 "We're gonna come on Sunday, maybe once in a while,

338
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:41,080
 "if I have nothing to do,

339
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:44,220
 "I will attend a fellowship or a Bible study,

340
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,660
 "but I'm not gonna go above and beyond."

341
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,940
 I bet you too many of us will probably not sit there

342
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,020
 and say, "We're gonna give up Christianity.

343
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,820
 "God is wrong, I don't believe it.

344
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,500
 "Now, I don't think we're gonna go that far."

345
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,540
 But we go in a state of what we call lukewarmness,

346
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,420
 where we sit there, we go through the motions,

347
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,180
 we attend service, and then we're done,

348
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,620
 and we say we're still a Christian

349
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,780
 and we attend the church and we're religious.

350
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:17,140
 I bet you that's where many of us are.

351
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,280
 That is the quiet quit, that is the lukewarmness

352
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,260
 that Revelation warns us about.

353
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,980
 Now, here's a quick question is,

354
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,460
 why do we end up in that place?

355
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,620
 What are the motives that causes us to go there?

356
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:32,900
 Let me actually go through some of those things.

357
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:36,620
 Maybe sometimes what causes us to go through the motions

358
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,360
 is churches become a routine.

359
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:42,660
 Maybe some of us have grown up in the church

360
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:44,860
 all our lives and all that other stuff,

361
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,220
 and ever since we're younger, a lot of times,

362
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,720
 we've gone through the same thing.

363
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,160
 We've lost that personal attraction,

364
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,060
 we've lost that personal motivation,

365
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,620
 and it has become a routine.

366
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,220
 Maybe for some of us,

367
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,540
 we've grown disenchanted by the church.

368
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,660
 We've grown frustrated by the church.

369
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:12,520
 Christianity is not seen in a very good light these days.

370
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,800
 Because of politics, because of race,

371
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,120
 because of how pastors act or ministry leaders act,

372
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,440
 we're not always seen.

373
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,740
 We're seen by the world as haters.

374
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,960
 We don't love other people, we don't care about other people,

375
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:28,800
 and we all make it about building our own empires.

376
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,840
 Christianity today is not seen in a positive light,

377
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,720
 and that's why sometimes you get frustrated

378
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,320
 and disenchanted by the church.

379
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,080
 It's not routine, we're disenchanted.

380
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,760
 Maybe a lot of times you're just distracted

381
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,240
 by what the world has to offer.

382
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:44,440
 And you're sitting there, "Hey, look,

383
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,600
 "I'll do this church thing, I'll come in,

384
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,420
 "but at the same time, I gotta worry about money,

385
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,560
 "I gotta worry about career,

386
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,100
 "I gotta worry about all these things.

387
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:55,080
 "But I'll come on Sundays, I'll give you that."

388
00:17:55,080 --> 00:18:00,360
 And we live in a state of going through the routines.

389
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,600
 We live in the state

390
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,840
 of what Revelation's called being lukewarm.

391
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,120
 For us as Christians, let me give you

392
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:09,840
 a couple of signs of being lukewarm.

393
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,440
 Let me give you a couple fast ones

394
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,040
 and see if any of these applies to you.

395
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:16,520
 Signs of being lukewarm,

396
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:20,240
 you have an inconsistent and diminished prayer life.

397
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,120
 You struggle with having regular communications.

398
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,740
 You struggle with genuine engagement with the Lord.

399
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,840
 If you do pray, it's, "Lord," you go through rhythms

400
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,640
 and you have a script or everything like that,

401
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,680
 but you've failed like what Elijah said,

402
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:37,680
 of wrestling with the Lord, crying out to the Lord,

403
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:39,880
 talking with the Lord.

404
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,060
 An inconsistent and diminished prayer life.

405
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:44,800
 Signs of being lukewarm also shows

406
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,700
 that you have a worldly mindset and values.

407
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,720
 You sit there and say, "Lord, I totally understand

408
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,900
 "what you're saying, but Lord,

409
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:53,780
 "look at all these different things.

410
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:57,900
 "Look at the need to have money and power and goals

411
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,520
 "and all of these different things."

412
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,040
 I literally was talking to a woman

413
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,200
 who lives in Australia, in Perth, Australia,

414
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,560
 and she works at Deloitte,

415
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:11,800
 and she's literally gonna be a partner over at Deloitte,

416
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,560
 but she works from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.

417
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,920
 every single day in Australia.

418
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,240
 And she's a Chinese-Indonesian,

419
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,680
 and she says to me, "Tommy, I'm trying to figure out

420
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:25,680
 "that as I get promoted to be partner,

421
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,720
 "how do I still maintain a vibrancy

422
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,880
 "in my walk with the Lord versus getting caught up?

423
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:35,920
 "I'm already working from 8 a.m. to 9, 10 p.m.

424
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,900
 "How do I continue to maintain a diligent,

425
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,720
 "a godly mindset, and never about going up

426
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,680
 "the corporate ladder?

427
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:47,080
 "What does it mean to have a worldly mindset and values?"

428
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,560
 We find ourselves struggling with all of that.

429
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,360
 Signs of being lukewarm is we neglect

430
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:55,720
 our spiritual disciplines, the importance of Bible reading,

431
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:00,520
 meditation, fasting, serving others.

432
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:04,000
 Other signs, lack of convictions and moral compromise

433
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,080
 about our character, about doing what is right,

434
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:11,040
 about humility, because the things of God matters to us.

435
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,800
 And when we struggle with lukewarmness,

436
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,440
 ah, yeah, sure, sure, fine.

437
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:17,400
 But what it means to serve others,

438
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,920
 to die to ourselves every single day,

439
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,840
 because when you're a motivated Christian,

440
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,800
 you're constantly asking those questions

441
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,640
 each and every single day.

442
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,960
 When we struggle with lukewarmness, we struggle.

443
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,080
 We have a lack of Christian community,

444
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:35,000
 because we just don't see the importance of that anymore.

445
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,360
 We see ourselves a lot of times just sitting there,

446
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,360
 and we don't need to share,

447
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,840
 we don't need to do anything accountable,

448
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,680
 we just do whatever we want.

449
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,120
 We don't see the importance of fellowship,

450
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,320
 of people holding us accountable.

451
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,800
 And for those who are sitting on the screens at home,

452
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,400
 and for those who are outside in the country,

453
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,960
 I totally understand, but for those who are in Chicago

454
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,320
 sitting there, you are the one

455
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,480
 that may be tempted to do this,

456
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,120
 'cause you're sitting at home and says,

457
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,360
 I will just watch, I'll attend virtual church,

458
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:06,480
 but I don't need any community,

459
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,560
 'cause I don't need anymore,

460
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,780
 I don't need anyone accountable.

461
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,320
 When we live in a state of lukewarmness,

462
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,280
 when we're sitting there stuck,

463
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,720
 stuck in being lukewarm,

464
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:23,820
 and limping along, we don't see the need for community.

465
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:28,960
 Are you stuck, are you limping along in your faith?

466
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,400
 And the second thing it tells us

467
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,060
 in terms of the verse is this,

468
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:38,320
 if the Lord is God, follow him,

469
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,320
 but if it is Baal, then follow him.

470
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,280
 Make a choice, make a decision.

471
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:47,560
 Will my gods accomplish what I want them to do?

472
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:51,920
 Because if it is not fully focused on our God

473
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,800
 and our Savior, we all have other gods.

474
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,400
 Now I'm saying that you have statues

475
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,400
 and everything like that,

476
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,000
 but the gospel and the Bible tells us

477
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,680
 that we have gods or we have built altars

478
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:07,520
 in our hearts that distract us away

479
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,520
 from focusing on one true God.

480
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,080
 For the Israelites at that time,

481
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:16,440
 Baal was the god of power and sexual potency.

482
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:19,640
 Asherah was a god of fertility,

483
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,200
 and for them, the Israelites,

484
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,440
 and all the people in Israel,

485
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,680
 and King Ahab himself was so focused

486
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,760
 on sex, power, harvest, wealth,

487
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:31,000
 that became their god.

488
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,240
 So if God is not your god,

489
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,380
 then what are the gods that you're chasing?

490
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,120
 If God is not your god,

491
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:44,120
 then is it wealth that you're chasing?

492
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,940
 Is it family that you're chasing?

493
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,760
 Is it relationships that you're chasing?

494
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:53,520
 Is it goals or dreams or comfort that you're chasing?

495
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:59,260
 And if it is, then you better take a hard look

496
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,260
 and ask yourself, if I chase after those things,

497
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,120
 will my god, will that god,

498
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,100
 money, wealth, family, relationship,

499
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:15,100
 will that god accomplish what I want them to do?

500
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,320
 And if the answer is yes in your mind,

501
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:25,140
 then there's no need for you to be here listening at all,

502
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,260
 because you've made up your mind,

503
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:30,620
 so no matter what I say, it won't matter to you.

504
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,000
 But you better make sure that will accomplish

505
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,860
 what you need them to do.

506
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:38,580
 Have you ever realized that some of the most unhappy people

507
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:41,980
 in life are wealthy people?

508
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:45,120
 And many wealthy people who spent their entire life

509
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,260
 just attaining and getting wealthy

510
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,660
 and finally they get to the end of it,

511
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:52,940
 and they have all the money that they want,

512
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:56,340
 they're lonely and they're realizing this is it?

513
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,460
 You have to ask yourself,

514
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:04,220
 will that god lead me to where I want to be?

515
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:06,740
 Now, if the answer is no,

516
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,140
 and you want to begin to explore the true god

517
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,580
 in the form of God and Jesus Christ,

518
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,820
 and see where that path leads you,

519
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,740
 then it goes to the third thing

520
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,220
 that we're gonna look at the question.

521
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,120
 If the Lord is God, follow him.

522
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,080
 But if thou, then follow him.

523
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,020
 And the last part of 21,

524
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:30,580
 and the people did not answer him a word.

525
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,580
 Third question.

526
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:37,600
 If you're stuck and you're looking through your faith,

527
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,340
 and you realize that the god that I'm chasing

528
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,120
 is not gonna get me to where I want to be,

529
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,980
 and I want to begin to understand what the true God

530
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:52,840
 or the form of Jesus Christ and God helps me to do,

531
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:56,340
 are you going to do anything about it?

532
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,520
 What are you gonna do?

533
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,640
 What steps are you gonna take to do it?

534
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,360
 If you realize, hey, look, the god that I'm pursuing,

535
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,960
 the money and all that stuff, that's not the answer.

536
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,640
 Lord, I want to pursue you.

537
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,180
 What are you going to do about it?

538
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,980
 Because a lot of times, too often,

539
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:17,820
 we sit there, when we're sitting there and lukewarm,

540
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:21,340
 we know that we should be doing something about it.

541
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:25,420
 We just don't have the motivation to push ourselves

542
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:28,900
 to do it, and that's where we continue to get stuck.

543
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,240
 I love what my friend Dave Evans,

544
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,380
 he's a professor at Stanford, says.

545
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,980
 And he says, "These days, meaning is the new money."

546
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,880
 We're not at a place where people are motivated

547
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,480
 by earning more money and all that other stuff,

548
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:46,380
 that people in this generation

549
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:51,320
 want meaning in their life.

550
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,360
 And if meaning is not found in money or power

551
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,840
 or relationship, and it's found in the true God

552
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,200
 in what scripture calls us, as we pursue God,

553
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:08,200
 we will find meaning, what are you going to do about it?

554
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:13,100
 Many of you guys may not be familiar with basketball,

555
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,640
 but you will understand this story.

556
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,380
 Many of you guys did see the last dance with Michael Jordan.

557
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,680
 And when I say Michael Jordan and Chicago Bulls,

558
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,960
 all of you guys are familiar with it.

559
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,140
 They had six championships.

560
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,780
 They were one of the greatest team

561
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,460
 in NBA basketball history.

562
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,700
 They had the first three championships,

563
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:34,040
 and then Michael Jordan retired,

564
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:37,360
 and then he came back for the last three championships.

565
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,340
 There was an interview, the former coach,

566
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:43,300
 Phil Jackson, did on a recent podcast I was listening to.

567
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,700
 I was very, it just caught my attention.

568
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:48,080
 Phil Jackson says to the team, he says,

569
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:52,520
 "When Michael came in, we lost in the championship,

570
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,300
 "the Eastern Conference Championship.

571
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:57,400
 "And then the following year, we all came back.

572
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,320
 "And I brought the team together,

573
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:02,660
 "and at that point in time, we brought in this player,

574
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:06,720
 "little crazy, his name was Dennis Rodman.

575
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,580
 "He was a little nuts, but we brought him to the team,

576
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:12,620
 "and a lot of people did not like him.

577
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:14,320
 "So I brought the team together

578
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,080
 "right before the season began.

579
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,780
 "And I said to the team,

580
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:24,140
 "how bad do you want to win this championship?

581
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,960
 "Because if you want to win this championship,

582
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,220
 "you're gonna have to do something about it.

583
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,120
 "And if you want to win this championship,

584
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:36,920
 "you're gonna have to accept people

585
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,700
 "who are different than you to be part of this team."

586
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:43,140
 And Phil Jackson says, I pointed to Dennis Rodman,

587
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,420
 and says, "You see this guy?

588
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,260
 "Dennis over here is a little strange.

589
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,880
 "Dennis over here will probably go to Las Vegas

590
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,540
 "sometime during the season.

591
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:55,680
 "Dennis over here will probably not show up at practice,

592
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:57,940
 "and he'll just do his own thing.

593
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:01,140
 "But Dennis over here promised that at game time,

594
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,800
 "he will be here at every single game

595
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,860
 "and play his tail off to help you win the game.

596
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:10,620
 "Can you accept someone different than you

597
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,380
 "to be part of the team?

598
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:14,040
 "Because you have to do that

599
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:17,000
 "if you want to win the championship."

600
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,280
 So for you and I as well, too,

601
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,100
 is if the money, the power, the family,

602
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,780
 the relationships mean nothing,

603
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,080
 and you're sitting there and says,

604
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,680
 "That's not gonna give me fulfillment or meaning.

605
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:32,160
 "And pursuing God is gonna give me the meaning."

606
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,080
 And you're willing to try that?

607
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:39,160
 What are you gonna do to pursue him?

608
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,320
 What changes are you gonna do?

609
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:46,280
 For the people, they cannot give him an answer.

610
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,420
 What about you?

611
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:50,900
 Elijah said to the people,

612
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:54,740
 "I, even I, only am left to profit the Lord.

613
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,420
 "But by all his profits are 450 men," in verse 22.

614
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,980
 "Let two bulls be given to us

615
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,140
 "and let them choose one bull for themselves

616
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,400
 "and cut it in pieces and lay on the wood,

617
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,140
 "but put no fire on it.

618
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,120
 "And I will prepare the bull and lay on the wood

619
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,600
 "and put no fire to it.

620
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,740
 "And you call upon the name of your God,

621
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:16,920
 "and I will call upon the name of the Lord.

622
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,640
 "And the God who answers by fire, he is God."

623
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,660
 And all the people says, "It is well spoken.

624
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:25,640
 "We love that question, we love that."

625
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,880
 Let's go to verse 30.

626
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,320
 "Then Elijah said to all the people, 'Come near to me.'"

627
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,800
 Because now the bells are doing all this,

628
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,160
 nothing happens, right?

629
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,200
 They sit there and they call upon their gods

630
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,640
 and all that stuff, nothing happens.

631
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,080
 They start cutting themselves,

632
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,560
 they start dancing, nothing happens.

633
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,080
 And Elijah says, "It is now my turn."

634
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:50,760
 Verse 30, Elijah said to all the people,

635
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,060
 "Come near to me."

636
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,300
 And all the people came near to him,

637
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,540
 and he repaired the altar of the Lord

638
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:59,020
 that has been thrown down.

639
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,620
 Elijah took 12 stones,

640
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:03,620
 according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob,

641
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,060
 to whom the word of the Lord came saying,

642
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,920
 "Israel shall be your name."

643
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,420
 And with the stones, he built an altar

644
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:12,740
 in the name of the Lord.

645
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:13,660
 Couple of things,

646
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,420
 if you feel like you're limping your faith, number two,

647
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:17,820
 if you feel like your God

648
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,620
 is not gonna accomplish what you need,

649
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,800
 and you're willing to make a decision to change it,

650
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:27,040
 you're gonna have to repair and rebuild the altar.

651
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,300
 Repair and rebuild the altar.

652
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,260
 Let me quickly go through what that means,

653
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,580
 that when you and I repair and rebuild the altar

654
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,480
 in our lives, what we're saying is

655
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,160
 we put the priority back on God.

656
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:42,540
 God, you are, I am rebuilding the altar in my life

657
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,760
 so that it is dedicated to you.

658
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,560
 What does that tangibly mean?

659
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,840
 That means you're gonna have to reflect upon

660
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,520
 what expected my relationship with God.

661
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:56,120
 You're gonna have to look at some of the barriers

662
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,760
 that can and will affect my relationship with my God.

663
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,880
 You're gonna have to look at some of the issues

664
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,000
 in your heart.

665
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,320
 You're also gonna have to ask yourself,

666
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,560
 who has God made me to be?

667
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:11,280
 What gives me meaning in my life?

668
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:14,480
 And who do I need to help in my process?

669
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,200
 The altars in our life are the altars

670
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,480
 that God places in your heart.

671
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:24,240
 We can always fake actions.

672
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,360
 We can't fake what's in our hearts.

673
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,680
 In order to rebuild the altar in our life,

674
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,800
 you will have to ask yourself,

675
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,360
 where is the state of my heart?

676
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,120
 What barriers are in my heart?

677
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,800
 What are the barriers that are affecting

678
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,000
 my relation with God?

679
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,880
 What are the barriers that are killing,

680
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,600
 or the issues that are affecting my heart?

681
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,920
 Who has God made me to be?

682
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:55,160
 What gives me meaning in my life?

683
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,640
 And you're gonna have to tangibly do all of that.

684
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,620
 And he repairs the altar,

685
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:04,440
 and then he makes a trench above the altar

686
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,960
 as great as wood contain two seeds of seed.

687
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,960
 And Elijah put the wood in order

688
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,640
 and cut the bowl in pieces and laid it on the wood,

689
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,000
 and he says, "Fill four jars with water

690
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,040
 "and pour it on a burnt offering."

691
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:18,840
 And on the wood.

692
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:22,720
 And he says, "Do it a second time."

693
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:24,840
 And they did it a second time.

694
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,480
 And he says, "Do it a third time."

695
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,120
 And they did it a third time.

696
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,960
 And the water ran around the altar

697
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,600
 and filled the trench also with water.

698
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,560
 Here's my last point,

699
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,760
 and we're gonna look at Elijah's prayer.

700
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,240
 At the time of the offering of the oblation,

701
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,360
 Elijah the prophet came near and said,

702
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,240
 and here's Elijah's prayer,

703
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:48,460
 "O Lord God of Israel, Isaac and Israel,

704
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,360
 "let it be known this day that you are God in Israel

705
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:54,400
 "and that I am your servant

706
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,500
 "and that I have done all these things at your word.

707
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,300
 "Answer me, O Lord, answer me,

708
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,400
 "that this people may know that you, O Lord, are God

709
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:08,920
 "and that you have turned their hearts back."

710
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,960
 Fifth question, we've gone through four questions.

711
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,720
 Are you limping through your faith?

712
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,800
 And if you are, what are the certain gods

713
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,000
 in your life that you have?

714
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,760
 Do you know if those gods are gonna accomplish

715
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,880
 what you need, do what you want?

716
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,080
 And if it's not, what's your alternative?

717
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:32,920
 Is it found in the Lord your God, in Jesus Christ?

718
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:36,560
 Thirdly, if it is found in the Lord Christ,

719
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:39,440
 what are you gonna do about it?

720
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,880
 Then from that point of forth,

721
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,480
 how do you rebuild your altars?

722
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:46,880
 How do you repair your altars?

723
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,880
 And the last one, what does the prayer of Elijah teach me?

724
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,640
 Prayer of Elijah teaches me three things.

725
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,600
 O Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel,

726
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,040
 let it be known this day that you are God in Israel.

727
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,200
 Prayer of Elijah teaches us that God is supreme.

728
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,160
 God is the God of Abraham, God is the God of Isaac,

729
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,360
 God is the God of Israel.

730
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:13,000
 Let it be known this day that you are God,

731
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,480
 you are the one true God.

732
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:18,120
 Second thing that the prayer of Elijah takes place

733
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,600
 is that I am your servant.

734
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,680
 It shows us our position in relation to God,

735
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,840
 that he is, we are his servant,

736
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:30,460
 and that I have done all these things at your word.

737
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:32,520
 And the last one, answer me, O Lord,

738
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,560
 answer me that this people may know that you, O Lord,

739
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:40,200
 are the God that you have turned their hearts back.

740
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,000
 Look at the key verse in this one

741
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,020
 as we wrap up this one too.

742
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,320
 Look at the key thing.

743
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,720
 It's not that, Lord, you're God and I am your servant,

744
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,200
 and force the people to turn back on him.

745
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,280
 No, no, no, no.

746
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:56,240
 Lord, work in it that you are the one

747
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,780
 that turns their hearts back to you.

748
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,760
 It is not the people turning their hearts.

749
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,360
 Lord, it is you who turns their heart back.

750
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,160
 Then the fire of the Lord fell

751
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,480
 and consumed the burnt offering,

752
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,800
 and the wood and the stones and the dust,

753
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,880
 and licked up the water that was in the trench.

754
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:18,040
 And when all the people saw it,

755
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,520
 they fell on their faces and said,

756
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,600
 the Lord, he is God, the Lord, he is God.

757
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,120
 What does this story remind you of?

758
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:32,200
 Does it remind you of the gospel?

759
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:35,160
 Does it remind you of the sacrifice of Jesus?

760
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,940
 That God could have easily punished all humanity

761
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,660
 because of their sin, and the judgment of sin,

762
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,900
 he could have literally leveled the fire

763
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:51,900
 and brought his entire judgment on the people.

764
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:55,860
 But he doesn't bring his judgment on the people.

765
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:59,940
 He brings his judgment on the sacrifice.

766
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:04,500
 And it is the sacrifice who takes the blunt of the flame.

767
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:09,280
 For us, as we look at the cross of Jesus,

768
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,540
 it is not humanity and those who have sinned

769
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:17,540
 that is the recipient of God's anger and God's judgment,

770
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:22,860
 but rather he sends Jesus who becomes the sacrifice,

771
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:27,120
 and he sacrifices the sacrifice.

772
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:31,300
 And through all that, through the sacrifice,

773
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,740
 it turns our hearts back to him.

774
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,020
 That's the gospel message.

775
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,180
 That's what the prayer of Elijah teaches us,

776
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,940
 a foreshadowing of Christ.

777
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,820
 Some of us here today may be stuck

778
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,740
 in limping through our faith.

779
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:51,260
 Some of us here may be wrestling through

780
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,540
 what are the true gods in our life.

781
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,940
 We may be living this state of mediocrity,

782
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:57,540
 of lukewarmness.

783
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,060
 We go through the flow, we go through the motions

784
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,500
 of coming to church, but there's things in our life

785
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,140
 that's tugging in our life.

786
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:06,920
 You're gonna have to make a decision.

787
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:09,640
 Who's gonna be the god of your life?

788
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,520
 And if Jesus is going to be the focal point,

789
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,680
 the god in your life, then you're gonna have

790
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,520
 to make a decision.

791
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,280
 What are you gonna do about it?

792
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:22,140
 Are you gonna repair and rebuild the altar in your life?

793
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,160
 Are you gonna sit there and reflect upon

794
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,480
 what God's meaning in your life,

795
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,360
 what God's purpose in your life is?

796
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,360
 Are you gonna look at some of the barriers in your heart?

797
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:34,500
 And are you gonna understand and reflect upon

798
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,880
 the road that God tells us through Elijah,

799
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,200
 that God is supreme in our life,

800
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,600
 that we are a servant of Christ,

801
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,660
 and it is the gospel that draws us over to him.

802
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:50,240
 That's what 1 Kings 18 teaches us.

803
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,520
 That it is the gospel, as God draws us to him,

804
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,760
 we are his servant.

805
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,760
 We are Elijah, continue to proclaim him as a servant.

806
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,100
 Let me pray.

807
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:07,140
 Father, thank you for your works.

808
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,940
 Thank you for the, man, the life of Elijah

809
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:13,460
 as we study so much in chapter 17 to 18.

810
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:15,180
 Thank you for how even through Elijah,

811
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,660
 you spoke and showed Jesus Christ through us,

812
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,660
 that you brought the sacrifice and your judgment

813
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,700
 was not placed on humanity, but placed on the sacrifice.

814
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:30,160
 And it is because of that sacrifice, we are drawn to you.

815
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,320
 May we continue to walk in your ways,

816
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:35,920
 especially those of us who are sitting right here,

817
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,240
 limping through our faith.

818
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:40,400
 In Christ we pray, amen.

819
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,980
 (gentle music)

820
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,840
 (gentle music)
