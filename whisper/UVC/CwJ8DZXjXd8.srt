1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 All right.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,680
 Good morning

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,280
 Brothers and sister if you have been with us for a while

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,000
 You know that we have been starting to Jesus Sermon on the Mount

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,360
 I think we began this series in October last year actually and

6
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:21,000
 The section that we are in now begins with Jesus

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,200
 proclaiming that he has fulfilled the righteous requirement of the law and

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:31,840
 Then using six specific examples or case studies Jesus continues on to redefine

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,580
 What true righteousness is in the eyes of the Lord compared to the religious and the cultural norms of his days?

10
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,800
 And so far for the past two months. We have looked at the first two examples on anger and loss and

11
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,720
 How Jesus he points to the root issues behind this action?

12
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:58,080
 that is a kind of attitude that doesn't treat other people made in the image of God with respect and dignity and

13
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:01,440
 In our third example today

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,160
 We will actually find a shift from the focus on our inner thoughts and desires

15
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:13,240
 To our ethical actions that impacts how we relate to others and we also find a shift from the decalogue

16
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,240
 Which is the ten words or the ten commandments?

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,840
 to the general general law and ethics section in the mosaic law and

18
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,520
 Similar to my last sermon we are actually about to engage in an area of sexual ethics which

19
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,840
 Tends to be an area of high scandal and offense

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:36,660
 It is sensitive because any discussion relate to sexual ethics

21
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:41,180
 Inevitably engaged in the part of our experience that is deeply personal

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:47,080
 From which we derive a great deal of our identity and also our meaning in life

23
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,360
 And no one likes a personal life to be met away, right?

24
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,120
 and on top of this

25
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:00,160
 Any kind of ethics by its nature place a certain limitation on our human freedom?

26
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,880
 and

27
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:06,280
 So for every yes that we say to Jesus and his kingdom ethics

28
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,400
 We are actually saying no to the ways of the world and the ways of our old self

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,080
 So today I will do my best to remain faithful to what the Word of God has to say

30
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
 when it comes to the topic of divorce and marriage and

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,560
 Regardless of where you're coming from and what seasons of life you're in whether you're married

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,440
 divorced

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,120
 Separated single or widow. I pray that the Lord will speak to each and every one of us

34
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,160
 Tangibly this morning. So let's pray with me together

35
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,160
 Father

36
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:49,960
 As we come to church and worship you this morning, I just ask that your Holy Spirit will be with us in this moment

37
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:55,560
 They will work in our hearts as your word is being proclaimed

38
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,120
 Convict us in the areas where we need conviction and

39
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,320
 Comfort us in the areas where we need to comfort

40
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:15,120
 May or may a word be proclaimed and your name glorified this morning. Amen

41
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,960
 So if you have your Bible with you

42
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,160
 Let's turn to Matthew chapter 5 and we're going to look at 2 verse today verse 31 and 32

43
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:31,760
 And if you don't have your Bible, I would encourage you to pull out your phone or I also put a couple of copies of Bible

44
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,840
 Behind there on the table. So if you want feel free to

45
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,200
 Just grab a copies and you can follow along

46
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:46,160
 So we'll be in Matthew chapter 5 verse 31 and 32 and I will be reading from the NIV version

47
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,760
 So verse 31

48
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:54,080
 It has been said anyone who divorced his wife must give her a certificate of divorce

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,800
 But I tell you that anyone who divorced his wife

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,360
 except for sexual immorality

51
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,840
 makes her the victim of adultery and

52
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,600
 Marries a divorced woman commits adultery

53
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,880
 This is the Word of God

54
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:14,840
 So this morning we are going to take a look first at the issue. That is that hand here

55
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,920
 That is the topic of divorce and then we'll take a look at what marriage is

56
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:25,400
 In another passage in Matthew where Jesus discuss about this topic at length, which is in Matthew 19

57
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,520
 but we are going to

58
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,320
 But we are going to

59
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,120
 Stay in Matthew 5 first. So verse 31

60
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,280
 It has been said anyone who divorced his wife must give her a certificate of divorce

61
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,360
 So what is this certificate of divorce?

62
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:51,120
 this is actually a piece of paper or a certificate that explains the reason for divorce and it primarily serves to

63
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,760
 function

64
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:56,520
 First it released the husband's legal claim on his wife

65
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:02,200
 and this is basically what Joseph intended to do when he found out that Mary was pregnant with Jesus and

66
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:06,360
 Secondly, it gives the spouse the freedom to remarry

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,000
 and

68
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,200
 In the Jewish law only the husband is allowed to give out this certificate of divorce

69
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,440
 however, the rabbis in Jesus day

70
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,720
 They have twisted this law and came up pretty much with a lot of ways where a wife in an unhappy or unfulfilling

71
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,280
 Marriage can sort of like force the hands of the husband to allow them to gain the freedom

72
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,360
 And not only that in Jesus day many of the religious leaders and the cultural in general

73
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,880
 They have pretty much taken this law as a blank check or a license for divorce

74
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,520
 and so this is especially clear in another passage that

75
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,720
 The topic of divorce is being discussed. That is Matthew

76
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:51,880
 chapter 19

77
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,600
 So in verse 3 it says some Pharisees came to him to test him

78
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:01,600
 They asked is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?

79
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,360
 For any and every reason is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason?

80
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:17,120
 So there seems to be a clear disconnection here right where this law has become a justification for all sort of divorce

81
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,680
 So to get a better idea of where the disconnects happen

82
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:27,840
 We need to go back to the initial context where this law was given by God to the people of Israel in Deuteronomy 24

83
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,320
 So this is the original context where this law was given

84
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,320
 If a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him

85
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:43,680
 Because he finds something indecent about her and I want you all to pay attention to the word indecent here because we will come back

86
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,680
 To it later. I promise you

87
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,520
 Because he finds something indecent about her and he writes her a certificate of divorce

88
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,200
 Give it to her and sends her from his house and it goes on for a couple more verses

89
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,880
 But basically here in the context of Deuteronomy 24

90
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:07,440
 this law prohibits a man from remarrying a woman he has previously married and

91
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:14,460
 Divorced to if she has subsequently been married to another person who has died or divorced her

92
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:20,880
 But the question that we need to ask here is whether it is a concession or a compromise being made

93
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,720
 Even though we know that marriage according to God's God's design is meant to be permanent

94
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:31,920
 This is why you always hear this phrase to death do us apart in a marriage vow, right?

95
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:37,040
 So here in Deuteronomy in an already sinful situation

96
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:44,880
 God actually permits divorce in light of the fact that the marriage covenant is not permanently. It's not uniformly permanent

97
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,660
 This law was given with the intention of limiting the harm and exploitative tendency

98
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,360
 Not to command divorce

99
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,120
 So because of the sin that led to divorce God actually gave instruction to make sure that the divorced person is being taken care of

100
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:09,600
 So what is being emphasized here is what may or may not be done in a situation where divorce has already happened

101
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,240
 The law right here is not addressing the moral status of divorce itself

102
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,120
 The emphasis is to regulate in order to minimize the damage not to command or sanction divorce

103
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:29,480
 So just want to be clear here a permission to divorce does not equal to a command to divorce

104
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,760
 They are two completely different things

105
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,240
 And when it comes to the New Testament

106
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:42,120
 Jesus does not want us to interpret this law as something that offers a command or prescription for us

107
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,880
 to to divorce

108
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,080
 but this is exactly how the Pharisees that came to Jesus understood it and

109
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,860
 We see this clearly in Matthew 19 again

110
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,660
 some a little bit

111
00:08:55,660 --> 00:09:01,380
 Further along so in Matthew 19 verse 7 again, they asked Jesus

112
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:09,340
 Why then they asked did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?

113
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,860
 Jesus replied

114
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,660
 Moses permitted you to divorce your wife. So right here Jesus is correcting them. He's like

115
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,700
 Moses did not command you but he permits you to divorce your wife. Why?

116
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:31,500
 Because your hearts were hard. So permission is given in these circumstances because sin has already taken place

117
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,740
 But then Jesus continues, but it was not this way from the beginning. I

118
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:44,060
 Tell you that anyone who divorced his wife except for sexual immorality and marries another woman

119
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,700
 commits adultery

120
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:54,840
 So verse 9 right here is actually similar to our passage in Matthew chapter 5 on verse 32 just with a slight different circumstances

121
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,960
 So once again, we find this phrase from Jesus

122
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:07,360
 But I tell you and once again, he continues on to redefines what true righteousness means in the eyes of the Lord

123
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:12,700
 But I tell you that anyone who divorced his wife except for sexual immorality

124
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:19,140
 Makes her the victim of adultery and anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery

125
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:28,380
 So, you know Jewish world of academia during Jesus's time there are a lot of different school of thoughts and different thoughts leaders and

126
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,260
 There's actually a lot of ongoing debates that are going on between all these different Jewish

127
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:40,700
 schools on what actually constitutes a valid ground or valid reasons for divorce and

128
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:44,860
 A lot of this discussion actually stems from the ambiguity of the word

129
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:49,100
 Indecent in Deuteronomy the word that I asked you guys to pay attention to just now

130
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:58,120
 Jerome me 24 it says if a man marries a woman who becomes displeasing to him because he finds something indecent about her

131
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:04,500
 So on one end of the spectrum, there's the more conservative school the school of Shami

132
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,900
 They say only sexual immorality and immodesty

133
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:15,300
 Constitute a valid reason for divorce and on the other end of the spectrum. There is the school of Hillel

134
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:18,860
 They basically say any any reason is valid if

135
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:27,460
 Your wife is not a good housewife and she accidentally spoiled a meal that constitutes enough reason for you to divorce her

136
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,900
 And there are also other Jewish thought leaders like Rabbi Akiva

137
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:37,380
 Who basically say if you find someone that is more attractive and she's available that?

138
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,260
 Constitutes valid reasons for you to divorce

139
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,900
 And while all these debates are going on

140
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:51,660
 Jesus he transcends all of them by saying that divorce is not part of God's original plan

141
00:11:51,660 --> 00:12:00,100
 Therefore remarriage with or without the certificate of divorce constitute adultery in the eyes of the Lord

142
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:04,020
 However, there are two clear

143
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:11,780
 exceptions that we can find from the Bible the first one is sexual immorality where we finds here in Matthew chapter 5 and 19 and

144
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,020
 the second one is

145
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,380
 spousal desertion or spousal abandonment and we find that in first Corinthians 7 15 and

146
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:27,740
 The second cases it basically described a situation in an unequally yoke marriage where one of the spouse is a believers

147
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,740
 and another one is not and

148
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:34,420
 If the non-believing spouse choose to leave the believing partner

149
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:40,500
 Paul this is Paul speaking. He say in that case that is valid

150
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,980
 But regardless we should view these two exception as permission not requirement

151
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:49,740
 And in our passage today

152
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:55,700
 Jesus did not actually say that in such a situation as husband is required to divorce his wife

153
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,740
 Quite the opposite

154
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:03,660
 What is implied by Jesus here? Is that even in the case of sexual immorality?

155
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:06,820
 you are not required to divorce your wife and

156
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,860
 It is possible for the marriage covenant to continue

157
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:16,100
 In fact because God's design for marriage is meant to be permanent

158
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:22,460
 Divorce should always be the last resort and this is quite a scandalous claim during Jesus's day

159
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,700
 And at this point some of you might ask what about other situations like

160
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,980
 domestic abuse or

161
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:36,340
 violence in a marriage relationship

162
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:43,220
 Of course God has given us the wisdom and his spirit to guide us in various situation

163
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:47,020
 So in some cases of violence and abuse

164
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:54,840
 It might be wise for the spouse to separate or even divorce in order to limit the harm and care for the person

165
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:59,780
 And I truly believe that there is always grace in this kind of situation

166
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:06,220
 However, this doesn't change the truth that the marriage covenant between a man and a woman is

167
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,260
 meant to be a lifelong covenant and

168
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:16,180
 This also doesn't change the truth that our God is the loving father who care deeply who cares deeply

169
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:22,740
 For his children and he desires for each and every one of us to experience a flourishing life

170
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:29,940
 So as the church as believers, we need to use our God-given wisdom to approach these issues

171
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:37,140
 With the intention of loving and caring for the person at the same time without compromising our faith

172
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:48,060
 So we have touched upon the topic on divorce and now we're going to take a look at God's design for marriage

173
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:54,900
 So we're gonna stay in Matthew 19 for this. So let's go back to Matthew 19 again in verse 3

174
00:14:54,900 --> 00:15:00,780
 When the Pharisees asked Jesus if it is lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any and every reason

175
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,540
 I want you all to pay attention to how Jesus respond to them

176
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,140
 He didn't focus on what constitute legal grounds for divorce

177
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,040
 But instead what he focused on is God's design for marriage

178
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:17,940
 So Matthew 19 starting in verse 4

179
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:24,660
 Haven't you read he replied that at the beginning the Creator made them male and female

180
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,860
 this is in reference to Genesis 1 27 and

181
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:34,220
 say for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and

182
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:39,420
 The two will become one flesh and this is in reference to Genesis 2 24

183
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:46,540
 So they're no longer two but one flesh and therefore what God has joined together

184
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,020
 Let no one separate

185
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:53,100
 So what can we learn about marriage from Jesus's response here?

186
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:57,060
 If you're taking note, I would encourage you to write this down

187
00:15:57,060 --> 00:16:05,300
 Marriage is a divine institution that is directed towards the goal of our lifelong discipleship to Jesus

188
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:14,020
 Again, marriage is a divine institution that is directed towards the goal of our lifelong discipleship to Jesus

189
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:18,980
 So we're gonna look for us marriage as a divine institution. I

190
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,620
 Don't know if any of you actually enjoy

191
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:24,580
 Legos and there's no shame in the meeting yet

192
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:29,420
 Even though you're an adult because I actually still enjoy building structures and play around with Lego

193
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:36,020
 When I was getting my MD fat tats, I live with a friend a friend's family up in the north suburbs

194
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:41,740
 And one of the unique thing about this family is that they are a family of builders and architects

195
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:45,880
 In fact, they have actually helped a couple of their friends and family

196
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:52,260
 built like the house from the ground up all the way from design to like actually building it and making it happen and

197
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:57,780
 The house that I live with them at that point the dad pretty much designed it and build it himself as well

198
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:02,100
 And somehow this builder DNA is being passed down to their grandchildren

199
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:08,600
 Claire and Russell as well because every time I hang out with them, they just love playing with their Legos

200
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:16,540
 For a certain period of time whenever they get their hands on their Lego, they actually like to play what they call Lego zoo

201
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:24,020
 And it is always fascinating seeing Claire and Russell used to creative freedom to build their Lego zoo

202
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:27,140
 One time the younger brother Russell

203
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:34,700
 He pretty much put a slide right in the middle of the zoo and not only that the slide actually leads right into the lion

204
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,420
 exhibits

205
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:41,820
 As an adult when I see the outside, okay, that is an issue right there. So I asked Russell

206
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:45,700
 Hey Russell, what is the slide for and he just answered me like genuinely?

207
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,060
 Well when the people get tired of walking they can just take the slides

208
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:54,820
 So even though me as an adult I see some issues with the Lego zoo

209
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,820
 But since this Lego zoo is the quote-unquote creation

210
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:05,500
 They pretty much have the freedom to build it whatever way that makes sense to them right as a three-year-old at that point

211
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,540
 But on the other hand

212
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,740
 There's another type of Lego that actually comes in a specific set

213
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:20,900
 With specific step-by-step instruction on how to build it and you can find all sort of different Lego sets at this point from Star Wars

214
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:24,380
 To Marvel to Harry Potter you name it

215
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,700
 And so a few Christmas ago

216
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:33,100
 I actually got an architectural Lego set of Singapore from this family and actually had a blast of building it

217
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:39,500
 I actually have a pictures on to show you so this is the Lego set that I received from this family and

218
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:48,340
 One thing that I noticed about this Lego set is how much details and thoughts they're being put behind the design of this Lego set

219
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:53,500
 each single piece of the Lego the colors the shapes

220
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,700
 the orientation

221
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,540
 Where you put them?

222
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:02,460
 They're all being intricately designed to be built into the skyline of Singapore. I

223
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:09,020
 Remember at some point I actually put a piece a right piece in the right place

224
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,020
 But I sort of like put it in the wrong orientation

225
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,580
 And I didn't notice it until later when I tried to put another piece on top of it

226
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,740
 And it just doesn't fit so I pretty much have to redo everything from that piece onward

227
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,740
 And so for me to successfully build this Lego set

228
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:30,020
 I pretty much have to follow like step-by-step instruction from the beginning to the end

229
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:38,260
 And so when it comes to marriage there are generally two different ways that we can approach it as well

230
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,660
 The first approach is kind of like see it as a social construct

231
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:48,100
 Which is pretty much like the free play Lego that Claire and Russell is playing with and they can pretty much do whatever

232
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:52,060
 They want with the Lego and the second approach is

233
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:55,340
 Seeing marriage as a divine institution

234
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:02,500
 So it's more like this kind of Lego set where a creator design is specifically to serve a specific purpose

235
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:06,660
 So if marriage is a social construct

236
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:10,580
 It means that there is no inherent nature and order to it

237
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:18,420
 But we as human we collectively decide and agree upon what marriage should be and what is the meaning of marriage?

238
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,180
 One good example of a social construct is cryptocurrency if you think of all the different coins

239
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:31,540
 Bitcoins or I don't know. What are some other coins these coins these virtual currencies?

240
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,940
 They don't really have any inherent value to it

241
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:38,980
 but the values come from we as human kind of like assign something to it and

242
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:44,780
 It also depends on a lot of different factors like the market or the supply and the demand

243
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:53,340
 But on the other hand if marriage is a divine institution it means that there's an integrity that exists

244
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:57,220
 Independently on how we as human instrumentalize it

245
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:03,300
 In other words, there's a certain norm and design to marriage in which we are accountable for

246
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:08,380
 Similar to when I talked about in my last sermon with kind of like the grain of the universe

247
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:12,540
 That there's a certain order to it that is being designed by God

248
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:18,940
 So what are the implication with marriage being one or the other if

249
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,620
 Marriage is a social construct that means that we as human

250
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:30,460
 We actually have the freedom to choose what form it takes and use it as a tool to pursue our own personal interests

251
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,660
 But if marriage is a divine institution

252
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:40,300
 It means that there's an inherent structure to marriage that is part of the scent that is part of the created order

253
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,700
 regardless of how we interpret or

254
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,180
 instrumentalize it of

255
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:50,780
 course, we as human we still have the free will to choose to go against the grain of the universe and

256
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:56,180
 Violate the created order, but ultimately it will not lead to a flourishing life

257
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,580
 And if we take a look at Jesus response, I think it would tell us a pretty clear answers right here

258
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:07,340
 Jesus he goes all the way back to Genesis to the creation account

259
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:12,540
 so notice in verse 4 haven't you read he replied that at the beginning the

260
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,940
 creator made them male and female and

261
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:22,220
 Say for this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife and the two will become one flesh

262
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:30,100
 so this means that marriage between a man and a woman is instituted by God the creator and

263
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:35,980
 When it is at the beginning that is since the creation of the world

264
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:39,380
 And we as human we are actually part of the creation as well

265
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:44,260
 So we don't really have an authority to simply decide what we want marriage to be

266
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:49,520
 So what is marriage first it is a divine institution

267
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:55,500
 That means there are certain orders and norms to it that we as human are accountable for

268
00:22:55,500 --> 00:23:00,140
 But second marriage is directed towards a greater goal

269
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:08,820
 So if you ask the people around you what is the purpose of marriage you might get an answer like affection

270
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:12,220
 companionships or

271
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,460
 procreation

272
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:20,380
 The church historically has seen some of this as the purpose of marriage include procreation

273
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,060
 companionship remedy for loss and also social stability and

274
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:31,500
 Marriage and family in general they are being situated in this historical narrative where we as human

275
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:36,020
 Carry the responsibility to extend the kingdom of God to a certain extent

276
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:42,980
 We find this in Genesis 1 28 where God tell command human to be fruitful and multiply

277
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:48,980
 Few the earth and subdue it and rule over the rest of the creation. This is what call

278
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,080
 This is what we call the cultural mandate

279
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:56,060
 All these purpose are true and good

280
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:02,780
 But ultimately I would say marriage is a way that we can be formed into Christ likeness

281
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:09,380
 This bring us to my third point that marriage is a way that we can pursue a lifelong discipleship

282
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:12,380
 to become more like Jesus and

283
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:15,020
 I just want to be clear here

284
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:22,440
 What I'm not saying is that your discipleship to Jesus is deficient if you are single or you're not married

285
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:29,500
 Paul speaks about singleness in 1st Corinthians 7 as well and Jesus himself. He remains single his entire life

286
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:32,780
 So there's nothing wrong with not being married

287
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:36,620
 But right here marriage is a form of discipleship

288
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:46,040
 Because at the core of a godly marriage is a kind of sacrificial love that reflects the gospel and its model after Jesus

289
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:52,980
 This is what Jesus meant when he says that in the marriage covenant the two will become one flesh

290
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,700
 And there are no longer two but one flesh

291
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,460
 So there are no longer two single individual pursuing after their own interests

292
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:06,860
 But one single Union pursuing after a common goal

293
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:11,340
 I'm sure all the married couples in this room can attest to this

294
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:17,960
 Therefore a marriage to work out. It usually requires a lot of sacrifice and self-denials, right?

295
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,500
 Maybe one of you would like to sleep at 65 degree at night

296
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:28,660
 But your spouse like to sleep at 75 degree Fahrenheit at night. So for your marriage to work out

297
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:33,300
 I'm sure either one of you or both of you have to give in in some ways, right?

298
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:38,700
 And this is just one of the small examples. There are a lot more important decisions like

299
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,280
 How many kids do you want to have?

300
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:47,620
 Where where do you want to live? What neighborhood you want to live in? What school do you want to send your kids to?

301
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:56,180
 These are all big decisions that as the two person become one they have to decide upon as one single Union

302
00:25:56,180 --> 00:26:02,900
 And this in some ways is what discipleship is all about that. We are called to deny ourself

303
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:10,420
 including our own self-interest to take up our cross and to follow after Jesus himself and

304
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:17,300
 Marriage is an arena where our discipleship to Jesus can be refined and being lived out

305
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,460
 And

306
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:26,020
 Moreover marriage is a lifelong journey because once again the marriage covenant between a husband and a wife

307
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:29,220
 Is a sacred covenant that is meant to be permanent

308
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:34,420
 And this is what Jesus meant when he say in verse 6 therefore what god has joined together

309
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,980
 Let no one separate

310
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:39,860
 So again, what is marriage?

311
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:47,640
 Marriage is a divine institution that is directed towards the goal of our lifelong discipleship to Jesus

312
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:54,500
 So if you have been following along this sermon series on Jesus sermon on the mouth so far

313
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:57,300
 over the course of my last few sermon

314
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:01,300
 You will probably started to notice a common threads in Jesus teaching

315
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,200
 Where he raises the standard of righteousness?

316
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,660
 And also intensifies the moral demand represented by this law

317
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:14,420
 And if this makes you feel like you can never really approach Jesus with such a high demand that he has

318
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:17,140
 There's a good news for us

319
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:20,740
 Unlike the pharisees and the teachers of the law

320
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:26,340
 The paradox of Jesus and some of the most scandalous realities about his ministry

321
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:32,500
 Despite his demand for righteousness is that the people whom Jesus chose to actively

322
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:35,460
 be with and spend time with

323
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:40,420
 Were usually those that are considered as sinners and outcasts by the society

324
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,340
 And these are the people that Jesus came and died for

325
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,620
 So I want to acknowledge that there might be some of us in this room

326
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,500
 Who have personally been through a divorce?

327
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:57,860
 Or you're currently going through a seemingly hopeless situation in your marriage

328
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:01,380
 Or maybe some of us

329
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:08,580
 Or maybe some of us you have been directly or indirectly impacted by a broken marriage in your family of origin

330
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:16,580
 Or maybe for some of us you're in a season of singleness where you're just struggling and feeling alone

331
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:23,140
 Whatever your experience is coming to church and hearing this message this morning

332
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:29,540
 I want to be abundantly clear that the intention behind these teachings from Jesus is not to condemn

333
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,100
 But it is actually out of his love

334
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,540
 For us to experience the good and blessed life

335
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:40,020
 This is why the entire sermon on the mount actually begins with blessing

336
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,740
 Blessed are the poor in spirit

337
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,260
 And regardless of your current struggles and past experience in your marriage or singleness

338
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:52,420
 You don't have to carry the weight of your guilt and shame anymore

339
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:54,820
 because Jesus

340
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,220
 Through his teachings in the sermon of mount

341
00:28:57,780 --> 00:29:01,060
 It's actually inviting all of us into a new way of living

342
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,860
 That will lead to a truly blessed life

343
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:12,180
 So before I end my sermon, I know we just touched upon a subject that can be heavy for some of us here in the room

344
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:20,500
 So now I want to actually create some space for us to respond to the lord and do whatever we need to do with him

345
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:25,060
 And i'm going to do so actually by leading us through a spiritual practice

346
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,820
 together

347
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,860
 so

348
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,860
 This might be new to some of you

349
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:36,660
 But if you can just find a position or if you want to move to another seats where you feel more comfortable with

350
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:41,800
 Just find a spot that you're comfortable in and just relax

351
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:55,380
 And if you're comfortable

352
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:59,400
 You can close your eyes and take a few deep breaths

353
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:16,840
 Now I want you to imagine that you and jesus are in a room together

354
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,820
 And jesus is not all the way across the room from you

355
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:30,120
 But he is either standing or sitting right in front of you or just right beside of you

356
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:48,760
 Take a few more deep breath listen to this invitation from jesus

357
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:55,700
 Are you tired

358
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:58,660
 Worn out

359
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,620
 Burn out on religion

360
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:10,980
 Come to me get away with me and you will recover your life

361
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:17,060
 I will show you how to take a real rest

362
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:26,580
 Walk with me and work with me watch how I do it

363
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:31,540
 Learn to enforce freedoms of grace

364
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:38,100
 I won't lay anything heavy or ill-fitting on you

365
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:46,360
 Keep company with me and you will learn to live freely and lightly

366
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
 So

367
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:59,400
 If you want to just take a moment at your seat, I also put out the passage up on the screen

368
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,400
 this

369
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:06,360
 In your own pace at your own time. Just read through this passage again. This is matthew 11

370
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:09,720
 28 to 30, but it is the message version

371
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:16,680
 Read through this passage again slowly and reflect on the invitation from jesus

372
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:19,480
 To come to him

373
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
 To get away with him

374
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,960
 To walk alongside him

375
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:26,680
 And to be with him

376
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,780
 And i'm going to close this out in a moment with a prayer

377
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,780
 So

378
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:59,020
 Jesus

379
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:03,280
 We thank you for you are a god who is close and near to the brokenhearted

380
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:08,940
 We thank you

381
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,140
 For your yoke and your burden is not heavy

382
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:15,660
 But it is easy and light

383
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,820
 As we receive your word this morning

384
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,500
 Help us lord

385
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:27,980
 To be willing to also receive this invitation from you

386
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,300
 To

387
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,380
 To be with you

388
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:36,780
 To take up your yoke which is light and free

389
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,500
 And as we continue to live out our christian faith

390
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,500
 Help us to know that jesus

391
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:50,220
 You are right there with us in each and singing each and every step of the way

392
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:53,180
 That you are with us

393
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:56,380
 Comforting us strengthen us

394
00:33:56,940 --> 00:33:58,940
 And healing us

395
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,540
 So as we go go on to the rest of the week, I just ask that lord you will refresh us

396
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:08,460
 Give us the rest that we need so that we can continue to live out

397
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:14,300
 Um the life that you have called us to live to live out the purpose that you have given us

398
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,180
 To be a light and the salt to the world

399
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,660
 To the darkness that is around us. So father be with us

400
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,820
 as

401
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,300
 As we walk out from church this morning

402
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,620
 Pray this in the son's name. Amen

403
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:32,060
 So, uh

404
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:34,060
 Thank you all if you need

405
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,180
 More time to process feel free to stay in the room if you want to find someone to pray

406
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,580
 Feel free to do so as well

407
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,540
 but for the rest of us, um, you are

408
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,740
 Dismissed you can go in peace and

409
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:51,340
 We have some dim sum out there

410
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,940
 For us to enjoy as well
