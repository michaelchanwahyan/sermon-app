[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200]   Family, it's good to be with you again.
[00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.600]   And as we've been having this conversation over the past few weeks and talking about
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:13.200]   all the stuff that's going on in our world, I've been trying to point you to some voices
[00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.360]   in the church and some voices in the African American community that can speak to these
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.360]   issues really well.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.200]   And so today I wanted to sit down with a couple of my really good friends.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.840]   And this is Wade Norman and Eric Cummings.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.560]   And they're good friends of mine and they're men who love Jesus and men who are serving
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.600]   Jesus with their lives.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.320]   But they're also black men who've grown up in Chicago and been here their whole lives.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.400]   And so these things that are happening right now in the news that we're all thinking about
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.400]   and discussing and trying to understand how to respond to, these events are realities
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.960]   of their experience that they've dealt with for a long time.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.520]   And so I really want you to be able to hear their voice and hear their hearts and hear
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.360]   what God has done in their lives and how God has taught them and hear how God wants to
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.000]   teach us right now and the things that God would have to say to us.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.960]   So guys, to start, why don't you just share.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.480]   I know these moments feel different for everybody.
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.960]   And for you guys, these moments are a part of your experience and have been.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.080]   And so if you could just share what that feels like a little bit, some of the emotions they
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.000]   have to navigate, some of the pain that's involved, some of what that is.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   You.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.520]   Yeah, you go.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:47.040]   Yeah, for me, it's like, it was a constant reminder of, in the Christian sense, this
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.080]   place is not my home.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:56.000]   But then also like historically, knowing like, you know, the scars of racism in this country,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.700]   it's like, you know, this country wasn't necessarily built for me or.
[00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.840]   And so it's, you know, it's like stuff like this happens.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.160]   And it's like, there's a part of you that's like really shocked or like, you know, in
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.760]   tears about it, but then it's also like not surprised, like you almost get numb to it
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.000]   to some degree when it's like, you've been kind of living that way.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   But yeah, a lot of it is a lot of it is really complicated now, I think, with so much like
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.880]   I was saying to somebody like, we're at a time now where like, everybody's voice can
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:31.880]   be elevated.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.040]   You know, social media has made this platform where now people can speak and share about
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.600]   injustices or things or issues that are happening.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.840]   But what is created is like, yeah, everybody has maybe the equal opportunity to share or
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.040]   say things about something.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:59.720]   But it's not necessarily equally valued or like equally worthy of listening to.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.200]   And so it's like this, yeah, this hard part where like social media has done really well
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.400]   at like, making us like, more aware of these things.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.560]   But it's like, at the same time, it's also made it kind of easier to almost ignore it
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.040]   if you want to.
[00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.560]   So it's yeah, so it's hard.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.920]   It's a lot of different emotions.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.760]   But what I find also just being an African American man is expressing emotion is very
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.080]   difficult anyway.
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.000]   Like it's one of those things that can, you know, that's kind of shunned within our own
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   community.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.440]   We have to be strong for our families, we have to be strong for, you know, our wives,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:38.440]   our kids.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.320]   But then strong for those who, you know, we don't know if they have ill intent toward
[00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:44.320]   us.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.840]   You have to, you know, you can't really show weakness.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.720]   And so that part is very hard because allowing, you know, stuff to build up, you know, in
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.680]   a lot of ways it can poison you if you don't have an outlet.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.400]   And thankfully, you know, I found Jesus.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.560]   And so like, I feel like even if I can't express an emotion around a bunch of people, I can
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.040]   always express it to God, you know, and know that He hears me, you know, that He finds
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.560]   my voice valuable.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:22.080]   But I can't imagine, you know, my brothers who don't know Christ, you know, I mean, it's
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.640]   like torture in a lot of ways.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.360]   And like just to piggyback off of what Wade was saying, the key word he said that really
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.200]   resonated with me was "no."
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.520]   So I mean, we've been through this so many times.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.200]   I know it's been the times where it's like, I say, you know what, that's another killing.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.240]   I'm like, it's like you said, we're so used to it.
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.960]   It's like we see it on social media and you just go pass it.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.680]   But this one with George Floyd, I can say personally, this one hit me extra hard because
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.760]   a few months before, somebody, I just want to say I was, somebody called the police on
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.840]   me and they're like, once you experience it, it's like you can start putting your feet,
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.520]   putting yourself in their shoes.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.400]   And it's like, wow.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.840]   And you're going through, you're trying to fight off that numbness.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.080]   You're fighting off anger, you're fighting off fear, you're scared.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:23.920]   And you got all of these emotions you're trying to figure out, but still try to go to work.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.760]   And it's like, you're still trying to do a nine to five and still keep it professional.
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.360]   And it's like, it's hard because it's like, you want to grieve.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.680]   Like you were saying before, like as black boys, we was told, like, you're not supposed
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680]   to show your, your emotion.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.680]   You're not supposed to cry.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.000]   But it's like, what are you supposed to, like, how am I supposed to like share these emotions?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.200]   How am I supposed to feel?
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.240]   So it's like, I'm learning how to share my emotions more, but at the same time, it's
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.240]   like, I don't want to show too much.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.000]   Like, it's like a double edged sword.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.880]   Like you show too much emotion, you're that angry black man.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.560]   Or you're an angry black person.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.120]   If you do show it on other sides, like, oh, you're too soft.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:09.720]   And so it's like, we're struggling to figure out what the mean, like, what should we do
[00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:13.120]   to like show how we feel about everything.
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.920]   So it's the first part is always numb.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:23.280]   It's like, when I remember the first day when George Floyd died, I looked at the video for
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.400]   like 10 seconds and I said, I don't want to look at this today.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:30.080]   But then it kept on coming back up and I was like, okay, let me sit down and like watch
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.080]   this video.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.320]   And then all the emotions started coming in.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:40.480]   So it's like, you go through it every day, but it's like just to see it again and again,
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.480]   it's like it hurts.
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:46.000]   So, because you think it could have been me.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.480]   One of the things we've been talking about a lot of different things and responding.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:57.880]   And one of the things we talked about was in Romans 12 and the verse that says that
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:58.880]   we're to weep or those who weep.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.520]   And so that's one of the things we've been focusing on grieving because we know that
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.360]   that is this process.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.680]   It's grief for the African American community.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.680]   It's grief.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:11.680]   It's mourning, it's weeping.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.640]   And we've talked about how it's not just grief over this incident.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:23.360]   Obviously, it's the whole history of injustice, particularly in our country.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.360]   It's grief over that.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:31.360]   And one of the things that we've talked about in that is how believers and people in the
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.960]   church who are outside the African American community, how they can respond in a right
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   and genuine way.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:42.000]   We see obviously a lot of different responses in the world right now, but how can we do
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.360]   that well and do it genuinely and do it in a way that's truly supportive and loving.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:56.040]   And so that's something I would love to hear you guys thoughts on how other believers can
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:08:02.320]   support you guys and your community and where you're going through.
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:11.400]   The first step, I will say, is to become a listener, to actually come and listen to someone
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.960]   share how they can help.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.040]   Because we don't need people to come in to be a savior for us.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   That's having a problem now.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:24.240]   But we need you to come in and listen and hear how people are feeling through this.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:29.720]   And over the last few weeks, I've actually had people come to me and do that.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:35.160]   And it's like, wow, like you actually want to sit down and listen and see, like, I know
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.320]   that we live in a broken world.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:41.960]   I had one person actually come out and tell me that he said that I've been racist and
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:46.260]   it's because the way I've been raised and what can I do or how can I help?
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.880]   So even I had to even encourage him at that moment, like you saying this and acknowledging
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.240]   that you have sinned or this sin is still in your life.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:58.120]   It's like you're ready to make a change.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.360]   But also when you make this change, you have to be able to listen to someone else.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:09.200]   So it's all you have to be able to humble yourself to listen to your brother and want
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.600]   to learn and actually, yeah, just shut up.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.840]   That's the thing, just shut up when you're talking.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:21.320]   Because sometimes what I've noticed, like people want to share and it's like you're
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:25.400]   still fighting on not listening.
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:31.560]   And it's like one challenge I did, like an exercise with somebody, like when you are
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.680]   the exercise is you, somebody say one thing and you have to start a hand, you have to
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.560]   start your sentence with that last letter of that last sentence.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.520]   And they didn't understand why I was doing it.
[00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.240]   And then after a while, we kept on doing it and they noticed like, okay, like what was
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.240]   that for?
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:55.120]   And I was like, you had to listen to everything I said to see how you're going to start your
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.120]   thing.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.560]   So you have to be able to sit and listen to everything the person is sharing, not just
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.200]   the one point you want to talk about, but they share a lot of points they want to talk
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:08.200]   about.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.920]   So it's a learning process and it's going to be hard.
[00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:16.280]   That's the thing, it's going to be hard.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.680]   It's not going to change overnight.
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.440]   Like you do it for one day, it's not going to be the same the second day.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.040]   It might change with whoever you talk with.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:29.760]   So it's the first two steps is acknowledging where you're wrong or where you're saying
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.760]   it is.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.960]   And then the second part is being humble enough to sit down and listen to your brother, to
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.280]   your African American brothers, actually share how they feel about the situation.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:41.280]   That's awesome.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:48.480]   Yeah, no, I think you guys are on the right track of what the Romans 12 of like grieving
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:49.960]   alongside your brothers.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:57.120]   I think, yeah, if I would add anything to listening to be lamenting alongside.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:04.760]   And really to go into what Eric's saying is like creating an environment of empathy and
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:13.400]   transparency where your African American friends do feel like they can express themselves without
[00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:20.280]   repercussions or feeling blindsided or like letting their guard down.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:27.200]   I mean, honestly, that's one of the biggest things we need, a place to be who we are.
[00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:33.280]   And it's, yeah, we have to put on so many faces when we step out into the world.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:40.200]   I was watching this one pastor talk about even like because of the Ahmaud Arbery thing,
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:47.760]   he was like, "In my mind, when I go outside, I've already played the mental game of what
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:55.040]   can I wear when I go on this run so that people know that's what I'm doing and there's no
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.560]   issue at all or there's no mistake that he's out there running, guys.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.160]   He's not robbing anybody.
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.840]   He's not trying to do anything."
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:08.160]   And it made me remember like something I did or something I still do actually.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.200]   And I never really associated with race necessarily.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:15.960]   I just associated with, oh, it's just a common courtesy to do this.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:21.640]   So when I go into a store, well, one, I never go into a store that I'm not willing to buy
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.320]   anything in.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:27.600]   And so the next thing is if I go into a store and if I'm going to be in there longer than
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:30.480]   10 or 15 minutes, I have to buy something in there.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:35.400]   So whether it's a soda, stick of gum, otherwise there's this attitude of like, "I don't want
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.760]   people to think I'm in here shoplifting.
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:44.240]   I want people to know I'm in this store just browsing, looking for something, didn't find
[00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:48.440]   it, but I'm not trying to get over on anybody."
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.920]   And it's, yeah, I don't know.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.760]   Hearing that pastor made me think there's so many areas where the African-American has
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:13:01.320]   to do that and put on this face of like professionalism sometimes, or maybe you do have to be the
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:06.960]   angry black guy because you're in a situation that calls for that.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:10.240]   But it's almost always a mask of who you are.
[00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:15.760]   It's never, you never, you honestly, unless you maybe go to counseling or have opportunities
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:21.640]   to talk with people that have been through the process and have given you opportunities
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:25.000]   and made that safe environment to express yourself.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.520]   I know there's some African-American men that never had that chance, and it plays out in
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:38.640]   different ways, whether that's domestic abuse or heavy alcoholism, or it's gambling, all
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.960]   these other sins are really deep.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.160]   But in a lot of ways, they're surfacy to what some of the issue is.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.760]   It's just like, "I can't be a man.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.400]   I can't be myself."
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:53.880]   And so, yeah, so lamenting is definitely one.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:56.760]   And then trying to create, yeah, creating a space.
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:01.600]   And I think, yeah, the way you create that space is with empathy and transparency.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:07.160]   People that are transparent, that is one of the most contagious things, I think, especially
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.920]   for believers.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:14.760]   Every Bible study that I love going to is because men were honest and transparent about
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.400]   the real issues that we deal with as believers.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:22.280]   So I think, yeah, I think those are good ways to do it.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:23.280]   - That's good.
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:28.120]   One of the things that hit me as you guys were speaking about that is how some of those
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:35.120]   things you're describing are like basic gospel values, basic values that should be in the
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.400]   church, that Koinonia type of fellowship.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:44.120]   And I think, I mean, that directs us to the hope of the gospel, obviously, but it also
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.120]   directs us to the failure of the church to nurture those things.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:53.560]   It's sad that we haven't done a better job of building those spaces and building them
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:54.560]   for everybody.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:03.200]   And that points an error of our own failing in the church, and that's really sad.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:10.400]   So I'm also interested to hear from you guys as we go forward how believers, and again,
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:15.400]   especially believers who are outside the African-American community, can really continue to be involved
[00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:18.040]   and engaged and supportive.
[00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:22.600]   Because obviously there's a lot of attention right now, and there's a lot of response,
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   and that's good.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:27.760]   There's a lot of positive response, which is really good, but it's easy for those things
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.160]   to just be a moment and to just be kind of an event, and then they fade away.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:38.120]   And in a few weeks or a few months, people forget about them and then go on.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.000]   And then the realities don't change.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.560]   And in the church, we want to continue, by God's grace, to be living out the gospel and
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.920]   seeking God's justice and doing those things.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:56.600]   So I'm interested to hear from you guys what are some ways that people can continue to
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:00.720]   be involved and to respond.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:02.520]   That's actually my biggest fear.
[00:16:02.520 --> 00:16:03.520]   That people...
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:04.520]   Oh, what?
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.520]   Like everybody's protesting.
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:06.520]   Yeah, what's next?
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.640]   And it's like, okay, what are you going to do next?
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:14.400]   Everybody's on the protest, but when a protesting dies down, like you said, what's your next
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:15.400]   move?
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:19.960]   I was just on a Bible study when we was talking about this.
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.560]   It starts with talking about community.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.400]   What was that guy named?
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.400]   Bon Hopper.
[00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:28.400]   Oh, Dietrich Bon Hopper.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:29.400]   Dietrich Bon Hopper.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   He was talking about...
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:35.360]   It was a quote saying, "If you have a dream for your community, you'll die, but if everybody
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.520]   else is in it, if you have a community, you'll thrive."
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:41.840]   So we were talking about community.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:48.840]   You need to create that community of not just people that look like you, but people that
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:53.960]   doesn't look like you, with different races, different age groups, so you'll be able to
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.320]   grow and learn from that.
[00:16:57.320 --> 00:17:00.640]   And so I think they were college students.
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.440]   Best thing about college students, they're able to...
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:05.160]   There's different events on your campuses.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:08.600]   Go to those different events and start able...
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:13.640]   I won't say put yourself out there, but take a chance to start talking to other people
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.080]   that doesn't look like you.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.640]   You're going to fail at first.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:22.200]   It's basically like that, because you're stepping out your comfort zone, you're coming into
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.000]   somebody's comfort zone.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.120]   Everybody's uncomfortable, but after a while, they see that you're not doing it because
[00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:33.320]   of what's going on, and it's really coming from your heart.
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:35.440]   People can tell the difference.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:39.120]   Once they see the difference, like, "Okay, I'm going to let down my guard just a little
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:43.040]   bit, but I'm going to still keep my distance.
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.280]   I'm going to still keep it up."
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.280]   But it's not a...
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:50.040]   Like I said before, it's not an overnight change.
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:56.640]   If you're serious about being the change, nobody said it's going to start overnight.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.120]   It's long suffering.
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:17:59.120]   That means suffering long.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:06.320]   But going through the changes, going through the hurt, and through the journey.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.480]   I was talking to somebody last night, like, we always want to get to the end of the journey,
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:15.360]   but the whole experience and the journey is what creates you, or what makes who you are.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.120]   So when you're working towards that, it's going to be hard.
[00:18:20.120 --> 00:18:24.720]   But I mean, if you walk with God and you faith, He's going to provide for you.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.840]   But if it's just for hidden knowledge or pride, it's just going to die.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:29.840]   It's not going to work.
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:32.160]   Like, it's a true heart change.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.160]   So I hope I answered that question.
[00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:38.600]   I think you answered it well.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:39.840]   Yeah, that's good.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:46.520]   It made me think of something else that might be helpful is one of the big things, I think,
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:55.680]   in our country and why a lot of racism or just prejudice in general is able to continue
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:59.320]   like generally is because we love categories, right?
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.120]   We love grouping.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.720]   You think about the news, right?
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.600]   They had the looters, the rioters, the peaceful protesters.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:10.560]   It was all these different categories.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.880]   And honestly, the African-American experience is pretty used to that.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.520]   We are used to carrying the weight of our race all the time.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:26.880]   And so one of the most helpful things is to treat each black friend you have as an individual.
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:31.480]   You know, like even me and Eric, we are very similar, but we're also really different,
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:32.480]   like distinct.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:40.360]   And it made me think of this one training I went to, and it was like, "Which black are
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:41.360]   you?"
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.960]   And it's like, so even within black, there's categories.
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.040]   And this may be helpful for you, but there's the ABC.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:51.740]   So the A black is assimilated.
[00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:54.280]   On the streets, we will call you a sellout.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:20:00.400]   This is the person that is basically joined with the majority culture.
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.440]   Most of their friends are probably white.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.200]   Most of the stuff they like is like pop culture type things.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.420]   Then you have the B black, which is like bicultural.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:12.520]   So this is the person that's pretty much able to walk in both worlds.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:20.880]   They recognize that they're black and are able to be black around blacks, but they also
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:27.040]   are able to kind of turn on, "What does it mean when I'm around people that aren't black?"
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:32.280]   And then there's the C black, which is like contextualized or culturally black.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:35.440]   So if you were like, "Oh, how do I spot this person out?"
[00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:38.920]   This is the person that has the Malcolm X shirt on.
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:44.080]   This is the person that is never going to probably come to a church that's mostly white.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   This is the person that's at all of the events that Eric was mentioning on college campus.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:53.280]   If it's a black event, they're probably there.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:57.800]   They probably have peace signs and things like that.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:03.200]   And they are very aware of their race and are very active and vocal.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:11.680]   And so one thing that could be helpful is discovering who are the ones around you, because
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.960]   all of us interact with these things differently on an individual basis, but even in those
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:21.280]   groups we interact differently.
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.480]   All this is general, so none of this obviously can stick on anybody.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:30.360]   Let's just say, for example, with all the stuff that's been happening, the assimilated
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.920]   might, let's say all of us say the exact same phrase.
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.360]   We say, "Man, we watch the news and we say, 'This is messed up.'"
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:39.680]   I, by culture, say, "This is messed up."
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.400]   And assimilated blacks say, "This is messed up."
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:44.080]   And then let's just act like Eric is a C black culture.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.400]   And he say, "This is messed up."
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:50.680]   Well, we all said the same phrase, but what did we mean when we said it?
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.360]   I say, "Man, this is messed up.
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:22:00.000]   I can't believe the media is showing all these people looting and rioting and stuff."
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.880]   And then the assimilated black says, "Wait, what do you mean?"
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.480]   "No, I'm talking about the way they're treating us police officers, blah, blah, blah."
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.400]   And then the culture black is like, "I just can't believe they didn't riot all these other
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.280]   places or do all these other places."
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.400]   Now, once again, that is general, but yeah, even within the black community, we're all
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.540]   coming at this from different angles, depending on how we were raised.
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:27.840]   And then what our connections is to our own race.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:35.480]   Some of us, honestly, the bicultural, we have an identity crisis, to be honest.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.080]   We can walk in both worlds, but we feel like we belong to neither.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:42.840]   We're not black enough for the contextualized friends.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.600]   We're not white enough for our assimilated friends.
[00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:51.040]   And each group probably feels some type of animosity toward others.
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.040]   It's an everyday struggle.
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:53.040]   It's a battle.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.040]   It is.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.040]   It's a battle.
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.040]   It is.
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:05.120]   I remember being at day camp and almost having to prove my blackness to somebody that came.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.600]   They thought I lived in Beverly.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:09.120]   It was something about that.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.840]   They thought I listened to...
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.880]   I did listen to this Hillsong, but I was like...
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.640]   I mean, there's a lot of people that listen to Hillsong.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.640]   I like Hillsong.
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:19.520]   They make good music.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.520]   But it is funny.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.400]   It is like this, "Oh, you have to prove, 'Oh, no, I'm black.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:26.400]   I'm black.'"
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.400]   Or whatever.
[00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.360]   But one of the things Eric said that made me think when you said community that is missing
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:38.040]   in all of this is, yeah, we want to run to solutions.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:40.240]   And a pastor was talking about this.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:47.200]   He said, "Don't be so quick to run to a solution that you forget to run to relationships."
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.640]   He was like, "Because solutions can be a quick fix, and you forget about it."
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:59.600]   We get to 2030, and 2020 is 10 years past, and it's not on our mind anymore.
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:05.400]   He said, "At the core of it all, do you care about people?"
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.080]   And it just made me think people is the problem with all of this.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.960]   If we're honest, you remove people, and there's none of these things.
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   There's none of these issues.
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:21.560]   But you put people who are sinful, have a sinful condition in a situation with each
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:24.520]   other, and sin is bound to happen.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:30.360]   And one of the things is not only people, but opportunities for power.
[00:24:30.360 --> 00:24:36.160]   And so power is this thing where it only means something when people are involved.
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.520]   You can't be powerful by yourself.
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:47.520]   One of my favorite conversations is when he's having his disciples, he's like, "In the world,
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:51.320]   these people in high leadership, they lord it over each other.
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.760]   They lord it over those that are lower than them."
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:56.800]   He said, "But that won't be the way with you."
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:00.760]   He's like, "Actually, you are going to go to the bottom."
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:04.840]   He's like, "Everybody is racing to this top, and lording it over each other."
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:07.080]   He's like, "You are going to race to the bottom."
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:12.080]   He says, "If you want to be great, you got to serve everybody."
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:19.520]   And what we see in this country, obviously the reversal of what Christ said, if you want
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.520]   to be great, this is who you have to step on, basically.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:27.720]   And it's people who were created and made in the image of God.
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:37.520]   So yeah, I think the other thing too is to try to think what you would do if it was your
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:39.560]   people.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.520]   That's one of the biggest things that has always gotten me.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:46.720]   What if this was my brother that was killed?
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:49.220]   What if this happened to my sister?
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:55.680]   I think sometimes when you empathize in that way, you don't even need to ask a person what
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   to do.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.880]   You just do it.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:05.200]   And that's when you learn that, yeah, we may be a different color, but we all want the
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:09.040]   same thing.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:15.720]   Another helpful thing is to understand just because things may be equal doesn't mean they're
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.520]   necessarily equitable.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.920]   That's another thing that I've been learning recently is things can be equal, but still
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   inequitable.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:28.640]   Let's say we're all looking over this fence and I'm short.
[00:26:28.640 --> 00:26:29.640]   I'm five, seven and a half.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:30.640]   Sam is pretty tall, six, two, six, three.
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:38.520]   Eric might be a little shorter than me.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:42.520]   So maybe there's two crates here.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:49.800]   And the equal thing is if we all just had a crate, but I still can't see over the thing.
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:50.800]   But it's equal.
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.800]   We're all equal.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.440]   It's like the equitable thing would be maybe Sam doesn't get a crate because he can see
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.440]   over the fence.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:00.760]   Eric might get two crates and I get one crate.
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:05.080]   So a lot of it is thinking about it in that way too.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:09.520]   Not just, "Oh, let's make it equal for everybody," because it's not necessarily the most helpful
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:10.520]   at times.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.360]   Sometimes it's like, "No, this needs to be equitable."
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:20.280]   But it's a lot of really awesome hopeful things that I've seen, like Eric just in the past
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.040]   few weeks, that is very different from this situation than situations that we've been
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:26.040]   used to.
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   It's a lot more people doing something.
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.640]   I feel like this is a very action-packed time to be a Christian because all eyes are on
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   you right now.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.200]   What will you do?
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:38.520]   What will you say?
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:40.080]   Because people are going to remember it.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.560]   That's beautiful, guys.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:46.320]   I appreciate you sharing your hearts.
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:49.720]   I know that's not easy a lot of times.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:54.120]   Everyone can be honest about anything in our lives, but especially about things like this
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.720]   that are really part of the core of who you are.
[00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.320]   So I just want to thank you guys for that.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.280]   I really appreciate you guys.
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:06.080]   I'm honored by your friendship.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.600]   I appreciate what both of you had to say about relationship.
[00:28:09.600 --> 00:28:14.480]   I know that's been a big part of, for me, understanding more of God's heart and the
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:19.920]   gospel and what it means in relationship to all the peoples of the world.
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:24.560]   It's having relationships with different people, and that's been really important.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:38.680]   I'm just always amazed at Jesus' love for us and the fact that, like you were saying,
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.040]   it comes back to people.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   That's what Jesus cares about.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.200]   He cares about hearts and lives, and that's what's important to Him.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:53.640]   He's not really in any way attached to our politics or to our philosophies or our ideas.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:29:01.840]   He cares about hearts and lives, and that's a part, something we can't and should not
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:03.480]   miss in the church.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:08.400]   I hope you enjoyed the conversation that we had today, and I just want to thank Wade and
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:15.320]   Eric again for coming and having that conversation with us and opening their hearts and being
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:21.400]   so honest and giving us the perspective of their life experience.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:24.960]   That's so good for us, and I hope it was encouraging to you.
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.320]   I hope it was thought-provoking.
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:33.360]   I hope it helped you to see some things that maybe you hadn't seen before.
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:39.560]   I really am grateful to both of them for sitting down and doing that with us.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:41.000]   I really appreciate both of them.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   As I said at the beginning, I'm honored by their friendship.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.800]   They're men who love Jesus and who are giving their lives to serve in Jesus and to serve
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:48.800]   in His church.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:50.720]   They're also great friends of mine.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:54.880]   That was actually the noises that you could hear in the video.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:59.440]   That was the Z's making a lot of noise because Wade and his wife have young children, and
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:02.360]   they're great friends with Jessmyn and I's kids.
[00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:05.400]   Our kids were playing together and having a great time, and so the Z's were making a
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.400]   lot of noise.
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.960]   You could hear that on the video.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:16.300]   But I want to point us to this heart of unity that Jesus has for His church as we close
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.680]   it out today.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:20.640]   I want us to consider that.
[00:30:20.640 --> 00:30:23.360]   Unity is hard work in the church.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.080]   It's always been hard work, but it's something that Jesus wants for us, and it's something
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:31.200]   that is available for us if we're willing to pursue it.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:37.480]   Pursuing it means sitting down with people who have different experiences than us, who
[00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:43.520]   have different perspectives than us, and listening, and really listening and hearing, not just
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:49.360]   being in the same room while they're talking, but actually really listening and hearing
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:54.840]   their heart, and practicing some empathy and saying, "I want to try as much as possible
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.120]   to think about what life might look like from that perspective, and to understand what my
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.040]   brother or my sister has gone through and what that feels like for them."
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.640]   To allow that to happen, even if it's difficult, even if it's uncomfortable, even if it reveals
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:16.200]   something about my own heart that I don't really want to see, we need to do that.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.560]   We need to do that in order to pursue unity.
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:24.100]   We need to allow ourselves to lay down some of our own preferences and some of the things
[00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:28.660]   that we enjoy and some of the things that we're familiar with in order to understand
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:35.720]   or to accommodate the feelings or the preferences or the familiarity of a brother or sister
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:36.720]   in Christ.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:41.160]   That's one of the things that we have to do to work towards unity in the church, to
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.920]   pursue unity.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.520]   It's not easy, but God can do that work in us and through us.
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.240]   We talked last week about how God in these moments wants to do the hard work of heart
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:55.800]   change in our lives, and that's one of the hard things that God wants to do right now.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:32:00.080]   One of the works of heart change that He wants to do in our lives is helping us to understand
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:06.000]   one another, helping us to hold more loosely to some of our preferences and to some of
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:11.360]   the ways that we're used to doing things and to some of our cultural affinities and be
[00:32:11.360 --> 00:32:17.840]   willing to take on more of God's kingdom cultural affinities.
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.880]   That's really important for us to remember.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:25.120]   If we are living according to the values of the kingdom, if we're living according to
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.100]   the values of heaven, then all of us are going to be a little bit uncomfortable, no matter
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.960]   what cultural background or what our life experience is.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:39.760]   God's going to ask all of us to lay some things down in order to love one another well, and
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.840]   that's what we need to be seeking and pursuing in this moment in the church as we continue
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:48.160]   to respond in all the ways we've been talking about over the past few weeks.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.200]   We want to pursue unity, and that comes through really caring for one another, really hearing
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:59.140]   one another, really loving each other well, and choosing to give up some of those things
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:03.000]   that maybe are important to us in order to love someone else well.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.760]   I'm going to close out just by reading a few verses from John 17.
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:10.960]   This is a prayer that Jesus prayed for the church.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.280]   I'm going to start in verse 20.
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.040]   This is John chapter 17, verse 20.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:19.120]   I do not ask for these only, but also for those who will believe in me through their
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:24.960]   word that they may all be one, just as you, Father, are in me and I in you, that they
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.440]   also may be in us, so that the world may believe that you have sent me.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.000]   The glory that you have given me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as we
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:41.560]   are one, I in them, and you in me, that they may become perfectly one, so that the world
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:47.600]   may know that you sent me and loved them, even as you loved me.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.560]   That's a beautiful, powerful passage.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:54.120]   It's a prayer that Jesus was praying for us, for the church.
[00:33:54.120 --> 00:34:02.680]   And in that prayer, Jesus tied the manifestation of God's glory to our unity.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:08.400]   He tied those things together, that God's glory and God's power would be revealed in
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.000]   people from all different backgrounds being unified in the church.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.880]   And he tied our testimony in the church to our unity, that the world around us, people
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:22.160]   who are outside the church who don't know Jesus, would know the supernatural power of
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:27.280]   the gospel and the reality of Jesus because of the unity in the church.
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:31.320]   So it's really important for us to walk in it and to live it out.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.760]   It's really important for us to seek it and pursue it in moments like this, even though
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:40.800]   it might be challenging, even though it might feel difficult or frightening to us, or we
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:43.880]   don't understand, or we say, "Hey, what does that mean for me?
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.440]   What do I have to lay down?"
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:53.000]   We need to pursue and seek after and hunger for unity and for love for one another.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Let's pray.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.880]   God, I do pray that your church would be one.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.760]   I pray that we would listen to one another, that we would love one another well.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:07.880]   I pray that you would do the hard work of heart change in our hearts and in our lives
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:14.480]   to help us to really care for one another and to help us to be unified in pursuing the
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.080]   values of the kingdom, to be unified in pursuing the heart change in our own lives, but then
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:25.040]   the transformation of our families, our neighborhoods, our communities, our cities, and even our
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:30.720]   nations that comes as we respond to the work of Jesus in our heart, as we respond to the
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:33.720]   healing that only He can bring to our hearts.
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:35.240]   God, I pray that it would happen.
[00:35:35.240 --> 00:35:38.880]   I pray that we would be healed and that we would love one another and that we would be
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:39.880]   one.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:41.680]   In Jesus' name, amen.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
