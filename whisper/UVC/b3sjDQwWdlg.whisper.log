[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.440]   God knows.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.480]   So I could send Jesus.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.000]   We are touched by love.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.400]   And that's hard sometimes.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:52.680]   (speaking in foreign language)

[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:04.080]   We don't, adults don't,
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:07.320]   but to go through the journey together.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.160]   Okay?
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.080]   (speaking in foreign language)
