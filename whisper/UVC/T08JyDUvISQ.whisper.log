[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760]   her today, Sam.
[00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.300]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.740]   - Good morning.
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.160]   I'm honored to be here and excited to be here.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.620]   Privileged to be with you in worship today.
[00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.820]   Thank you to the worship team for leading us.
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.900]   I really enjoyed that time of worship in the Lord.
[00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.680]   And this morning we're gonna talk about something
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.540]   that is really important for us,
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:30.840]   especially in the modern world that we live in,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.640]   and that is learning to love dependence,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.480]   learning to love dependence.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.400]   And that's a difficult thing for us.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.680]   Dependence is not a cultural value
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.580]   that we are used to embracing.
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.280]   We live in a culture that really values,
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.340]   especially in the United States,
[00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.120]   really values individualism and independence,
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.900]   self-reliance, self-sufficiency.
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.080]   We all feel like that's how we should live
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.120]   and that's how we wanna be.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.220]   We feel like we don't want to need anyone else.
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.060]   We don't want to have to rely on anyone else.
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.160]   We wanna be strong and get through things on our own.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.160]   But the reality is that's not a biblical value.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.580]   And in fact, what the Bible teaches us is the opposite.
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.440]   The Bible teaches us that we are hopelessly dependent
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.420]   on God and that we're also,
[00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.860]   God made us to be interdependent on one another
[00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.460]   in the church.
[00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.680]   And so our cultural instincts in the world around us
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.780]   kinda fight against that.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.560]   We say, no, I don't wanna be dependent on God.
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.720]   I don't wanna be dependent on others.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.140]   I wanna do everything on my own.
[00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.000]   But we have to learn to embrace the fact that we're human
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.220]   and that God made us with limitations
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.220]   and that we need him and that we need one another.
[00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.420]   So that's what we're gonna speak about this morning.
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.760]   We're gonna look at this verse in Genesis chapter two,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.440]   verse seven, just one verse.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.920]   And if you're not familiar with what's going on
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.480]   in Genesis two, this is when God is creating.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.120]   And so in Genesis one, God's created the universe
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.560]   and everything in it.
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.920]   He's created the earth, he's created the animals
[00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.320]   and the plants that are on the earth.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:19.240]   And in Genesis two, Genesis one is like an overview
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.320]   of creation, it gives all the different things God created
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.640]   and the days and when they were created.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.200]   And then Genesis two is like zooming in on day six,
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.880]   which is when humans were created
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.920]   and giving us more detail about when we were created.
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.480]   And so in verse seven, it tells us, speaking about us,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.720]   it says, "Then the Lord God formed the man of dust
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.640]   "from the ground and breathed into his nostrils
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.280]   "the breath of life, and the man became a living creature."
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.580]   That's our origin story right there.
[00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.680]   The origin story of humanity,
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.780]   not as glamorous as we think, right?
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.500]   We didn't get bitten by a radioactive spider
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.600]   or come from an alien planet.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.400]   We got made out of dust and dirt.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.840]   That's our origin story, that God formed us from dust
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.000]   and he literally breathed life into us.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.440]   And not just life, but our soul
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.760]   and everything that it means to be human.
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.680]   We know in, earlier in Genesis 1, 26 and 27,
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.320]   it says that God made us in his image.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.680]   And one of the things that we need to understand about God
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.640]   that helps us to understand ourselves is who God is.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.500]   And one of the most significant aspects
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.180]   of Christian theology is the truth
[00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.380]   that God is completely distinct
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.940]   from all of the created order.
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.480]   God is in a class to himself.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.160]   Everything else that has been created,
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.920]   everything that we interact with,
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.280]   everything in our world was created or made.
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.760]   The natural things were made by God.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.320]   Buildings and things like that were built by humans.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.280]   But everything we see and interact with
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.600]   was created at some point
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.240]   and it had a beginning point in time
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:13.560]   and it will have an end point in time, including us.
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.420]   But that's not true of God.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.640]   God is completely different
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.760]   than everything in the created order.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.440]   We see in Genesis that God, in the beginning,
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.400]   God, he already existed before the beginning of the universe.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.200]   God was pre-existing, he was eternal.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.120]   He needs nothing from no one to exist.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.360]   That's who God is.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.240]   And that's important to help us understand who we are.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.420]   Because God made us in his image,
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:43.980]   but not the other way around.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.240]   We are like God in some ways.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.920]   God made us in his image.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.480]   So God gave us a soul, this spiritual part of us
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.540]   that can have relationship with him.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.800]   God gave us some of the things that we see in our own lives.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.760]   We see the appreciation for beauty and creativity
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.840]   and a desire for relationship.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.760]   Those are reflections of God.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:10.280]   God obviously loves beauty and he's very creative.
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.760]   And he is a relational being.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:16.480]   Even in the beginning of Genesis there,
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.880]   we see God as father, son, and the Holy Spirit
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:19.800]   in the act of creation.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.720]   God's a relational being.
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:21.920]   And we are too.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.960]   We're made in God's image.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.460]   We're like God in some ways.
[00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.880]   But God is not like us in any way.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.400]   And so we have to understand,
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.200]   when we start to think about who God is,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.720]   God is completely beyond us.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.340]   And we are finite creations of the infinite God.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.380]   God is unlimited in every way.
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.800]   He has all knowledge, he has all power.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.320]   His attributes are unlimited.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:54.320]   He is not just loving, but he is perfect love.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.600]   He's the definition of what love is.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.940]   That's how we know love, because of God.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.900]   He is just.
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.320]   That's how we know what justice is.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.960]   Because God is the definition of perfect justice.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:08.780]   He is holy.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:12.540]   That's how we know what's right and holy in the world,
[00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.400]   because God is holy.
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.060]   He's the definition of those things.
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.640]   God is infinite in every part of who he is.
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.900]   But we're not.
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:28.000]   He created us as finite creations.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.040]   We're a part of the created order.
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.760]   Now we're a very special part of the created order.
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   God created us as the crowning achievement of his creation.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.480]   He gave us, again, his image
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:45.760]   and things that no other part of his creation has.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.360]   We have a soul, we have the ability
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.160]   to make moral choices for right or wrong.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:52.520]   We have the ability to have relationship with God
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.840]   and relationship with one another.
[00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.960]   Those are really unique things.
[00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.160]   But we are not God.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   We are not infinite.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.020]   We are finite in our capacity.
[00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:07.000]   And even in the attributes of God's character
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.400]   that God calls us to reflect,
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.800]   we reflect those things in a finite way.
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.280]   God's love is perfect.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.020]   We love imperfectly.
[00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.320]   And we should seek to love like God.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:18.940]   God calls us to that throughout scripture,
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:22.040]   but still, our love is imperfect, it's incomplete.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.760]   God is perfectly holy.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.800]   Our holiness is always flawed.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.240]   We are finite.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:37.200]   And a part of our finitude, the finite part of us,
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.120]   is that we have limitations.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:44.600]   In verse seven there that we just read,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.200]   God formed humans from the dust of the ground.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:49.560]   How did he form us?
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.760]   He formed us in the way that we
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.080]   see one another in this room, right?
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.920]   God gave us spiritual bodies, physical bodies.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.080]   He gave us spiritual life as well,
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.840]   through the universe and do different things.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.000]   He gave us this physical container for us to live in.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:11.560]   And that physical container has some limitations, right?
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.840]   One of the biggest ones is we can only
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:17.120]   be in one place at one time.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:20.480]   As much as we would love to be in multiple places at once
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.840]   and feel like we could get so much more done,
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.240]   God gave us that limitation.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:26.460]   We can only be in one place at a time.
[00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.240]   But there's a lot of other limitations too, right?
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.800]   We get tired.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:33.120]   All of us have to sleep.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.680]   We can work hard, we can hustle, we can do a lot,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.960]   but then we have to rest.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.120]   That's just a reality of having a physical body.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.800]   And what I want us to see is that our limitations
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:49.320]   are actually a part of God's good design.
[00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:50.840]   Sometimes we fight those limitations.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.140]   We say there's something wrong with me
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.800]   because I can't do more and I can't do
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.540]   all the things I wanna do and what's wrong with me?
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.640]   But the reality is our limitations
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.700]   are a part of God's good design.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.560]   God gave us those limitations on purpose
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.780]   because we need them.
[00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:08.020]   And one of the biggest reasons that we need them
[00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:11.740]   is to make us depend on him.
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.180]   We're limited creations that are dependent on God.
[00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.380]   And one of the marks of God's good design in our lives
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.140]   is the limitations that he gave us
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.940]   that force us to rely on him.
[00:09:22.940 --> 00:09:26.920]   I'm gonna let you in on a secret here.
[00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:28.360]   Most of you probably already know this,
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.560]   but some of you may not.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.340]   But here's the secret.
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.540]   It took me a long time to learn in my life.
[00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:38.540]   But the secret is that you cannot have it all in life.
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:40.940]   All right?
[00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.540]   And our world, most people in the world
[00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.500]   don't seem to know that or maybe they know
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.320]   but they just don't believe it.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.620]   And they think they can have it all.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.480]   And so at every stage of life,
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.460]   we are trying to live into that,
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:55.980]   that we can have it all.
[00:09:55.980 --> 00:09:57.740]   So when we're young and we're a student,
[00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.180]   we're trying to get the best grades
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.380]   and also do all the extracurriculars
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:02.620]   and maybe some of the sports
[00:10:02.620 --> 00:10:06.340]   and also be the best rated gamer
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.980]   and be a great child to our parents.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:11.860]   We're trying to do it all
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:13.500]   because apparently we think we can
[00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.020]   and apparently we think we have to, right?
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:18.700]   Then we get a little bit older and we're working
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.140]   and we're trying to have it all in our career
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.980]   but also live this really cool life
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.560]   where our social media reels are full of great pictures
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:30.140]   and vacations and restaurants and beaches
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.380]   and we're trying to do it all.
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:34.100]   And then if we have a family,
[00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.700]   we find ourselves trying to still have it all in career
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:40.100]   and everything else but also be a great parent
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.020]   and a great spouse and we're trying to do that.
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:47.140]   And the reality is we can't.
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:50.940]   God never intended it for us to have it all.
[00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.900]   We are limited creations.
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:55.980]   And if we're gonna live in a healthy way,
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.740]   then we have to embrace that and say,
[00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.780]   you know what, I'm dependent on God.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.260]   Think about what we see in this passage.
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:05.860]   First, we're dependent on God for our physical life,
[00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.620]   for our very breath.
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:11.680]   God breathe the breath of life into humanity.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.820]   And we could say, well, this is just talking
[00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:16.260]   about the first man, the first woman,
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:17.380]   it's not talking about us.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:20.820]   But the Psalms speak very clearly to the fact
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:24.660]   that God forms each one of us before we are born.
[00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:29.660]   God, it says, God knits us together with his own fingers.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.280]   God is in there in the mess of your DNA
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.240]   and not just in the DNA.
[00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:39.920]   The DNA is the physical part, right?
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:42.800]   God formed you how he wanted you to be,
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.840]   with your face and your height
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.240]   and your physical characteristics and all that.
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:51.200]   But not just in that, God forms you in your emotions,
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.760]   in your personality, in your gifts, in your talents,
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.600]   in all those ways.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:59.400]   God forms you just like he formed the first humans.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.000]   So we're dependent on God for our physical life.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.940]   We're dependent on God for our emotional life.
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:07.500]   We're dependent on God for our spiritual life.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:12.760]   All of those things, those dreams and desires
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.220]   and ambitions that we have,
[00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.480]   ultimately, we're dependent on God for those things.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.320]   James chapter four talks about this.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.720]   It says, come now you who say today or tomorrow
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.080]   we'll go into such and such a town
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.960]   and spend a year there and trade and make a profit.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:29.760]   Yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.760]   What is your life?
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.960]   For you are mist that appears for a little time
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.600]   and then vanishes.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.280]   Instead, you ought to say if the Lord wills,
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.420]   we will live and do this or that.
[00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:40.040]   As it is, you boast in your arrogance.
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.760]   All such boasting is evil.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:42.860]   What is that passage saying?
[00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:45.120]   It's saying, look, you don't know it,
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:48.440]   but you're dependent on God,
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:50.400]   even for your future plans and the things
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:53.460]   that you think you're gonna do next week or next year.
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:58.860]   If God doesn't sustain your life and your emotions
[00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:00.540]   and sustain you spiritually,
[00:13:00.540 --> 00:13:02.240]   you're not gonna do those things.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.340]   That's what that verse is reminding us of.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:11.260]   We, as human beings, we don't like dependency.
[00:13:11.260 --> 00:13:12.580]   We try to convince ourselves
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:14.100]   that we're not actually dependent.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.680]   We love feeling like we're in control,
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.180]   even if it's just an illusion.
[00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.660]   We're very good in the modern world
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.700]   at building a lot of structures around us
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:26.940]   that insulate us from difficult events
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:28.500]   and maintain the illusion
[00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.260]   that we're in control of our lives.
[00:13:30.260 --> 00:13:32.040]   But we're really not.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.980]   We're dependent on God
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:35.960]   to get us through the day physically.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.100]   We're dependent on God emotionally.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:41.460]   When we go through times, as Pastor Mark was mentioning,
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.240]   where we are grieving or we're experiencing loss
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.980]   or we're hurting or something unexpected happens
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.380]   or we have a disappointment, we lose a job,
[00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.780]   we have a relationship where someone is unkind to us,
[00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:54.260]   we go through those things,
[00:13:54.260 --> 00:13:55.620]   or at least when I go through those things,
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:56.460]   I'll speak for myself.
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:13:59.060]   Maybe it's not true for you, but it's true for me.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:00.420]   Sometimes I go through those things
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:01.940]   and emotionally I just get really wrecked
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:06.120]   and I realize how close I am all the time
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.740]   from just really struggling emotionally
[00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:11.300]   and getting stuck
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.380]   and just being in a really unhealthy place.
[00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:21.000]   So if I think, oh, I'm doing great because I'm so strong,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.620]   I'm lying to myself.
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:25.180]   I'm dependent on God all the time for his strength
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:27.180]   and for his comfort and for his peace
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:31.700]   and to sustain me emotionally and certainly spiritually
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:33.780]   for the relationship that I have with God.
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:37.040]   That's not gonna happen at all unless I'm depending on him.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:40.140]   If I'm relying on myself saying, yeah, I'm a great person
[00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:41.500]   and I know what I'm doing
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:46.020]   and I'm out here doing all these things because of me,
[00:14:46.020 --> 00:14:49.220]   I'm gonna be very spiritually unhealthy.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:54.580]   We have to get past our sinful desires
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.500]   and the lies of our culture that it's all about us
[00:14:57.500 --> 00:14:58.700]   and we need to rely on ourselves
[00:14:58.700 --> 00:14:59.700]   and we need to say, you know what?
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:04.700]   I am a limited creation and I need God in my life.
[00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:07.660]   I need him to keep me going.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.780]   I pray this prayer pretty much every morning.
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:12.500]   I prayed it this morning 'cause I was tired.
[00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:14.920]   Just my wife and I, Jessamine is my wife's name.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:16.740]   We have five kids.
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.100]   Our youngest is one
[00:15:18.100 --> 00:15:20.520]   and so he had trouble sleeping the last few nights.
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.980]   So I've missed some sleep.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.420]   So I was tired when I woke up this morning
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:26.580]   and I prayed this prayer that I pray every morning
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:27.660]   before I even get out of bed.
[00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.500]   I just say, God, I need you today.
[00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.700]   I'm really dependent on you.
[00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:35.780]   I need you physically to get me through the day.
[00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:37.700]   Just give me the strength and the energy
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:39.540]   to get through this day.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:41.220]   I need you emotionally and spiritually
[00:15:41.220 --> 00:15:43.520]   to give me the patience that I need
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.060]   to deal with situations that are gonna arise today
[00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:50.060]   or people that are gonna give me difficult interactions
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.580]   or whatever it is.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:55.160]   I need you to get through this very day.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.820]   That's a healthy place for me to be.
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:58.920]   It's a healthy way for me to start my day.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:02.660]   Then we see in Genesis as well
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:04.580]   that we are limited creations
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.720]   that are interdependent on one another.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:11.160]   Again, that's a part of God's good design.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.300]   God gave us limitations
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:15.260]   that not only make us dependent on him
[00:16:15.260 --> 00:16:17.620]   but they make us need other people.
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:20.060]   And we're relational beings
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.820]   and God created us for community
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:25.820]   or another word that we could use is family
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:27.620]   with one another.
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:31.780]   Genesis 2, 18, just a few verses after this in chapter two.
[00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:33.500]   God looks at the man.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:34.860]   This is before he makes the woman.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.540]   God looks at the man and says this.
[00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:40.540]   The Lord God said, it is not good
[00:16:40.540 --> 00:16:42.060]   that the man should be alone.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:48.620]   It's not good for us as humans
[00:16:48.620 --> 00:16:50.740]   to be isolated and on our own.
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:52.060]   As much as we think it's good,
[00:16:52.060 --> 00:16:55.540]   we think oh, but then I would never be disappointed
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:58.360]   if I didn't have anybody else that I had to trust
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.900]   or no one would ever hurt me
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.340]   if I could just isolate myself
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.520]   from these other people who are being mean.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:06.300]   But God said, hey, it's not good for you to be alone.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:07.500]   You are relational.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.480]   You need other people.
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:13.740]   And in Genesis 2, 24,
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.500]   God institutes this covenant of marriage.
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:22.220]   He begins the first family between Adam and Eve.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:24.420]   But he doesn't just begin the first family.
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:26.540]   He begins the first community.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:30.940]   Before there was Adam, there was an individual.
[00:17:30.940 --> 00:17:33.120]   After that, there was community.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.100]   There was a group.
[00:17:35.100 --> 00:17:40.220]   God made us to be in community, in family.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:42.420]   And we need that.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:43.940]   And we need to embrace that.
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.240]   And one of the ways we embrace that is right here.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:52.500]   The church is a community that God gave to us
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.340]   for our own benefit.
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.360]   And it doesn't matter if you're married or single
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.200]   or young or old or even what your background is.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:02.660]   God in the New Testament talks about that,
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:04.460]   how there's neither Greek or Jew,
[00:18:04.460 --> 00:18:06.100]   circumcised, uncircumcised,
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.500]   barbarian, Scythian, slave, free,
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.420]   but Christ is all and in all.
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.460]   That God brings us together in the church.
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:15.660]   It doesn't matter who we are or what our past was.
[00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:18.340]   And he says, you're in a family now.
[00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:21.460]   And so you can rely on each other and care for one another
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:23.560]   and depend on each other.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:28.140]   And again, the human part, our sinful nature says,
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:31.020]   I don't want that, I don't wanna need other people.
[00:18:31.020 --> 00:18:34.380]   I don't wanna need people in my church.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.380]   Sometimes we don't even wanna need our own family members.
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:38.340]   I don't wanna rely on my family.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:39.840]   I'm not even sure I like them.
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.680]   But God says, you need those people.
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.620]   I made you that way on purpose because you need help.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:49.240]   And if you didn't have the limitations,
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:51.800]   you wouldn't go to anyone else.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.840]   You'd just try to do it all on your own.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:19:00.240]   That limitation is a good thing for us that God gave us
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.040]   so that we would rely on others.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:06.800]   And I just wanna say real quickly here
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:12.760]   that those limitations are not necessarily sin.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.680]   Look at the order of Genesis, what's happening here.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.120]   Genesis one, the creation.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.440]   Genesis two, like I said, it zooms in
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.640]   and gives us this kind of zoomed in view of humans
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.440]   and the creation of humans.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.440]   Then Genesis three, what happens?
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:30.640]   Genesis three is where sin enters the world.
[00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:33.640]   So think about that.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.520]   Genesis two, we're created as limited beings
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:41.800]   and there's no sin in the world yet.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:44.920]   It means our limitations are not sin.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.920]   And a lot of times we feel like,
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:51.880]   oh, well, I just can't do enough and be enough
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.800]   because I'm broken, there's something wrong with me
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:57.360]   and I guess I just need to try harder.
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.840]   I need to figure out a way to be better.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.240]   And we treat our limitations like there's some type of sin
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:05.720]   or brokenness.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:06.960]   God never said that.
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:10.920]   Now, our limitations can lead us to sin
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.400]   if we don't respond to them correctly.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:15.800]   If we hit the wall of our limitations and say,
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:17.600]   you know what, I need help
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:19.680]   and so I'm gonna turn to God for help,
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.520]   that's exactly what God wants us to do.
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:25.680]   But if we hit the wall of our limitations and say,
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.600]   no, I'm gonna push through and I'm gonna find a way
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.640]   and I'm gonna do this on my own,
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:32.440]   then yeah, our limitations can lead us to sin.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.680]   But our limitations are not sin.
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.680]   And so when we look at our life and say,
[00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.840]   I just can't do it and I can't say yes to everything
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.080]   and I can't keep up with it all
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.680]   and I can't take it all on, that's okay.
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.560]   That's okay.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.240]   God didn't make you to do all those things.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:53.040]   God made you to be able to do a limited number of things
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:55.000]   each day in a limited amount of time
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:56.520]   before you have to sleep
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.360]   and you can only be in one place at a time,
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:20:59.880]   you can't meet every need,
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:01.400]   you can't be friends with everybody,
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.360]   you can't do everything that you want to do.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:08.640]   And that's tough for us in the modern world, right?
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.000]   In the past, maybe it was easier
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.840]   because you didn't see pictures all the time
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.080]   of what everybody else was doing,
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.920]   so you just lived in your community
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:16.640]   and you felt like, hey, I'm doing okay,
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:19.320]   I'm here in my community with my family,
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.640]   with my people, with my church,
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.520]   we're doing what God has for us.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.840]   It might have been a little bit easier
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.320]   to kind of keep your eyes
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.720]   on what God was doing in your life.
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:30.960]   But in the modern world, with the internet and social media,
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.040]   we're constantly seeing what everybody else is doing
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:34.480]   and so we have this desire
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:38.200]   to always feel like we should be doing more,
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.840]   like we're not doing enough,
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:42.480]   or that we're not enough.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:44.400]   Like, you know, I'm not good enough
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.800]   because I see everybody else
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.120]   that seems to be better than me
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:51.000]   or more talented or their life is more exciting.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.440]   Those are not the things that God has told us.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.680]   God, it's clear here that God created you
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.840]   to be who he wanted you to be.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:06.440]   He intentionally gave you the talents that you have,
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:09.200]   but he intentionally gave you the limitations you have.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:11.520]   And he wants you to be dependent on him
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.600]   and dependent on others in a healthy way
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:16.560]   and to not try to do it all.
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:20.720]   Our limitations are not sin.
[00:22:20.720 --> 00:22:23.240]   And I want us to see here that dependence on God
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:26.360]   is cooperation, it's not resignation.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.400]   Sometimes we might be mistaken
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:31.440]   and say, okay, if I'm just gonna depend on God,
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.400]   that means I'm just gonna kinda resign
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.720]   and be like, I can't do it.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.800]   And so whatever happens in life is just gonna happen
[00:22:38.800 --> 00:22:43.040]   and I'm gonna give up because I'm overwhelmed, right?
[00:22:43.040 --> 00:22:46.760]   But that's not what the Bible teaches us.
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.160]   It's not a posture of resignation where we just kinda quit.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.640]   The New Testament's clear that we are still
[00:22:53.640 --> 00:22:57.280]   supposed to be actively engaged in seeking to know God
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:58.600]   and seeking to draw near to him,
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.600]   seeking to surrender to his truth
[00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:02.800]   and seeking to obey the commands of scripture
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:04.240]   and glorify God in our lives.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.880]   So we're not just quitting,
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:13.120]   but we are cooperating with what he is doing in our life
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:16.200]   and allowing him to lead and depending on him
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:17.880]   and being honest with ourselves and saying,
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:20.600]   God, I can't make myself.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.200]   It's one of the interesting things about this passage,
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.400]   Genesis 2, seven, it gives us that origin story,
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:27.560]   that moment of formation,
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.080]   but the reality is God continues to form us
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:34.200]   throughout our lives, emotionally, spiritually.
[00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:35.480]   And if we're a follower of Jesus,
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.400]   if we're someone who by grace and through faith
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.880]   has put our trust in Christ,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:45.160]   then God is going to form us as a new creation
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:46.240]   into the image of Jesus.
[00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:48.880]   He's gonna make us look more and more like Jesus
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:52.080]   and that's an ongoing process throughout our life.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:53.880]   And so we're supposed to be engaged in that.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:55.360]   We're supposed to be surrendered to that.
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:23:57.840]   We're not supposed to just give up.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   Dependence is a posture of cooperation
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:04.200]   where I admit my limitations and my need
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:06.480]   and I rely on God's work in my life
[00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.240]   and I cooperate with all of my mind and my soul
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.200]   and my strength with what God is doing.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:15.320]   It's not giving up.
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.440]   Ephesians 2, 10 says,
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.720]   "For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:21.200]   "for good works, which God prepared beforehand
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:22.200]   "that we should walk in them."
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.600]   It's a beautiful verse.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.120]   And it tells us that God has some good stuff for us to do.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:30.920]   But who is the focus in that entire verse?
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.760]   God.
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:34.640]   We're his workmanship created in Christ Jesus,
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:36.680]   which God prepared beforehand.
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:40.120]   It's all about what he's doing, not about what we're doing.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.600]   There are good works that we're gonna do,
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:44.200]   but it's through relying on him.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:47.960]   And that means we're actively involved, but we're dependent.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:52.160]   One of the beautiful fruits of dependence
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.280]   is that it can give us peace.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:25:01.680]   As I said earlier, having limitations is not sin.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:04.640]   And understanding that we can't do it all
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.280]   is actually a very peaceful place to be.
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.160]   When we get to that point where we say, you know what?
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.160]   I'm not gonna be able to please everybody in my life.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:17.360]   I'm not gonna be able to commit to everything.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.400]   And instead, I'm gonna depend on God and say,
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.200]   God, what's really important for me here?
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.080]   What's important for me in this job?
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:25.000]   My boss keeps saying that I need to do this
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.200]   and meet these standards.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.760]   What do you have for me here?
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.560]   What am I supposed to be doing?
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.760]   And I'm gonna live into that.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:33.120]   That's a much more peaceful place
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.400]   than just trying to please all the people around you
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.380]   who are constantly saying, we wish you'd do this,
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.080]   we wish you'd do that, we want you to be more,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:40.280]   we want you to give more.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:44.640]   It's a peaceful place when we can say, you know what?
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.340]   I was involved in this at work,
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:47.820]   I was involved in this other thing,
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.780]   someone asked me to volunteer over here,
[00:25:51.780 --> 00:25:54.000]   but I can't do that all.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.940]   I can't do all that stuff because I'm a limited human.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.240]   I'm gonna seek God about what God wants me to do,
[00:25:59.240 --> 00:26:01.900]   and then I'm just gonna pick one thing,
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:02.980]   or I'm gonna pick two things,
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:05.180]   or I'm gonna pick three things.
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:08.360]   We have different capacities at different times in our life,
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:12.600]   but I'm gonna match what I'm doing to my capacity,
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.500]   and then I'm not gonna worry about the rest.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:18.180]   I'm gonna admit that I'm limited.
[00:26:18.180 --> 00:26:21.260]   That's a place of peace.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.860]   And those things change in time of life.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:29.220]   I remember when Justin and I got married,
[00:26:29.220 --> 00:26:31.780]   before we had kids, I was serving as a youth pastor,
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:34.420]   and we did a lot of stuff in ministry,
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:36.500]   'cause we had more time than we had kids,
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:37.700]   and when our kids were little,
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:40.420]   they just got dragged along to everything,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:43.860]   and did it all with us, and we still did quite a bit,
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:45.500]   but not as much as we had been doing,
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.460]   and as our kids have gotten older, that's changed.
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.340]   It's not that we're doing less,
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.740]   we're actually doing more than we ever did,
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.180]   but it's just in different ways.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.300]   We invest more in our kids,
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:26:58.660]   and we still invest a lot in ministry,
[00:26:58.660 --> 00:27:03.200]   but not as much as we used to,
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.020]   'cause I can't have it all.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:08.300]   I can't be the dad that God wants me to be,
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:13.060]   and also be the number one preacher guy
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:15.180]   who's putting out stuff all the time.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.060]   I couldn't be that guy anyway.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:19.420]   I'm not talented enough to be that guy in the first place,
[00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:21.460]   but even if I was trying to be that guy,
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:24.500]   I wouldn't have enough time to be the dad
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:26.460]   that God wants me to be, and so I have to choose.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:28.500]   I have to say, God, what is important?
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.820]   What do you want me to do?
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.900]   You want me to be a husband and a dad first,
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:33.620]   and so I'm gonna put my time there,
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:37.780]   and I'm gonna give the time that I can give to ministry,
[00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.300]   but I'm okay with the fact that there's some things
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:42.300]   I'm gonna say no to, and there's some things
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.540]   that other people are gonna say,
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.020]   you know, if you would do this,
[00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:47.540]   it would really work out great for you,
[00:27:47.540 --> 00:27:49.820]   and I'm gonna have to say, that's probably true,
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:52.020]   but I can't, I don't have enough time,
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:27:54.120]   because God's given me other things to do,
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.320]   and that's a part of our life.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.460]   Our capacity changes.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.680]   I'm older now than I used to be.
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.420]   I used to run a lot faster than I do, jump higher.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:07.420]   I played sports, all that stuff.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.300]   A few weeks ago, Zara, she's seven, she's sitting there.
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:12.640]   We were at the park about two weeks ago
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.220]   playing a little family baseball game on the Diamond,
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.700]   just kind of hitting the softball and running the bases,
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.940]   and I was playing with him and running,
[00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:24.300]   and she goes, "Dad, I've never seen you run that fast."
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.540]   (laughing)
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:30.900]   But it's true, I don't run nearly as fast as I used to,
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.740]   but I also don't run that much anymore,
[00:28:33.740 --> 00:28:36.340]   'cause it's a different time of life,
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.340]   and that's okay, that's a part of our limitations.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:40.420]   Aging is a part of our limitations.
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:43.080]   And just like I said earlier,
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:45.460]   our limitations are not sin, but they can lead us to sin.
[00:28:45.460 --> 00:28:48.420]   Some people in midlife, they hit that wall of aging,
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.460]   and they say, "No, I'm gonna fight against it,
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:53.260]   "and I'm gonna go out and blow all my family's money
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.480]   "on a new car, and I'm gonna leave my marriage
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:57.380]   "and do all this."
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.280]   It can lead us to sin, right?
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.320]   But if we're honest with our limitations, we say,
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:07.020]   "Hey, I'm not as fast as I used to be."
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.780]   Things are different now, that's okay,
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.620]   I'm gonna rely on God, and let him equip me
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.860]   to love the people in my life in different ways.
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.180]   Maybe I can't do all the things I used to do,
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.420]   but God can make different ways for me to minister
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:24.580]   and love and care for people.
[00:29:24.580 --> 00:29:27.820]   Then we can maintain health,
[00:29:27.820 --> 00:29:29.580]   and that's what's really important.
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.900]   Embracing our dependence gives us a lot of peace,
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:34.940]   when we're able to say, "You know what, I can't,
[00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.340]   "and that's okay."
[00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:38.380]   That's where God wants me to be.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:41.100]   Embracing our dependence gives us freedom,
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.340]   when we're able to say,
[00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:47.940]   "You know, that gap between the desire to have it all
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:50.900]   "that we feel and that the world tells us,
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.360]   "and then what we can actually achieve,
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.100]   "that gap can give us a lot of stress,
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.100]   "and a lot of anxiety and a lot of worry."
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.420]   When we realize, "Here's what I wanna do,
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.020]   "and here's what I expected that I was gonna be able to do,
[00:30:03.020 --> 00:30:05.820]   "and here's what I thought I was gonna be able to do,
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.040]   "and here's the reality of what I can achieve."
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.420]   As a limited person, with a certain number of hours a day
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:13.740]   that can be in one place at a time,
[00:30:13.740 --> 00:30:16.060]   this is really as far as I can get.
[00:30:16.060 --> 00:30:17.540]   And there's always a gap there.
[00:30:17.540 --> 00:30:20.300]   We always want more than we can get to.
[00:30:20.300 --> 00:30:21.660]   Every day is like that for me.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.140]   I'm a very optimistic person,
[00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:25.020]   so I start every day thinking I'm gonna get
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:28.900]   like 20 things done, and usually I get three to five.
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.800]   And sometimes, if I'm not relying on the Lord,
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.140]   I'll get really stressed, 'cause I'm like,
[00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:37.120]   "I didn't get 20 things done, and now what am I gonna do,
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.940]   "and now I've got so much to do tomorrow,"
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:42.140]   and I get full of stress and worry and anxiety.
[00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.420]   Embracing our dependence gives us freedom
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:45.820]   when we say, "You know what?
[00:30:45.820 --> 00:30:49.820]   "I can do what God enables me to do.
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:51.540]   "I'm gonna depend on Him to make sure
[00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.000]   "that I'm doing the right things,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.880]   "and the rest of it, I'm gonna let go of."
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:59.680]   There's a lot of freedom in that.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.020]   Even our mission in the church,
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.720]   to make disciples of all nations,
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.820]   way bigger than anything we could ever achieve
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:07.820]   on our own, right?
[00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:10.440]   That is such a huge mission.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:14.000]   We need to embrace our dependence on God and say,
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:15.680]   "God, yes, we want this.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:16.680]   "We wanna serve you.
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.520]   "We love you.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.640]   "We wanna be your people.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:19.920]   "We wanna make disciples.
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:22.020]   "We wanna reach our community."
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:23.100]   But we can't.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.980]   These obstacles are way bigger than we are.
[00:31:26.980 --> 00:31:28.440]   We need you to show up.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.900]   We need you to be at work.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:32.700]   And when we embrace our dependence on God,
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:35.140]   we're able to be free from the pressure
[00:31:35.140 --> 00:31:37.540]   of filling roles that were never ours to fill,
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.480]   trying to do things that we were never supposed to do
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.960]   in the first place.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:44.820]   We can be free from the stress and worry of anxiety,
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:47.920]   of carrying burdens that we were never supposed to carry.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.320]   Think about that in your life, in my life.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   Again, I'll speak about myself.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:55.020]   A lot of the times when I get stressed
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:56.220]   and anxious and worried,
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:32:00.700]   it's because I'm trying to, in some way, know the future.
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.500]   Was I ever supposed to know the future?
[00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.340]   No.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:04.180]   That's a human limitation.
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.060]   We do not have the ability to know the future.
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:08.300]   God does, but we don't.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:10.620]   So when I try to take that on,
[00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.180]   I'm definitely gonna get stressed out.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.540]   There's no way I can know the future.
[00:32:15.540 --> 00:32:17.760]   Or I try to control other people.
[00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:21.740]   Or I wanna have control over something like my health
[00:32:21.740 --> 00:32:23.480]   or someone else's health.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:27.700]   God never intended for me to have that ability.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.460]   And so if I'm taking that on,
[00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:34.820]   I'm just gonna stress myself out and frustrate myself.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.100]   There is freedom in just saying,
[00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.500]   God, this is a you thing.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:40.340]   This is not a me thing.
[00:32:40.340 --> 00:32:41.260]   I can't.
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:44.700]   You know, Matthew 11, 29 to 30 says this.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:47.220]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me,
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.940]   for I am gentle and lowly in heart,
[00:32:48.940 --> 00:32:50.560]   and you will find rest for your souls,
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:53.280]   for my yoke is easy and my burden is light.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.140]   Jesus said that.
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:56.380]   Now how could Jesus say that?
[00:32:56.380 --> 00:32:59.380]   How could he say his yoke is easy and his burden is light?
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.820]   'Cause this is the same Jesus that also said,
[00:33:01.820 --> 00:33:03.500]   if you wanna be my disciple,
[00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:06.660]   you have to take up a cross and follow me.
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:08.300]   This is the same Jesus that also said,
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.820]   in this world, you will have troubles.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:14.580]   So when Jesus said his yoke was easy and his burden was light
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.260]   he wasn't saying there's not gonna be any problems,
[00:33:18.260 --> 00:33:20.540]   there's no adversity if you follow me,
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.460]   it's smooth sailing for the rest of your days.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.600]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:28.740]   What he's saying is if you follow me and you do it right,
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.580]   the yoke is easy and the burden is light
[00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:34.240]   because you're not carrying it, he's gonna carry it.
[00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:36.860]   But for that to happen in our lives,
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.420]   we have to embrace our dependence on him.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:44.140]   And the last thing I wanna point us to
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:47.700]   is that embracing our witness is a dependence to others.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:50.620]   In a world that so values individualism
[00:33:50.620 --> 00:33:56.200]   and hustle and self-reliance,
[00:33:56.200 --> 00:33:59.260]   being someone who says, you know, I can't do it all,
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.700]   I need help of other people, I have to rely on God,
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:04.680]   that in and of itself is a witness,
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.900]   that in and of itself is counter-cultural,
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:08.180]   that in and of itself is something
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:09.500]   that people take notice of.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:12.300]   And they say, this person's different
[00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:14.860]   'cause everybody else is trying to do it all on their own
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:17.500]   and trying to project an image
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.820]   that they've got it all together.
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.060]   And so if we are willing to say, you know what,
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:23.940]   I don't have it all together,
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.320]   I actually need things in my life,
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.100]   I'm a dependent person, I'm a limited person,
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.560]   that's a witness to what God is doing.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:36.020]   Now earlier I said that God continues to form us
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:37.340]   throughout our lives.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.780]   In Jeremiah chapter 18, in the first four verses,
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.780]   there's this beautiful illustration of the potter
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.980]   that's forming the clay, right?
[00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.780]   And it talks about how the clay
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:51.940]   has to surrender to that process,
[00:34:51.940 --> 00:34:54.360]   embrace being formed by the potter.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.560]   The clay doesn't get to say to the potter,
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.500]   I think this is how you should mold me.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:02.540]   The potter is the one who is in control of that process.
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:07.460]   And that process of forming and shaping and removing,
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:09.860]   that's a painful process, right?
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:10.980]   Think about what happens.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:14.460]   The clay gets formed, it gets shaped,
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:17.300]   parts of it are chopped off, removed,
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.500]   and then what happens, if you know anything about pottery,
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:23.420]   what happens next is it goes in the fire.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:26.980]   And it gets heated really hot.
[00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.300]   And a lot of times it goes in the fire multiple times.
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:35.140]   But then what comes out on the other side
[00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:36.940]   is something that's beautiful,
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.220]   something that's valuable, something that's useful,
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.460]   and something that if it's really well made,
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:46.340]   it reflects the craftsmanship of the maker.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:50.880]   In our house we have some really nice, fine dinnerware
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.840]   that my wife's grandmother got us when we got married.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:57.140]   We never use it, but it's really pretty.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:36:00.480]   It sits in this hutch next to our dining room table.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:03.040]   And every time I look at it, I'm always amazed
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:04.920]   because it's so beautiful.
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:08.240]   The craftsmanship in it is really intricate and amazing.
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:10.620]   And I'm always kind of in awe of whoever made it
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:14.600]   because that's, I know I could not do that.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.260]   And that's what can happen in our lives.
[00:36:18.260 --> 00:36:21.640]   If we're willing to surrender to being dependent on God
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:23.640]   and our need for him and allowing him to form us
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:25.340]   and shape us and mold us,
[00:36:25.340 --> 00:36:28.560]   and even through taking us through difficult things
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:32.600]   like going in the fire, maybe even more than once,
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.940]   when we come out on the other side,
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.400]   there's something in us, in our life,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.540]   that's valuable and useful and beautiful,
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.520]   and it's glorifying to God.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.200]   And the people around us who observe it,
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:50.520]   they say, "Wow, that person is really different.
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.680]   "There's something really beautiful in their life
[00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:57.280]   "and something that testifies to someone else."
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.240]   That's another beautiful thing about dependence
[00:37:00.240 --> 00:37:03.160]   is when other people see it, they know it's not us.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.800]   They don't look at us and say,
[00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:06.100]   "All this stuff going on in your life
[00:37:06.100 --> 00:37:08.780]   "is because you're so great and you're so smart
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.440]   "and you're so tough and you hustle so hard."
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.600]   They have to look at our life and say,
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:18.360]   "There's something else going on here
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:21.000]   "'cause it's not you," right?
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:22.840]   And that's what we want.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.960]   We want to be in that place where we are reflecting
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:29.000]   God's work in our life, where we're dependent on him,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.760]   where we're experiencing the peace and freedom
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:32.200]   that comes from that,
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:34.960]   and that's a witness to the people around us.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.720]   And that only happens as we learn to embrace
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:42.420]   our need for God and the need for the people around us,
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.560]   that God created us with.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:46.200]   We are limited creations.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.760]   That's okay, God made us that way on purpose,
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:51.540]   and we need him, and he wants us to turn to him
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.440]   in our lives and to rely on him.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:54.260]   Let's pray.
[00:37:54.260 --> 00:38:00.320]   God, thank you so much for your truth
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:01.920]   and the way it speaks to us.
[00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:03.500]   There are times when it's tough to hear.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.480]   We don't always want to hear that we are dependent
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.960]   or that we have need.
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.880]   We'd rather just hear that we're great
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.580]   and that we have it all together.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.180]   But the reality is we do need you.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.260]   You formed us from dust, from nothing,
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:22.080]   and you breathed life and vitality and a soul into us.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.260]   But we did not make ourselves.
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:29.460]   You formed us, and you are still making us.
[00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:32.800]   And so God, please help us to embrace our need for you,
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:36.620]   to be honest with ourselves about our limitations
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.300]   and the fact that we can't do it all,
[00:38:39.300 --> 00:38:42.820]   to embrace the interdependence that you gave us
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:47.300]   in the church, the people around us that we need,
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:49.420]   to rely on you and others,
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:52.340]   to help us live into who you want us to be
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:54.420]   and who you've called us to be.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.380]   God, thank you that you are loving us
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:01.000]   and you are at work in our lives to form us and shape us
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.060]   into something that's way more beautiful
[00:39:04.060 --> 00:39:06.860]   than we could imagine or we ever would have planned for.
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:09.580]   And I pray that you would continue that
[00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:11.600]   even this week in our lives.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.200]   Give us comfort, give us peace, give us hope.
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.300]   Help us to rely on you.
