1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 And here's the announcement.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Let's welcome Pastor Mark for today's sermon.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 Welcome everyone.

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 And again, I want to remind you on your way out,

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,000
 there will be a table, there will be some products, CDs and media products featuring sun music.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 And please go pick it up. It's not free.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
 You have to pay for it.

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,000
 And I think it's worth for you to support a ministry like this, right?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:36,000
 To have strong and solid spiritual hymns and contemporary songs, worship songs, serving for the church.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:43,000
 And we want to praise God and thank God for using Brenda in the past many years and writing so many songs.

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,000
 And Cantonese songs or English songs or Mandarin songs, right?

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
 Mandarin songs. Wasn't it a beautiful song?

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
 What was it?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
 The Mandarin song I'm talking about. Yeah, the third one.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 Okay, those of you who don't know Chinese, it's okay.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
 It's still beautiful, right?

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,000
 It's still beautiful.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
 And we want a ministry like this to grow and to work with the church and support the church

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
 so that churches around the world can sing praises to our Lord, right?

20
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 Amen?

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,000
 So please do support the Sun Music ministry.

22
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,000
 By the way, they have a YouTube channel and go Google it.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,000
 Sun Music, S-O-N, Son of God, S-O-N, God's Son, Jesus Christ, S-O-N Music, okay?

24
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
 So go and subscribe, all right?

25
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
 Go and subscribe, please. Go and subscribe, all right?

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:42,000
 And support her ministry and it's really a bless to have her in the past weekend.

27
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,000
 And we got five people last night to come forward and made the decision to come to know Jesus.

28
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
 Amen to that, right?

29
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
 Thank God for that.

30
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,000
 And today, I know my time is very limited and I'll make it short.

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
 And I want to start with this question.

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,000
 It's a big question.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 I wonder if you read the Bible, you try to understand the Bible,

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:16,000
 have you ever asked yourself a question, "What does God really want?"

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,000
 What in the world does God desire the most?

36
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 You know, look at Genesis 1 to the last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22.

37
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 There was a theme underlying all of these books.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,000
 Now, there are 66 books in the Bible, 39 books in the Old Testament, and 27 books in the New Testament.

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
 But among all of the books from Genesis to Revelation,

40
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 there is an underlying central theme that runs through every single book, every single passage.

41
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 And what does God really want?

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,000
 And that theme that underlines and links every single thing together,

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
 one of those themes is that God wants to make His home among us.

44
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,000
 He wants to live among us, among His people.

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
 Whenever we worship, whenever the church gathers,

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:25,000
 we sing praises to the name of Jesus, we exalt the name of the Lord.

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 When we worship together, God lives among us.

48
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,000
 And that's one of the major themes underlying the entire Old Testament and New Testament, entire Bible.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:41,000
 Do you realize that even though there are 66 separate books in the collection,

50
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 what we call Bible, is actually a big story, a big narrative,

51
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
 big narrative to introduce to us who God really is.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 I want you to pay attention in the next five to seven minutes as I cut this sermon into a very condensed form.

53
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:08,000
 I want to give you a very, very quick summary.

54
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:16,000
 What the Bible is all about, what God really wants, is to live in your life.

55
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,000
 God wants to fill your life with His love, His joy, and His peace, and His kingdom.

56
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
 That's what God really wants. That is what God really desires.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:37,000
 God is not some kind of transcendent concept out there somewhere and doesn't care about you.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:43,000
 God cares about you deeply. God wants to make His home in your heart.

59
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:51,000
 And He wants to make His home in His people, in the churches, in all of God's people.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
 I want you to pay attention to three circles.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,000
 And these three circles is a very, very condensed summary of what the entire Bible is all about.

62
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:07,000
 And you ever use a napkin, a piece of napkin?

63
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 You can put the entire Bible on a piece of napkin.

64
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 This is a napkin theology, all right? Napkin theology.

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 You can just do it during lunch or during dinner.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:29,000
 On the dining table, take a piece of napkin, and you can summarize the entire, entire story of the Bible.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 And this three circles is, you have to imagine, the first circle is on your upper left,

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 is that God created this world good and orderly.

69
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:51,000
 God created everything, the entire cosmos, the entire universe, out of love.

70
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:57,000
 Do you realize that God is Trinity, right? Three persons in one God, right?

71
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 That's kind of interesting. That kind of defiles our logic, right?

72
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
 There is no way for us to wrap around what is going on.

73
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,000
 God is one, but He's also three. God is also three, but one, right?

74
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:17,000
 Isn't that interesting, right? But that is what God in His essence.

75
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 He is not a lone person. He is a community, one community, united together, and love one another.

76
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:30,000
 The Father loves the Son, and the Son loves the Spirit, and the Spirit loves the Son and the Father.

77
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,000
 And there's a mutual community of the God Himself.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
 God is three in one, Father, Son, and Spirit.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 How many of you have children? How many have children? Yeah.

80
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
 A few of you, yeah. You should understand, right?

81
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:58,000
 First, when we first gave birth to the first child, what did we do? What did we do?

82
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 We prepared the crib, we prepared the diapers, we prepared the bottles, we prepared everything.

83
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 And we set aside a room for her, and we set aside so many things, and put the child in your first priority.

84
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:20,000
 At least, you know, ten months or so before the birth of the child, right?

85
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
 And why do we do that?

86
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:32,000
 And you have to know, parents are doing this, not only they want to set up the physical space, the house.

87
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 God, parents, parents want to do a home.

88
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,000
 You know, house and home are different, right?

89
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
 We have some brothers and sisters moving around in the summer, in the past year,

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 moved from house one to another one, and they bought another house,

91
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,000
 or they rent another house and moved to another place.

92
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 Those of you who are students, you move out of your dormitory, and then move to another apartment,

93
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
 and then you move from here and there, right?

94
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
 Those are house stories, just physical space.

95
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,000
 Now, this is what's interesting to us, because we opened the Bible, Genesis 1.

96
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:21,000
 God created the heaven and the earth, the entire cosmos.

97
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,000
 And so often, we treat the story, Genesis 1, as a house story.

98
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:32,000
 We think that God is simply just creating all the physical structures, right?

99
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,000
 That's the planet Earth, and you've got different planets and different stars, and sun and moon, and all that stuff.

100
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,000
 It's all about material that we think about.

101
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
 But Genesis 1, the Bible tells us, is not a house story.

102
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
 Genesis 1 is a home story.

103
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 God wants to create humankind so that He can enter relationship with those created in His image.

104
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 That is not a house story.

105
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
 That's a relational story, right?

106
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,000
 Much like parents preparing the arrival of the child.

107
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,000
 You know what the child needs?

108
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:15,000
 It's not the physical space. It's not just that.

109
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,000
 It's not just buying stuff for him or her.

110
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
 It's the relationship.

111
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:28,000
 You want a child to be born in a home that is warm and welcoming.

112
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 That is, you find relationship in it, peace in it, love in it.

113
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,000
 That's what Genesis is all about.

114
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
 That's what God's creation is all about.

115
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,000
 God created you and me because He wants to enter into a relationship with us.

116
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 So that we can worship Him, and we'll be His people.

117
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
 And God's life will dwell among us.

118
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
 It will dwell in your heart.

119
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,000
 So God created everything good.

120
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:03,000
 And as you can tell, if you trace the entire story of the Bible, things didn't go well.

121
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,000
 Quickly, humankind rebelled against God.

122
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,000
 They want to say to God, "You are no longer God. I am the God."

123
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,000
 "We are the gods. We are the little gods. We are the bosses."

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 "And we take charge of our own life. You create it for us."

125
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
 "No, you don't be our God. We will be our own God."

126
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
 And that's why they were in exile.

127
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 And if you trace the entire story of the Bible,

128
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:34,000
 God is not giving up His desire to dwell among you.

129
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
 To dwell in your life.

130
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 You trace the story of Genesis, Exodus, and all that.

131
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 All the Old Testament books.

132
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,000
 God is trying to make His dwelling.

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,000
 God is trying to make His home in His people.

134
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:52,000
 So after Eden, you got Abraham.

135
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,000
 And God called Abraham out to form a nation out of him.

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,000
 So that through this nation, Israel, everyone in the world will be blessed.

137
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:07,000
 In the sense that everyone, every nation, will be brought back to God.

138
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 To His fellowship so that God can live among them.

139
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 So that when Israel was saved by grace from Egypt,

140
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,000
 God was telling them, "I'm going to walk with you."

141
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
 "I'm going to be present with you."

142
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,000
 "That's why I have my tabernacle among you."

143
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
 The book of Exodus.

144
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
 Chapter after chapter.

145
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
 Talking about how to build a tabernacle.

146
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,000
 A tabernacle is simply a portable tent.

147
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
 A portable home.

148
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 Because they were in wilderness for 40 years.

149
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
 And God said, "I'm going to be with you."

150
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
 "I'll be your God and you will be my people."

151
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 And then finally they arrived at the promised land.

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,000
 The book of Joshua.

153
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
 They settled down in the promised land and God fought the battles for them.

154
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 And let them settle down in His good land.

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 And finally, ultimately, they arrived at Jerusalem.

156
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:04,000
 And King David brought the Ark of the Covenant to the capital, Jerusalem.

157
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 And then his son, Solomon, built the first temple.

158
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,000
 And you read the account of the building and dedication of the first temple.

159
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
 You find that God's glory filled the earth.

160
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:22,000
 He filled the entire temple because God finally made His home in His people.

161
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:26,000
 It was so glorious and everybody saw His glory.

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
 And of course things didn't go well.

163
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 Soon after, the kingdom split.

164
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
 Right?

165
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
 And they abandoned God and they followed the false gods.

166
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
 They worshipped idols.

167
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,000
 And then finally they brought the end to their nation.

168
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
 So Israel was gone.

169
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 And then Judah was gone.

170
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 And then the entire people of God was in exile.

171
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
 However, God did not give up.

172
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
 God dwelt among the exiled people in Babylon.

173
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,000
 After 70 years of exile, they returned back to the land of promise.

174
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
 They returned to Jerusalem.

175
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 And God continued to dwell with them in the second temple.

176
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 And after decades and centuries, God finally showed up.

177
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
 It's Jesus.

178
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,000
 Jesus Christ, the Son of God.

179
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:25,000
 He came and dwelt in His people.

180
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 So that's the first circle.

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,000
 That's the first circle.

182
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:36,000
 And we sinned and we did rebellious things.

183
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 And we're going to set up ourselves as gods.

184
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
 And that's why the world has so much suffering.

185
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
 The world has so much brokenness.

186
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 I read an article not too long ago.

187
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,000
 It says in the 21st century, mental health has become a crisis and is on the rise.

188
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,000
 Now this is nothing new to you.

189
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 And the article tried to capture what is going on in our broken world because of sin.

190
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 The author said it's brokenness.

191
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,000
 You observe around our world, you see brokenness everywhere.

192
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,000
 Family is fragmented.

193
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 We live in an age, the author said, an age of alienation.

194
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,000
 We are aliens to one another.

195
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 We are separated. We are broken off from one another.

196
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:36,000
 And most of all, broken from God, our Creator.

197
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
 And that's why Jesus came.

198
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
 Jesus came and offered a way so that we can come back to the home of God,

199
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
 to the relationship of God.

200
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 And whosoever repent and whosoever believe in the name of Jesus,

201
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,000
 our life will be restored.

202
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 And that is what the gospel is all about.

203
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 And because of the gospel, we are recovered, we are reconciled with our Creator,

204
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
 the good home, the owner, the Lord of the home.

205
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 And that is what the gospel is.

206
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 Gospel of John 1.14

207
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 "So the Word became human and made His home among us.

208
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:24,000
 He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness.

209
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 And we have seen His glory, the glory of the Son of God,

210
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:33,000
 the glory of the Father's one and only Son."

211
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
 Pay attention to those words.

212
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 "The Word became human and made His home among us."

213
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,000
 By the way, the original text, the original language,

214
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:52,000
 "made His home among us" is actually tabernacle.

215
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:57,000
 He made His tent, His home in the midst of His people.

216
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 That is what the gospel is all about.

217
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:04,000
 If you yield to God, if you repent and return to God,

218
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 and say yes to God, then God will dwell in your life.

219
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 And you will see His glory.

220
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,000
 And the glory we see is on the cross.

221
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:21,000
 He came in humility and He died in your place.

222
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 The righteous one became sin for all of us.

223
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:30,000
 So that He could bear all the wounds and brokenness

224
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
 and all the sins on the cross.

225
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,000
 And by the cross we are redeemed.

226
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
 And that's what the gospel is all about.

227
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:43,000
 God wants to dwell in your life, to write His story in your life.

228
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,000
 Back in the 1960s, and I used this illustration last night.

229
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
 Back in the 1960s, the Russians,

230
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
 they were successful in sending a man to outer space.

231
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 So they sent a man on a rocket, and a man went to outer space,

232
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 and then returned.

233
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 So as the Russian returned, he talked to the news outlet.

234
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,000
 In the news conference, he said, "Oh, we have been to outer space,

235
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,000
 and we didn't find God, or we didn't find heaven.

236
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 So God does not exist."

237
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 That was his conclusion.

238
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 Or maybe God did exist, but He doesn't care about us anymore.

239
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
 He's not there anymore.

240
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:40,000
 So he made this news, this kind of conclusion in the news conference.

241
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,000
 Now back then in the 1970s, '60s, in England,

242
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:54,000
 there was a literature professor, a Christian theologian.

243
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,000
 His name is C.S. Lewis.

244
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 And C.S. Lewis has been a very good writer, a very creative writer.

245
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 And he responded to the Russian, and he said,

246
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 "So this guy being sent to outer space, and then returned,

247
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
 he said this guy is looking for God in the outer space.

248
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
 It's kind of like Hamlet looking for Shakespeare in his own world."

249
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 You know Hamlet and Shakespeare?

250
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
 How many of you have heard of Shakespeare?

251
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
 You did, right? Yeah.

252
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 How many of you read some of the works of Shakespeare?

253
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,000
 Okay, wow, you guys are really educated.

254
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 (Laughter)

255
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,000
 And one of the main characters in one of the plays

256
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 written by Shakespeare is Hamlet.

257
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
 It's a character full of life, right?

258
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,000
 A character inside the story of Hamlet,

259
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 and he had to make a lot of decisions, life and death,

260
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:55,000
 be or not to be, that's the question, that kind of thing, right?

261
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 He went through so much ordeal.

262
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
 And Hamlet, think about it, in the story of Hamlet,

263
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 in the world of Hamlet, he has no way to get to know Shakespeare.

264
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 Because if you read the entire story, the entire play of Hamlet,

265
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
 you won't find Shakespeare in Hamlet's story.

266
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 So C.S. Lewis was saying,

267
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 "If the guy, the Russian, went to outer space, and then returned,

268
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 he couldn't find God,

269
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
 it's kind of like Hamlet looking for Shakespeare in his own world."

270
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,000
 The only way Hamlet can get to know Shakespeare

271
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 is for the author himself to write himself his story

272
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,000
 into the story of Hamlet.

273
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
 That is the only way.

274
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:46,000
 That is the only way for the character to get to know the author

275
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 is for the author to take the initiative

276
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
 to write himself into his story.

277
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 You know, if you think about it, what C.S. Lewis has said,

278
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
 it's actually the gospel.

279
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 The gospel tells us God enters our world in Jesus

280
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,000
 and meets us where we are.

281
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:14,000
 He came to live among us, and God literally writes his story,

282
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 writes himself into your story.

283
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 Jesus is willing to humble himself to be known by you

284
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 so that you can have a relationship with God.

285
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,000
 And that's what God desired from the original plan.

286
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:35,000
 God's desire has always been to live among us

287
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,000
 so that we can worship him.

288
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:42,000
 John 1:14, "So the Word became flesh,

289
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 became human just like us, and made his own among us."

290
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:52,000
 I tell you, the world needs to see the glory of God.

291
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
 How do they see it?

292
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 See through you that the life of Jesus can live inside of you.

293
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 And the church has a lot we need to do.

294
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
 There are so many things we need to do together.

295
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 When we worship together, when we live in Christ together,

296
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 we learn how to love one another,

297
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,000
 we learn how to fellowship with one another,

298
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 to love each other as Christ loves us.

299
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:24,000
 In this community, then God will be shown.

300
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 Last night we had a sister, Lily.

301
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,000
 She was a devout Buddhist.

302
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,000
 And it's just amazing to hear her story again and again,

303
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 how she came to our church and how she came to know Christ

304
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 because of the community that live out the gospel.

305
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 And let's do that.

306
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
 When we worship, when we gather,

307
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 when we form a community in Christ,

308
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 Jesus lives among us and God made his home in the midst of us.

309
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
 Let's all pray together.

310
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 And I ask the praise team to come here to sing the last song as a response.

311
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:12,000
 Father, we give you thanks because of your desire to be with us.

312
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 And you humble yourself in your son, Jesus Christ,

313
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
 to write yourself in our story.

314
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Thank you for being our living God.

315
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 May our community continue to display your glory,

316
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,000
 to tell the world that you are real,

317
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
 to tell the world that you are in our midst.

318
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
 Thank you. In Jesus' name, amen.

319
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:47,000
