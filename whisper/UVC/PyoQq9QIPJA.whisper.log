[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Welcome to the first of this series called Mapping the Bible.
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.040]   Now this is a special series I've always wanted to do,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.000]   to use Google Earth, videos, pictures, and different visuals
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.120]   to help us travel to the land of the Bible
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.440]   so we can appreciate, we can hear the messages of the Bible.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.240]   You can see in my background,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.960]   we are right above in the air of the land of Israel,
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.740]   the Bible land.
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.720]   Now of course the best ways to go about studying the land
[00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.840]   and how it relates to the messages of the Bible
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.940]   is to go to Israel yourself, right?
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.640]   To study the land, to walk on the ground,
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700]   to experience yourself.
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.320]   If you do that, I can almost guarantee you,
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.360]   you will see the Bible in a totally different new way.
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.400]   But we are still in the pandemic
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.480]   and international travel is such a hassle.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.560]   So we cannot do that easily.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.320]   However, we can use technology like Google Earth
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.700]   to help us out.
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.360]   Now you may think immediately,
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.680]   why do we need to study the land of the Bible?
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.600]   Can we just get to know God and read scripture directly?
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.160]   Why do we need to travel to the land of Israel, Palestine
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.880]   in order to get a better understanding of the word, right?
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.320]   Now I believe understanding the Bible,
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.720]   our faith has so much in common with traveling.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:21.800]   Now think about it.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.240]   Every time you open the pages of scripture,
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.500]   you turn to the word of God.
[00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.580]   You should recognize there is huge difference
[00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.340]   between our culture and the culture
[00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.500]   of the Old Testament and New Testament, right?
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.140]   In fact, the original languages of the Bible,
[00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.940]   even though translated into modern languages
[00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.720]   were in classical Hebrew, not modern Hebrew,
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.860]   classical Hebrew, some Aramaic in the Old Testament
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.940]   and the New Testament was written in Greek.
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.540]   So on top of linguistic language differences,
[00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.540]   our world and the biblical world are quite different
[00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.440]   in terms of cultural values, right?
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.540]   Customs and all that.
[00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.960]   We're not saying the Bible was simply a product
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.660]   of ancient culture, trapped in the ancient time.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.860]   We're not trying to suggest that,
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.340]   but we need to understand when God reveals himself
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.380]   through scripture, God communicates in ways
[00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.340]   that are intelligent to the ancient audience
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.520]   using their languages, using their metaphors,
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.020]   using their images or their cultures.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.820]   So in order for us to get a better understanding
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.660]   what scripture says or what scripture may mean to us today,
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.220]   we need to take a step back and kind of time travel
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.780]   to understand, to learn about how the first audience,
[00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.840]   the ancient Israelites received the messages, right?
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.860]   Now, somewhat like traveling to a foreign place,
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.660]   a foreign culture, a foreign country,
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.480]   different from our own.
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.520]   We first need to get some basic understanding
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.960]   of that culture, right?
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.340]   The history, the geography of that place,
[00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.040]   how those people live in that region and all that.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.400]   We may get those information from a guidebook
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.400]   like Lonely Planet or find information off the internet.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.960]   So now think about it.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   Every Bible reading, every time we think about the scripture
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.420]   is actually a cross-cultural activity.
[00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.660]   Now let me begin with Psalm 125, verses one and two.
[00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.460]   Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion,
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:33.100]   which cannot be shaken but endures forever.
[00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.300]   As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.580]   so the Lord surround his people now and forevermore.
[00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.940]   Then the Psalm talks about God granting peace and security
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.460]   to those who are committed to the way of God,
[00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:49.480]   contrasting the wicked whose way will perish.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.560]   But how do we understand the words,
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.640]   as the mountains surround Jerusalem?
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:00.440]   Now I am zooming into the Old City of Jerusalem.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.880]   The yellow line you see on the map
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.800]   outlines the current Old City wall of Jerusalem.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.240]   The city wall dates back to the Ottoman period.
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.240]   South of the Old City is the long, narrow Eastern Hill.
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.660]   This is where the Bible refers to as City of David,
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.420]   Mount Zion, ancient Jerusalem.
[00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.860]   Now if we are standing on the Eastern Hill,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:27.940]   on an elevated point on the City of David,
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.620]   and take a 360 degree roundabout look,
[00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:34.860]   you will be able to appreciate Psalm 125.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.060]   So we're looking north now.
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:42.060]   We see the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Temple Mount in front of us.
[00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.360]   Notice the elevation is higher than where we are,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.040]   the City of David.
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.440]   Now turn a little bit to the right,
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.560]   northeast is Mount of Olives.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.520]   Elevation again is higher.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.320]   Continue to the east, we see the Palestinian village,
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.920]   Silwan, on the foothill.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.560]   Now looking south, we see a mountain range.
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.620]   This is the southern approach to Jerusalem.
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.980]   On top of the hill is the United Nations Headquarters.
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.040]   Again, the elevation is higher
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.280]   than where we are standing now.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.080]   Below us, there are some archeological remains.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.000]   They date back to the pre-Israelite,
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.160]   Canaanite, Jebusite period,
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.320]   called the Step Stone Structure.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   Now southwesterly, we see a high hill called Western Hill.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.480]   On top of it is the Catholic Church Domitian Abbey.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.260]   Now continue turning back to where we started,
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.220]   we see the Temple Mount again.
[00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.660]   Now you should be able to appreciate
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.660]   the mountains surrounding us is hugging Jerusalem.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.260]   It's the City of David, right?
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.260]   Being surrounded by higher, elevated mountain range.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:04.580]   So this psalm attributed to King David,
[00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.980]   but whoever wrote this psalm originally
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.540]   has to be someone who is familiar
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.720]   with the local physical settings of Jerusalem, right?
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:14.180]   Otherwise, he would not be able
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:16.100]   to write something like that.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.100]   The psalmist is using local geographical terrain features
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.100]   to talk about something beyond geography,
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:29.120]   talks about theology, talks about faith, right?
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:32.720]   If we put our trust in God, look around you, right?
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.920]   Just like the Lord Yahweh will surround Jerusalem
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.340]   and protect Jerusalem,
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.060]   just like the mountains are protecting it, right?
[00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:45.060]   If we put our trust in God, the Lord God will protect us,
[00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.280]   will grant us security, will grant us peace.
[00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:50.860]   (gentle music)
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:53.440]   (gentle music)
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.020]   (gentle music)
[00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:58.600]   (gentle music)
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.180]   (gentle music)
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:03.760]   (gentle music)
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.000]   (gentle music)
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.880]   Now continue with our orientation of the land.
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:12.240]   This land of the Bible has many different names and labels.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.340]   Sometimes it is called Israel, sometimes called Palestine,
[00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:20.080]   and Palestine was a name given by the Roman emperor
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.480]   after the defeat of second Jewish revolt
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.880]   in the second century AD.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:28.040]   The Old Testament also has different names and labels
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.720]   to describe this land.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:32.640]   Land of Canaan, the promised land,
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:36.040]   land flowing with milk and honey,
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.200]   and many call this land the Holy Land today.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.200]   It is a religious symbol, a religious label.
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.340]   And yes, this is a sacred place
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:50.960]   because it is a sacred home of three different
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:54.840]   major monotheistic faiths, Judaism, Islam,
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:57.080]   and Christianity, of course.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:01.440]   And some still call it Near East or Middle East.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.400]   Why?
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:07.400]   Well, about 200 years ago in the 19th century,
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:10.200]   from the perspective of the European powers,
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.860]   this region is, of course, the East, right?
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.160]   Now, back then, it was under the control
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:18.440]   of the Ottoman Empire.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.400]   At the end of 19th century,
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:27.000]   the first Sino-Japanese War broke out far away from Europe.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.480]   And then the Ottoman Empire,
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:34.740]   which lasts for about 400 plus years, started to crumble.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:39.740]   So to the Westerners, to the Western European powers,
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:44.140]   there were two different Eastern problems, right?
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.560]   There were two regions in the East
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:49.620]   that have some political struggles.
[00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.500]   One was the Far East.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:56.340]   The Near One is naturally called Near East.
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:00.140]   Now, then in the 20th century,
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.380]   the Western countries recognized that the region
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:07.260]   of Persian Gulf and India was strategic
[00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:08.980]   to their political interests.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:12.440]   So people started using terms like Middle East
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:15.100]   to describe Persian Gulf.
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.260]   And then as times go by,
[00:09:18.260 --> 00:09:23.260]   because Palestine is connected to Persian Gulf and beyond,
[00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:28.040]   the definition of Middle East enlarges
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:30.820]   to include the regions between Persian Gulf
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:34.020]   all the way to the Mediterranean Sea.
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:38.100]   So yes, the land of the Bible has many different names,
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.660]   but one thing remains constant.
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.660]   It is the geographical dynamics, the geographical feature.
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:49.140]   This is a land connecting three different continents.
[00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:54.140]   As you can see, Africa, Asia, and Asia Minor in Europe.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:10:00.260]   It is the center, the land bridge of the ancient world.
[00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:05.940]   It's a springboard, right, to go from one region to another.
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:08.300]   It's a place where people are connected,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.660]   a place where people come and go all the time.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:15.660]   Now, with this geographical perspective,
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:19.340]   I would like to suggest with some biblical geographers
[00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:24.340]   would say this land is appropriately described
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.520]   as the land between.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.200]   It's always the land between,
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.000]   people come and go all the time.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.380]   And the best way, the best value of this land
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:37.380]   is not to build an earthly empire, but to communicate,
[00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:43.460]   to tell the world a message, to broadcast a message.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:49.820]   A Bible geographer rightly says,
[00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.820]   this land, the best value is to build a podium.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.260]   It is to communicate.
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.900]   So if you think about it,
[00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:03.380]   isn't that why God would choose this land
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.940]   to begin his redemptive program?
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:11.260]   Isn't that why God would place his people
[00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:16.260]   to start his redemptive purpose in this place, right?
[00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:23.820]   Now let's look at a second passage today, Deuteronomy 11,
[00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.860]   Deuteronomy chapter 11.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:28.740]   Now the book of Deuteronomy was the sermons
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.940]   of the servant of the Lord, Moses.
[00:11:31.940 --> 00:11:35.500]   When Moses was standing in the east side of River Jordan,
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:38.540]   he was not allowed to enter Canaan,
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.540]   but he is called by God to tell the Israelites,
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.820]   the next generation, as they go into Canaan,
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.480]   they have to pay attention to a few different things.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.100]   Chapter 11, verses eight and following,
[00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:57.580]   "Observe, obey all the commands I am giving you today,"
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:12:00.100]   Moses said to the Israelites,
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:02.980]   "so that you may have the strength to go in
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:05.580]   "and take over the land that you are crossing
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.380]   "the Jordan to possess."
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:10.780]   Verse 10, "The land you are entering to take over
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:15.780]   "is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come,
[00:12:15.780 --> 00:12:18.880]   "where you plant your seed in Egypt
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.100]   "and irrigated it by foot as in a garden,
[00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.940]   "a vegetable garden."
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.900]   Verse 11, "But the land, the land of Canaan,
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.300]   "you are crossing the Jordan to take possession of
[00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:34.500]   "is the land of mountains and valleys
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.380]   "that drinks rain from heaven.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.020]   "It is the land the Lord your God cares for.
[00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:44.780]   "The eyes of the Lord your God are continually on it
[00:12:44.780 --> 00:12:49.020]   "from the beginning of the year to its end."
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:53.560]   13, "So if you are faithfully obeying the commands
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.700]   "I'm giving you today to love the Lord your God,
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.940]   "to serve him wholeheartedly,
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.860]   "then I will send rain," God says, "on your land.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.160]   "I will send rain on your land in this season,
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.280]   "in this right timing.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.020]   "Autumn and spring rains will be sent to you
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:09.660]   "and you may gather in your grain,
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.400]   "your harvest, your new wine, and your oil.
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.240]   "I will provide grass in the fields
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:16.860]   "for your cattle, for your flock,
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:19.620]   "and you will eat and be satisfied."
[00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.020]   Now think about this passage.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:25.000]   This passage is full of geographical details.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.960]   Look at the land of Canaan.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.120]   It is totally different from Egypt, right?
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:34.120]   Egypt, the delta, is flat with all the branches of Nile,
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:37.400]   because the Nile will flood annually,
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.760]   constantly supplying water to farmer.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.320]   It is not like Egypt.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.940]   Canaan is not like Egypt.
[00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:49.800]   Nor is it like Mesopotamia,
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:54.040]   where you got two big rivers, Tigris and Euphrates.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:57.960]   The land of Canaan has no big river.
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.960]   The biggest river you can find is the Jordan River, right?
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.440]   But it is very small.
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:08.680]   It flows through the dry and thirsty land
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:13.080]   of the wilderness of the Jordan River Valley.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:16.740]   So there's not much use of it in terms of farming.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:20.520]   So in order to survive in this land,
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.600]   Deuteronomy says you need to understand
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:26.140]   this is different geographically from Egypt,
[00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:27.680]   where you come from.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.680]   In Canaan, you have to depend on rain from heaven.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.520]   Around the rainy season of October and November,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:39.200]   rain clouds will move from west to east, all right?
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   Rain clouds will bring in water to water the land,
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.560]   so you can farm, you can harvest,
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:49.800]   you will have food to eat.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:52.320]   But when rain is not enough,
[00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:55.400]   is when rain is not sufficient,
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.420]   you get drought and famine.
[00:14:58.420 --> 00:15:00.700]   So the book of Deuteronomy says
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:04.420]   you have nothing to depend on in the land of Canaan,
[00:15:04.420 --> 00:15:06.360]   but God who controls the rain,
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.600]   the God who sends rains at the right time.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.160]   You got to depend on God, you got to trust in him.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:16.360]   You do not turn away from the God of heaven,
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.640]   to the idols, to other false gods in the land of Canaan,
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.480]   be it Baal, the storm god, or any other false god.
[00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:28.680]   You got to trust in God, you got to focus on him.
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:32.860]   Only Yahweh the Lord you can trust, and he will send rain.
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:37.860]   So you think about it, to survive in this land is difficult.
[00:15:37.860 --> 00:15:40.000]   It is not an easy land.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.840]   It is never a paradise.
[00:15:42.840 --> 00:15:46.200]   And God settles his people in this land
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.040]   to teach them, to train them.
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:53.320]   The land must wait for God to open the heaven and water.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:58.920]   The land is a spiritual classroom,
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:03.520]   a spiritual mentor, to train the faith of God's people,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.160]   to teach them, to discipline them,
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:09.520]   to fix their eyes on God the creator alone.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.100]   (gentle music)
[00:16:12.300 --> 00:16:14.880]   (gentle music)
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:28.980]   - Now, isn't that true for most of our life journey
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.940]   as we follow Christ?
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:35.940]   What COVID has taught us is that life is full of crises,
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:40.560]   challenges, temptations, and trials,
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.660]   and all those tough situations can happen to us,
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:48.460]   every single one of us, unexpectedly, suddenly.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:52.620]   We will be hit by a storm, right?
[00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:55.980]   And faith in the Bible has always been faith
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:58.520]   in the midst of difficulties.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:01.180]   Never easy.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.500]   But following Christ is like that, right?
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:10.300]   God put us in a spiritual classroom for a good purpose.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:14.340]   In all these difficulties and all these challenges,
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:18.580]   pandemic included, God has a good purpose.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:21.380]   It's a life-giving purpose.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:25.620]   The purpose is to draw us closer and closer to him.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:28.900]   So when we face difficulty, when we face challenges
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:31.140]   or uncertainties in our futures,
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:35.260]   whether we are going to school, determining our future,
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:40.260]   whether we hit rock bottom in our career,
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:44.540]   remember that God is mentoring us.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:48.140]   Like living in the land of Canaan,
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:49.540]   we have to depend on him.
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:51.420]   We have to trust in him.
[00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:54.260]   And knowing that God is always with us,
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:56.820]   God is always trustworthy.
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:59.620]   Let me close by reading Psalm 125 again.
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:02.620]   Psalm 125.
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.500]   "Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion,
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:11.580]   "which cannot be shaken, but endures forever.
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.260]   "As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
[00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:17.620]   "so the Lord surround his people,
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.940]   "both now and forevermore."
[00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:21.980]   Let's pray together.
[00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:25.620]   Father, we give you thanks
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.180]   for all the experiences that we have.
[00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:34.060]   You put us in a spiritual classroom to train our faith,
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:37.940]   to pray to you, to depend on you,
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.740]   knowing that you are the faithful God
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.220]   who always cares for us.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.220]   Thank you for the lands of Canaan that we experience now.
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:52.300]   No matter what challenges we are facing,
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:54.660]   trials and temptations,
[00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:59.460]   we pray that we will continue to fix our eyes on you,
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:04.460]   to follow you, to commit our lives to trust in you.
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.980]   And pray that you will strengthen our faith.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.020]   And as we do so, we draw closer and closer to you.
[00:19:11.020 --> 00:19:13.460]   In Christ, we pray.
[00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:14.300]   Amen.
