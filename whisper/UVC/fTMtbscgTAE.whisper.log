[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   All right, we continue our series on worship.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.920]   And I think we need to understand what worship is all about.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.920]   And I need to, we need to come before the word of God
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.120]   because the word of God is our final standard.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.640]   It's the highest standard for our belief and our practice.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.720]   Ask questions as someone who is in Christ.
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.840]   I want to know what worship is all about.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.240]   Is it just about attending an hour of program
[00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.240]   to go through the motions and to just sing some songs
[00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.200]   and spend an hour and then I'll just check out,
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.520]   and then I'll go home.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.640]   Is it what worship is all about?
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.640]   So let me begin today with this main question.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.600]   This question is how can we become better worshipers?
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.320]   Or I should say, how can we be worshipers
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.920]   who are pleasing to God?
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.040]   How can we do that?
[00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.200]   So let's take a moment and talk to your neighbor,
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.640]   if you can.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.800]   How can we be better worshipers
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.800]   or worshipers that will please God?
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800]   All right, think about it.
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.760]   What would be your answers?
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.040]   What would be your answers?
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.600]   Now, sometimes when we approach questions like this,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.720]   or some of the Christian practice
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.440]   revealed to us in scripture,
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.400]   sometimes we approach questions like this,
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.920]   like we approach our boss.
[00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.800]   I'll talk to some of you,
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.060]   and some of you are working from home.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.960]   And someone share a secret,
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.040]   because working from home,
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.960]   and you have to turn on Microsoft Team
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.600]   or Zoom or the online platform,
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.560]   and your boss has to know that you are present.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.120]   And some of you have a smart way to fake your presence,
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.200]   you know, to get your, some sort of software.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.760]   I don't know about this, but until someone told me.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.560]   You can actually buy a software and install a software,
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.640]   and then mechanically remove the mouse from time to time,
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.480]   and just fake your presence in the online meeting.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.600]   And that's a very, very wise way to do it.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.360]   I would say this is beyond my wisdom.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.240]   But, you know, is that all God cares about, right?
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.560]   I mean, do we treat God as our boss?
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.680]   You know, our boss simply, you know,
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.360]   want us to check in, right?
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.040]   Clock in and clock out.
[00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.840]   Want your time, right?
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.040]   And then we just fake our presence, right?
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.960]   Is that what God care about?
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.120]   What does God really care about, right?
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.880]   In this series, we say that in scripture,
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.240]   God is revealing to us who he is and what he does.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.200]   From creation to new creation,
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.840]   what God really care about is that he will live among us.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.840]   He will be our God and we will be his people.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.920]   And that's what worship is all about.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.240]   It's not about clock in and clock out.
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.880]   Okay, I just check this.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:12.640]   Okay, I've done this for this week,
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.160]   and I'll get worship done, and I'll sing some songs to God,
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.120]   and that's it, and I'll go my way, right?
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.720]   Is that what God really care about?
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.280]   God cares about his presence with us,
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.400]   his relationship with us.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.880]   Your boss will not care about his relationship with you,
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.720]   right?
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.920]   That's why, you know, it is legitimate to think about
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.960]   how to fake your presence, right?
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.000]   Because all your boss cares about is your productivity,
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.200]   right?
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.840]   Squeeze you in some way that use you, right?
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.160]   Use you for productivity, for profit.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   But God cares about his relationship with us.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.200]   And that's what it means when we believe in Jesus Christ.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.800]   It's not about do's and don'ts.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.560]   It's about our relationship with Christ.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.880]   I was talking to someone, his friend,
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.360]   is a very devoted Catholic.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.560]   And he was sharing with me,
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.720]   oh no, his friend is not willing to come to church.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:23.280]   Going to church is not just part of his friend's agenda.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.880]   Because as a Catholic, a lot of Catholics are like this.
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.520]   And of course, a lot of Christians are like this.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.560]   A lot of evangelical Christians are like that.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.600]   No, a lot of Catholics are, you know,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.760]   when they approach faith, when they approach God,
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.600]   it's a cultural thing, right?
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.800]   Because my father and my mother were devout Catholics,
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.560]   so that's why I am Catholic.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.440]   And that's part of my cultural identity.
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.000]   And if you ask a devout Catholic,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.280]   so often you get the answer is that,
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.640]   of course I am a Catholic, right?
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.520]   Now Catholic in the sense of cultural identity, right?
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.160]   It's not really a personal encounter
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.680]   or personal intimate relationship with God.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.920]   And that's what many, many Catholics are lacking.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.480]   And I'm not trying to mention,
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.480]   but many, many Christians are like this too.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.880]   Many Bible-believing Christians are like that.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.440]   The kind of a cultural identity,
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.160]   kind of, you know, attack on an app in your phone, right?
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.080]   And you never use it.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.420]   You got some apps in your phone, right?
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.400]   On your phone, installed, but you never touch it.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.800]   You never use it, right?
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.480]   In case you need it, and then you click on it, right?
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.400]   It's not just part of your system.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.680]   It's not, right?
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.480]   Many of us approach worship, approach God in that sense.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:46.880]   And we lost what really God care,
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.560]   what God really care about.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.840]   He care about His relationship with us.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.840]   So therefore in the entire Bible,
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.820]   from creation to new creation,
[00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:58.480]   from the first chapter to the last chapter,
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.080]   it's all about worship.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.400]   In some sense, everything is about worship.
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.320]   Everything is about God living in you,
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.880]   and you live in God.
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:09.280]   Everything is about you and God relationship.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.820]   So we talk about creation.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:13.200]   The Bible is a grand story.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.520]   And even though we rebel against God,
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.380]   that's Genesis chapter three,
[00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.380]   but God is not abandoning the fallen world
[00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.520]   to rebel against mankind.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   God chooses to redeem them and to live among them.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.020]   And therefore He saved the Israelites out of Egypt
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.580]   by grace, and then live among them in the form of tabernacle,
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.220]   the tent of Portable Temple,
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.500]   and living with them and guiding their way
[00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:45.980]   through wilderness.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:48.380]   And then once they settle down in the land of Canaan,
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.440]   the promised land, God is dwelling with them
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:53.860]   in a stone temple, right?
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.060]   And as times go by, we know that all of this
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:59.860]   Old Testament symbols are pointing forward
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:01.780]   to Christ Jesus, our Lord.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.540]   And Christ came and Jesus came and died on the cross
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.620]   to redeem His people and rose from the dead
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:07.820]   and gave us hope.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.540]   And in Christ now, we worship, not in the stone temple,
[00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:14.980]   not in the tabernacle, because everything points
[00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.500]   to the reality of Christ.
[00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:17.940]   So in Christ we worship.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:21.420]   In Christ we encounter God,
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.340]   and we build our relationship with Him.
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:29.340]   Until someday in eternity, when new heaven and new earth
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:34.260]   came down in the midst of us, and God lives among us,
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.340]   and that is what we call heaven,
[00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:39.540]   or should we call new creation, new heaven and new earth.
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:42.060]   So the entire story of the Bible tells us
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:45.540]   it's all about His relationship with us,
[00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.860]   and that's what worship is all about.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:49.380]   Now, as we come to the New Testament,
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.540]   we find that there were a lot of teachings about worship
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:54.540]   and what worship is all about.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:58.560]   Acts chapter two describes the early church,
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:02.140]   the first generation Christians, what they do in worship.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.060]   All the believers devote themselves to the teachings
[00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.020]   of the apostles and fellowship,
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:09.300]   sharing in meals and to prayer.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.180]   A deep sense of awe came over them all,
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:16.580]   and the apostles performed many signs and wonders,
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.980]   and all the believers, all the disciples met together
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.860]   in one place and shared everything they had.
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:23.420]   All the while, they praised God
[00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:26.140]   and enjoyed the goodwill of the people.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.560]   Now, from this short passage, we can see
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.060]   worship is a priority.
[00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.480]   It's a priority for the tiny Christian movement
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.920]   in the beginning.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.920]   They gather together in homes,
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:42.040]   you know, house churches, what we call,
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:44.960]   and worship is always a priority, not an option.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.040]   And then worship is about a corporate community
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.640]   getting together, fellowship,
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.080]   face-to-face, sharing with one another,
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.900]   and they practice generosity.
[00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.420]   They give, right?
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:01.140]   Voluntarily, they give their resources
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.860]   to build up the church, the community.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:07.800]   And worship is also a puppet weakness to the world,
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.740]   enjoying the goodwill of all the people,
[00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:14.340]   all the neighbors, all the people, not just the believers.
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.940]   And because when they see them worshiping together,
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.420]   when they see them gathering together,
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:23.580]   there is a function, or there is a power
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:28.580]   of outreaching missional, being missional in worship.
[00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:32.380]   You know, when people come into our gathering,
[00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:38.900]   they hear us praising God, they hear us worshiping God.
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:44.960]   What should happen is that they will sense
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:47.760]   that this is a different community,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.640]   a different community that I cannot find
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.880]   in the rest of the world.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:55.680]   Someone pointed to me sometimes
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.820]   on some worship songs on YouTube,
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:01.840]   and there were people who comment,
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.840]   you know, comment below a certain video
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.840]   or a certain worship song.
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.000]   And some of the comments are really interesting.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.120]   And some of the comments, let me read that.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:12.480]   Some of the comments reads,
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:18.220]   "I am not a Christian, but I am touched by the music.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.400]   "I don't know this song,
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.520]   "but I'm touched by the message of the song."
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.160]   Now that's what worship should do, ultimately.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.520]   It is going out, right, reaching out to other people
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.560]   so that people can understand our music
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.320]   and understand what we are doing,
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.800]   and they sense there's something different,
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:40.900]   you know, in the midst of Christian worship.
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:45.900]   So today I would like to turn to one of the passages
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.680]   in the New Testament that talks about worship.
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.040]   And that is 1 Corinthians chapter 14.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:56.080]   As you know, the entire letter of Corinthians
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.420]   is a corrective letter.
[00:10:58.420 --> 00:11:01.960]   It means that the pastor, the apostle Paul,
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.800]   he writes the letter to correct some of the misbehavior
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:09.820]   and misbelief amongst the house churches,
[00:11:09.820 --> 00:11:12.080]   tiny house churches in Corinth.
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.900]   And there were many, many problems in the churches,
[00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:19.640]   or the house churches in Corinth.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.240]   Division, they have a lawsuit against one another,
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.560]   they have sexual immorality,
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:27.680]   idle food controversies, and all that.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.120]   So the entire letter is trying to correct one problem
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.600]   after the other.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   In 1 Corinthians 14, actually from 12 to 14,
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:39.900]   Paul is addressing problems in the worship,
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:43.340]   in the corporate gathering.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.960]   And in chapter 14, there were two parts.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:50.340]   First of all, Paul is talking about the difference
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:55.200]   between prophecy and tongues, speaking in tongues.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.720]   And the second part of this chapter,
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:01.560]   he talks about your worship is a witness to other people.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:04.220]   So let's break this down and try to understand
[00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:05.880]   what is going on here.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:07.180]   Chapter 14, verse one.
[00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:12.640]   Paul said, "Let love be your highest priority, highest goal,
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:15.280]   "but you should also desire the special gift
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.000]   "or special abilities," by the way,
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.560]   this is New Living Translation,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.240]   which is easier to understand.
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.600]   "Special abilities that the Spirit gives,
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:26.540]   "especially the ability or the spiritual gift to prophesy.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:29.820]   "For one who speaks in a tongue
[00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:32.920]   "speaks not to men, but to God.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:35.120]   "For no one understands him,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.580]   "but he utters mysteries in the Spirit."
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:42.360]   Now what is he talking about?
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:45.800]   Now, first of all, what is tongue?
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.820]   What is speaking in tongue?
[00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:48.660]   What is speaking in tongue?
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.760]   I'm not sure you have heard, maybe you have,
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:55.160]   you have heard someone speaking in tongue, right?
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:57.280]   Yeah, when I was in seminary, my first seminary
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.760]   was Westminster Theological Seminary in California.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.440]   And I lived with three other roommates, they are Koreans.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.420]   And one of those guys, in the same age,
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:11.920]   when I was really young, right, 20 something.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:13.920]   And then we lived together, four of us.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.060]   And one of my roommate, Korean roommates,
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.900]   he speaks in tongue, every morning.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.600]   He opened the Bible in his room,
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:26.320]   he does his devotional, and he will pray.
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:30.800]   And he will pray in some sort of unknown language, right?
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.260]   Of course, I don't know Korean, right?
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.720]   I'm not sure he was praying in Korean.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:41.600]   So sometimes I ask him, "Hey, you're praying, right?
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.400]   "What kind of language are you praying?"
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:48.280]   Because it's different from normal conversation,
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:50.680]   normal speaking of Korean.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.320]   So I ask him, "What kind of language are you speaking?"
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.440]   "No," he said, "I'm speaking in tongue."
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:58.440]   Some sort of mysterious, unknown language
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:02.480]   that only he and God understand, right?
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.360]   There's some sort of intimate language
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.360]   that only God and him would communicate, right?
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.360]   This is kind of like, you know,
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.400]   when you hear intimate couple talking to each other,
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:24.280]   you don't understand what they're saying.
[00:14:24.280 --> 00:14:26.120]   But they're talking, right?
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:29.160]   I remember one time I was in a church conference in Texas.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.000]   I was all by myself, right?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.480]   I went to a restaurant and I ordered my entree
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   and I was enjoying my dinner.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.600]   And next to me, at the other table,
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.760]   was a dating couple, I guess, right?
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:43.880]   They're pretty young and obviously
[00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:46.200]   they're in love with each other.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:49.760]   You know, I can understand every single word they say
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.720]   in English, but I don't know what they mean.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.160]   They have their own intimate connection, right?
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:58.040]   Communication.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.640]   I guess speaking in tongue is kind of like that, right?
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.800]   So some people have the gift of speaking in tongue,
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.960]   some sort of mysterious, unknown language,
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:09.720]   his intimacy with God, and you can't understand
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.120]   until it is being interpreted, right?
[00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:14.680]   So that's speaking in tongue.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   And obviously there are some people who are gifted
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.800]   in such a way in the Church of Corinth.
[00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:22.480]   So as they gather together, some of the people
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:25.160]   will speak in tongue, you know, freely, right?
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:28.040]   And people around them who don't have the gift
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:31.240]   and where there's no translator or interpreter,
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.160]   there's no way you can understand what they say.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.520]   That is speaking in tongue.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.480]   And how about prophecy, all right?
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:39.320]   Prophecy.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.080]   So Paul is trying to contrast speaking in tongue
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:43.520]   and prophecy, right?
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:44.360]   But what is prophecy?
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.560]   Now, modern people will always understand prophecy
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:49.960]   in a very narrow way.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:51.340]   What is prophecy to you?
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.480]   What does prophecy do?
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.320]   It's always prediction, right?
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:57.600]   Weather forecast.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.020]   Oh, will it rain tomorrow at 2.50 p.m.?
[00:16:02.020 --> 00:16:04.820]   Will it snow tomorrow, right?
[00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:06.760]   We always approach prophecy that way.
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:11.020]   But, you know, in the Bible, prophecy is much broader.
[00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:16.160]   You know, look at the prophets in the Old Testament.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.160]   The prophets are spokepersons of God.
[00:16:21.160 --> 00:16:26.320]   And they always begin the message by, "Thus says the Lord."
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.520]   This is what Yahweh the Lord says.
[00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.400]   And you better listen.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:35.120]   And that's what prophets would do, would say.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:37.520]   And it's kind of like preaching.
[00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.660]   It's kind of like biblical teaching.
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.020]   So prophecy is not just about, you know, weather forecast,
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.500]   or what will happen tomorrow.
[00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.620]   It's not about prediction.
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.660]   It's about proclamation of the Word of God,
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:50.420]   the authoritative Word of God.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:55.420]   So Paul is trying to contrast prophecy and tongues.
[00:16:55.420 --> 00:17:00.780]   And what he's trying to get at is that prophecy,
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:05.020]   or preaching, or biblical teaching,
[00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:08.560]   is understandable to all the people.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.620]   It's intelligent to all the people,
[00:17:10.620 --> 00:17:11.900]   because people can understand.
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:13.300]   It's a known language.
[00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.080]   And people can understand its meaning.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.080]   But speaking in tongue, that is a barrier, right?
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:23.500]   Because you need to wait for someone to translate
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.380]   or to interpret in order to understand it.
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:27.980]   And Paul, in this passage,
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:31.380]   he talks so much about using those gifts.
[00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:33.820]   He said in the corporate worship setting,
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.700]   you better not use tongues.
[00:17:35.700 --> 00:17:37.420]   You better use prophecy.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.500]   You better speak in such a way
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:43.000]   that everyone can understand.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.840]   So verse four, he says,
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:47.580]   "A person who speaks in tongue is strengthened personally,"
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:50.580]   because it's an intimate language, right?
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:53.280]   Only God and him would enjoy it.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:56.340]   But nobody else around him can enjoy it.
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.780]   So it's only strengthened personally,
[00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:04.440]   but one who speaks a word of prophecy, preaching,
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.300]   strengthens the entire church.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.140]   And I wish you could all speak in tongues,
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.380]   because Paul, obviously, he also speaks in tongue.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:17.300]   But he never does so in the worship setting,
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:18.840]   in the corporate setting.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.320]   But even more, I wish you could all prophesy, right?
[00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:23.980]   You could all speak in such a way,
[00:18:23.980 --> 00:18:25.860]   teach in such a way, preach in such a way,
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:27.340]   everyone can understand.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:30.700]   For prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.700]   Unless someone interprets what you're saying
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:36.620]   so that the whole church will be strengthened.
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:41.060]   Now notice the key words here, strengthen, right?
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:44.540]   Or the older translation would say to edify, right?
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.860]   It's a architectural term.
[00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:50.260]   So everyone getting together in a church setting,
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:52.700]   in a corporate gathering,
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:55.300]   our purpose is to strengthen one another,
[00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:57.820]   to pray for one another, to build up one another.
[00:18:57.820 --> 00:19:01.180]   Your presence, your prayers, your ministry
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:03.220]   is to edify other people
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:06.980]   so that the church can be built up, right?
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.620]   And the church, the word church,
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.580]   repeated many, many times in the entire chapter,
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:13.660]   nine times in total.
[00:19:13.660 --> 00:19:16.500]   Paul is saying we should use our spiritual gifts,
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:21.260]   our talents, our abilities to edify the church,
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.700]   to build up the church.
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:27.060]   And what we have, our skills and our talents
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:31.300]   are not for ourselves, but means to bless other people.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.300]   It's not my own possession
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:36.740]   because the Spirit gives you in such a way
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:39.260]   that you can serve other people.
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:41.700]   I have been to many churches
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.700]   and I've always find that it's such a great blessing
[00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:49.060]   to see people using their gifts
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.180]   and using their skills to build up
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:54.860]   the community of the church.
[00:19:54.860 --> 00:19:59.700]   Some people who are gifted to help other people, right?
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:01.580]   Help in a very practical way.
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:05.460]   I know a brother in California.
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:09.340]   Every time I meet with him,
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:12.020]   he always ask the question,
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:17.660]   are you in need financially, right, financially?
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.020]   He's gifted in such a way that,
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.140]   I wanna bless you because God bless me so much.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.740]   And I wanna bless you in such a way
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.620]   that God can use you, right?
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:32.700]   It's always good to have a friend like that, right?
[00:20:32.700 --> 00:20:34.660]   But I don't see him often.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:35.820]   I don't see him often.
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:40.020]   But he's just gifted in giving, right?
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.540]   And some people who are gifted
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.540]   in emotional relational intelligence.
[00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:49.260]   Some people you can meet with them
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:52.500]   and they will encourage you in the conversations
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.460]   and they will build you up.
[00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.140]   And you find the conversation with him or with her
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.780]   is life-giving, right?
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.220]   Some people are especially gifted in such a way.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.340]   Of course, we're always commanded to love one another,
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.340]   to care for one another,
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.460]   but some people are especially gifted in such a way.
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:12.060]   And some people who are obviously gifted in music, right?
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:13.300]   And they play music
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:16.860]   and so that we can sing songs together, right?
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.660]   And some of the gifts need to be developed
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:22.340]   and to be trained to be used.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:24.980]   Otherwise, you would lose it, right?
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.600]   You realize I play most of the instruments, right?
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:30.500]   Why do I do that?
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:34.260]   It's not necessarily I enjoy it,
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:37.540]   but because when I go to different churches,
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:40.260]   you know, I serve different churches in the past,
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:43.480]   I find that it's very useful.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.800]   And if I can get a handle on it,
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:48.260]   I'll learn it myself, right?
[00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:49.740]   I'll learn it myself.
[00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:54.420]   Because I want to bless the community that I'm in, right?
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:57.580]   The fellowship, the small group, or the churches,
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:59.000]   wherever I am.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.940]   A couple of weeks ago, we had the MSI event.
[00:22:02.940 --> 00:22:05.420]   We went to a museum of science industry.
[00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.540]   And for church-wide events, sometimes I do observe
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.420]   that we are blessed with many, many people
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:14.380]   who don't take advantage,
[00:22:14.380 --> 00:22:16.880]   but they understand the purpose of the event
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:19.060]   is to connect with other people,
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.740]   especially non-Christians.
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:22.420]   Some people who bring new friends,
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:26.700]   and they just take the initiative to approach those friends
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:28.820]   and talk to them and to relate to them.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:31.700]   But on the other side of the coin,
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:35.420]   sometimes I see Christians who just enjoy their own time,
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:38.020]   you know, and take advantage.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:39.460]   And this is sad, right?
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:42.660]   Because we lose the focus, we lose the purpose
[00:22:42.660 --> 00:22:44.740]   of why we gather together.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:48.060]   Paul is saying why we gather together is to strengthen,
[00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:51.380]   is to edify one another.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:54.980]   Therefore, Paul is saying prophecy.
[00:22:54.980 --> 00:22:56.260]   When you speak in such a way,
[00:22:56.260 --> 00:22:58.740]   you can proclaim the word of God
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:02.100]   in such a way everyone can understand this is greater,
[00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:05.220]   this is stronger than speaking in tongue.
[00:23:05.220 --> 00:23:07.460]   You just enjoy your spiritual high, right?
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:12.980]   The whole church will be strengthened.
[00:23:12.980 --> 00:23:14.700]   And that's the first part of this chapter.
[00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:15.880]   The second part of this chapter,
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:18.080]   let me read part of the passage here.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.900]   And this is a very important passage.
[00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:22.740]   Verse 23 and following.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.900]   Even so, if unbelievers or people
[00:23:25.900 --> 00:23:28.380]   who don't understand these things, the spiritual things,
[00:23:28.380 --> 00:23:32.460]   come into your church meeting, your church worship,
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:35.820]   and hear everyone speaking in an unknown language,
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:36.920]   speaking in tongue,
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.500]   they will think that you guys are crazy,
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:40.300]   you guys are nuts, right?
[00:23:40.300 --> 00:23:41.800]   Because they don't understand.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:46.820]   Verse 24, but if all of you are prophesying,
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.700]   preaching, explaining the faith
[00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.980]   in such an understandable way,
[00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.340]   unbelievers or people who don't understand
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:57.020]   the spiritual things come into your worship meeting,
[00:23:57.020 --> 00:24:00.420]   they will be convicted of sin and judged by what you say.
[00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:03.740]   Verse 25, as they listen,
[00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:06.000]   their secret thoughts will be exposed.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.860]   They will fall to their knees and worship God,
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:14.060]   declaring, "God is truly here among you."
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:18.720]   You see the key word here is understand.
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.240]   It's the principle of understandability
[00:24:22.240 --> 00:24:24.040]   or intelligibility.
[00:24:24.040 --> 00:24:26.360]   It's the principle of doing something
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.760]   that people can understand, even visitors,
[00:24:28.760 --> 00:24:32.540]   non-Christian visitors, will be able to understand.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:34.800]   (stammers)
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:38.700]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:24:38.700 --> 00:24:42.860]   Is our worship design
[00:24:42.860 --> 00:24:47.080]   understandable to most people?
[00:24:47.080 --> 00:24:48.820]   Yes, right?
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:53.300]   Yeah, we use, I'm very grateful for worship leaders
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.860]   and people who serve in the worship ministry
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:59.700]   and they choose songs that are newer
[00:24:59.700 --> 00:25:02.700]   or they're more contemporary, right?
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:07.700]   I'm not saying we should abandon the traditional hymns, okay?
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.560]   All right, for those, well, I'm probably the older guy here.
[00:25:11.560 --> 00:25:13.740]   That's so sad.
[00:25:13.740 --> 00:25:18.940]   But anyways, when we grow up in the church,
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.160]   we learn a lot of traditional hymns,
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.500]   many, many traditional hymns.
[00:25:23.500 --> 00:25:27.100]   And when I hear those traditional hymns,
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.660]   I immediately go, this is my language, right?
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:33.660]   This is my language.
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:38.900]   And we used to sing from a hymn book, right?
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:41.620]   We sing the old, old hymns.
[00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:44.700]   But we need to understand worship as a language.
[00:25:44.700 --> 00:25:48.060]   It's kind of a language or kind of a form
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:52.180]   that is always evolving,
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.180]   from time to time, from generation to generation, right?
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:59.820]   Those songs used to be a great hit
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:05.860]   and no longer the language of today, right?
[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.320]   Again, I'm not saying we have to abandon
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:11.180]   everything traditional.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:14.500]   I'm not trying to say, let us embrace the newest thing,
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.420]   right, like the iPhone, right?
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:19.880]   The newest iPhone, everyone wants to get it, right?
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.100]   I'm not trying to say that,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:24.620]   but the mission of the church, Paul says,
[00:26:24.620 --> 00:26:27.620]   is to make worship gathering in such a way
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:32.620]   that will honor God and that is also understandable
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:36.300]   to other people, right?
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:41.300]   So I'm grateful for those who try to use songs
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.380]   or new songs to worship,
[00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:45.580]   because the mission of the church
[00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:49.060]   is not to keep certain tradition, right?
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.540]   That is not our mission.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:55.540]   Our mission is to make faith and the Bible
[00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:57.540]   and our message understandable
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.700]   and that is the spirit of the passage here.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:06.100]   Those of you who have been to a traditional worship setting,
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:11.600]   when you come in, you pick up a copy of the bulletin, right?
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:13.860]   Do you still remember those days?
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.300]   Or I'm just dating myself, right?
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:21.020]   Yeah, you pick up a copy of a sheet of paper
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.180]   with the, it's called worship bulletin, okay?
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:30.060]   And it lists every single component of the worship service.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:33.020]   The first one is usually is the call to worship
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.860]   and then there's a prayer and then there's another prayer
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.340]   and then you stand up for the prayer
[00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:39.460]   and then you sit down for another prayer
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.820]   and then there's a scripture reading and then preaching
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:47.300]   and then you sit down and you do a certain hymn
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.660]   and then after you do a certain hymn
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.740]   and then you do some other component
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:53.100]   and then you stand up again for a doxology
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.020]   and then you sit down and then you do your silent prayer
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.940]   and then you go, right?
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:27:59.300]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.080]   There's a traditional liturgy, right?
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.220]   Traditional liturgy.
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.180]   And some of the churches still do that, right?
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:06.420]   But we don't, right?
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:07.260]   We don't.
[00:28:07.260 --> 00:28:10.060]   Why don't we print a worship bulletin
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:14.020]   and hand you one copy when you come in?
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.060]   Why don't we do that?
[00:28:15.060 --> 00:28:17.580]   Why don't we do that?
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.240]   We don't.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:20.280]   Because we're lazy.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.620]   We don't wanna do some stuff, right?
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:24.900]   Well, no, no, no.
[00:28:24.900 --> 00:28:26.920]   We wanna be environmental, right?
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:28.140]   We don't wanna waste paper, right?
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.420]   I've been to some churches
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:31.820]   where traditional in worship form,
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:37.060]   after the worship service, you see papers lying around, right?
[00:28:37.060 --> 00:28:38.600]   And then you just go to,
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.700]   those papers will go to the trash.
[00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:42.380]   But what I'm saying is the form
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:45.620]   or the language of worship evolves from time to time, right?
[00:28:45.620 --> 00:28:47.960]   Even the instruments that we use, right?
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.340]   In my old days, in my old days,
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:57.220]   we only do organ and piano, right?
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.980]   So many, many of the traditional churches,
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:04.700]   they have to have organist, someone who play organ, right?
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:08.900]   Wouldn't it be nice if we have a pipe organ in the church?
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.040]   Don't you think so?
[00:29:10.040 --> 00:29:10.880]   Yes?
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.620]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:14.540]   But the maintenance will kill you, right?
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:19.180]   You need to spend a lot of money to maintain those stuff,
[00:29:19.180 --> 00:29:20.020]   right?
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.360]   We use electric piano, right?
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.220]   Electric keyboard, right?
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:28.340]   Yeah, let me tell you this little story about drum set.
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.620]   Okay, I told some of you about this drum set.
[00:29:31.620 --> 00:29:33.420]   Now, I remember in the '90s,
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:38.420]   I was in my church in Vancouver, in Canada.
[00:29:38.640 --> 00:29:40.200]   We didn't have a drum set.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:43.120]   And some of the brothers and sisters wanted to suggest,
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.520]   "Oh, let's use drum set."
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.360]   Those are the early days of the worship team, right?
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.960]   The band, worship band, music band.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.240]   And we didn't have a drum set.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:56.440]   And the deacon board called for a meeting to vote
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.360]   whether we should buy a drum set using church budget.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.360]   And there was a huge controversy.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:05.160]   It was a huge controversy because some people,
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:07.960]   the older folks, they said, "Oh, we should buy a drum set.
[00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.940]   "The older folks especially,
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.460]   "they are against the idea of putting a drum on stage
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:17.620]   "or buying a drum using church money."
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:19.260]   You know why they think that way?
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:25.460]   You have to understand, they grew up in the '70s,
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.700]   you know, the '60s and the '70s.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:30.220]   Those are the days, you know, sexual revolution
[00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.700]   and all that liberation movement, right?
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:37.820]   And for them, this thing, drum set,
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.940]   is for those who smoke weeds, right?
[00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.140]   Those rock band, right?
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:48.300]   The rock musicians, they use this kind of instrument.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.740]   But they cannot change, right?
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:53.340]   Because the language has changed, right?
[00:30:53.340 --> 00:30:57.620]   And people use drum set for a different reason now, right?
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:01.600]   People play electric guitar for a different reason now.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:06.400]   Those are the old days, all the rebellious teenagers,
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.900]   the young people, would play those instruments, right?
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:12.140]   And they never thought of putting those instruments
[00:31:12.140 --> 00:31:13.060]   in the church.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:15.140]   So there was a huge debate
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:18.060]   about whether we should buy a drum set.
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:20.220]   And what is the result of the vote?
[00:31:20.220 --> 00:31:23.540]   It was no.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:25.500]   We don't buy it, right?
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:28.240]   And so it didn't carry through.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:31.700]   So I was serving in the church and I was saying,
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.720]   okay, let me just buy it out of my own pocket.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:37.440]   So I did.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.000]   I spent almost $2,000 to buy this thing, right?
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:43.960]   So this drum set belongs to me.
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.500]   It follows me.
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:48.480]   It follows me every single day, you know?
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:50.420]   Whenever I serve in the church, I say,
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.960]   hey, you don't have a drum set?
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.100]   Boom, here.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:53.940]   Okay, it's the instrument,
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.100]   it's a personal instrument of the pastor, okay?
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:58.360]   The pastor plays drums too, okay?
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.780]   So it's okay, all right?
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:04.320]   It's not like we are going astray or something like that.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.200]   But what I'm trying to tell you is that
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.840]   there is a different language
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.760]   from generation to generation.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:16.440]   Even the attire is different.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:20.320]   What we wear is changing, right?
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:21.480]   You go to the tech talks,
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:25.500]   you go to the big announcement from the big company,
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:26.820]   the IT companies,
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.760]   you know, those CEOs, they don't wear suit and tie, right?
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:33.280]   They don't do that anymore, right?
[00:32:33.280 --> 00:32:34.980]   We change, right?
[00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:41.600]   Whoever does the announcement is short, right?
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:43.480]   And it's okay, right?
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.440]   And it's okay.
[00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:47.920]   And we have to distinguish what the Bible,
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:52.400]   what the Bible says, what the Bible says,
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.860]   and what tradition says, right?
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:59.660]   God want us to hear his word,
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.500]   but not just our tradition.
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:05.420]   And that's the spirit of the passage.
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:11.620]   Even the songs that we use today, right?
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:13.460]   I remember some months ago,
[00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:16.980]   I was trying to pause my Hebrew, my biblical Hebrew.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:20.780]   So I tried to learn some Hebrew songs.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:22.720]   So it's a very beautiful songs.
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.280]   You know, the Hebrew songs, the Middle Eastern melody,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:30.000]   is actually very, very sweet, all right?
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.520]   So I was trying to play those songs
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.460]   because I wanna learn some new Hebrew words, right?
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:36.100]   Like Psalm 23, you can sing the whole thing, right?
[00:33:36.100 --> 00:33:37.340]   And I was using my guitar
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.240]   and trying to sing some Hebrew songs
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:42.000]   so that I can remember some of the words, right?
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.760]   And then my kids, my children,
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.240]   they came over and say,
[00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.480]   "Can you please stop?"
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:54.680]   Because it doesn't sound good, right?
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.560]   Actually, it sounds good, right?
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.800]   Actually, it sounds good.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.200]   And I sing well.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:04.360]   And you know, what I'm saying is the language has changed.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.840]   The melody has changed.
[00:34:05.840 --> 00:34:08.900]   And we have to be relevant, right?
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.560]   So the principle here is that worship is vertical.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.140]   Worship is that we bring the offering to God vertically.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:18.580]   Because we are the people of God,
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.440]   and God loves us, and God cares about us, we worship Him.
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.920]   All because God has created and redeemed us,
[00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:28.680]   and we respond to the great acts of God.
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:31.760]   We respond by saying, "God, thank you for saving us.
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.920]   "Thank you for letting us be your people."
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:37.900]   So worship is, first of all, vertical.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:39.780]   But it is also horizontal.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:43.040]   It's all about other people,
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:45.080]   and we cannot ignore one another.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:48.260]   And worship needs to be edifying,
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.480]   to build up other people
[00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:52.300]   so that people can understand the message.
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:57.300]   And even it can be, it needs to be missional, evangelistic.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:59.200]   When people walk into our church,
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:01.120]   when people join our meetings,
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.520]   when people come into our worship,
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:06.040]   they will sense that this is different, right?
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:07.840]   And it's not about the size.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.160]   It's about the message that we carry, right?
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.100]   People can see, hey, God is in the midst of you.
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.180]   And let me close by trying to answer this question.
[00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:21.940]   How can we be better worshipers?
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:24.820]   First, I would like to suggest, be mindful.
[00:35:24.820 --> 00:35:26.860]   Be mindful.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:29.500]   When you come in and worship God,
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.860]   be mindful in the sense that we are approaching God,
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.220]   we are approaching God with a pure heart,
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.900]   and we need to be fully present.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.340]   Our mind, our spirit need to be fully present.
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:45.680]   Even our physical body needs to be fully present
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:50.760]   to prepare ourselves so that we can come
[00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:55.760]   to the presence of God to be a worshiper pleasing to Him.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.720]   And secondly, let us be reminded
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.440]   to be obedient in our attitude.
[00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.200]   When we come in and pray, prepare our hearts
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.560]   so that our hearts is a good soil.
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:12.820]   We can receive the word of God, the message of God
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:17.140]   through songs and prayers and sermons and all that we do.
[00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:20.820]   Be obedient.
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:25.540]   And lastly, let me remind you to be prayerful.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:31.940]   We approach this holy God, this great and awesome God, right?
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:36.420]   And we need to approach Him with a clean heart.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.100]   I always find this good practice.
[00:36:40.100 --> 00:36:43.400]   I come into a worship, corporate worship,
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:47.660]   a little bit earlier, and I do a little prayer,
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.960]   and I ask for forgiveness.
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:53.460]   I ask that God will forgive my sins and cleanse me.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:57.800]   And I pray that God will prepare my heart to approach Him.
[00:36:57.800 --> 00:37:01.220]   And sometimes I even need to pray
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:03.900]   and forgive other people, right?
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:05.500]   Other people, other brothers and sisters,
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:06.800]   other family members.
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:13.500]   I need to ask them, I ask God to forgive them, right?
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:16.800]   So that I can approach God in a new and fresh way.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:21.460]   How can you become a better worshiper?
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:24.760]   How can you become a better worshiper?
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.420]   Let us pray and prepare our hearts
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:28.980]   to receive the communion today.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:31.420]   Let's pray.
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:36.420]   Father, as we come before your presence,
[00:37:36.420 --> 00:37:37.660]   we want to say thank you.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.820]   Thank you for forgiving our sins,
[00:37:40.820 --> 00:37:44.660]   for cleansing us, for redeeming us,
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.160]   all because what Jesus our Lord has done on the cross.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:54.220]   He died and shed blood in order for all of our sins,
[00:37:54.220 --> 00:37:58.620]   the past, present, and future, everything forgiven
[00:37:58.620 --> 00:38:03.940]   so that we can be called, declared righteous in Christ.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:07.900]   Thank you for what you have done.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:12.900]   And our worship is a response to your grace.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:15.020]   Thank you for loving us.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:17.340]   Thank you for calling us to worship you.
[00:38:17.340 --> 00:38:24.580]   So we ask that you will cleanse our hearts and our mind
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:26.400]   so we will focus on you.
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:30.260]   As we come before the Lord's table today,
[00:38:30.260 --> 00:38:35.780]   we ask that you will refresh our heart and our spirit
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:37.580]   as we partake the bread and the cup.
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:43.580]   These are the symbols, the tangible reminders
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.980]   of your love to us.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:48.300]   And thank you.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.860]   And may your grace continue to transform us.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:52.300]   In Christ's name we pray.
