[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Hello, my name is Joyce. I am one of the ministers at UV. I live in Arizona and I mostly serve
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:19.760]   the church online. And I fly back to Chicago once a quarter to serve in person. In 2008,
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.640]   the U.S. economy started to decline. That summer, our family went to China to do a short-term
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.040]   mission with our home church. We returned to Chicago in August, and next month, September,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.760]   my husband was laid off. Since then, he was out of work for the next 11 months. The year
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.960]   after, 2009, we went to China for another short-term mission trip. While we visit families
[00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:07.120]   and friends in Hong Kong, my husband got a job offer. So after he brought us back to
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:14.160]   Chicago, he flew back to Hong Kong for the new job. He only had 100 Hong Kong dollars
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.600]   in his pocket for that month until he got his first paycheck. My daughter and I stayed
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:31.520]   behind in Chicago for another three months because of her school. We have about a month
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.440]   of mortgage and living expenses in the bank. We live in Hong Kong for two years, and we've
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:45.440]   moved to Arizona in 2012. In September 2014, we got a job offer from a bank in Hong Kong
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:51.520]   and we came back to Chicago for a friend's wedding. A day before the wedding, our whole
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.280]   family went for a physical checkup because we were in the middle of changing insurance.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:04.280]   A day after the wedding, my husband was admitted to the hospital. Because the blood test showed
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.320]   his blood count was dangerously low, his hemoglobin level is about one-third of a normal person.
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.160]   They did some tests on him, and the tests showed that he had five ulcers in his stomach.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:28.160]   He was bleeding nonstop. We stayed in the hospital for a blood transfusion, and after
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:35.680]   he was discharged, we went back to Arizona, and he needed another blood transfusion. Unfortunately,
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:44.240]   there was a month between the two insurances that we didn't have insurance, and it was
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:51.440]   that month. So the medical bills pretty much emptied our bank account. And with all the
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.720]   chaos, I barely survived my second semester of seminary study. I can go on and on with
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:08.920]   similar stories like this, but I think you get the idea. There were times in my life
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   that was very, very difficult. But standing in front of you today, when I look back, I
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:26.080]   have nothing but thankfulness. I thank you, God, for His grace. I thank God for the many
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:35.720]   trials in my life. I am blessed because I'm a Christian. How so? How could that be? I
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.720]   thank you, God, for the many trials in my life. How so? How could that be? Today's message,
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.080]   hang tight. Hang tight means to continue doing something or staying somewhere, although it
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:57.840]   is difficult or unpleasant to do so. Let's pray. Lord God Almighty, blessed be the name
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   of the Lord. We come before you and ask for a teachable heart. May the Holy Spirit speak
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:20.120]   to each one of us as you pleased. Your name be glorified. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.560]   Today's passage, John 3, 16. Shall we read it together? "For God so loved the world that
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:43.200]   He gave His one and only Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:52.760]   eternal life." Many of you, or probably all of you, are very familiar with this verse.
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.160]   But maybe it is not a bad idea to take another look, or you just have no choice since I'm
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:08.160]   the speaker. I'm the one who chose the verse. As you see, this is not a long verse. However,
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:16.080]   it is so rich in meaning and significance. So let us unpack this verse together. In this
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.960]   verse, there are seven important truths, truths that you and I need. The first truth is that
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:31.960]   we need, number one, God, the ultimate authority. Two, love the world, the greatest action.
[00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:44.520]   Three, that He gave His one and only, one and only Son, the best gift. Four, whoever
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:55.480]   believes in Him, the widest coverage. Five, believes in Him, the only way out. Six, shall
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:04.760]   not perish, the holiest salvation. Seven, eternal life, the priceless gift. God, the
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:19.240]   ultimate authority. From the very beginning, chapter 1 in Genesis, there are 11 God says.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:27.240]   The authority of God is clearly reflected in the command spoken from His mouth. It is
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.920]   also recorded in the Old Testament that God called Abraham with authority. In Exodus,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:40.920]   God also played an authoritative role in the exile and return of the Israelites. When it
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:47.800]   comes to the New Testament, we also see that God had given authority to Jesus. "All authority
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:54.800]   in heaven and earth has been given to me." And later, authority was passed on to the
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:02.720]   disciples. More importantly, Paul mentioned in his letter that the authority from the
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:09.720]   Holy Spirit is fulfilled the mission in the church of God. God is the ultimate authority.
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.720]   He has the authority over the earth, over the authority of your life, over the challenges
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:26.720]   in your life. Two, love the world, the greatest action. God loves the world. The word love
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:34.880]   consists of thoughts, wills, and emotions. But we must understand God's love for the
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:42.040]   world is not limited to thoughts, wills, and emotions. God's love is also an action. Christ
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:51.400]   died for us. In this, the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent His
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.400]   only Son to this world so that we might live through Him. For reason why loving the world
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   is the greatest act? Because this is a sacrificial love. On the cross, the Father makes the sinless
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:12.480]   Son the object of the Father's wrath for our sake that in Jesus we might become the righteousness
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:19.600]   of God. Someone took the action to pay for your wrong. Someone took action to bear the
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:27.400]   pain. Someone loves you more than He loves Himself. Three, one and only Son. The Father
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:34.400]   one and only Son, the best gift. Eternal life belongs to God. The Son of God also has
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:41.840]   eternal life. Eternal life is supernatural. So unless God gives it to man, there's no
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:49.280]   way for man to have it by himself. John 10, 28, "I give them eternal life and they will
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:58.560]   never perish and no one will snatch them out of my hand." The only begotten Son is the
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:06.440]   best, ultimate, and most priceless gift. Life, you will never receive another gift in your
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:13.920]   life that can compare to it. There were times in my life that were so difficult that I can
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   barely breathe. There seems to be no way out and I don't even have money to pay the mortgage
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:30.760]   next month. I used to joke with my brother's sisters in the church like, "If I don't have
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:37.760]   money to buy grocery, I'll come to your home for dinner." But the gift of, the thought
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   of, the knowing of Jesus carried me through. You may be a professional. You may feel like
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:58.280]   you have control over your life. You might feel confident or you may have tons of money,
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:07.600]   but in the end, you cannot save yourself. Four, whoever the widest coverage. You must
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:14.440]   know that the Jews did not think that God loved the world because they believed that
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   God only loved Israel. But it was Jesus' word that showed God's love is so long, wide, and
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:29.080]   deep that it covers everyone in the world. All people in the world can be saved and all
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:35.080]   people can have the life in the Lord. Jesus' teaching challenged the Israelites to humble
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:41.320]   their hearts and their status as God's chosen people and deprive them of the privilege of
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:48.320]   thinking they had God's blessings. Jesus transformed people's understanding of God's love and
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:56.320]   salvation. We are covered. You and I are within the coverage.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:04.320]   Five, believe in Him, the only way out. Believe in Him, describe people who are willing to
[00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:10.360]   accept God's love. God loves the world, but if people don't accept the Lord Jesus and
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:16.960]   the gift from God, they can't have eternal life at all. Believing in Jesus is not just
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   about cognition in the head, but believing in Jesus is about believing in the head and
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   relying on the heart and following in the action.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   John 5, 24, "Truly, truly, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:44.280]   has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life."
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:53.920]   To believe is to connect, to hang tight our lives in Jesus, to transfer our sovereignty,
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:12:01.220]   to change our values, and to allow God to renew our hearts and guide our lives from
[00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:08.220]   now on. You must believe in Him because He is the only way out.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:16.680]   There is a verse that I love since I was in high school. Proverbs 3, 5-6, "Trust in the
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:29.360]   Lord with all your heart and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:36.800]   Him and He will make straight your path."
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:44.400]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart and do not lean onto your own understanding. In
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:55.760]   all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make straight your path.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:13:04.160]   Sixth, "Shall not perish the holy salvation." The word perish, destroyed in the Bible means
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   to be destroyed, to be regarded as useless, to be killed, to go to hell, to be lost, to
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:19.440]   be declared, sorry, to be put to death.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:27.000]   Charles Spurgeon, one of the most influential English preachers in the 19th century. He
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.680]   once said, "Morality may keep you out of jail, but it takes the blood of Jesus Christ to
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.040]   keep you out of hell."
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:43.440]   Elaine Pagels, she is a professor of religion at Princeton University, the world's leading
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   biblical literature research expert. In 1987, her son Mark died of terminal illness at the
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:59.040]   age of six, followed 15 months later. Her husband died in a climbing accident.
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:10.320]   In 2018, she released a book called "Why Religion?" This book was written after the death of her
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:17.640]   son and her husband. Elaine tried to explore the teachings in the Bible from the religious
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:23.040]   studies she was familiar with, which could help her face the death of her son and her
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:29.320]   husband and overcome the struggles of extreme pain.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:36.320]   Although Elaine studied the Bible all her life, she was not a Christian, and even denied
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:43.720]   Christianity and religion all her life. Ironically, at the end she had no choice but to admit
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:53.360]   that the grace from God brought her out of the shadows. Although Elaine Pagels experienced
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:15:01.400]   grace from God and the death of her son and her husband, in the end she still chose to
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:08.240]   define God as the object of her study, not her savior. Her knowledge of the Bible is
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:15.240]   so extremely rich, and she has received many, many awards and respect in the academic world,
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:21.560]   but none of these can save her.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:28.560]   How about you? Do you truly believe He is the God of your life, or is it just a brainful
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:43.160]   of Bible knowledge? "Shall not perish," the holy salvation, is the ultimate goal of God's
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.640]   love for the world. Anyone can know God, but unless they confess their sins and believe
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:58.640]   in their hearts, they cannot escape eternal destruction.
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:03.800]   Eternal Life is the Priceless Gift
[00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:10.800]   John 11, 25-26 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:18.760]   in me, though he die, yet shall he live. And everyone who lives and believes in me shall
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:24.080]   never die." Do you believe this?
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:31.080]   Eternal Life, the Priceless Gift. Have you received it? You claim it. Open it. The understanding
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:43.440]   of Eternal Life helps us live our lives beyond the here and now. It empowers us to live life
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:52.760]   with a wider kingdom's perspective. We can claim victory over comes the world.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:17:04.180]   How can we still sleep like a baby when you lose your job, when there's no money in your
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:11.180]   bank account, or the number in your bank account continues to drop? How can we finish the race
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:20.200]   when everything seems to go against you? And how can we testify his name in our lives when
[00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:28.720]   there is suffering, when there is continuous challenge, struggle?
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   God, the ultimate authority, loves the world, the greatest action, one and only Son, the
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:48.520]   best gift, whoever the widest coverage, believes in him the only way out, shall not perish
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:59.260]   the holiest salvation. Eternal Life, the Priceless Gift.
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:06.840]   Seven Truths. Seven truths of the gospel we Christians need to hang tight because eternal
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:13.840]   hope is a big deal.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:21.740]   In Pastor Mark's video, he mentioned Matthew chapter 6, 31 to 33. What is kingdom living
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   like? What should disciples, followers of Jesus think of every single day?
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:40.880]   Seek ye first the kingdom of God. Understanding who we are is the foundation of this worthy
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:47.920]   walk. Let's not live like we don't know God. Act or live like a Gentile.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:57.720]   Anyone with kingdom perspective can conquer the storm in life. Trials shall pass. Christ's
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:06.240]   followers can rest peacefully in the storm because he saves, because God is with us.
[00:19:06.240 --> 00:19:16.000]   Hang tight. Trust in the Lord. Pray without ceasing. Don't let go. Let's pray.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Redeeming God, thank you for salvation, full and free. You are rich in mercy and grace.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:42.400]   You have promise and eternity spent with you by faith in Jesus Christ. Nothing can separate
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:50.200]   us from you. Please grant us kingdom perspective when trials come. We don't worry about tomorrow,
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:20:01.080]   what we eat, what we wear, because there is something more important. May your name be
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:08.380]   glorified in our lives. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:18.380]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
