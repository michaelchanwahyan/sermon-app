1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,160
 Good morning, guys.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,920
 Why don't we say hi to each other?

3
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:04,480
 Just wave your hand.

4
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:05,680
 Good to be here.

5
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:06,520
 Whose bottle is this?

6
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:09,760
 Oh, it's some living water, yeah.

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,880
 Okay, today we are going to continue

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,040
 with the reflection on what is going on

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,560
 in Israel-Palestine.

10
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,320
 I'm not going to talk so much about

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,320
 what is going on right there on the ground.

12
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:26,240
 It's tragedy to both sides.

13
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,880
 No matter what happened, ground invasion

14
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,760
 or spill out into a regional conflict,

15
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,240
 it's going to be bad.

16
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,680
 What I would like to do is, in this conflict,

17
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,360
 there were a lot of different arguments

18
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:43,960
 and a lot of different discussions about the land.

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,200
 So I would like to walk you through,

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,800
 like what I did last week,

21
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,320
 walk you through the entire Bible

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:51,840
 from the first book, Genesis,

23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
 to the last book, Revelation,

24
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,320
 and what is going on with the theme of land.

25
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,960
 Definitely in the Old Testament,

26
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,120
 there were a lot of discussions

27
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,640
 and a lot of emphasis on land,

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,240
 land of Canaan, which is between the Mediterranean Sea

29
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,200
 and the desert on the right,

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,400
 that narrow corridor.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,480
 In this conflict currently happening,

32
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:21,400
 people often come to the debates and the arguments,

33
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,360
 whose land is this and who should stay in this land?

34
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,160
 And it can be very divisive.

35
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,160
 But I want to walk you through

36
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,520
 from Old Testament to New Testament,

37
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,920
 what is going on here.

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,800
 Sometimes we miss the big picture.

39
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,560
 The Bible, when the Bible talks about the land of Canaan,

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,680
 the promised land, it actually talks about grace.

41
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,800
 It actually talks about God's gifting the land

42
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:47,400
 to the Israelites, to the Old Testament people.

43
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,240
 And the land is a sheer, a sheer gift from God.

44
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,280
 And the people of God get to enter

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,200
 and to enjoy the land all because of God's grace.

46
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,800
 Of course, there was a covenant between God and the people,

47
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,600
 and the people are to be faithful.

48
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,760
 People are to follow the Torah,

49
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,560
 the principles lay out in the Old Testament,

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,240
 especially the first five books, how to manage their land.

51
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,320
 So when the Bible talks about God gifting the land

52
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,880
 to the Old Testament people,

53
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,760
 it is not saying, okay, anything goes.

54
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,120
 You know, I just give you this piece of property

55
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,080
 and you can just go in and do whatever you want, right?

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,440
 And by the way, we talk about the people of God being chosen,

57
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,560
 right, chosen people of God.

58
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,560
 The word chosen or the concept of election, chosen,

59
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,440
 does not mean the people being chosen have privileges,

60
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,520
 does not mean the people being chosen are superior.

61
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,680
 Chosen or being elected means God is choosing you

62
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,040
 to be his instrument to bless other people, right?

63
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,120
 So it's the land, the land is a gift.

64
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,000
 And the Israelites are called to manage it well

65
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,080
 and to give back and to love God.

66
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
 So there are many different principles in the Torah,

67
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,760
 and I wanna give you a sample of it.

68
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,840
 One of the sample that talks about

69
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,600
 how people should behave in the land,

70
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,120
 in the land gifted by God.

71
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,320
 Deuteronomy 24, it says,

72
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:29,320
 "When you beat the olives from your olive trees," okay,

73
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:30,480
 "don't beat it twice.

74
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,400
 "The remaining olives are for the foreigners

75
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,040
 "or the orphans, the widows.

76
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,120
 "When you gather the grapes in your vineyard,

77
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,080
 "do not clean the vines after they are picked.

78
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,480
 "Leave the remaining grapes for the foreigners,

79
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,200
 "orphans, and widows.

80
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:53,160
 "Remember that you were slaves in the land of Egypt.

81
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,640
 "That is why I am giving you this command."

82
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,560
 Now, this is very interesting.

83
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,120
 When you beat the olives, what does it mean, right?

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,520
 Have you seen the olive tree?

85
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,080
 Olive tree, no?

86
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,000
 Okay, you've seen olives, right?

87
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,840
 In whole foods.

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,760
 Right, but olive tree, the olive tree,

89
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,920
 it's like an umbrella,

90
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,400
 and when you harvest olive tree,

91
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:18,920
 the olives are on the tree, on the branches,

92
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,000
 and how you do it?

93
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,960
 You have a blanket under the tree,

94
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,680
 and then you use a wood stick,

95
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,880
 and then you beat the branches.

96
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,360
 When you beat the branches, the mature olives will fall,

97
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,120
 and then you will gather it underneath

98
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,680
 with a blanket or with baskets.

99
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,160
 So that's what it's talking about.

100
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,200
 When you beat the olive tree,

101
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,960
 when you harvest the olive tree,

102
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,580
 don't harvest to the end every single piece of olives.

103
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,520
 Leave it there.

104
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,600
 Why?

105
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,680
 Because after you harvest,

106
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,920
 then the poor and the needy,

107
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,680
 they will come to your field,

108
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,420
 and they can have their summit field.

109
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:59,220
 You see what it's saying?

110
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,440
 Okay, vineyard as well.

111
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,640
 You know, have you seen vineyard?

112
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,200
 Grapes, have you seen grapes?

113
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,040
 Whole food, right?

114
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,760
 Yeah, but vineyard, we're talking about vineyard, right?

115
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,560
 The branches, right?

116
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,880
 When the grapes mature, you're gonna clean them, right?

117
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
 You can take them down, cut them down.

118
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,200
 But what it says here is that you have to have leftover

119
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,920
 remaining in the vineyard, on the vines.

120
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,200
 Please, why?

121
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,000
 Because the needy will come by,

122
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,680
 and they can enjoy the fruit.

123
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,000
 That is what land management or farm management

124
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,160
 looks like in the Old Testament.

125
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,640
 And usually those laws,

126
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,920
 this kind of law, similar principles,

127
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,520
 are all over the place in the Old Testament.

128
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:47,960
 And usually they are followed by one clause,

129
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,640
 what we call the motive clause.

130
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:52,200
 Motive clause, verse 22.

131
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,700
 It gives you the motive.

132
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,800
 So the Torah is not just like,

133
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
 you know, I give you this principle, this commandment,

134
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,280
 and you have to observe it,

135
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:02,340
 so you can earn my favor, right?

136
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,660
 No.

137
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:06,100
 It gives you the motive clause.

138
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,260
 Remember that you were once slaves in the land of Egypt.

139
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:15,540
 Remember you were saved by grace.

140
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:18,860
 Remember I saved you by grace from Pharaoh, from Egypt.

141
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,960
 Now you settled down in the land.

142
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,040
 You should not imitate the oppressors, right?

143
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,740
 You should leave behind some resources

144
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,060
 so you can bless other people, right?

145
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:32,900
 You can be generous.

146
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,440
 So the promise of,

147
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,180
 they get to enter the land

148
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:41,300
 in order the land will be filled with,

149
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:44,740
 you know, resources, can bless other people.

150
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,700
 Again and again, the Bible tells us in the Old Testament,

151
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:54,860
 the land promise was already fulfilled.

152
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,180
 Not one word has failed.

153
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,740
 Everyone was fulfilled.

154
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:03,980
 Not one thing has fallen.

155
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,400
 Everything God promised to the Israelites were fulfilled.

156
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,500
 That's why they can settle down in the land,

157
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:13,700
 and then they build a kingdom, right?

158
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,980
 But of course, that's not how the story goes, right?

159
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,620
 In the Old Testament, when the people of God,

160
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,140
 they build their own kingdom, then they were divided,

161
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,340
 and they continue to oppress other people.

162
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:28,460
 And until 586 BC,

163
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:32,020
 God sent the Babylonians to destroy Jerusalem

164
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:35,220
 and the country of Judah,

165
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,500
 because they violate, they violate the Torah.

166
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,420
 So they were in exile.

167
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:45,020
 But then in exile, they came back, right?

168
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,580
 Under Ezra and Nehemiah,

169
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,380
 you can also call that second Exodus.

170
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:55,380
 And other Exodus, they came back from the exile land,

171
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,340
 back to Jerusalem, back to their homeland.

172
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:04,060
 But more importantly, when they came back to the land,

173
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,360
 they did not treat it as we conquest.

174
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,860
 They're not conquering the land again.

175
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,020
 When they came back to the land,

176
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:16,340
 they understand it is a regifting.

177
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,740
 God is regifting them a new, generous,

178
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:26,020
 a gracious opportunity to serve God.

179
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:30,420
 So you remember those guys, Ezra and Nehemiah, right?

180
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,660
 Came back, Ezra as a scribe,

181
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,700
 and teaching the people the Torah,

182
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:39,700
 and lead them into a spiritual revival, right?

183
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,740
 And then there was big, long prayer in Ezra chapter nine.

184
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:49,400
 And then Nehemiah had prayed the same prayer,

185
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:53,900
 or similar prayer in chapter nine of the book of Nehemiah.

186
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,940
 They all talk about the same thing, and with the same tone.

187
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,180
 And let's listen to their tone.

188
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:01,780
 In the midst of spiritual revival, back in the land,

189
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:04,580
 being regifted.

190
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:07,900
 Oh my God, I'm ashamed, utterly ashamed,

191
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:11,460
 for our sins are power higher than our heads.

192
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,980
 But now we have been given a brief moment of grace,

193
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:18,340
 for the Lord our God has allowed a few of us

194
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,220
 to survive as remnant.

195
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,740
 We are the remaining people,

196
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:25,260
 because we have abandoned your commands.

197
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,260
 There's no demand of God, giving them the land again.

198
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,140
 There's no demand of God that says,

199
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:36,620
 no, this land belong to us, because we were here first.

200
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:39,200
 There's no sense of entitlement,

201
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,560
 but only a sense of repentance, right?

202
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,080
 Knowing that God is now gracious enough to regift them,

203
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,360
 so that they can serve God in the land.

204
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:53,020
 And then the Old Testament story continues into,

205
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:57,100
 between the Old and New Testament,

206
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:59,140
 there were three to 400 years,

207
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,660
 and the people of God were still yearning

208
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,100
 for the real return.

209
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,140
 Because yeah, physically they are returned, right?

210
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,100
 They have returned to the land physically,

211
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,100
 but spiritually, politically,

212
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,620
 they were still under different empires, right?

213
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:18,620
 Persian empires, Greek empires, and then Roman empire.

214
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,760
 They did not have their freedom.

215
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,680
 And the people were looking forward,

216
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:29,200
 someday God will fulfill his promise again,

217
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,880
 fulfill his promise in the Messiah.

218
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,640
 So the second theme we have to think about

219
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,600
 is that the entire Old Testament

220
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:40,880
 is actually pointing forward to a goal.

221
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,380
 And that goal is our Lord Jesus Christ.

222
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,760
 In Jesus, we find that all the promises of the land

223
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,720
 and other promises are fulfilled.

224
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,440
 Yes, the people lost the land because of a sin.

225
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,440
 After exile, they were still up in the air.

226
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:01,960
 But not because God failed, God is faithful.

227
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,960
 The people failed, the other party of the covenant,

228
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,440
 they failed, they did not keep the covenant.

229
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,000
 Now this has to do with Jesus.

230
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,740
 Now think about how the New Testament,

231
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,260
 the first book of New Testament introduced Jesus.

232
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,460
 What is the first book of the New Testament?

233
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:24,700
 Gospel of Matthew, right, Matthew.

234
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,020
 The genealogies, right, from Abraham

235
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,820
 all the way down to Christ, and then the birth of Christ,

236
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:35,860
 and then living under an other pharaoh,

237
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:39,140
 Held the Great, and he was persecuted.

238
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:42,200
 And then the Holy Family, Joseph, Mary, and Joseph,

239
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,480
 they were kind of exiled from the land

240
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,360
 and they went down to Egypt, which is on the left-hand side.

241
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,240
 And then after the pharaoh, the new pharaoh,

242
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,560
 Held the Great died, they returned back to the land, right?

243
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,460
 So there's exile and return in the life of Jesus.

244
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:03,020
 So as you can see in the Bible,

245
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,720
 already in the first book of the New Testament,

246
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,100
 the Gospel of Matthew, they look at the life story of Jesus,

247
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,380
 his life, his mission, his ministry,

248
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:16,760
 his death and resurrection, in light of the story of Israel.

249
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,460
 Because in Jesus, no matter what happened to him,

250
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,680
 no matter what he did and what he said,

251
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,300
 they find that Jesus is the true Israelites

252
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:27,940
 who keeps the covenant perfectly.

253
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,780
 He fulfilled all the promise and secure all the promises

254
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,140
 for those who are in Christ.

255
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,980
 You are in Christ, I am in Christ.

256
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:40,980
 So in that sense, we share that promise,

257
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:46,500
 which is included, which the land is included.

258
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,140
 So in some sense, as we trace the entire Old Testament

259
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:52,860
 to New Testament, we know that, so listen up,

260
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,380
 Old Testament, the Old Testament is incomplete

261
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:00,880
 without the New Testament, right?

262
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,720
 If you read the entire Old Testament,

263
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,080
 which probably you haven't, right?

264
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:10,440
 But if you read them, all the books, 39 books,

265
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,620
 you come to the end, it's an open-end book.

266
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,320
 What is going on, right?

267
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,100
 We're still yearning for another episode, right?

268
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:22,560
 In some sense, you can imagine the Old Testament

269
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,560
 and New Testament as a unit, as an entire grand story

270
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,760
 that has a lot of episode.

271
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,640
 The Old Testament is episode one to episode 98.

272
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:39,440
 After 98, you're still yearning for something, right?

273
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,320
 The hope, the promise is unfulfilled.

274
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,320
 And then episode 99 is New Testament, right?

275
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:53,560
 Jesus came and he fulfilled all the promises.

276
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,520
 He secured the fulfillment.

277
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,200
 Where's episode number 100?

278
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,400
 It's the new heaven, new earth, right?

279
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:07,640
 That we're all going in Christ.

280
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:11,140
 In that sense, Old Testament and New Testament are a unit.

281
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,280
 So when you trace the land promise, the theme of land,

282
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:18,320
 you come to Jesus and Jesus fulfilled principally,

283
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,840
 fundamentally, he fulfilled that promise of inheritance,

284
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,640
 the promise of land.

285
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,740
 So in the New Testament, we are not looking forward

286
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:33,740
 to any point or any piece of property on earth.

287
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,380
 You cannot find it with a GPS.

288
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,640
 You find it in Jesus Christ, the living person

289
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,340
 who loved you and died for you and rose from the dead.

290
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:49,340
 Let me take a look at, fast forward to the book of Hebrews.

291
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:53,120
 Hebrews chapter 11.

292
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,360
 Remember this chapter is a list of faithful heroes, right?

293
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,960
 In the Old Testament.

294
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:02,720
 So-and-so is so faithful and they obtained the promise.

295
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,720
 And now come to 1110, Abraham, talking about Abraham.

296
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,720
 Abraham is the first story, the forefather of Israel.

297
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,520
 He was confidently looking forward to a city

298
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:20,520
 with eternal foundations, a city designed and built by God.

299
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,720
 So what was Abraham looking for?

300
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,680
 He was probably in episode three, right?

301
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,360
 Abraham in the Old Testament.

302
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:34,280
 He was looking forward or hoping for not a point

303
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:38,360
 on the map, not a physical point on the map,

304
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,000
 but looking forward to the heavenly city.

305
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,920
 And the New Testament is clear.

306
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,000
 It's clear the new city is in episode 100.

307
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,440
 Someday in Christ, we will see that new city

308
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,360
 coming down from heaven, the new Jerusalem to earth.

309
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,520
 And that is our hope.

310
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,960
 The Bible is clear, the fulfillment of land promise.

311
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:06,160
 Indeed, every promise of God is found none other

312
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,120
 than Jesus himself, Jesus Christ himself.

313
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:11,880
 Ephesians chapter one.

314
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:17,440
 It talks about how blessed we are in Christ.

315
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,160
 How many promises and how many blessings

316
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,360
 we receive in Christ.

317
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,000
 Chapter one, seven.

318
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 In Christ or in God, we have redemption through his blood.

319
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,640
 The forgiveness of our trespasses,

320
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,760
 according to the riches of his grace,

321
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,360
 which he lavished upon us.

322
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:43,360
 God is so resourceful and he is so willing

323
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,600
 to lavish on us blessing.

324
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,120
 I remember when my kids were younger,

325
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:56,160
 of course, young kids, they like candy, right?

326
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,640
 They like candy.

327
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:00,920
 I used to buy them some candy, right?

328
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:02,400
 And then they were so happy.

329
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:05,800
 When I buy them a little box of candy

330
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,680
 and they were overjoyed, right?

331
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:11,880
 Little did they know that my credit card

332
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:16,240
 can buy millions of candies.

333
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:21,000
 And I can shower upon their heads, right?

334
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,040
 That is what is happening here in Ephesians one.

335
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,280
 God is God of blessing.

336
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,280
 And in Jesus, we have so much riches of his grace,

337
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:38,680
 which he lavished upon us in all wisdom and insight.

338
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,840
 Verse nine, making known to us the mystery of his will

339
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:45,040
 according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ

340
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,140
 as a plan for the fullness of time

341
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,500
 to unite all things in Jesus,

342
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,340
 things in heaven and things on earth.

343
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,860
 Everything in the universe, everything in the cosmos

344
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,860
 is united together, found the fulfillment in Jesus Christ.

345
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:06,580
 Verse 11, in him we have obtained an inheritance, the land.

346
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,340
 And what is the land?

347
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:13,440
 Episode 100, new heaven and new earth.

348
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:19,380
 We have obtained the inheritance, the property in heaven,

349
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:20,980
 in new heaven, new earth,

350
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,980
 having been predestined according to the purposes of him

351
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:30,360
 who works all things according to the counsel of his will

352
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:34,220
 so that we who are the first to hope in Christ

353
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,220
 might be to the praise of his glory.

354
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,220
 This is episode 99, and telling us someday we will inherit.

355
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:48,580
 The inheritance, the land in episode 100.

356
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:53,360
 I know most of us live in Chicago, right?

357
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,060
 We live in Illinois, right?

358
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:00,060
 You know the most expensive house in Illinois?

359
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,380
 Where is it?

360
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:05,860
 The most expensive house in Illinois, in the state of Illinois.

361
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,700
 Where is it?

362
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,460
 Let me give you a clue, in Chicago.

363
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,600
 It is in Chicago.

364
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,860
 The most expensive house in the state of Illinois

365
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,820
 is in Chicago, in the city of Chicago, right?

366
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,340
 Have you seen it?

367
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:17,340
 Which neighborhood?

368
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:19,720
 Lincoln Park.

369
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,980
 Anyone from Lincoln Park?

370
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:25,540
 The most expensive house in Illinois

371
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,200
 is located in Chicago, Lincoln Park.

372
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,860
 The price for the house is 50 million.

373
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:38,460
 50 million, imagine that, one house, right?

374
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,460
 25,000 square feet, 11 bathrooms.

375
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,280
 Praise God, 11 bathrooms, right?

376
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:52,840
 Eight city lots, eight city lots, right?

377
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,680
 How many houses do you have?

378
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,980
 One house is one lot, right?

379
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,940
 Oh, no, no, no, one lot has so many houses, right?

380
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:05,020
 Eight city lots, big house, huge house.

381
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:10,540
 Imagine this most expensive house is God's inheritance.

382
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,620
 I'm using a very finite analogy, right?

383
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:17,600
 Imagine this is the inheritance that we have in Christ.

384
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:22,020
 Now, you don't get to live in that house yet, right?

385
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:27,020
 We're still in episode 99, but the key is given to you, right?

386
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:29,700
 If the key of the house is given to you,

387
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:33,700
 how you treat, where you gonna put your key?

388
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,100
 Where you put the house key?

389
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:40,660
 A 50 million dollar house, the key is already given to you.

390
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:43,160
 Someday you're gonna get into this mansion

391
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,460
 and you can enjoy the inheritance.

392
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:46,940
 Where you gonna keep the key?

393
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,680
 I don't know.

394
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:55,260
 I don't know, somewhere in the safe, right?

395
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,580
 Would you give it to your dog?

396
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,780
 Probably not, right?

397
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,580
 Hopefully not.

398
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,720
 That is the new heaven, new of the inheritance

399
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,500
 that Apostle Paul is telling us.

400
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:08,060
 In Christ, we have that gift.

401
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,900
 We have that inheritance, secure and fulfilled

402
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:12,220
 in Jesus Christ.

403
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:17,860
 That's why we are being gifted so much.

404
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:20,260
 And at the same time, if we understand

405
00:21:20,260 --> 00:21:24,740
 that we have experienced grace of God, right?

406
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,700
 The lavish grace of God.

407
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:33,340
 It should motivate us to be generous people, right?

408
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,260
 We are so generous.

409
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,580
 We can be so generous because we are so blessed.

410
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:41,420
 I know Thanksgiving is around the corner

411
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,300
 and I've been thinking about grace,

412
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,580
 the goodness of God, the blessing of God,

413
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:50,340
 and our responses.

414
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,620
 I wanna close today with a parable, a parable by Jesus.

415
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,260
 And usually when we hear this parable,

416
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,660
 when we study this parable,

417
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,260
 we don't read this parable with the perspective

418
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,900
 of inheritance, the father's house, right?

419
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,540
 The household, the big household.

420
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:15,660
 Usually we read this parable understanding the love of God.

421
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,900
 Yeah, definitely.

422
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,660
 But I wanna go through this parable with you

423
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,140
 and with this perspective.

424
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,940
 Remember the parable of prodigal son?

425
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,020
 The prodigal son?

426
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,900
 The younger son who is rebellious, right?

427
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,740
 And he took his inheritance and go to far country

428
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:37,580
 and waste them all, right?

429
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,100
 And he was suffering and he just thought on him,

430
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,180
 hey, maybe I should return to the father's house

431
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,260
 and rather be a servant, right?

432
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,580
 That's a parable of prodigal son.

433
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,500
 But actually if you read it carefully,

434
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,460
 the parable of prodigal son is parable of two sons.

435
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:58,380
 Two sons, the younger and the older, right?

436
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,540
 The younger and the firstborn.

437
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,980
 The younger son, as I said, goes away

438
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,740
 and spend all of his inheritance from the father

439
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,180
 and he suffered so much.

440
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,900
 And then the son realized the patience

441
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:12,660
 of the father is enduring, right?

442
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:17,660
 So he decided to just go back to the father's house.

443
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:23,060
 He hurts his father deeply and he knows

444
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:26,080
 he does not deserve the favor of God.

445
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:29,580
 So he made up his mind and say,

446
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:32,480
 no, I'm not worthy to be called my father's son,

447
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,300
 but I would rather go back to be one of his servants.

448
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,300
 So he goes back and he just wanna work for his father

449
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:44,020
 as a slave working for the master.

450
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:46,420
 But when the son returns home, what did he find?

451
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,460
 He does not see a stern master,

452
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,860
 but a loving and patient father waiting for him.

453
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,740
 The loving father is waiting for him.

454
00:23:57,740 --> 00:24:00,700
 He saw him and felt compassion and ran

455
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:03,620
 and embraced and kissed him.

456
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:07,300
 Now, this sort of actions, usually in that kind of culture,

457
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:11,560
 in biblical culture, means humiliation.

458
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:14,820
 Old men don't run.

459
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,900
 They walk slowly, right?

460
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:21,100
 And respectfully, keeping their honor.

461
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:23,700
 But this father seeing the younger son coming back,

462
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:27,620
 he ran and embraced him and kissed him

463
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,140
 and threw a party for him and celebrate.

464
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,640
 So the son returns home,

465
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:36,060
 returned to his father's land and inheritance.

466
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:42,860
 Now, at this point, the firstborn,

467
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,260
 the elder son came back, right?

468
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:48,460
 And how did he react?

469
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:53,240
 He comes home from the farm

470
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,060
 and he heard about the celebration

471
00:24:56,060 --> 00:25:01,060
 for the long lost younger brother, but he was angry.

472
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,740
 He said, "It's not fair."

473
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,720
 Why?

474
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,060
 Because he has been working so hard, right,

475
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,700
 to earn his father's favor.

476
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:14,140
 And he was angry against his father

477
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:17,120
 and the younger son, his brother,

478
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,540
 because he has been working so hard

479
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:22,500
 to earn the favor of God.

480
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,640
 And the father never threw a party for him.

481
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,780
 He, the elder son, is a dutiful son.

482
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:33,540
 He's a very faithful son, but he never realized, sadly,

483
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:37,720
 he is already living in and enjoying

484
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,560
 all the inheritance of the father,

485
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,840
 all the inheritance of the father,

486
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:44,880
 every single day since he was born.

487
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:50,900
 He would enjoy it and he would inherit

488
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,020
 all the land and inheritance.

489
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,200
 You see here, the two sons,

490
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:02,200
 one find that God's favor is undeserved.

491
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,800
 The other one is trying, working so hard

492
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,600
 in order to earn that, right?

493
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,760
 And the parable ends with, you know,

494
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:15,760
 you don't have to do that because God is so rich

495
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,440
 and God has blessed you and give you the inheritance.

496
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,960
 Now, usually theologians would define grace

497
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,400
 as unmerited favor.

498
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,360
 What does it mean, unmerited favor?

499
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,700
 It means that you don't deserve the grace of God,

500
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,360
 the love of God.

501
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:39,160
 Nonetheless, God loves you.

502
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:41,540
 God loves you even you don't deserve it,

503
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,660
 even you feel you don't deserve it.

504
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,460
 God still loves you.

505
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,320
 That is grace, right?

506
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,280
 No debate about it, unmerited favor.

507
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,760
 You don't deserve it, unmerited, but it comes upon you.

508
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,580
 But this is only one side of the coin.

509
00:26:57,580 --> 00:27:03,320
 I will say grace is also dismerited favor.

510
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,400
 Now, what does it mean, dismerited favor?

511
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,720
 I don't know how to translate in Chinese,

512
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,200
 so yeah, don't worry about it.

513
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,080
 It's called dismerited favor.

514
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:16,480
 What it means is that you deserve judgment.

515
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,600
 We sinners, we deserve condemnation,

516
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,420
 yet condemnation does not come to us.

517
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:29,280
 God forgives.

518
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:34,280
 God forgives us even we do deserve condemnation.

519
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,880
 That is dismerited favor.

520
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,800
 It's not just unmerited favor, it's dismerited favor.

521
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,320
 This ought to be the motivation

522
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:46,060
 for our entire Christian life, right?

523
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,380
 You don't have to work so hard to earn God's favor,

524
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:56,060
 but it has given to you unmerited and dismerited.

525
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,260
 Once we experience the grace of God,

526
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:04,940
 our relationship with God should be motivated

527
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:09,180
 by a grateful response.

528
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:12,900
 Since God loves me so much, and I'm not worthy,

529
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:18,900
 I'm not dismerited, yet God's love comes upon my life,

530
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,620
 and I want to respond to God with gratitude,

531
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:25,260
 with worship, with my service.

532
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:28,540
 Yesterday, I read something really,

533
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,240
 I think it's meaningful for this season, Thanksgiving.

534
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,260
 That short piece is about gratefulness and gratitude.

535
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,440
 It's a reminder for me,

536
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:43,460
 and I want to close my sermon with this.

537
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:48,420
 There's a fine line between doing things for God

538
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:51,460
 with a strong sense of responsibility,

539
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:56,460
 and serving God with gratitude, gratefulness.

540
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,380
 So that short piece talks about this.

541
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,940
 Let me run it through.

542
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:08,080
 Grateful for, house to clean.

543
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:11,020
 You can take it as, I have to clean my house.

544
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,580
 Such a burden for me, right?

545
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,500
 Have you cleaned your house lately?

546
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,420
 Such a burden.

547
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:21,440
 But you can also reflect it on the other side.

548
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,420
 Yeah, I can clean my house because I'm grateful.

549
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,780
 God has given me a safe shelter to live.

550
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:32,100
 Doing laundry, right?

551
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:33,820
 It sucks doing laundry.

552
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:36,580
 I don't do it, my wife does.

553
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:38,700
 It sucks.

554
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,460
 But consider, we are doing laundry

555
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:47,460
 because God has been so blessing us with clothes to wear.

556
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,580
 Doing dishes, last night I was doing dishes,

557
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,940
 a lot of dishes, because my son came back

558
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,300
 to spend the night.

559
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,700
 Yeah, there were so many dishes, right?

560
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,380
 I do dishes, it sucks.

561
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:06,820
 You know, it come from a spirit of just being responsible.

562
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,000
 The elder son, by the way, the elder son.

563
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,400
 I'm working so hard, right?

564
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:16,220
 But gratitude says, we have food to eat, right?

565
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,020
 That's why we do dishes.

566
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,740
 Grocery shopping, right?

567
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,660
 It's routine, it's tedious.

568
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:26,180
 But God has provided me money, it's proficient.

569
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,420
 I have to clean toilets.

570
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,860
 But thank God for indoor plumbing.

571
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,660
 There were a lot of noise in my life,

572
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:38,660
 but thank God, we have people around us

573
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,100
 who care about us.

574
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,380
 There are endless questions about homework,

575
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,580
 for the kids especially, right?

576
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,500
 Endless assignments they have to do.

577
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:49,960
 Oh, so tired.

578
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:56,020
 But gratefulness says, hey, my kids are growing, right?

579
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,060
 Early wake-ups, just like this morning, right?

580
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,620
 Early wake-ups.

581
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,840
 Or Monday, right?

582
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,720
 Anyone has Monday blue?

583
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,220
 I do, right?

584
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:11,820
 Oh, what a day, we have to drag our body,

585
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:14,060
 you know, away from the mattress, right?

586
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,100
 To wake up, early wake-up.

587
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,440
 But hey, if you're taking care of the young kids,

588
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,140
 children to love, praise God.

589
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:26,900
 Throwing tire in bed, it sucks.

590
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,480
 But thank God I'm still alive.

591
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:33,900
 And by the way, ties an offering, right?

592
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,040
 One-tenth of our income goes into offering.

593
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,880
 Um, it feels burdensome.

594
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,520
 Yeah, I must say that, you know,

595
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,320
 I'm a Christian for many, many years.

596
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:50,660
 I feel like ties and offering, yeah, right?

597
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:55,000
 Yeah, it would be heaven if there was no ties and offering.

598
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:59,720
 However, gratefulness says,

599
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:03,000
 I do have the resources to bless other people, right?

600
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,600
 Last week we had the General Assembly

601
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,760
 and usually at the end of the year,

602
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,880
 all the churches and most of the organizations

603
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,300
 are lacking some resources.

604
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,480
 We do, our church does, yeah.

605
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,720
 It's challenging this year, right?

606
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:23,720
 Yesterday I was dining out in a restaurant with someone

607
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:26,720
 and then I paid the bill.

608
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,000
 $30 each person.

609
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,920
 $30 a meal, right?

610
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,660
 That's crazy, I didn't have enough.

611
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:40,140
 I was still hungry, leaving the restaurant, right?

612
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,860
 So I paid $60, right?

613
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,620
 The biggest struggle I have these days,

614
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:46,640
 dining out, is the tips.

615
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:50,740
 Can I cut the tips, right?

616
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,880
 Life is hard.

617
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,740
 But gratitude says,

618
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:59,060
 we have the resources to bless other people.

619
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,620
 God is too good.

620
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,860
 God is too resourceful.

621
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,500
 God of blessing.

622
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,300
 Let's all pray.

623
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:13,540
 Father, thank you for being our God, our infinite God.

624
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:17,540
 And you are the God of blessings.

625
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,920
 You are the God full of resources.

626
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:22,260
 And you are infinite.

627
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,120
 And your love never exhausts.

628
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,860
 Your patience towards us never exhausts.

629
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:32,540
 Thank you for being our great God.

630
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:34,660
 Thank you for the fact that in Christ,

631
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:38,420
 we enjoy the unmerited,

632
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,760
 dismerited favor.

633
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,600
 That we are in Christ, no more condemnation.

634
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,620
 And in Christ, we have new life.

635
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:49,020
 Thank you for all the good things

636
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:51,460
 that you have showered upon us.

637
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:54,500
 Especially as we end our service with communion,

638
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,960
 we pick up the bread and the cup of grape juice

639
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,900
 to remember how great you are

640
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,360
 and your love is so great.

641
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,500
 Beyond our comprehension,

642
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,380
 yet becomes a reality in our life.

643
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,700
 Encourage us and give us hope.

644
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:16,700
 Give us this new strength to live for you,

645
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:18,660
 to serve you.

646
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,560
 In Christ, we pray.
