1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,160
 - Alright guys, let's turn to our scripture today.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,560
 And may I invite you to go to your phone app

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,980
 or to your Bible.

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:14,940
 We're going to continue our series on basics, okay?

5
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:16,880
 Let's master the basics.

6
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,980
 There are so many basic exercise or habits

7
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,780
 as a question we need to master.

8
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:26,940
 So I introduced to you many weeks ago

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,780
 the verse of the week.

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:32,240
 And this is the verse of last week.

11
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:33,900
 Remember that?

12
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:36,440
 Alright, can we recite it together?

13
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,280
 Let's do it in English.

14
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,040
 Don't worry about anything, instead pray about everything.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,100
 Tell God what you need and thank Him for what He has done.

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:47,420
 Then you will experience God's peace,

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:50,360
 which exceeds anything we can understand.

18
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,760
 His peace will guide your hearts and minds

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,240
 as we live in Christ Jesus, alright?

20
00:00:55,240 --> 00:01:00,240
 So we got the Chinese translation for many of you.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,540
 This is the verse of last week.

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,360
 And today we're going to introduce another verse.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,360
 However, we're going to go through the passage of today.

24
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:14,440
 My sermon is taken, centered on this passage,

25
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:17,600
 this famous passage from the book of Romans.

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,140
 Romans chapter 12, verse one.

27
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:24,600
 "Therefore I urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercy,

28
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,400
 "to offer your bodies as living sacrifices,

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,720
 "holy and pleasing to God."

30
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,360
 This is your spiritual act of worship.

31
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,160
 "Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world,

32
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:39,840
 "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,

33
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,920
 "and you will be able to test and approve

34
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,560
 "what God's will is, His good and pleasing perfect will."

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,840
 And that is the first two verses,

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,140
 and we continue, verse three.

37
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,020
 "For by the grace given me, I say to every one of you,

38
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,120
 "do not think of yourself more highly than you ought,

39
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,180
 "but rather think of yourself with sober judgment,

40
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,460
 "in accordance with the measure of faith God has given you,

41
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:11,460
 "just as each of you has one body with many members,

42
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,380
 "and these members do not all have the same function."

43
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:19,900
 So in Christ, we who are many form one body,

44
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:23,300
 and each member belongs to all the others.

45
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:26,220
 "We all have different gifts,

46
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,700
 "according to the grace given us.

47
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:31,140
 "If a man's gift is prophesying,

48
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,020
 "let him use it in proportion to his faith.

49
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,100
 "If it is serving, let him serve.

50
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,100
 "If it is teaching, let him teach.

51
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,940
 "If it is encouraging, let him encourage.

52
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,720
 "If it is contributing to the needs of others,

53
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,100
 "let him give generously.

54
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,600
 "If it is leadership, let him govern diligently.

55
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:55,480
 "If it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully."

56
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,780
 Now that is from the book of Romans, chapter 12.

57
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,540
 And that is, as I said,

58
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,940
 is one of the well-known passages in the Bible,

59
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,860
 especially in the New Testament.

60
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,100
 And there is some background we need to understand

61
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,780
 as we read this passage.

62
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:15,340
 Now, all of the Bible passages were written

63
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,340
 to a specific context or specific need of a congregation.

64
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:22,700
 This is not new to us,

65
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:27,260
 but as long as we get more familiar

66
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,180
 with the background of the Bible,

67
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:31,660
 then we understand what God is saying, right?

68
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,460
 Then we understand what this passage is all about.

69
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,740
 So some of the background.

70
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:39,300
 This letter is written by Paul, the apostle Paul,

71
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:42,780
 the pastor Paul, a missionary,

72
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,620
 founding churches in many cities in the Roman Empire.

73
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,540
 And this letter is written by him, by Paul,

74
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,240
 to the Romans, so-called the Romans,

75
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,100
 because those are the Christians

76
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,500
 and house churches in the city of Rome.

77
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:02,500
 And as you know, Rome was the center of Roman Empire,

78
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:05,860
 of the center of the world in Paul's day.

79
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:10,860
 And the relationship between Paul and the Roman Christians,

80
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,580
 the Christians, the house churches in Rome

81
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,580
 are somewhat interesting because Paul did not establish,

82
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:22,900
 did not plant the church in Rome.

83
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,460
 In fact, he had never been to Rome

84
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:28,420
 until the end of the Book of Acts.

85
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:31,340
 And when he wrote this letter to the Roman Christians,

86
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,420
 he had never been there.

87
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,620
 He said he wanted to visit Rome someday on his way to Spain.

88
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,100
 Well, we don't know whether Paul

89
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,880
 has traveled to Spain or not.

90
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,960
 However, he wrote this letter,

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,200
 and at that time, he did not come to Rome,

92
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:50,440
 and he never planted the church in Rome.

93
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,360
 But there are Christians,

94
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,580
 there are house churches in Rome nonetheless.

95
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,980
 And we don't know who brought the gospel

96
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:01,220
 to the people in Rome,

97
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:03,780
 and why there were some house churches

98
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,820
 being established in Rome.

99
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:10,560
 So who brought the gospel to Rome in the first place?

100
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,960
 Remember chapter two of Book of Acts,

101
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,120
 very familiar chapter, Pentecost, right?

102
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:21,120
 When the Holy Spirit descended on the apostles,

103
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
 and they began to preach the gospel,

104
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,480
 and Peter begins to preach to the people,

105
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,000
 and 3,000 people came to faith, right?

106
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,760
 And they were baptized by water,

107
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,320
 and they became Christians.

108
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:38,440
 And on the day of Pentecost,

109
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:43,360
 there were many Jews in Jerusalem.

110
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,640
 And the Book of Acts tells us

111
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,360
 there were many Jews come from other places

112
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,120
 of the Roman Empire.

113
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,840
 Some come from today's Turkey,

114
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,000
 some come from today's Egypt,

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,040
 some come from even Rome,

116
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:00,600
 because in Acts 2.10, it tells us

117
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,000
 there were some Jewish people coming from the city of Rome,

118
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,720
 from the capital city of Rome.

119
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,000
 And they were visiting Jerusalem for the festival,

120
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,360
 for Pentecost, and for Passover before Pentecost.

121
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,580
 And they just happened to be there.

122
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:19,020
 And the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles,

123
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:21,120
 and they began to preach the gospel,

124
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,880
 and many of them became Christians.

125
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,540
 And I think surely they also came to faith,

126
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:33,240
 and they brought the gospel back to their home city in Rome.

127
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,240
 So I think they found the house churches in Rome.

128
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:45,040
 And in the very beginning period of the church in Rome,

129
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:52,340
 we can imagine the Jewish people

130
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:57,340
 and their Gentile Christians gathered together, right?

131
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,480
 So that was the picture,

132
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,720
 the reality of house churches in Rome.

133
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,520
 Again, it's by some sort of lay Christians,

134
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,360
 white Jewish Christians,

135
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,400
 they brought the gospel back to Rome,

136
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,860
 and they probably attract other people,

137
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:15,480
 and some of the Gentile Christians.

138
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:20,200
 And they gather together in different houses in Rome,

139
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:25,200
 and that's how house churches in Rome began.

140
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,400
 But, but, but in AD 49, AD 49, okay?

141
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:34,760
 So in your mind, imagine there's a timeline, okay?

142
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,880
 There's timeline.

143
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,880
 You put cross there, it's about AD 30, AD 30, all right?

144
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,640
 And Jesus died and rose again,

145
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,680
 and he ascended to heaven, right?

146
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,480
 And the Holy Spirit came on the day of Pentecost.

147
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,480
 Now, that was around AD 30.

148
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,080
 But in AD 49, everything changed,

149
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,320
 especially in the city of Rome.

150
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,160
 Why?

151
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,160
 Because at that time, Roman emperor named Claudius,

152
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,680
 and he issued a decree to ban all the Jews

153
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,320
 from the city of Rome.

154
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,040
 So, so Claudius, the emperor,

155
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:18,660
 kicked out all the Jewish people from the city of Rome.

156
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,160
 And as you can imagine,

157
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,000
 some of them are being kicked out of Rome

158
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,960
 were definitely Jewish Christians,

159
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,600
 and they originally belonged to the house churches in Rome,

160
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
 right?

161
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,080
 And actually we find that in the book of Acts, chapter 18.

162
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,680
 Here, the map clearly shows where Rome is, right?

163
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,680
 And Paul is writing the letter to the Romans from Corinth,

164
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,880
 right?

165
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,480
 And there were house churches

166
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,700
 mixed with Jewish and Gentile Christians in Rome,

167
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,020
 but AD 49,

168
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,900
 Claudius commanded all the Jews to leave Rome.

169
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,960
 And we find that in Acts 18.

170
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,760
 Acts 18, what happened here

171
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,960
 was that Paul was doing mission in different cities,

172
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,540
 and he came to Corinth,

173
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:15,020
 and he found a Jew there named Aquila,

174
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:18,260
 and he was a native of Pontus.

175
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:23,260
 Pontus was today's Northern Turkey.

176
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,700
 And this guy is called Aquila,

177
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,040
 and he was a Jew,

178
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,600
 and Paul met him because he come from Italy

179
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,700
 with his wife Priscilla.

180
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,720
 So this couple was being kicked out of Rome,

181
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,240
 and they were in Corinth,

182
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,200
 and they met Paul,

183
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,640
 and Paul preached to them.

184
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,560
 And Acts 18 explains,

185
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:51,040
 because Claudius, the emperor,

186
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:55,040
 had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome, okay?

187
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,860
 So that's pretty interesting, AD 49, right?

188
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,780
 Remember, the house churches in Rome

189
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:04,540
 were mixed with Jewish and Gentile Christians, right?

190
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,400
 They were all calling the name of Jesus,

191
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,420
 and they worshiped together.

192
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:13,160
 But AD 49, after Claudius kicked out all the Jews

193
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,100
 out of Rome,

194
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:18,300
 overnight, the church in Rome

195
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,820
 became virtually 100% Gentile.

196
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:24,660
 Right, it's not hard to imagine, right?

197
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,720
 Kick out some of the Jews,

198
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:29,020
 and then what you left in the house churches in Rome

199
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,960
 were Gentiles.

200
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,140
 And the Gentile Christians, naturally,

201
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:36,320
 would take over the leadership of the church.

202
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,200
 And so they were minority,

203
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,660
 and now the Jews are being kicked out.

204
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:45,300
 The Jewish Christians left the city.

205
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,220
 They became the majority.

206
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,900
 And by the time Paul writes from Corinth,

207
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:56,020
 writing the letter of Rome,

208
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:59,980
 it was about AD 57, eight years later,

209
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,500
 and some of the Jews were allowed

210
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,540
 to go back to their home city, Rome.

211
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,220
 But when the Jewish people came back to the church,

212
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,660
 and they find that the church was dominant by Gentiles,

213
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:17,500
 right, now before AD 49,

214
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:21,060
 the Jewish Christians were the majority.

215
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,340
 After AD 49, they became the minority.

216
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:27,300
 And you can imagine the tension,

217
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,100
 the social tension, or the leadership tension

218
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,880
 created by such a situation.

219
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,020
 And by and large,

220
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:39,160
 Paul is writing the letter to Romans

221
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,420
 to address some of the problems or tensions

222
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,180
 that happened in the church.

223
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:44,060
 You got that?

224
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:46,100
 All right, it's very easy, right?

225
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,900
 Now, you wanna do a pop quiz?

226
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:52,820
 All right, so remember, AD 49 is the watershed

227
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:55,100
 for the house churches in Rome.

228
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,820
 And all of a sudden, the Gentiles became

229
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:01,380
 the dominant people, and they take over the leadership,

230
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,220
 and they despise the Jews who came back.

231
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,220
 And Paul is writing this letter

232
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,380
 to address some of the issues

233
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:13,140
 or some of the tensions and debates inside the church.

234
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,660
 There are two points we can find in this passage.

235
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:20,980
 So the letter to the Romans

236
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,100
 is the longest letter in the New Testament,

237
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,420
 the longest letter.

238
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:30,700
 And Paul used the first 11 chapters to explain,

239
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,700
 to emphasize that Jesus came to save Jews and Gentiles alike.

240
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,780
 At the foot of the cross, the ground is level,

241
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:42,180
 and all have sinned, Paul said, chapter three.

242
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,500
 Everyone falls short of the glory of God.

243
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,740
 But in chapter 10, Paul proclaims,

244
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,020
 everyone who calls on the name of Jesus will be saved,

245
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,260
 whether you're a Jew or you're a Gentile,

246
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,460
 because the ground at the foot of the cross is level,

247
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,940
 and that is the mercy of God, right?

248
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,780
 We never deserve the grace of God, right?

249
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:08,700
 Only because what Jesus has done for us,

250
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,260
 and that is the mercy of God.

251
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,780
 And in Christ, Paul reminds us,

252
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,020
 we are one new people now, right?

253
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:23,140
 Now, you may center your identity on your ethnicity.

254
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:27,920
 I am a Jew, I am a Gentile, right?

255
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,340
 I am from a certain ethnic group.

256
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:33,820
 But Paul is saying, when you come to the cross,

257
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,180
 when you receive the mercy of God,

258
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:40,580
 undeserved, and in Christ, we are now one people,

259
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,900
 and we have the new identity in Jesus Christ.

260
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,700
 And that is the most important identity.

261
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,660
 And that's why the church is the new people of God.

262
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:53,580
 And we come to chapter 12 of the book of Romans.

263
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,780
 Paul is saying, I urge you, brothers,

264
00:13:57,780 --> 00:14:00,800
 in view of God's mercy, right?

265
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,780
 Now, you have heard me explain for 11 chapters

266
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:09,700
 of the mercy of God on Jews and Gentiles alike.

267
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:12,820
 And Paul is saying, chapter 12 verse one.

268
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:16,540
 Therefore, I urge you, brothers, right?

269
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,260
 Or brothers and sisters, siblings.

270
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,100
 You know, this is one of Paul's most favorite term

271
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,860
 to describe Christian relationship.

272
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:29,100
 He could have used the temple,

273
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,260
 he could have used the people,

274
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:34,340
 but the most favorite term Paul uses

275
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,100
 to describe our relationship as Christians

276
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,540
 is siblings, brothers and sisters in Christ.

277
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,260
 And so often, we see each other

278
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,080
 based on our common background, right?

279
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,080
 Common language, race, or interest.

280
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:56,380
 And sometimes we fail to see each other in the church

281
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:00,420
 on the sole basis of God's mercy and grace, right?

282
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,980
 We come here, we call each other

283
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:04,780
 sisters and brothers in Christ

284
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:08,620
 because God has done something in your life, in my life.

285
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:11,020
 God has created something new.

286
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:13,100
 And look around, right?

287
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,460
 This is something new, this is something unheard of,

288
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,220
 or you have never thought about,

289
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:21,020
 that God is putting you and me together

290
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,540
 in this new society, right?

291
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,540
 New people.

292
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,420
 He created a new society of siblings,

293
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,140
 our people from all walks of life, right?

294
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:35,140
 We're so different, we're so distinct, right?

295
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,140
 But God is calling everyone in Christ,

296
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,700
 Jews and Gentiles, right?

297
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:44,260
 All kinds of people, East and West, right?

298
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,020
 Coming together to be a people, right?

299
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,260
 I have been to different churches.

300
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,620
 I've always been amazed by, you know,

301
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:59,460
 how the people are so different,

302
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,820
 but God put us together, right?

303
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:04,860
 I'm so thankful I'm not the only guy there,

304
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:07,820
 and no one looks like me, right?

305
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,500
 Everyone looks different, right?

306
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,620
 Everyone comes from a different walks of life,

307
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,580
 so that is the mercy of God.

308
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,780
 And Paul continues to tell us,

309
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,620
 because of the mercy of God that we receive

310
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:22,100
 as brother and sister, we need to offer your bodies

311
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,060
 as living sacrifices to God.

312
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,540
 And Paul, I think he has in mind

313
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,500
 a different and new sacrifice, right?

314
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,300
 A living sacrifice, right?

315
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,380
 All the sacrifices are dead, right?

316
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,860
 Dead animals.

317
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,300
 And Paul is saying, as we come together,

318
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,180
 as we receive the mercy of God,

319
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,460
 it is not offering animals anymore.

320
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:47,180
 We offer ourselves, right?

321
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:50,940
 And we offer ourselves as living beings,

322
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,940
 living bodies, how we live and how we think,

323
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:59,940
 how we speak, how we act, how we relate to each other.

324
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:02,460
 It's like a sacrifice to God, right?

325
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:04,860
 How we build our family, how we guide our children,

326
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:07,940
 how we serve, how we participate in fellowship and worship

327
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,820
 is also a sacrifice.

328
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:12,060
 It's like a worship to God, right?

329
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,220
 And here the English says spiritual act of worship.

330
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:17,860
 I think a better translation is a reasonable,

331
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:21,020
 reasonable act of worship.

332
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,420
 Or even a better translation is gospel field.

333
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,940
 Gospel shaped act of worship.

334
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,900
 We come here and it's not because it's convenient to come.

335
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,300
 We come here because of Jesus Christ, right?

336
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,500
 And he continues to say, do not conform any longer

337
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,780
 to the pattern of this world.

338
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,340
 The way of life in this world

339
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:47,940
 means the way of life in the Roman empire, right?

340
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,900
 The Roman way is I dominate you, right?

341
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,580
 I have power, you have no power.

342
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:57,140
 So the powerful is ruling the powerless.

343
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,340
 The strong is ruling against the weak, right?

344
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:04,100
 And I think this phrase, do not conform any longer

345
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,540
 to the pattern of this world,

346
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,380
 I think the best paraphrase is from a very,

347
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:16,740
 is from an older English paraphrase Bible called J.B. Phillips.

348
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:20,700
 So J.B. Phillips was a pastor and translator of the Bible

349
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,540
 and he translated New Testament in contemporary English.

350
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:28,580
 He translated this phrase, do not conform any longer

351
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,940
 to the pattern of this world as, listen up,

352
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:36,060
 do not let this world around you squeeze you

353
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:41,060
 into its own mold, but let God remove your mind from within.

354
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:47,380
 J.B. Phillips, yeah, pretty good, right?

355
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:51,700
 Do not let this world squeeze you into its own mold, right?

356
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:55,540
 Do not let the pattern of the world,

357
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,220
 the Roman way or the secular way to mold you.

358
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:04,100
 Don't let it squeeze into the worldly mold,

359
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:10,300
 but let God shapes your mind and mold your mind from within.

360
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:14,940
 There's constant pressure in this world to shape us,

361
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,180
 to squeeze us, to be like the world.

362
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,740
 But as Christians, as we receive the mercy of God,

363
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,740
 the true way of life is conforming to Jesus Christ himself.

364
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:30,660
 So point number one, I have it is we,

365
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:33,140
 each and every one of us together,

366
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,460
 we are living sacrifice to God.

367
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,260
 We are worship.

368
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,260
 We are like an act of worship,

369
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,420
 not only by singing in the first 15 minutes, right?

370
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,300
 We sing, how many songs do we sing today?

371
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:50,540
 Three, right?

372
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,380
 Three.

373
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,580
 We sing the songs and we follow the PowerPoint.

374
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,940
 It's not just that.

375
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,860
 Worship is not just that.

376
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,780
 Worship is our whole being.

377
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,580
 We live together.

378
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:06,060
 We act together as a pleasing sacrifice,

379
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:07,980
 as a pleasing worship to God.

380
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:12,060
 And let the word of grace shape us

381
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,620
 instead of the words from the world, right?

382
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:18,220
 That's the two verses in the beginning.

383
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:21,700
 And three to eight, Paul reminds the church,

384
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:25,300
 reminds us who we are and what we are to do.

385
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:29,780
 Basically, he said, we are the body of Christ.

386
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:32,300
 We are the new body of Christ.

387
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,660
 So he said, "By the grace given to me,

388
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,900
 "I say to every one of you,

389
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,600
 "do not think yourself more highly than you are,

390
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:42,000
 "but rather think of yourself with sober judgment

391
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,580
 "in accordance to the measure of faith God has given you."

392
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:48,040
 So God has given us different levels of faith,

393
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,820
 different levels of maturity, different levels of abilities.

394
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:55,060
 Verse four, "Just as each of us has one body

395
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,980
 "with many members,

396
00:20:56,980 --> 00:21:00,160
 "these members do not have the same function."

397
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,640
 And the analogy goes that in Christ now,

398
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:08,640
 we form one body and each member belongs to all the others.

399
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,600
 That's a wonderful verse, right?

400
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,160
 In the body of Christ,

401
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:19,080
 our relationship to each other has changed.

402
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,700
 It's defined by God,

403
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,440
 none other than God.

404
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,900
 And God defined our relationship with each other.

405
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:31,920
 And God has given us different measures of faith gifts,

406
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,160
 right, some special abilities,

407
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,180
 some special calling to all of us,

408
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:38,140
 whether we are Jew or Gentiles,

409
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:42,160
 whether you are high up in the social status

410
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,820
 or low in the social status,

411
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:45,760
 with status or without status.

412
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,500
 Christ has redefined our relationship.

413
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:51,840
 To the Romans, to the first audience of this letter,

414
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,020
 body, when they say body,

415
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,880
 it was a political term

416
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,440
 because politicians in the Roman Empire

417
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,040
 and in the Greek world,

418
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:07,040
 they like to use the analogy of body

419
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:12,040
 to describe the citizens of the city

420
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:14,640
 or citizens in the empire.

421
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,280
 You belong to body, to one body,

422
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,240
 the politician would say.

423
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:21,120
 That's why you need to be united

424
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,160
 and you have to vote for me, right?

425
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,660
 You have to support me.

426
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:27,560
 That's how the Roman politicians would say

427
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,840
 when they use the term body.

428
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,120
 They're talking about political unit,

429
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,900
 body of citizens.

430
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,080
 To the Romans, as I said,

431
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,300
 the rulers were dominant over the ruled.

432
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,720
 The slaves need to obey the leaders.

433
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,400
 The men are above, on top of women, over the slaves.

434
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,240
 And that will be peace.

435
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,440
 To the Romans, this is Roman peace.

436
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:55,920
 But Paul is using the same term in a subversive way.

437
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,280
 He's using the same term, body,

438
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:03,560
 and to tell us, hey, in here,

439
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,300
 in this new community, this new society,

440
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,160
 relationship is defined and configured differently.

441
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:13,120
 Verse four, he says,

442
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:17,120
 "One body with many members and different functions.

443
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,840
 "Each member of the church,

444
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,600
 "each member here is gifted in some way."

445
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,320
 Aren't you amazed, you know,

446
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:32,740
 some people are gifted in very different ways, right?

447
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:37,840
 You may be gifted in cooking, right?

448
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,480
 I'm certainly not gifted, right?

449
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,200
 I'm certainly not gifted.

450
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,080
 Before, my son is spending the summer here,

451
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,420
 and because of him, we have good food.

452
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,640
 You know why?

453
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:55,640
 Because I approach food in a very practical way, right?

454
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,120
 I don't care whether it tastes good or not, right?

455
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,600
 As long as it fills my stomach,

456
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,360
 and I continue to work, right?

457
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,680
 I approach food, it's a very, very, very

458
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,800
 despising way to him, right?

459
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,200
 But he makes good food,

460
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:11,220
 and he's so gifted in that way, right?

461
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:14,720
 And some of people are gifted in leading,

462
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,880
 and some of us are gifted in teaching.

463
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
 Some of us are gifted in caring.

464
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,440
 And many different abilities, many different gifts

465
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,440
 that the Bible says has different function, right?

466
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,020
 And the word function, in verse four,

467
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:39,200
 you see that these members do not all have the same function.

468
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,240
 The Greek, the original Greek term is praxis.

469
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:49,200
 Praxis, that's how we get the English word practice, right?

470
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,380
 So Paul is saying members do not all have the same praxis,

471
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:57,940
 do not all have the same practical function.

472
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,460
 And this word is telling us

473
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,140
 not only we receive some spiritual gifts,

474
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,220
 we have to use them.

475
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:06,620
 Spiritual gifts or spiritual abilities

476
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,540
 are not to be owned or possessed by the individuals.

477
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:13,780
 Each one of us needs to discover our spiritual gift.

478
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:17,060
 We discover our spiritual gifts,

479
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,340
 and we need to develop,

480
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,300
 we need to grow our spiritual gifts

481
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:26,140
 and use them in praxis, in practice,

482
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:28,580
 to use it for the good of the church,

483
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,620
 for the good of others.

484
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:35,620
 No one, no one, no question in the church is an audience.

485
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:39,900
 Every one of us is performing something.

486
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,060
 Every one of us is doing something

487
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,300
 and performing our practical function.

488
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:47,460
 And that's what Paul meant when he continues to say,

489
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,180
 "We have different gifts," verse six,

490
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:52,180
 "according to the grace given to us."

491
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:56,660
 A man may be gifted in prophesying, right?

492
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,100
 Now again, let me remind you,

493
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,980
 prophesying in the Bible, in biblical terms,

494
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:03,700
 is not predicting whether it will rain tomorrow

495
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:04,980
 at 3.30 p.m.

496
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,260
 It's not predicting.

497
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,740
 Prophesying is proclaiming the word of God,

498
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,780
 the authoritative word of God.

499
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,340
 That's what the prophets did in the Old Testament.

500
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:17,100
 And that's what people who are gifted

501
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,100
 in prophesying will do.

502
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:22,860
 They would preach according to scripture

503
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:25,820
 and let him use it in proportion of his faith.

504
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,100
 Verse seven, "If you're gifted to serve, let him serve."

505
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:34,500
 By the way, this church is so blessed

506
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,540
 to have many people who are gifted in serving.

507
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:39,300
 You know what it means?

508
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,580
 You know what it looks like?

509
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,500
 People always work in the background, right?

510
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,060
 Putting things together, setting things up, right?

511
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,900
 And they don't talk, right?

512
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,660
 But they use their hands and feet to serve the church.

513
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,500
 If it is serving, if it is the spiritual gift of serving,

514
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:00,020
 let him serve or let her serve.

515
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,260
 If it is teaching, let him teach.

516
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:05,500
 If it's encouraging, let him encourage.

517
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:10,500
 Contributing, let him give generously.

518
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:14,180
 If it's leading, let him lead diligently.

519
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:18,780
 Showing mercy, let him do so cheerfully.

520
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:23,940
 And that is the beautiful picture of the church.

521
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,940
 And, you know, Olympic Games has been showing on TV, right?

522
00:27:28,940 --> 00:27:35,220
 I hope you have been watching the Olympic Games, right?

523
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,300
 Yeah, you just can't help it.

524
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,740
 You have to watch it, right?

525
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,900
 Yeah, it's 'cause you're bombarded by, you know,

526
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,060
 different games and replay, right?

527
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,140
 And I spent some time watching the Olympic Games,

528
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,380
 and I'm just amazed how people get gifted so differently,

529
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,220
 right?

530
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,300
 Some are great swimmers, right?

531
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,900
 You can't tell them to climb, right?

532
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:02,460
 They are created, they're made, they're gifted to swim, right?

533
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,900
 Some are good at track and field.

534
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,060
 Some are good at gymnastics, right?

535
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,820
 You can't tell them to do something else, right?

536
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:14,060
 And that is the picture Paul is trying to paint to us.

537
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:19,060
 'Cause he says, in Christ, we are a new people,

538
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:22,540
 and we are gifted in many different ways.

539
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:27,540
 And you and I are called to build up the body of Christ,

540
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,860
 the church.

541
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:31,860
 Use our gifts, right?

542
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,140
 You have to find your own gift.

543
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:37,340
 And you discover your own gift, praise God, right?

544
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:43,180
 That does not mean you don't need to do your lessons.

545
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,740
 You still need to improve, you still need to develop, right?

546
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:50,180
 You still need to use them.

547
00:28:50,180 --> 00:28:54,980
 I remember in the early years of my Christian walk,

548
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,700
 I started to discover the gift of teaching, right?

549
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,660
 Because, you know, that's one of my passions, right?

550
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:08,100
 I like to study the Bible, I like to know more about God.

551
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,820
 And I wanna tell other people, right?

552
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:14,460
 I remember the early years, I stumbled.

553
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,860
 I stumbled a lot, because I don't know how to put

554
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:21,660
 the information or the materials together in a helpful way,

555
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,540
 to help the church, to help our fellowship,

556
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:25,620
 to help our brothers and sisters, right?

557
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:28,340
 And it took me some time to practice it.

558
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,380
 It took me some time to take the opportunity,

559
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,420
 seize the opportunity to help other people.

560
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,220
 And that's what I'm saying, discover your gifts

561
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,220
 and develop them and deploy them and to use them, right?

562
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:46,300
 Paul is saying to us, we are a new people of Christ.

563
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,900
 We are gifted in many different ways.

564
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:51,780
 Let's build up the body of Christ, right?

565
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,020
 If you find that you are not gifted,

566
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:58,140
 you need to tell yourself, that's not true.

567
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:02,260
 You are always gifted in some ways, right?

568
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,940
 Our church is blessed by many people

569
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:08,300
 who thought they are not gifted,

570
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:12,780
 but what they do, what they practice is so important to us.

571
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:15,860
 And that is praying for the church, right?

572
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:20,220
 There are some elderly members in our community,

573
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,100
 they faithfully pray for us.

574
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,860
 They faithfully uplift the church

575
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:28,780
 and pray and support the church, right?

576
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,900
 You have the gift and you have to use it.

577
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,940
 You have to use a gift to build up the body of Christ.

578
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,060
 That brings us to the verse of the week.

579
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,220
 And let me conclude with this verses

580
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,220
 taken from the Book of Romans 12, verses four and five.

581
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:52,620
 Why don't we read this verses together, right?

582
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,340
 Just as each of us has one body with many members

583
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:01,060
 and these members do not all have the same function.

584
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:05,700
 So in Christ, we who are many form one body

585
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:09,420
 and each member belongs to all the others.

586
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,700
 Let's all pray together.

587
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,860
 Father, we wanna give you thanks

588
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,560
 for each and every one of us here.

589
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:18,780
 Yes, we come from different walks of life

590
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,180
 and we speak different languages,

591
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:24,700
 we have different interests and we have different passions.

592
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,580
 And yet in Christ, we are one body.

593
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:30,660
 And yet in Christ, in the mercy of God,

594
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,620
 we belong to this new family.

595
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,540
 We can call each other siblings,

596
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:38,940
 siblings in Christ, sisters and brothers in Christ.

597
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:43,940
 What an amazing reality that we can live in.

598
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:50,460
 Thank you for the brother and sister in this room,

599
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:54,780
 for the siblings in this church,

600
00:31:55,700 --> 00:32:00,700
 that we are being called into this community,

601
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:04,260
 this family to be one, to be one body.

602
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:10,860
 And God, we just pray that you will help us

603
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,020
 to break down all the walls that separate each one of us

604
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:21,420
 and help us to be united, united in Christ Jesus.

605
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,660
 And thank you for the gifts you have given to us.

606
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:30,660
 Help us use them for the benefit of others,

607
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,900
 to pray for the church, to build up the church,

608
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,060
 to serve other people.

609
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:36,900
 Thank you for this new identity

610
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:42,300
 and may this new identity continue to remind us

611
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,820
 that we belong to the body of Christ.

612
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,180
 What a glorious truth.

613
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,660
 And we can use our gifts to serve,

614
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,300
 use our gifts to worship.

615
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,500
 Again, we wanna give you thanks and praises

616
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:56,460
 in Christ and pray.

617
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,820
 Well, may God's peace be each and every one of you

618
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:03,420
 and I wanna see you next week, 11.30

619
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,700
 and let's continue to worship God.

620
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,540
 God bless.

621
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:09,120
 (gentle music)
