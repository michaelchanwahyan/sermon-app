1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
 - All right, guys, this is the Christmas season,

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:06,520
 and we're going to talk about the Christmas story,

3
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,800
 of course, and we're gonna turn to the Bible

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,220
 and continue, actually, with this mini-series

5
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,400
 on the pagan canes in the Bible.

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:15,980
 And I'd love to see all of you,

7
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,520
 and I know some of you are missing today

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,140
 because of some difficulties,

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,640
 and we're gonna pray for one another

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,800
 at the end of the service, all right, after the sermon.

11
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,760
 So I wanna set aside some time at the end of this service

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,700
 to remember some of those who are weak

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,000
 and having challenges.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,360
 You know, one of them is Jinfan.

15
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,400
 Jinfan is still in the hospital, I think.

16
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,520
 Hopefully, she will be discharged by the end of today,

17
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,080
 and I'll give you more updates at the end,

18
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,280
 and actually, it's good to see you,

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,080
 once you're here, and good to see you.

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,760
 I know it's a difficult day yesterday.

21
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,560
 Jim Borders also, you might, yeah,

22
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:03,160
 they went to UR, and so it's a very difficult day

23
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,240
 for some of us.

24
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,860
 And remember to pray for one another,

25
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,460
 and we'll do that after the sermon.

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,040
 And again, we turn to the Christmas story,

27
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,520
 which is found in Matthew and Luke,

28
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,240
 Matthew 1 and 2 and Luke 1 and 2,

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,360
 and today, we're going to focus on Luke 2,

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,960
 and the first few verses talk about

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,920
 the context and the time when Jesus was born.

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,920
 2.1, in those days, Caesar Augustus issued a decree

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,840
 that a census should be taken of the entire Roman world.

34
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,580
 And this was the first census,

35
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:47,240
 or the census before something took place,

36
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:50,440
 and what that took place was that

37
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:54,280
 Quirinius was governor of Syria.

38
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,280
 And verse 3, everyone went to his own town to register.

39
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,000
 Now, this is one of the Christmas stories

40
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,220
 recorded in the Bible about the birth of Jesus.

41
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,680
 As I said, the first two chapters of the Gospel of Matthew,

42
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,880
 the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke,

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,440
 which is this passage, it's all about,

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,800
 and the Gospel of Luke did not miss the background,

45
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,220
 you know, the history, the time of Jesus' birth.

46
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,880
 There are two pagan kings mentioned here.

47
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,240
 The first one is named Augustus,

48
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,280
 the second one is Quirinius,

49
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,960
 and we're gonna focus on Augustus.

50
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,960
 Augustus was the founder and the first emperor

51
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:39,000
 of the Roman Empire, and he was a very powerful

52
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,040
 Roman king and a political elite.

53
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,880
 So he rose to power after a series of military conflicts

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,040
 and a series of political successes,

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,040
 and under Augustus, the Roman Empire expanded greatly,

56
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:00,240
 and he built many different buildings,

57
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:04,440
 and he kept the peace, what we call later day

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,040
 Pax Romana, Roman peace,

59
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,060
 which means he beat up all the guys,

60
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:10,980
 you know, he conquered all the lands,

61
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,120
 and then there will be peace.

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,640
 So he kept the peace with his iron fist,

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,560
 and he conquered many, many places,

64
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,400
 including the land of Israel, Palestine,

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,320
 and he imposed heavy taxes, heavy taxes.

66
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,020
 You think your tax is heavy?

67
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,680
 Back in the Roman world, their tax was quite heavy,

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,720
 especially for those who are common people.

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,680
 And Augustus even called himself the son of God.

70
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,860
 From the coins, from the statue,

71
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,500
 from all the inscriptions, you know,

72
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,080
 all these promotions and propaganda,

73
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:53,300
 talking about him as the divine son of God.

74
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,460
 And he demanded people to worship him

75
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,540
 and to pledge allegiance to him.

76
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,980
 Now, as we see these three verses,

77
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,980
 notice the words, issue a decree, a decree.

78
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,780
 It was a political order.

79
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,380
 Now, only the Roman emperor can do that,

80
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:15,380
 can issue a decree, a demand on the people to obey.

81
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,380
 And one of the contents of the decree is taking a census.

82
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,220
 Now, census in those days in the Roman world,

83
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,900
 it's not simply counting the heads.

84
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,980
 It's not simply counting number of people.

85
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,160
 It's not just for statistics purpose.

86
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:37,180
 The Roman empire would call for census

87
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,900
 every some 10 years or maybe 14 years.

88
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,260
 Every 10 or 14 years, they would call for,

89
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:50,940
 you know, regional or empire-wide census.

90
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:55,020
 And the purpose of a census is to control,

91
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:58,700
 is to exercise control of the conquered people.

92
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:01,700
 So in the census, when the time comes,

93
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:06,120
 you have to report in your hometown to the government.

94
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,600
 Now, people would often be upset.

95
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,360
 And that's why in times of census,

96
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,980
 you know, people often will plan for revolt

97
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,960
 against the empire.

98
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,880
 And you also notice not only the word decree

99
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,400
 and also the word census, also Quirinius.

100
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,080
 Quirinius was a governor of the province of Syria,

101
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,100
 which includes the land of Palestine, Israel.

102
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,460
 And the word governor is where we get

103
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:40,200
 the English word hegemony.

104
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,840
 Hegemony, it means the most powerful guy, you know.

105
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,520
 He's the most powerful guy in the region, in the province.

106
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,520
 And of course, the top guy is, this guy here is Augustus.

107
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,920
 Now, as you can tell from this three verses,

108
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,920
 Luke is trying to tell us when Jesus was born,

109
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,600
 it was a time of mighty political power,

110
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:07,440
 exercising their authority over poor people,

111
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,120
 the common people.

112
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,300
 And Christmas happened in such a time.

113
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:17,460
 So don't you forget, in the time of Jesus' birth,

114
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,660
 it's not what we experience in Christmas.

115
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:24,620
 You know, usually when Christmas comes,

116
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,880
 what are we thinking about?

117
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,440
 We think about vacation, right?

118
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,640
 You got some vacation to burn, right?

119
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:35,100
 So you wanna do it by the end of the year.

120
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,840
 In times of Christmas, you think about shopping,

121
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,900
 buying gifts, you know, Christmas lights,

122
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,880
 and all those things.

123
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,440
 In the time of Jesus' birth, it was not like that.

124
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,120
 It was a time of domination.

125
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,320
 It was a time of a political crisis

126
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,920
 or political instability.

127
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,840
 And this three verses, you know, trying to tell us

128
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,840
 or to give us the context, the time of Jesus' birth.

129
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,720
 Verse four, "So Joseph," now, as you can see,

130
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,840
 the camera is trying to zoom in

131
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,800
 to the main character of the story.

132
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,720
 "So Joseph also went up from the town of Nazareth,

133
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,720
 "in Galilee to Judea, to Bethlehem, the town of David,

134
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:28,440
 "because he belonged to the house and line of David.

135
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,640
 "He went there to register with Mary,

136
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,240
 "and Mary was pledged to be married to him

137
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,360
 "and was expecting a child."

138
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,080
 I think Mary's carrying at least nine months now.

139
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,300
 "While they were there, Joseph and Mary,

140
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:48,300
 "the time came for the baby, Jesus, to be born.

141
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:53,520
 "And she gave birth to her firstborn, a son.

142
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,020
 "She wrapped him up in cloths and placed him in a manger,

143
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,860
 "because there was no room for them in the inn."

144
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,240
 Now, there's so many details here we can unpack,

145
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,680
 but here, the big picture is the common people,

146
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,840
 the conquered people, the losers,

147
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,080
 Joseph and Mary included, and Jesus, of course, included,

148
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:20,200
 and all the Jewish people, they report to their hometowns

149
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:24,360
 and to recognize that Augustus was ruling over them.

150
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,540
 Augustus was the king.

151
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,380
 Nobody else is the king.

152
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,140
 And Mary and Joseph were on their way from Galilee,

153
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,180
 which is in the north, to Bethlehem.

154
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,980
 As you can see from the map,

155
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:41,820
 right there, far corner on the right,

156
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,180
 kind of upper right, you see Nazareth?

157
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,100
 Can you see that?

158
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,980
 You can make it out, right?

159
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,980
 That is in Galilee.

160
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,260
 Galilee, you see the small lake on the right

161
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,540
 is the Sea of Galilee, a freshwater lake.

162
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:02,640
 And they have to make the journey to the south,

163
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,860
 which is Jerusalem and Bethlehem.

164
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:11,860
 Now, Bethlehem is located a few kilometer south of Jerusalem

165
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:15,100
 so they have to make the way all the way from the north

166
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,740
 to the south, and that is, the red line there,

167
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,740
 is 80-mile journey, and mostly, I think, on foot.

168
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:25,460
 Mostly on foot.

169
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,060
 You can imagine if you are pregnant with a baby,

170
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:32,940
 eight months, nine months, and you have to walk, right?

171
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,540
 Now, most of the image that we have for Christmas

172
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,600
 is that they got a donkey, right?

173
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,700
 They got a donkey.

174
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,980
 They kind of like, they have a Uber, you know?

175
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:48,820
 So Mary was on the Uber, was on the donkey.

176
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:52,660
 Well, not necessarily so, because you got to pay

177
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,580
 for the Uber, right?

178
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,020
 You can't get the free Uber.

179
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,960
 Not necessarily so.

180
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:03,960
 I think the 80, 90-mile journey, mostly, was on foot.

181
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:09,160
 80 miles is like three marathons, right?

182
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,060
 Carrying a baby is a very, very difficult journey.

183
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:19,440
 Chapter two, verse four says, "Went up to Bethlehem."

184
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,340
 And that makes sense geographically

185
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:25,100
 because you're climbing from the north shore

186
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,500
 of the Dead Sea, which is right at the bottom center,

187
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,900
 and you have to climb almost 2,000 feet,

188
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,460
 and over 2,000 feet, to the central mountain range

189
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:38,000
 where Jerusalem and Bethlehem were located.

190
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,060
 And as you can tell, it's a very difficult journey,

191
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,020
 especially for a pregnant woman.

192
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:49,420
 And when they get there, it was time to give birth.

193
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,420
 And Joseph, I think probably, at the time of delivery,

194
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,180
 he had to urgently hire a midwife to help out.

195
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,540
 And there was no, you know, Rush Hospital

196
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:06,380
 or Northwestern Hospital in those days.

197
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:08,460
 There was no delivery room.

198
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:13,460
 And the scripture tells us, they went into the barn,

199
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,900
 and there was no place for the baby to lay but a manger.

200
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:26,420
 However, in Luke one and two, we find people like this.

201
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,180
 They were able to meet Jesus as their Savior.

202
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,820
 As you can tell from verse one,

203
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:39,580
 the main character seems to be Augustus,

204
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:42,460
 seems to be those who hold power,

205
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,260
 those who have political might,

206
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,300
 those who have military might,

207
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,340
 and they were the main actors in history.

208
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:52,320
 They were the main actors on stage,

209
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,820
 on the stage of human history.

210
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,900
 Augustus, Quirinius, the governor, the king, the emperor,

211
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,820
 the political elites, all those people

212
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:06,540
 are the main actors in human story, right?

213
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:09,340
 So we study Western history or Eastern history

214
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,540
 or whatever history.

215
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:14,860
 Sometimes we focus so much on the big guys, right?

216
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,980
 The kings, the emperor, the generals, right?

217
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,260
 Those who can fight, those who can win,

218
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:22,140
 and those who can conquer.

219
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,580
 But in Luke, in the Christmas story,

220
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:30,460
 the concentration or the focus is on the common people,

221
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:33,940
 on Joseph and Mary.

222
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:38,620
 Now, we don't have time to take a lot of details today,

223
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,260
 but in Luke 1 and 2, the first two chapters,

224
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,540
 talking about Christmas or the arrival of Jesus,

225
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:47,000
 the Son of God, the Savior,

226
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,980
 the Gospel of Luke mentions so many different people

227
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:54,340
 who have met the baby Jesus,

228
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:58,480
 who have been part of the Savior's story.

229
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:03,620
 From chapter two, we see Joseph and Mary,

230
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,780
 and Mary was probably, you know how old Mary was?

231
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,940
 Probably a high school girl, right?

232
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:13,660
 14 year old, 15 year old,

233
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,540
 and has the faith to receive Jesus.

234
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,140
 And then chapter one,

235
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:25,300
 the parents of John the Baptist,

236
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:28,900
 Zechariah and Elizabeth,

237
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,620
 and these two, they're the couple,

238
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,820
 were aging and dying couple because they were so old,

239
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:37,660
 and the Gospel of Luke tells us

240
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,900
 they had no child.

241
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,960
 They're struggling with infertility,

242
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:47,020
 and in those days, it is a shame to not have a child.

243
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,420
 In those days, it was hopeless

244
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,820
 if you cannot have a child to carry on your name,

245
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:55,620
 to continue your line and your family.

246
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,540
 So Zechariah and Elizabeth,

247
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:00,500
 they were dying and aging couple,

248
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:02,640
 and they had no child.

249
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,580
 However, in chapter one,

250
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:08,580
 God graced them and granted them

251
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:11,760
 a miracle child, John the Baptist.

252
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,500
 And John the Baptist is the pioneer of the Savior Jesus.

253
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:20,100
 That is Luke chapter one.

254
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,180
 And then the story goes on and talks about Jesus

255
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:27,460
 when after he was born, when he was eight days old,

256
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:31,020
 he was brought to the temple in Jerusalem for offering.

257
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:35,920
 So Joseph and Mary are carrying an eight-day-old child,

258
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,100
 Jesus, in their arms,

259
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:42,620
 and bring him to the temple in Jerusalem

260
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:47,180
 for circumcision and for offering a sacrifice.

261
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:49,460
 And there in the temple court,

262
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,620
 two other people are being mentioned,

263
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,700
 and they have the opportunity to take part

264
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:59,700
 and to experience, to meet the baby Jesus.

265
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,240
 And the first one is Simeon.

266
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,500
 Simeon, the Bible did not tell us how old he was.

267
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:10,880
 I think probably he was in his last days of his life,

268
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,960
 and he was devoted to worship God day and night

269
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,340
 in the temple, and finally he met Jesus, the Savior.

270
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:22,620
 And then the second person is Anna.

271
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,260
 Anna was an old widow.

272
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:30,700
 The Gospel of Luke tells us she lived in the temple

273
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:37,340
 day after day with the hope of seeing the salvation happen

274
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:40,260
 in her life.

275
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,260
 And there Anna also met Jesus in the temple court.

276
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:50,260
 Now these people, Joseph and Mary, Zechariah and Elizabeth,

277
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,340
 and their son, miracle child, John the Baptist,

278
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:57,300
 pioneer of Jesus, and Simeon, Anna,

279
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:02,900
 they are all powerless people,

280
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,040
 but in the plan of God, in the story of God,

281
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,900
 they are the main characters,

282
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,340
 because they praise God and thank God and worship God,

283
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,100
 because finally they can see the Savior

284
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,340
 coming into the world, coming into their life.

285
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:22,380
 And they welcome Jesus, the Savior,

286
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,420
 with thanksgiving and with faith.

287
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:29,300
 Now if you have time, I would always recommend

288
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:32,060
 in times of Christmas, go into the Bible,

289
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,340
 spend some time, and we read and meditate

290
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,040
 and reflect on the story of Christmas.

291
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,800
 Now if you have time, look at Luke 1 and 2.

292
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,820
 You see, Luke is trying to tell the story

293
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,620
 of some of these common people,

294
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,460
 and afterwards, he always record their praise and worship.

295
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:59,180
 Anna praised God, Simeon praised God

296
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:03,420
 after holding and seeing the Savior, baby Jesus.

297
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:07,620
 Zechariah and Elizabeth, they burst out

298
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:11,460
 with praise and worship, because they finally have met

299
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,500
 the hope of Israel, the hope of mankind,

300
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,620
 the salvation in Jesus.

301
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,500
 And Joseph and Mary, of course Mary,

302
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,380
 offer a song called "Magnificat."

303
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:28,380
 And that is a song praising God for reversing our role,

304
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,100
 reversing, you know, the powerful becomes powerless,

305
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,160
 and the powerless become powerful in the sight of God.

306
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,580
 So all of these people, they are common,

307
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:38,740
 even though they are conquered,

308
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,340
 they are in the low, low bottom layer of the society,

309
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,060
 and they welcome the Savior,

310
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,700
 and they have met the Savior face to face

311
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,940
 with thanksgiving and in worship.

312
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,640
 Now this is relevant to us,

313
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,500
 because none of us is like Augustus.

314
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,700
 None of us is like billionaire.

315
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:00,680
 Maybe you got a lot of money, okay?

316
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,700
 I guess you are not Elon Musk, right?

317
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,500
 You're not in the White House.

318
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,580
 You're not the powerful elite.

319
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:12,420
 But this story tells us Jesus came to the life of people

320
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:17,420
 who are powerless, who are poor, and who feel oppressed.

321
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:23,400
 Now Jesus is different from Augustus,

322
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,680
 because his kingdom is different from the Roman Empire.

323
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:30,900
 Jesus did not come to collect power for a field.

324
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:34,520
 Jesus is going to rule differently.

325
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,700
 And as I told you, all the praise songs,

326
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:41,580
 especially Mary's praise song, "Magnificat,"

327
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:46,580
 talks about God in Jesus elevates those

328
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:52,140
 who are without privilege, without status,

329
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,120
 elevate them from low to high,

330
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,640
 and release people from bondage.

331
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,380
 And that is the vision of Jesus' kingdom,

332
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,320
 is to restore relationship with God

333
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,860
 and restore our brokenness

334
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,420
 so that he can breathe life, eternal life in our lives.

335
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,300
 Augustus would ask other people to sacrifice themselves

336
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,820
 for him and for his power, for his kingdom, for his empire.

337
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:24,680
 But Jesus came and sacrificed himself for us,

338
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,820
 sinners, broken people.

339
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,740
 We don't deserve it.

340
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:34,140
 But Jesus came and sacrificed himself for us.

341
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:37,660
 And our situation may be different from 2000 years ago,

342
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:41,500
 but we still see kings these days,

343
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,940
 politicians these days,

344
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,860
 flexing their muscle for self-interest.

345
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:49,100
 And these people, the powerful,

346
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:53,080
 would benefit themselves and the privileged few.

347
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,580
 Jesus is calling us not to serve ourselves,

348
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,420
 but to serve others.

349
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,540
 So that's what he did.

350
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,460
 The ruling powers may be strong

351
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,640
 and seek to bend us to their vision,

352
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,260
 but Jesus is calling you, calling me, to his kingdom.

353
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,580
 And his kingdom is totally different

354
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,660
 from the earthly empire.

355
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:20,660
 His kingdom is characterized by service and humility,

356
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,980
 service and humility.

357
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:27,280
 As we think about the birth of Jesus in this holiday season,

358
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,500
 don't you forget,

359
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:33,800
 don't you forget Jesus is calling us for his kingdom.

360
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,660
 And his kingdom is totally different.

361
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:42,660
 And remind ourselves not to seek our own good,

362
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:47,640
 but to give and to serve other people.

363
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:51,820
 In Luke chapter 22,

364
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:58,640
 almost before Jesus went to the cross and being crucified,

365
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,820
 he said to his disciples,

366
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:04,060
 because they're on their way to Jerusalem,

367
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,120
 and Jesus knew that he was gonna die

368
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,180
 a shameful death on the cross,

369
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,920
 and he was trying to interact with his disciples,

370
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,200
 and his disciples trying to fight for,

371
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,740
 you know, who's gonna be first in Jesus' kingdom.

372
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,880
 And Jesus is trying to tell them and to teach them,

373
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,780
 this is a totally different way.

374
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:25,980
 It's a way of reversal.

375
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,420
 Jesus said to the disciples,

376
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:33,560
 "The kings of the Gentiles, lord it over them,

377
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,600
 "and those who exercise authority over them,

378
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,440
 "call themselves benefactors."

379
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,520
 And the kings, the emperor, the powerful people,

380
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,080
 would call themselves to be benefactors,

381
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,760
 because they are the ones who do good to other people, right?

382
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,560
 To have charity to other people,

383
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,000
 to shower blessing to other people.

384
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,840
 They are the actors, the benefactors.

385
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,800
 These are the Gentile kings.

386
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,960
 Jesus said in verse 26 and following,

387
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:08,120
 he said, "You guys, the disciples,

388
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:12,080
 "the church, are not to be like that.

389
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,080
 "Instead, the greatest among you shall be like the youngest,

390
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:21,920
 "and the one who rules like the one who serves."

391
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,880
 Who is more important in the kingdom of heaven?

392
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:31,080
 The one who sits at the table, or the one who serves?

393
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,780
 Who is more important, Jesus said?

394
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:38,200
 The one who sits at the table, of course, but not here.

395
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:42,040
 You know, in the Roman Empire,

396
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,440
 the one who sits at the table, who has the feast,

397
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,760
 they are the powerful.

398
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,200
 But in the kingdom of heaven, in the kingdom of Jesus,

399
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
 it's not like that.

400
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,280
 Jesus said, "For I am among you as one who serves."

401
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,640
 Jesus came to serve us, not to be served.

402
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,880
 And that's why Jesus, in the sight of God,

403
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,160
 is the real Son of the Most High,

404
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:13,920
 the real Son of God, not Augustus.

405
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,400
 And Jesus bring us true peace,

406
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
 not the Roman peace, not the earthly peace,

407
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:23,160
 but the heavenly peace, eternal peace,

408
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,880
 because our relationship with God can be restored

409
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,920
 because of what Jesus did for us.

410
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,560
 And Jesus comes to serve all of us.

411
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:35,960
 Those who are on top of the pyramid,

412
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,320
 Augustus, the earthly kings,

413
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,840
 those who have the political power,

414
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,080
 they come to be served.

415
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,920
 But Jesus said, "In my kingdom,

416
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,040
 "the order of things is totally different."

417
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,420
 So as we reflect on the Christmas season,

418
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:56,400
 ask ourselves a question.

419
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,960
 What can we do to serve God and others?

420
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:06,440
 What can we do not to be served, but to serve others?

421
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,840
 As I told you at the beginning of this sermon,

422
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,640
 we're gonna serve one another,

423
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,640
 we're gonna pray for one another.

424
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:16,480
 So let's start with this small action,

425
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,720
 to remember other people, all right?

426
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,720
 So last night, I received a message from Jin Fan,

427
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,640
 and I was kind of taken aback

428
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:33,640
 because she told me she was in the hospital

429
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:40,200
 because she was having some high blood pressure,

430
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,840
 beyond normal.

431
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,840
 So Paul and Jin Fan rushed to Northwestern Hospital,

432
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,480
 and I just received a message this morning.

433
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,560
 As you know, Jin Fan is carrying 34 weeks, right?

434
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,800
 34 weeks, yeah, it's very critical.

435
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,680
 And, but I received a message from her this morning,

436
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,320
 her blood pressure is back to normal.

437
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,720
 Hopefully, we pray for her, pray for Paul,

438
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,640
 pray for the baby.

439
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,040
 Everything will go fine,

440
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,120
 and she will be discharged by the end of today, yeah.

441
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:18,680
 But we need to pray for them, pray for them.

442
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:22,160
 And then, and I also received another news,

443
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:26,240
 is Wang Shi also went to ER,

444
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:31,240
 because Jin Paul also went to ER because of stomach ache.

445
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,880
 But he was discharged last night, right?

446
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:36,560
 Yeah, so they have a very difficult day.

447
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,920
 Yeah, so, boy, we need to pray for one another, all right?

448
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:45,920
 For those of us who are well, and relatively healthy,

449
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,440
 don't forget to serve one another,

450
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,560
 to care for one another, right?

451
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,600
 Yeah, why don't we spend some time to pray for one another?

452
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:05,280
 So in your quiet prayer,

453
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,720
 please pray for those who are in need,

454
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,960
 Jin Fan and Jin Paul,

455
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,520
 and all the people that God brings to mind.

456
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:17,600
 (gentle piano music)

457
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,680
 (gentle piano music)

458
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,320
 Father, we come before you, we know we are broken,

459
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,760
 we are weak, and we are poor.

460
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,960
 We are not like the powerful.

461
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:59,440
 We are not like those who have might.

462
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:04,280
 They seem to be the main actors.

463
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:08,320
 But we come before you, we know that.

464
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,320
 Your focus is on us,

465
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:14,200
 because you love us,

466
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,160
 and you take care of us.

467
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:22,080
 Never have a moment in our lives that's out of your sight.

468
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:28,160
 Never have a minute in our life that's out of your control.

469
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:31,320
 So we come before you to acknowledge

470
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:34,400
 that you are the Lord, you are our King,

471
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:40,960
 and you are indeed holding everything together in our world.

472
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,840
 So we wanna give you thanks,

473
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,240
 we wanna praise you and worship you.

474
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,440
 We sing songs to you,

475
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,000
 not to those on top of the pyramid,

476
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,200
 but to you,

477
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,040
 who came to us in Jesus,

478
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,360
 in the form of manger,

479
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,400
 the form of a baby,

480
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,440
 just like every one of us.

481
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,560
 You came to save us, to serve us,

482
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,800
 even die on the cross,

483
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:19,120
 sacrifice yourself in order to redeem all of us,

484
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:23,400
 so that our relationship with the Father can be restored,

485
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,760
 so that we can have hope.

486
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:29,080
 And thank you for your love and your grace.

487
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,280
 And we don't deserve it,

488
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,960
 yet this grace came to our lives.

489
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,840
 So again, in this season of Christmas,

490
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,280
 remind us how you live,

491
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,520
 remind us your life,

492
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:48,360
 remind us how our Lord Jesus came not to be served,

493
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,880
 but to serve all of us.

494
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:54,000
 And yes, Father, we wanna remember

495
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,280
 some of our family members,

496
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,600
 some of our church members,

497
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,080
 and those who are having a tough time and challenging time.

498
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:08,160
 And we, first of all, wanna uplift Jinfan,

499
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:11,160
 Paul and their baby in your hand.

500
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,120
 We know that they had a very challenging day

501
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,520
 yesterday and today,

502
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,360
 and I just pray that you will grant them peace,

503
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,680
 you'll help them to calm

504
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,000
 and to know that everything is in your hand.

505
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:32,000
 We praise you for bringing the blood pressure

506
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,200
 down to normal level.

507
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:36,320
 We praise you for good news.

508
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,960
 And I pray that you will be their protection.

509
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,440
 And we just pray that Jinfan will be discharged today,

510
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,760
 and you will continue to protect

511
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,760
 and especially watch over Jinfan's pregnancy.

512
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:57,480
 We also wanna pray for our brother, Jinbo.

513
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:04,240
 We know that he was having just pain yesterday,

514
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:09,720
 and they were rushed to ER.

515
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,840
 Sure, they have a very, very chaotic

516
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:15,680
 and very, very difficult night,

517
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,240
 but we praise you for good news.

518
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,840
 And I just pray that you will continue

519
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,960
 to bring healing to Jinbo,

520
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,520
 to grant strength to Wanshe and their family,

521
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,600
 be with them, and knowing that, God,

522
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,760
 you are always our strength,

523
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,400
 and you are our power, and you are our refuge.

524
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,200
 I pray for those we cannot mention by names.

525
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:43,520
 I'm sure some of us are having a very hard time

526
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,520
 and a challenging season in our lives.

527
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:54,320
 Help us to lift our eyes to the throne.

528
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,640
 Know that you are the king, and you are in control.

529
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:01,760
 Increase our faith so that we can trust in you.

530
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,880
 Thank you for being our God.

531
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:07,320
 Thank you for being, walking with us.

532
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,920
 And you are faithful, and you are always faithful,

533
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:13,000
 yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

534
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,480
 And your grace is always sufficient.

535
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,520
 So we pray that we'll rely on you

536
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,160
 and to believe in you and to trust in you,

537
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,360
 trusting the fact that you are always our provider,

538
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,120
 and you are always our shepherd,

539
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,680
 and you will be with us always.

540
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,400
 So pray for our church as well.

541
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:33,120
 As we come to the end of the year,

542
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,880
 we are thinking about the next year,

543
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:40,160
 our plan, our budget, our financial need,

544
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,280
 and all of the ministries that we're gonna come before you

545
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:45,880
 and pray that you will bless us.

546
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,320
 Whatever we do in your name,

547
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,200
 we'll receive blessing and we'll receive fruit

548
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,280
 so that we can bring glory to you.

549
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,000
 And I pray that as we go out from here,

550
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,120
 you will send us out to live the life of kingdom

551
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,280
 in our family, in our workplace,

552
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:07,120
 in everywhere you send us,

553
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,800
 that we will demonstrate your love.

554
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,440
 You will demonstrate your grace.

555
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,680
 Thank you, Father, in Christ, we pray.

556
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,840
 Well, I wanna remind you to continue

557
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,120
 to pray for one another.

558
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,400
 For those who are weak and for those who are in need.

559
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:32,080
 And I also wanna remind you in the season of Christmas,

560
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:33,800
 let's do something for other people.

561
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:37,400
 Maybe a random act of kindness to our neighbors,

562
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,040
 to our brother and sister in the church.

563
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,840
 And please remember one another

564
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:48,840
 and show the spirit of Christmas a little bit more.

565
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,040
 All right?

566
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:53,280
 And by the way, this afternoon,

567
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:56,400
 I just made up my mind to go to the Zoolight

568
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,000
 in Lincoln Park.

569
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
 Anyone wanna join us?

570
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,920
 You can get the tickets yourself

571
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:07,760
 and you can see me and we go together

572
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,760
 for the Zoolight at 5.30 p.m.

573
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,920
 All right, 5.30.

574
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,760
 All right?

575
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,440
 But you have to pay for your own ticket.

576
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,000
 But you wanna hang out with some of the people

577
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,240
 together this afternoon, please.

578
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:21,240
 Yeah, you're welcome to join us.

579
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,080
 All right?
