1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,400
 email, so yeah.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,560
 So today we have Pastor Mark to give us a message today.

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,400
 - Hey guys, we are starting a new series,

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,320
 and this series I want to connect the Bible and the land.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,360
 Now you have heard me saying the Bible

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,040
 is not written to us, right?

7
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,020
 It's written for us, alright?

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,160
 Now why do I say that?

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,000
 Why do I say that?

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,120
 Because indeed the Bible was an ancient document,

11
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:27,120
 and it's not directly written to us,

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,500
 but it's written for us.

13
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,400
 That's why we need to understand the Bible

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,040
 in its own context.

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,240
 So I want to connect the Bible and the land.

16
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:38,160
 Sometimes we read the Bible, we read scripture,

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,760
 without the context, without the background.

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:46,300
 And that's why we miss so much of the nuance

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,840
 of what the word of God will say.

20
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,240
 So I would like to explore the whole land with you,

21
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:55,080
 at least virtually, virtually we can do that,

22
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,840
 and think about some of the Bible passages,

23
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,180
 some of the words of God.

24
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,360
 And today we are going to a place called Hezekiah Tunnel.

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,900
 Hezekiah Tunnel.

26
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,500
 And one of those passages that mention this tunnel

27
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:17,020
 is found in the book of 2 Kings, chapter 20, verse 20.

28
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:18,420
 Let me read that first.

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,420
 The rest of the events, the account in Hezekiah's reign,

30
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,840
 including the extent of his power and how he built a pool

31
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,980
 and dug a tunnel to bring water into the city

32
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,660
 are recorded in the book of the history

33
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,340
 of the Kings of Judah.

34
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,340
 Hezekiah died and his son Manasseh became the next king.

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:45,500
 That is toward the end of the kingly account

36
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:49,460
 or royal record of King Hezekiah.

37
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:52,420
 Now he's a good guy, and that's why we want to spend

38
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:57,420
 some time with what he did and what it means to us today.

39
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,560
 There are three points I want to go through.

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,620
 The first one is to understand who Hezekiah is

41
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,840
 and the record of his reign.

42
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,120
 That's the first part.

43
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,800
 The second part is the importance of faith

44
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,080
 from a biblical perspective.

45
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,480
 And third point is the call for stewardship,

46
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,600
 biblical stewardship.

47
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,320
 Now first one is the record of Hezekiah.

48
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:30,320
 Now if you read 1 and 2 Kings, it's original one book,

49
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,400
 it records king after king what they did

50
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,440
 and sort of a political history, sort of a political book,

51
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,300
 talking about the kingdoms, right?

52
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,880
 Remember David, well Saul was the first king,

53
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:46,060
 and then David and then Solomon,

54
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:51,060
 and then the United Kingdom under these three kings

55
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:53,600
 crumble after Solomon.

56
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,660
 And then it was split into North and South, right?

57
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,800
 The Northern Kingdom is called Israel.

58
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,560
 The Southern Kingdom is called Judah.

59
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,080
 So then they parallel and develop,

60
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,920
 and there are so many different kings

61
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,960
 in the Northern Kingdom and the Southern Kingdom.

62
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,200
 And 1 and 2 Kings are tracing the political history

63
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:17,440
 of what happened to the people of God in those days.

64
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,700
 So there were about 19 kings in the Northern nation

65
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,420
 of Israel, 19 kings, and all of them,

66
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,340
 all 19 of them are bad guys.

67
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:33,400
 And then the Southern Kingdom had about 20 kings,

68
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,480
 only eight of them are good guys,

69
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:38,300
 and all the rest of them are bad guys.

70
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:42,660
 Now this scripture, this passage that I just read

71
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,520
 is the conclusion of Hezekiah's reign.

72
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,980
 Now the Bible in 1 and 2 Kings

73
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:52,820
 spend about three chapters, long chapters,

74
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:56,980
 to record what is important in the political history

75
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,880
 of King Hezekiah.

76
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:01,660
 And this is toward the very, very end,

77
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:04,420
 the last couple of verses.

78
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,480
 He said what?

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,860
 "The rest of the event in the reign of Hezekiah,

80
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,880
 "including the extent of his power,

81
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,460
 "and how he built a water pool

82
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,380
 "and dug a water tunnel to bring water into the city,

83
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,080
 "are recorded in the book of the history

84
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,980
 "of the kings of Judah.

85
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,440
 "And then he died, and his son became the next king."

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,720
 Now what happened in the reign of Hezekiah

87
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
 was that he had a big problem,

88
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,180
 and the problem is called Assyrian problem.

89
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:38,880
 Now if you know, imagine a big map,

90
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,960
 the Middle East, the Near East.

91
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,120
 Right at your upper right-hand corner

92
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,980
 is the big guy, the Assyrian Empire,

93
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:53,620
 with mighty military power.

94
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:56,080
 And they're expanding to the west.

95
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,600
 Expanding to the west,

96
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,660
 and the ultimate goal is to conquer Egypt.

97
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:03,800
 In order for Assyrian Empire to conquer Egypt,

98
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:07,700
 he has to pass through one land bridge,

99
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,480
 the only land bridge of the world.

100
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,140
 It's the land of King.

101
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,440
 That's where Hezekiah was, Jerusalem was there.

102
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,740
 Israel, Palestine.

103
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:21,020
 It's the land bridge for all three big continents, right?

104
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,200
 Europe, Asia Minor, and then Africa, and then Asia.

105
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,240
 Now he had to pass through the land of Kingdom

106
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:32,440
 in order to go to his ultimate destination,

107
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,840
 which is Egypt, right?

108
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,180
 So he had to pass through that land,

109
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,600
 but if the local kings in the Middle East

110
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,020
 if the local kings in the land bridge

111
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,980
 obey him and follow the empire of Assyria,

112
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,440
 then you're okay, right?

113
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,540
 You just pay more taxes, right?

114
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,980
 If you rebel against the Assyrian Empire,

115
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:59,300
 the Assyrian Kingdom, the military might

116
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:03,340
 will come down upon you and will crush you.

117
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:08,140
 Now in those days, the military strategy

118
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:13,140
 for conquering a city is to lay siege around the city.

119
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,000
 You know what lay siege around the city is?

120
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,320
 They surround the whole city,

121
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:23,980
 and then they trap you inside the city wall, right?

122
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,220
 And then until you, staff you to death

123
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,080
 or thirst you to death, right?

124
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,940
 You can't come out, you can't go in, right?

125
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:37,940
 And that's what Assyrian military is trying to do.

126
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,780
 To Hezekiah in Jerusalem.

127
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,540
 So what Hezekiah did was he tried to block

128
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:49,540
 all this small water sources,

129
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:53,680
 all of this mountain spring, small springs,

130
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,620
 around the city of Jerusalem in the hill country.

131
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,680
 And then he shut himself into his own city.

132
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,680
 And Hezekiah's strategy is so that the city

133
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:11,100
 is prepared for the siege with enough food and enough water

134
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,100
 so that the Assyrian soldiers surrounding Jerusalem,

135
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,500
 hopefully they will get tired

136
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,140
 and then they will go back home, right?

137
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:26,060
 So as long as you make sure you are sustainable,

138
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:29,340
 the city is sustainable, then you're okay.

139
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:32,040
 And that is the strategy of Hezekiah.

140
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:34,100
 I think that's the only way, right?

141
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:37,200
 'Cause you cannot stand against a monster, right?

142
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,920
 You gotta prepare yourself.

143
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,340
 So that's what Hezekiah did.

144
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:45,340
 He built a new water tunnel to bring water into the city.

145
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,660
 Now back in those days, usually when you need to get water,

146
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:53,420
 you had to go outside of the city wall to the valley.

147
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,780
 'Cause usually the spring is in the valley, right?

148
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,220
 It's outside the city wall and then you come back, right?

149
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,820
 In time of peace, you're okay, right?

150
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,500
 You pass through city gate two times a day,

151
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,740
 go out and go in.

152
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:07,220
 You get enough water, you come back.

153
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:10,860
 But in times of war, you cannot do that.

154
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,680
 That's what Hezekiah did.

155
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,740
 He tried to block all this little water springs

156
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,740
 in Jerusalem area and then shut himself into his own capital

157
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,740
 and built a new plumbing to bring water into the city

158
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:32,180
 so that they can sustain the Assyrian siege.

159
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,540
 Now I have three minute video.

160
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,260
 I wanna show you what this tunnel is like.

161
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:41,260
 Now as I said, the background of the Bible,

162
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:46,000
 the context of Bible is very concrete.

163
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,060
 You can actually walk it.

164
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,580
 You can actually see it and touch it.

165
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,620
 So Hezekiah tunnel is one of them.

166
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,860
 Let me try to show you the three minute video.

167
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,860
 (crowd chattering)

168
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:02,760
 - My right is Gihon Springs.

169
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:07,060
 Gihon Springs right here.

170
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:10,980
 (speaking in foreign language)

171
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:23,140
 - Oh, so cold.

172
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:26,060
 (crowd chattering)

173
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:29,980
 (speaking in foreign language)

174
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,500
 (speaking in foreign language)

175
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,420
 (crowd chattering)

176
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:41,340
 (speaking in foreign language)

177
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:45,260
 (speaking in foreign language)

178
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:48,180
 (crowd chattering)

179
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:52,940
 (speaking in foreign language)

180
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:55,860
 (crowd chattering)

181
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,780
 (speaking in foreign language)

182
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:21,180
 - This is the Hezekiah tunnel

183
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,500
 and we are walking through it

184
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:26,540
 and we are using a 360 camera

185
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,340
 so that you can see the environment.

186
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,020
 And this is a man-made tunnel, 2,000 feet long

187
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,860
 and done by two different teams.

188
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,340
 And one team starting from the spring,

189
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,900
 from the origin of the water.

190
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,580
 And the other team is coming from the port of Siloam,

191
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,700
 south of the city of David.

192
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,940
 And two teams listening to one another

193
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,620
 and they are built through the mountain.

194
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:59,340
 And as you can see, the size of the tunnel is a body.

195
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,660
 And they dig and dig and dig

196
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,020
 and they listen to each other and the noise of the digging.

197
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:07,940
 And they try to meet together.

198
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,940
 And at the end of the engineering project,

199
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:15,500
 two teams did meet together.

200
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,100
 And it was a celebration.

201
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:21,140
 And the water tunnel is through

202
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:23,100
 and the water from the Gihon Strait

203
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,380
 can go down to the south of the city of David

204
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:29,380
 so that people can get the water

205
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:32,380
 without going out of the city wall.

206
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,700
 (speaking in foreign language)

207
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,700
 (people chattering)

208
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:48,100
 - Sorry about that.

209
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,500
 This is my bad.

210
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,180
 And now, the tunnel is too long.

211
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:56,940
 (speaking in foreign language)

212
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,940
 (people chattering)

213
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,940
 (people chattering)

214
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,460
 (speaking in foreign language)

215
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:16,060
 (speaking in foreign language)

216
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:28,260
 (speaking in foreign language)

217
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:32,780
 (speaking in foreign language)

218
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:57,260
 - Well, it is very interesting, right?

219
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,700
 You can actually walk the tunnel

220
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,060
 that is recorded in the Bible.

221
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,980
 And especially you have a 360 camera.

222
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:05,300
 And thanks to Hale for lending the camera.

223
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,820
 I think in the YouTube world,

224
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:12,140
 we are the first one recording the tunnel

225
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,860
 using a 360 camera.

226
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,260
 Yeah, praise God.

227
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:17,340
 Anyways, makes you wanna go, right?

228
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,620
 Makes you wanna go.

229
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:21,340
 It spent about 40 minutes to walk the entire tunnel.

230
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:25,380
 Total pitch darkness.

231
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:30,380
 And it was built in Hezekiah time, 700 BC.

232
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:35,900
 That's when Hezekiah had a crisis.

233
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,460
 If you see the diagram here,

234
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:41,780
 you see that the Gihon Spring,

235
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,300
 which is now flowing,

236
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:47,260
 even now, there are clean water coming out of the mountain

237
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,380
 from Gihon Spring.

238
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,660
 Gihon Spring is on the right.

239
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,060
 You see that blue line?

240
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,780
 That blue line, S-shaped, curved blue line

241
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:58,820
 is the line of Hezekiah Tunnel.

242
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:03,260
 I was kind of walking the first third of the tunnel.

243
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,460
 So you start from Gihon Spring on the right.

244
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:10,220
 And then the entire tunnel is about 2,000 feet long.

245
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,500
 And you walk the entire thing with a flashlight.

246
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:16,900
 And you went through the tunnel to the end,

247
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:20,220
 and you come out to the open air again,

248
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,420
 which is on the left.

249
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,300
 The left is Siloam Pool.

250
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:28,300
 Now this is a mighty thing that Hezekiah did in his time.

251
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,460
 And let me tell you this.

252
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,180
 If you understand a little bit about the background,

253
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:38,700
 you know this tunnel, 2,000 feet long,

254
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:40,300
 a body width, right?

255
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,860
 If you're too big in size, you cannot fit in, right?

256
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,260
 And good luck to you, right?

257
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:50,700
 And then water flowing from the spring

258
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:54,740
 all the way to the Siloam Pool inside the city.

259
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:56,900
 This water tunnel, this plumbing system

260
00:14:56,900 --> 00:15:01,860
 was the greatest achievement in his time

261
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,540
 in the entire world.

262
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,580
 You go back to 700 BC,

263
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:12,060
 the greatest plumbing system was done by Hezekiah Tunnel.

264
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,820
 You can't find it in Rome.

265
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,940
 You can't find it in Greece.

266
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,940
 You can't find it in Iran or Iraq.

267
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,820
 The greatest plumbing system of all time

268
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:25,180
 during Hezekiah's time was found there.

269
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,780
 And we were walking through it, right?

270
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,580
 The greatest plumbing system.

271
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,780
 Probably the plumbing system is better

272
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:32,580
 than those in your homes.

273
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:35,620
 The best plumbing system.

274
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,460
 The best achievement.

275
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,700
 And because of that,

276
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:43,820
 now one of the questions is why the tunnel was not straight?

277
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:46,700
 Why wasn't it straight?

278
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,860
 From left to right,

279
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:52,380
 the shortest distance should be a straight line, right?

280
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,740
 Through the mountain, right?

281
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,460
 You just hill through the mountain, straight line.

282
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,380
 Now what happened was that

283
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:00,420
 because during the Assyrian crisis,

284
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:03,820
 they had to build this plumbing system ASAP,

285
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,340
 as soon as possible.

286
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,740
 So he divided into two teams of workers.

287
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,140
 They're trying to dig from,

288
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,500
 one dig from the spring, downhill.

289
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:16,500
 The other team, team B, is digging from the water pool

290
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:21,060
 at, on your lower left, all the way uphill.

291
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,580
 And they're trying to hear the noise of digging.

292
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,940
 Trying to discern where the other team is.

293
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:28,900
 So they're trying to dig through the mountain.

294
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,260
 That's why it's curving around inside the mountain.

295
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,740
 Now this is a great achievement

296
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:38,700
 because, no, you didn't have any GPS, right?

297
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,780
 You didn't even have flashlight back then.

298
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:43,260
 You only have oil lamp, right?

299
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,940
 You have oil lamp and candle,

300
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:47,340
 and then you have to go through the mountain,

301
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:52,460
 totally dark, and try to hear the noise

302
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,820
 so that you can meet together at the midpoint.

303
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:57,060
 You see the midpoint?

304
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,140
 They're trying to dig in, you know,

305
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,740
 with some excitement, right?

306
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,100
 You want to get to work, right?

307
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,540
 Because the Assyrians are coming.

308
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,340
 Crisis is coming to us.

309
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,540
 So they're trying to meet together.

310
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,140
 So the middle point is kind of like,

311
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,260
 there are some false starts,

312
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,820
 there are some false places

313
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:15,860
 they have to correct themselves.

314
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:18,380
 So that's why the tunnel is not straight.

315
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:22,340
 And then toward the end, there is an inscription.

316
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:25,260
 About 150 years ago, there's a high school boy

317
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,900
 who skipped school that day, 150 years ago.

318
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,340
 And then he was swimming in the pool.

319
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:34,380
 And then he started to say to himself,

320
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:37,300
 "Okay, let me go inside the tunnel."

321
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,740
 So he swam, swimming, swimming,

322
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,340
 and swim a little bit into the tunnel,

323
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:45,780
 about six meters deep inside the tunnel.

324
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,140
 And then he slipped.

325
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,220
 He drowned a little bit, and then he got up.

326
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,740
 And then he wiped his face,

327
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:57,300
 and he saw a stone inscription on the side of the tunnel.

328
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,540
 And that inscription can be translated,

329
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:04,940
 and it is kind of, you know,

330
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:07,620
 two feet by one foot,

331
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:11,100
 a stone inscription.

332
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,700
 And if you translate it,

333
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:16,660
 what it says is the story of digging through the tunnel.

334
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,220
 Let me translate it.

335
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:21,620
 The tunnel, this is the story of the tunnel.

336
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:24,340
 And they are digging against each other

337
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,540
 while three cubits was left.

338
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:29,460
 The voice of a man called to his teammate,

339
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:32,980
 his counterpart, and there was a sada,

340
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,420
 whatever that is, right?

341
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:36,820
 Probably a crack in the rock.

342
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,620
 And on the right and on the left,

343
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,860
 on the day of the tunnel,

344
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,300
 the stone covers struck each other

345
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:46,300
 toward his counterpart, X against X,

346
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,940
 and flow water from the source, the Gihon Spring,

347
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:54,700
 to the port for 1,200 cubits.

348
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:58,340
 It's about 1,900 feet long,

349
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:03,340
 and six cubit high in terms of the height of the tunnel

350
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,900
 over the head of the stone covers.

351
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,260
 Now, I don't know how to translate

352
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,780
 to express the excitement,

353
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:13,260
 because this is a historical record, right?

354
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,140
 So all you can do, all I can do,

355
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:18,180
 is add exclamation mark, right?

356
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,740
 You add a lot of exclamation mark.

357
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,580
 This is the greatest achievement of all time.

358
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,580
 It is the water tunnel is being done, right?

359
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,340
 So the high school boy who skipped school that day

360
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:33,700
 found this important inscription.

361
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:36,540
 So I guess one of the lesson is it's okay to skip school.

362
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:41,340
 You found something really, really important, right?

363
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,620
 Anyways, this is what the Bible recorded.

364
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,420
 This is the water tunnel, the greatest achievement of all.

365
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:53,940
 And second king did not fail to mention it.

366
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,300
 And that's the first point.

367
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,700
 But the second point I want to bring out

368
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
 is the importance of faith.

369
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:04,140
 Let me try to understand the biblical perspective

370
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,060
 on the life of Hezekiah.

371
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:09,580
 And how does the Bible see your life?

372
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,500
 How does Bible evaluate your life?

373
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,180
 How does the Bible evaluate the reign of Hezekiah?

374
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:22,380
 Let's take a look at this passage again.

375
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:24,340
 2020, second Kings.

376
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,740
 The rest of the events in Hezekiah's reign,

377
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,180
 including the extent of his power,

378
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:33,020
 how he built this and that water tunnel,

379
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,980
 recorded somewhere else in the book of history

380
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,340
 of the kings of Judah.

381
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:45,020
 Now this face, the rest of his achievements,

382
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:51,740
 is often repeated throughout the book of first and second Kings

383
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,620
 for each king, his political history.

384
00:20:55,620 --> 00:21:00,140
 At the end of it, the book of Kings always concludes

385
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:03,620
 the rest of the events of this king or that king.

386
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:08,660
 Now in terms of Hezekiah, the Bible sees,

387
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:13,660
 did record the great achievement, the water tunnel.

388
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,900
 Again, it's the best plumbing system in his time

389
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,740
 in the world.

390
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,060
 However, what is the key word here?

391
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:26,260
 The key word is the rest.

392
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,340
 Now if you record, if you are the court historian,

393
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,460
 if you're going to write a book on Hezekiah,

394
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,380
 what would you spend most of your details

395
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,900
 or most of your content on?

396
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,800
 You're gonna talk about this tunnel.

397
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:49,560
 You're gonna talk about the engineering project,

398
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,200
 the water engineering project, right?

399
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,020
 Now if you have read some of the political history

400
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:59,380
 or autobiographies of politicians,

401
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,780
 you will open the book and you find,

402
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:05,400
 okay, this president or that politician

403
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,860
 has done something great, right?

404
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,420
 That's what biography, royal biography does.

405
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,420
 To praise a guy or a lady,

406
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:22,000
 how, what great achievement he has done or she has done.

407
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,980
 All kinds of autobiographies,

408
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:32,340
 Obama, Hillary Clinton, or whatever big politicians,

409
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:35,260
 when they write their own biography,

410
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,020
 when they write their own story,

411
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,500
 they would lift up or exalt

412
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,060
 the great things they have done.

413
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:47,780
 Here, second Kings has done something totally different.

414
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:51,980
 The greatest project, yeah, I'll mention it,

415
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,740
 but it's the rest of the archive.

416
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,220
 You can dig it up, right?

417
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,640
 I save it on another hard drive, right?

418
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,420
 But you can reshift the data if you want,

419
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,760
 if you're interested.

420
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,460
 But I'm not interested in it, right?

421
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,500
 It's in the rest of his deeds,

422
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,900
 the rest of his achievement is recorded in the other book.

423
00:23:11,900 --> 00:23:14,260
 That's what I'm talking about.

424
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,600
 I wanna talk about not his great achievement.

425
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,820
 I wanna talk about something else.

426
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,940
 Now, this is the biblical perspective on someone's life.

427
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,160
 Think about your life.

428
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,060
 If you're gonna write a book,

429
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,260
 a biography of yourself, your history,

430
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:35,580
 what would you put in it?

431
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,780
 You probably would think, naturally,

432
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:42,080
 we would think that we'll put our great achievement, right?

433
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,300
 Which school I went to, I went to Harvard,

434
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,480
 I went to the best school of the world,

435
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,740
 I got the best education, right?

436
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:54,740
 I graduated with, I don't know, straight A, 4.0, right?

437
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:58,540
 And I went to this company or that company,

438
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:02,300
 Fortune 500 company, I got so much achievement.

439
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:05,800
 And I'm gonna put it in my book, my reign.

440
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:10,540
 But that is not the perspective of the Bible.

441
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:14,340
 The Bible pay attention to something else.

442
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:17,060
 Yeah, you have your own achievement, that's fine.

443
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,900
 I'm gonna talk about it in one verse.

444
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:25,340
 The rest of the chapters from 2 Kings 18 to 20,

445
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:28,000
 what does the book of Kings talk about?

446
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,900
 And think about it.

447
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,600
 If you understand the perspective,

448
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:37,320
 how would the Bible, how would God sees your life?

449
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,220
 How would God evaluates your life?

450
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:45,220
 The rest of his deeds, mentioned somewhere else.

451
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,020
 But what I wanna focus on,

452
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:51,120
 what the Bible wants to emphasize is this.

453
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:55,460
 At the beginning of Hezekiah's reign, his record,

454
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,060
 18 verse three,

455
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:03,660
 Hezekiah did what was pleasing in the Lord's sight.

456
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:06,740
 Just as his ancestor, his father David, had done.

457
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:11,540
 He removed the pagan shrines, smashed the sacred pillars,

458
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:13,340
 and cut down Asherah posts.

459
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,620
 Those are the pagan idols across his country.

460
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:20,720
 He broke them and he removed them.

461
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,620
 Hezekiah trust in the Lord God of Israel.

462
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:28,140
 There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah,

463
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,420
 either before or after his time.

464
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,580
 He remained faithful to the Lord in everything.

465
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:36,740
 And he carefully obey all the commands

466
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:40,500
 of the Lord had given Moses.

467
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,260
 So the Lord was with him.

468
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,380
 What the Bible sees is his faith,

469
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,100
 his spiritual life, his relationship with God.

470
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:58,020
 When things are going right in his life, God walks with him.

471
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:02,180
 When he faces crisis, a Syrian crisis,

472
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,700
 or whatever crisis you are facing,

473
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:07,180
 he depend on the Lord, he trust in the Lord.

474
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:11,780
 That goes into the record of first and second kings.

475
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,340
 That's what God wants to see.

476
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,140
 That's what God want to focus on.

477
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:18,740
 You see what I'm saying?

478
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:24,980
 Your construction, your achievements,

479
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,860
 maybe they are important.

480
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,460
 You know, in Hezekiah's day,

481
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:32,500
 he had to devise some political strategy.

482
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,460
 He has to achieve something in order to defend the city.

483
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,500
 But at the end of the day, who save him?

484
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,060
 Yahweh save him, God save him.

485
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:47,180
 When crisis hits you, you can do all the preparation.

486
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,660
 This is part of our faithful stewardship, right?

487
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,060
 We have to be responsible.

488
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,940
 We have to go to a doctor.

489
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:56,420
 We have to find the best medical treatment.

490
00:26:56,420 --> 00:27:00,140
 We have to find the best way to manage our lives.

491
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,500
 But the end of the day, do not forget

492
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,580
 as what happened to Hezekiah.

493
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,460
 He did not save himself.

494
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:14,220
 The water tunnel, as mighty as it was, did not save him.

495
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:17,700
 At the end of the day, he went to the temple

496
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,580
 and prayed for salvation.

497
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,140
 Prayed that God will help him.

498
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:25,700
 And then God help him.

499
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:29,700
 At the end of the day, the credit goes to the creator,

500
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,860
 his Lord and savior, no one else.

501
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:35,940
 You see what I mean?

502
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,060
 You can manage your life.

503
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,900
 You should.

504
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:44,020
 You may have a little bit achievement here and there,

505
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:46,620
 here and there, and maybe those are important.

506
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,060
 But when God sees your life, okay,

507
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:53,220
 I put one verse, summarize it.

508
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,140
 All your achievement are becoming footnotes.

509
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:01,580
 The main content of your life is your spiritual life.

510
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:04,260
 It's your faith.

511
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:07,460
 Whether you are depending on God in times of crisis,

512
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:12,020
 whether you do not forget God in times of blessing,

513
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,260
 it's your relationship with God.

514
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:18,540
 That is all that matters at the end of the day.

515
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:20,660
 That is God's perspective seeing you.

516
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:24,940
 Not how the culture sees you, not how the world sees you,

517
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,620
 not how you see yourself.

518
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,820
 It's how the Bible sees you.

519
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:36,020
 That brings to my third point, it's the call for stewardship.

520
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:41,700
 God has entrusted us with different things,

521
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,580
 resources, time, our money, all kinds of resources

522
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,660
 He has entrusted to us.

523
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:53,580
 That's why we have this word, theological word, stewardship.

524
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:57,540
 Comes from an old English word, steward.

525
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:00,820
 A steward is a manager of the house.

526
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,300
 To use a modern analogy, it's kind of like a bank manager.

527
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,860
 When you go to the bank, you deposit your money

528
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,420
 into your bank account.

529
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:14,260
 And the bank is entrusted with your money,

530
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:18,100
 and the bank, hopefully, the bank will faithfully

531
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,460
 and wisely manage your money.

532
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,420
 In times of need, you go to the bank

533
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:26,100
 and you withdraw some money, right?

534
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,820
 It really does not belong to the bank manager.

535
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:32,900
 The bank manager is managing someone else's resource,

536
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,740
 your resource.

537
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:38,660
 This is the same way our relationship with God and you.

538
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:43,660
 God entrusts something in you, in your life.

539
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,980
 And you're kind of like a bank manager.

540
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:47,540
 You're a steward.

541
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:52,540
 And the only thing required for you is faithfulness.

542
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:57,020
 Whether you're using all the resources as much as possible

543
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,420
 to serve God and to worship Him.

544
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:02,660
 That is biblical stewardship.

545
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:04,820
 And do not forget that.

546
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,580
 And that's what Hezekiah's story is all about.

547
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:11,140
 Why didn't the Bible, I actually want the Bible

548
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:16,140
 to talk more about the Hezekiah tunnel, right?

549
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:20,780
 I want a whole chapter talking about it.

550
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:25,100
 However, the biblical author did not care.

551
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,860
 And think about it.

552
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,180
 In the great scheme of things,

553
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:35,180
 God does not really care about your earthly achievement.

554
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:40,060
 What He cares is how you manage it to glorify Him.

555
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:43,440
 How you build your life on the word of God,

556
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,780
 in obedience to Him.

557
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:47,760
 That is what matters at the end of the day.

558
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,380
 You are God's steward and trusted with all sorts of things.

559
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:58,220
 How are you managing it?

560
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:03,180
 If God calls you to give an account today,

561
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:07,100
 how would you respond?

562
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:07,940
 Today.

563
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:12,780
 Will God seize your life saying,

564
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,060
 "Hey, you are being faithful.

565
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:18,660
 "You're a good and faithful servant.

566
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,360
 "And you're coming to my kingdom."

567
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,500
 Or maybe God will see you, you are wicked.

568
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,020
 You wasted all of my resources.

569
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,140
 You are not a faithful manager.

570
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,580
 That is biblical stewardship.

571
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:40,100
 I officiate a lot of funerals.

572
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,100
 I've served in the pastoral role

573
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:45,900
 for probably close to 30 years.

574
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,420
 And I have done so many, so many funerals.

575
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,380
 I remember one year, in my early year,

576
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:57,200
 I have to officiate 40 funerals in a year.

577
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,540
 40 funerals.

578
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:03,300
 Sometimes two funerals a week.

579
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,540
 Especially in winter time in Chicago.

580
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:08,300
 More people die in the depressing time.

581
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:12,200
 If you go to a funeral, if you go to a funeral,

582
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:15,320
 well, I mean, it's not a nice thing to say,

583
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:17,620
 but you should go to funerals more.

584
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,300
 At 10 funerals.

585
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,180
 You know why?

586
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:26,500
 Because there's a part in the funeral service,

587
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,300
 there's a part called eulogy.

588
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:33,100
 Eulogy means speak good, right?

589
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,920
 Speak good, it's a Greek word.

590
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:37,620
 Speak good of a person, right?

591
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:41,040
 Eulogy is, you know, reciting the history

592
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:43,320
 or remembering the history of someone,

593
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,440
 the deceased family member.

594
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,300
 All the eulogies I've heard

595
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:56,260
 have nothing to do with the deceased achievements.

596
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:00,820
 Nobody will come up to the podium in the funeral service

597
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:04,300
 and say, "Oh, he got a lot of money, you know what?

598
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,700
 "He got a lot of investment.

599
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:08,580
 "He's so great in terms of money.

600
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,340
 "Look at how many figures he has in the bank account."

601
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:14,260
 Nobody will say anything like that.

602
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:17,140
 Most of the eulogies will talk about

603
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,540
 the character of the person.

604
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:23,060
 How he has been a blessing to other people.

605
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:28,620
 The family, the community, the neighborhood, right?

606
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:31,500
 The church, his spiritual life.

607
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,200
 Most of the things mentioned in the eulogies

608
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:39,520
 are those things, the spiritual things, so to speak.

609
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,100
 Your relationship with God

610
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:45,100
 and your relationship with other people.

611
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,820
 Whether you are walking in the way of God

612
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:52,780
 or you are loving other people just as God loves them

613
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,380
 and you try your best to do it,

614
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:57,500
 those are the things going to the account.

615
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:03,060
 Those are the things going to God's record of your life.

616
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:06,220
 Don't lose that focus.

617
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,480
 Let's pray.

618
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:15,420
 Father, we wanna build our lives on your grace

619
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,980
 and thank you for calling us.

620
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,460
 Thank you for entrusting so many wonderful,

621
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,140
 great things in our lives.

622
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,100
 Yes, we do have some achievements.

623
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:31,760
 We exert great efforts in building our lives,

624
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,260
 but we pause right now

625
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:41,220
 and ask you to help us see our lives in your perspective,

626
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:48,340
 to evaluate all our doings, all our efforts

627
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,380
 in light of your eternal kingdom.

628
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:56,580
 And I pray, I pray that in times of blessing,

629
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,700
 we do not forget you.

630
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,900
 We thank you, we praise you.

631
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:06,340
 And in times of crisis, we don't forget you,

632
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:11,680
 knowing that you are our rock and you are our salvation.

633
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,580
 Thank you for your deliverance, thank you for your healing,

634
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:21,540
 thank you for your blessing that we enjoy.

635
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:26,540
 So in times of crisis, help us to focus on you

636
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:29,180
 because in the end of the days,

637
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:33,620
 it's our faith in you that matters.

638
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:38,400
 Pray that you will help us to focus on your kingdom.
