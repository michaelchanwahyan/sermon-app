1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
 Good morning, welcome to our worship service.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,420
 This is the first sermon of the year 2023.

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:09,720
 As we say goodbye to 2022,

4
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,020
 welcome to the new year 2023.

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,380
 We are probably thinking about a lot of different things.

6
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,420
 The Christmas season was just over.

7
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:25,420
 Probably your life or your house was in chaos or in a mess

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:28,340
 and you're trying to fix it

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:32,700
 and trying to put your house or your life back in order.

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,860
 The vacation mode is over

11
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:40,620
 and we're back to the so-called reality.

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:44,340
 And we should thank God in our calendar,

13
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,140
 in our daily life pattern,

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,140
 there's always time and always opportunity

15
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,380
 for us to say goodbye to the old and welcome the new.

16
00:00:57,380 --> 00:01:02,280
 And for us to transition from one period to another period.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,940
 I think this is a God sent moment

18
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:09,260
 for us to think about what our lives should be

19
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,420
 and where our life is heading to.

20
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:17,300
 In the new year, many of the people, including ourselves,

21
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:21,020
 are probably thinking about some resolutions, right?

22
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,660
 Some new year's resolution, probably losing weight.

23
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:26,180
 Any of you are thinking about this?

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:30,060
 Or quit some of the bad habit, going back to gym,

25
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,860
 paying off some debts or saving more money,

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,800
 building up a better or good habits.

27
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,700
 This kind of new year's resolutions.

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,660
 And I keep thinking about this question.

29
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:46,080
 I'm sure you do as well.

30
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,100
 What, as questions, should be thinking about

31
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:55,860
 in terms of new year's resolutions?

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:00,180
 As we transition from one period to another period,

33
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:06,420
 as we say goodbye to the old and welcoming the new year,

34
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,580
 what kind of new year's resolution

35
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:13,460
 should we be thinking about as the people of God?

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:16,620
 So I have chosen a fairly familiar passage

37
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,220
 to share with you, to reflect upon,

38
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:24,460
 so that we know what Jesus wants us to do.

39
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,660
 What kind of new year's resolution

40
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:31,660
 should we be keeping in mind at this time of the year?

41
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,420
 So as we welcome the new year,

42
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:36,460
 why don't we just read through this passage

43
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,460
 and see what we can take out of this passage?

44
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,780
 What kind of lessons we can learn?

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:48,340
 Here is Matthew chapter six.

46
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:50,420
 Now, Matthew chapter six is a familiar passage.

47
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:53,920
 It's actually the, sort of the conclusion

48
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,860
 of Sermon on the Mount,

49
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,180
 the famous, well-known sermon of Jesus

50
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,060
 giving to his disciples while on earth,

51
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,260
 teaching us what kingdom living is all about.

52
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:11,980
 So right at the end, almost the end of this long sermon

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,980
 from Matthew chapter five, all the way to chapter seven,

54
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:21,020
 we come to the end of chapter six.

55
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:26,020
 Six, 25, it says, "Therefore I tell you," Jesus says,

56
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,740
 "do not be anxious about your life,

57
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,340
 "what you will eat or what you will drink,

58
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,280
 "nor about your body, what you will put on.

59
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,020
 "It's not your life more than food

60
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,620
 "and the body more than clothing.

61
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:45,820
 "Look at the birds of the air.

62
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:49,880
 "They neither sow nor reap

63
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,960
 "nor gather into bonds,

64
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,840
 "yet your heavenly Father feeds them.

65
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,980
 "Are you not more value than they?

66
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:02,880
 "And which of you, by being anxious,

67
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,880
 "can add one single hour or cupid to his span of life?"

68
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:14,380
 So Jesus said, "Don't you worry about your essential needs,

69
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:19,480
 "the money, your bank account, your investment,

70
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,140
 "all this earthly concern that we have."

71
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:26,900
 Now, Jesus is not saying that we should be irresponsible.

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,060
 That's not the teaching of the Bible.

73
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,340
 Jesus is saying our mind and our heart

74
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:39,340
 should not be so fixed upon things like these.

75
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:42,560
 He says, "Look at the birds of the air.

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,480
 "The Father is feeding them.

77
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,360
 "They don't work as hard as we do.

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,700
 "They don't gather into bonds, they don't harvest,

79
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:54,600
 "but the heavenly Father is feeding them

80
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,620
 "and keeping them alive."

81
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:01,860
 And he compares that to our lives.

82
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,860
 "And which of you, by being anxious, just worrying,

83
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:11,520
 "working so hard, right, or overworking,

84
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,820
 "how many of us can do this, being anxious,

85
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,820
 "can add one single hour to the span of our life?"

86
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,940
 Now, the original word behind the word hour is cupid.

87
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:29,360
 Cupid is the arm length of the king,

88
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,820
 most probably Egyptian king, Pharaoh,

89
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,000
 using his arm as the standard of measurement

90
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,920
 in the ancient days.

91
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,920
 Cupid is arm length, is the smallest unit of measurement,

92
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:52,300
 smallest unit of length.

93
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,880
 So Jesus is saying, by having anxiety,

94
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,880
 cannot add a single cupid, cannot add the most basic,

95
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,400
 the smallest unit to the span of life of hours.

96
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,320
 So he keeps on saying,

97
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,100
 "Why are you anxious about clothing?"

98
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,100
 Right, what we wear, the outward appearance,

99
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,560
 the outward things.

100
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:25,000
 He said, "Look at the lilies of the field, how they grow.

101
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,440
 "They neither toil or spin."

102
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,880
 But I tell you, even King Solomon in all his glory

103
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,740
 was not to be compared to one of these,

104
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:42,240
 to the bird or the wild flowers, the lilies of the field.

105
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:48,340
 "But if God so clothes the grass of the field,

106
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,600
 "which today is alive, tomorrow will be gone

107
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,300
 "and thrown into an oven,

108
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,280
 "will he not much more clothe you,

109
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,180
 "O you of little faith?

110
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:04,960
 "Therefore, do not be anxious, saying,

111
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,360
 "What shall we eat?

112
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,720
 "What shall we drink?

113
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,260
 "What shall we wear?"

114
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,940
 For the Gentiles, those people who do not follow Jesus,

115
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,940
 do not know God, they seek after all these things,

116
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:23,200
 all this eating, drinking, clothing,

117
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,320
 but your heavenly Father knows what you need,

118
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,740
 that you need them all.

119
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,300
 But seek the kingdom of God and his righteousness

120
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,000
 and all these things will be added to you.

121
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:42,540
 Now, therefore, do not be anxious about tomorrow,

122
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:45,420
 for tomorrow will be anxious for itself.

123
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,740
 Enough for the day, sufficient for the day

124
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:50,580
 is its own trouble.

125
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:56,160
 Now, this is the one unit, one of the units

126
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,700
 of the Sermon on the Mount,

127
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:02,300
 talking about how the disciples should be living.

128
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:08,340
 What is the disciple of Christ should be seeking after all.

129
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:13,340
 Jesus is comparing some of the things

130
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:18,340
 that those people who don't know Jesus,

131
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:21,540
 what they're seeking, what they're going after,

132
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:24,820
 and compared to what a disciple of Christ

133
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,820
 should be seeking and pursuing.

134
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,780
 I remember years ago,

135
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:36,580
 I left Israel after my trip.

136
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,820
 It was about more than 10 years ago.

137
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,340
 I left Israel and I was waiting for the flight

138
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:46,060
 in the Tel Aviv airport.

139
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,060
 So I was walking around in the hallway of the airport

140
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,380
 and then I bum into a map

141
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:59,260
 outside of the Elor Airlines.

142
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:02,700
 Now, the Elor Airlines, as you can see here,

143
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:06,900
 is the national Israeli airline

144
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:11,900
 and it's one of the most well-known airlines in the world.

145
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:16,220
 So I went by the counter

146
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,420
 and then I saw this map.

147
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,220
 You know, this map, I was pretty curious,

148
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,120
 why is there a map like this by the counter of Elor?

149
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:31,680
 Can you guess what this map is all about?

150
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,120
 What is this map?

151
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,640
 Now, I have some options here.

152
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,420
 A, intercontinental highway system.

153
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:44,420
 So this Elor is intercontinental Africa to Asia or Europe,

154
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:49,920
 probably a highway system road map

155
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,680
 or the airline route map

156
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,920
 or none of the above.

157
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,880
 Which one do you think this map is all about?

158
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,940
 Is it the highway system?

159
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,880
 Is it the route map?

160
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,040
 Or is it none of the above?

161
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,560
 Now, the answer is, it's none of the above.

162
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:13,360
 It's not the highway system.

163
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,320
 This is not a map of the Elor airline route map.

164
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
 And now what this is all about

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,720
 is actually routes or map of routes

166
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,540
 of the migratory birds in Israel.

167
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:33,400
 Migratory birds, as we know,

168
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:36,240
 they fly from south to north and north to south,

169
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,360
 depending on the season.

170
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,360
 When it is in the winter, it's getting so cold,

171
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:48,820
 the birds will migrate down to the warmer climate, right?

172
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,620
 In the continent of Africa.

173
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,800
 So this map is very interesting,

174
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,800
 just right outside of Elor airline back then 10 years ago.

175
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,100
 It's not there anymore.

176
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,100
 So I took a picture.

177
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,760
 So I took this picture because as I saw this map,

178
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,420
 I immediately thought of Matthew 6,

179
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,120
 when Jesus said, "Do not worry about what you eat

180
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,480
 "and what you drink."

181
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,400
 Look at the birds of the air, check them out,

182
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,960
 see how they fly.

183
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:27,840
 And I immediately thought of this passage

184
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
 of the Sermon on the Mount,

185
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,600
 because Jesus was saying,

186
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,960
 referring to the birds of the air.

187
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:38,960
 And this is not by accident that Jesus knew something

188
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,200
 about the geography of Israel,

189
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,360
 because the birds are traveling north to south

190
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,000
 and south to north.

191
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,040
 They have to travel through the narrow strip of land

192
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,540
 of Israel Palestine.

193
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,080
 As you can see on the left or the west side

194
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,000
 of this long narrow strip is the Mediterranean Sea.

195
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,920
 And on the right is the desert of the Syrian,

196
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:15,360
 Saudi Arabia desert on the right or in the east.

197
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,980
 Now let me show you a map here.

198
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,660
 As you can see, this is the Google map.

199
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,520
 And you can see Israel is right here.

200
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,400
 And this long narrow corridor is the land bridge

201
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:34,360
 of all the continents, Africa, Asia minor and Europe,

202
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,920
 and Asia.

203
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,640
 This is the land bridge.

204
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:43,640
 And on the left is the huge Eastern Mediterranean Sea.

205
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:49,480
 And then on the right is the Saudi Arabia or Syrian desert.

206
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:53,580
 So the birds have to travel through from north to south

207
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:56,880
 or south to north, they have to fly through

208
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,160
 the land of Israel.

209
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,440
 In fact, in the land of Israel,

210
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,380
 just north of the lake of Galilee or Sea of Galilee,

211
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,760
 here there's a small strip of flat land called Hula Valley.

212
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:17,640
 This Hula Valley is famous for bird watching.

213
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:22,180
 In the end of the year, around the month of November

214
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,620
 or December, bird watching people would gather

215
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:30,140
 in this Hula Valley north of Sea of Galilee

216
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,700
 in order to just look at the birds,

217
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:38,220
 look at all this beautiful migratory birds

218
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:41,040
 flying through Israel.

219
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,940
 As you can see this beautiful pictures of birds

220
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:50,940
 and migratory birds are flying through the land of Israel,

221
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:58,100
 particularly through that corridor of Galilee.

222
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,620
 Migratory bird flying through Mount Hermon right here.

223
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,140
 So Jesus was saying, pointing to the birds

224
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:11,140
 and the disciples knew about this.

225
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,740
 It's about time of the year

226
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,940
 when the migratory birds will fly through

227
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,380
 this strip of land and they can see all sorts

228
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,380
 of different birds and different big and small

229
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:30,260
 flying creatures going through the land.

230
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:35,260
 So they are not unfamiliar with all of this

231
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:40,420
 beautiful birds and different migratory pattern.

232
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:46,540
 Jesus was pointing to something that they could see

233
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:51,540
 and they could observe and just ask them to open your eyes

234
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,660
 and see how the creatures of God, how the animals,

235
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:02,940
 how the birds are being taken care of by the heavenly father.

236
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:09,660
 So compared to our own lives, we are so much more valuable

237
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,220
 than one of these sparrow or birds.

238
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:18,940
 And then he take another example from the field.

239
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:23,220
 So the first example was to direct our eyes,

240
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:25,860
 direct our perspective toward the sky,

241
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,500
 see the migratory birds, right?

242
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,900
 They are being taken care of by the heavenly father,

243
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,180
 just like God will take care of you.

244
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:39,180
 And also he direct the perspective on the field.

245
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:42,060
 On the land.

246
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:45,140
 So we look up and then we look down

247
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,700
 and we see all kinds of wild flower,

248
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,060
 the lilies of the field.

249
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,500
 The wild flower growing in every single season,

250
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,580
 every single month, they have different colour

251
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,700
 in every month.

252
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:03,060
 Sometimes it's red, sometimes it's white,

253
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:07,180
 sometimes it's yellow, sometimes it's like

254
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:09,300
 this beautiful purple.

255
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:13,700
 So he was saying to these disciples, saying to us,

256
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:17,580
 look at the wild flower growing almost by themselves

257
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,820
 because the heavenly father is taking care of them.

258
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,020
 Look at the flower, how glorious

259
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,740
 and how beautiful they are.

260
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:33,500
 He said, compare the beauty of the wild flower in gallery.

261
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,860
 And you will notice how beautiful they are

262
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:41,620
 compared to the time of Solomon.

263
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:42,940
 Remember Jesus said,

264
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:47,460
 you see the wild flower, the lilies of the field,

265
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,220
 how glorious they are.

266
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,140
 They are more beautiful, more glorious,

267
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:56,060
 more majestic than the time of Solomon.

268
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:58,740
 In times of Solomon,

269
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:04,740
 the royal purple or the royal building

270
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,660
 were the glory.

271
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,500
 Now, if you know about something,

272
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:14,460
 if you know something about purple dye,

273
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,700
 the colour purple is really hard to obtain,

274
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,460
 even these days.

275
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:25,460
 Purple is the hardest dye,

276
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,500
 the hardest dye to obtain.

277
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,980
 Now, back in Jesus' day,

278
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:33,860
 when people need to have the purple dye,

279
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:37,220
 they have to go to the Mediterranean seacoast

280
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,220
 to gather the myrrh shells.

281
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:46,220
 And one of the, take the shells and open it up

282
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:49,420
 and you harvest the gland,

283
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:52,700
 a very small part of the myrrh.

284
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,980
 And then you gather all the glands

285
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,900
 and you can get some purple dye.

286
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,860
 Now, as you can see in this picture,

287
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,180
 you have to do that one by one

288
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:06,140
 in order to have purple,

289
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:10,380
 in order to have the most valuable,

290
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:13,780
 most royal colour in Jesus' day.

291
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:18,740
 How many do we need in order to dye purple?

292
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:23,740
 How many do we need in order to dye clothing into purple?

293
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,380
 Now, as you can see in this formula,

294
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:34,060
 you need 54 kilogram of myrrh shell

295
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:38,500
 that is equal to 119 pounds

296
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:43,460
 of different, many myrrh shells

297
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:48,460
 in order to produce only one gram of purple.

298
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,100
 One gram of the colour.

299
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,540
 It's so hard to get, right?

300
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,660
 It's so valuable.

301
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,580
 But look at the lilies of the field.

302
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,180
 Look at the pictures.

303
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:05,420
 Look at pictures how the purple flowers

304
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,940
 are just growing on the field.

305
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:11,060
 And God is taking care of them.

306
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:14,860
 God is clothing them with the best colour on earth.

307
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,220
 You cannot compare the beauty of this wildflower,

308
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:24,020
 this purple flower, red flower,

309
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:28,020
 with all these different kinds of beautiful colours.

310
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:31,780
 Compare them to the time of King Solomon,

311
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,100
 what he was wearing, right?

312
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,540
 These flowers is more beautiful

313
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:41,740
 than what Solomon has on his body.

314
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:44,580
 So don't you worry.

315
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:48,620
 Don't you overwork so hard

316
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,220
 in order to obtain one of these colours, right?

317
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,380
 One of these glories.

318
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:55,180
 Because you know that the heavenly father

319
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,300
 is taking care of you.

320
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,180
 Now, not only the purple colour

321
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:02,940
 was such a valuable in Jesus' day,

322
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:06,220
 even the buildings, the royal buildings, the temple,

323
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:11,220
 they were the most magnificent buildings

324
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:12,980
 on earth in those days.

325
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:19,220
 Here I show you a picture of a model of Jerusalem.

326
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,940
 The ratio is one to 50.

327
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:24,140
 You can see that in Israel Museum.

328
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,980
 As you can see this man here,

329
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:32,100
 you know, this model of Jerusalem is already,

330
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,300
 is very, very, very big.

331
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,340
 And the scale is only one to 50.

332
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:40,460
 Now, as you can see this model,

333
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,460
 it is gigantic temple mount.

334
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:48,300
 It is a glorious golden building of the temple.

335
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,420
 Now, when people think of Solomon,

336
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:55,420
 they think of the most glorious period of Israel's history.

337
00:20:55,420 --> 00:21:02,340
 I remember I had a dinner with some of the classmates

338
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:05,740
 when I was studying in Jerusalem.

339
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:07,620
 And we had the opportunity to sit down

340
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,260
 with some of the most,

341
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:17,260
 the best Israeli Jewish teachers in Jerusalem.

342
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:22,140
 So I remember one time we were sitting down around the table

343
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,700
 with one of the teachers that I really respect.

344
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:31,340
 He is Israeli Jewish teacher.

345
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:34,380
 And we were, you know, chit-chatting

346
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,460
 and talking about different things.

347
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:39,940
 And then one of the classmates asked the teacher,

348
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,380
 the Jewish teacher,

349
00:21:41,380 --> 00:21:44,660
 and if you had the opportunity,

350
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:49,340
 if you can travel back to the Old Testament time

351
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,980
 or the history of Israel,

352
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,740
 which period would you choose in order to witness

353
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,980
 the glory or what happened in those days?

354
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:03,220
 And without even thinking,

355
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,300
 he respond by saying,

356
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:10,300
 I would want to travel back to the time of King Solomon

357
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,700
 when he dedicate the temple,

358
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,660
 when the glory of God fills the temple

359
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,860
 and people cannot even enter.

360
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:19,900
 You know, that sort of glorious day,

361
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,340
 the good old days,

362
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,860
 was the time of King Solomon.

363
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,900
 But what was Jesus saying?

364
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,500
 Jesus was saying,

365
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,420
 even when you consider the most glorious,

366
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,700
 magnificent building,

367
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:37,380
 magnificent period of your history,

368
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,420
 this cannot be compared to the lilies of the field.

369
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,060
 How the father has clothed the field

370
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:51,580
 with all sorts of different valuable colors.

371
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:55,660
 You cannot compare them to one of these.

372
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:59,500
 One of these purple flowers or different kinds.

373
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:02,340
 They grow by themselves

374
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,900
 because the heavenly father is taking care of them.

375
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:10,980
 Now, the take home for us, as Jesus said,

376
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:14,180
 is that do not be overly anxious about

377
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,020
 what we eat and what we drink.

378
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,580
 Or housing, right?

379
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,100
 What kind of house do we have?

380
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,740
 What kind of house do we buy?

381
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:26,540
 What kind of car do we drive?

382
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:31,060
 Again, it's not suggesting

383
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:36,380
 in any way that we should live irresponsibly.

384
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,660
 We should be good stewards

385
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,340
 of all the resources God has given to us.

386
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:44,780
 But Jesus is saying, do not be overly anxious.

387
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,300
 Do not be just overly worrying.

388
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:53,740
 Or work just so hard on where you live,

389
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:58,340
 what you wear, and how you look.

390
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,380
 God is taking care of you.

391
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,100
 But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.

392
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,620
 And all these things, what we eat and what we drink,

393
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:16,540
 where we stay, will be added to you.

394
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,940
 Seek first the kingdom of God.

395
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:22,300
 I think a better translation would be

396
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,700
 pursue the kingdom of God.

397
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:30,380
 Run after first the kingdom of God.

398
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:35,060
 Be concerned about the name of God.

399
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,980
 Making God's name famous,

400
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:40,540
 it should be our first and foremost concern.

401
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,100
 And his righteousness, all the things

402
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,300
 that the word of God is teaching us to do.

403
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,620
 Be concerned and pursue above all

404
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:56,020
 the righteousness of God, what God requires us to do.

405
00:24:56,020 --> 00:25:00,260
 And then all these things will be provided for you.

406
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:03,420
 The priority of our lives,

407
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:09,460
 as we say goodbye to the old time, 2022,

408
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:12,140
 and welcome a new year, 2023,

409
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,980
 let us be reminded, seek first, run after,

410
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,860
 be the first and foremost concern

411
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,860
 in our desire to glorify God, to serve him.

412
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,940
 So talking about New Year's resolutions,

413
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,060
 how do you fill in the blanks?

414
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:35,140
 How do you fill in the blanks?

415
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:39,940
 What are those things that we should first seek after

416
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:43,340
 and desire most?

417
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,620
 Let me suggest to you five of them,

418
00:25:45,620 --> 00:25:49,700
 before considering any other things.

419
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:53,260
 First, live in the word of God.

420
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,500
 Read the word of God, meditate on it,

421
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,860
 reflect upon it, so that the word of God

422
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,860
 can fill our lives and inform our living.

423
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:06,700
 That is the first and foremost thing we can do

424
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:10,100
 and we have to do as disciples of Christ.

425
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,460
 When the word of God is filling your lives,

426
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:17,460
 your priority is correct, and your priority of lives,

427
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:22,340
 you know what is your foremost concern and desire.

428
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,340
 Then everything else will be configured correctly.

429
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:31,660
 Live in the word of God, read the word of God daily,

430
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,220
 every single day, meditate upon it.

431
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:37,780
 I'm not saying you have to read the word of God 24/7.

432
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:42,020
 I'm saying that should be our consistent pattern of thought.

433
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:46,180
 Think about what the Bible says,

434
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,180
 how we should make any decision,

435
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,740
 how we can please God.

436
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,780
 These are all coming from scripture.

437
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,020
 So we have to live in the word.

438
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,100
 And then secondly, I suggest that we have to pray daily.

439
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,980
 Pray for ourselves and most formally,

440
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:07,820
 and pray for others.

441
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,260
 Not just be concerned about our own needs

442
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,140
 and most of the time our own wants.

443
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,020
 You know, those are really insignificant

444
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,740
 compared to the eternal kingdom of God.

445
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,580
 Pray daily for other people,

446
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,700
 those who are in need around us.

447
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,300
 Pray for them and care for them.

448
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:27,220
 And third, worship wholeheartedly.

449
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,780
 Worship God with all of our heart

450
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:32,580
 and all of our soul and all of our strength.

451
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:36,580
 You know, we worship God because whenever we worship,

452
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,020
 we are reminded who is really the king,

453
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:43,180
 who is really the leader of our lives,

454
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,540
 not ourselves, God himself.

455
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:51,460
 And we can reset our priority on a weekly basis.

456
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:56,420
 That's why we insist on church not closing, right?

457
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,900
 Not be so concerned about, you know,

458
00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:03,620
 what kind of pandemic out there and disease out there.

459
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:07,700
 A church should be operating every single week.

460
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,140
 We worship God every single week, right?

461
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:11,980
 Wholeheartedly.

462
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:16,860
 Fourth, build up the family of a church,

463
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,860
 the family of God.

464
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,940
 The New Testament and the Old Testament

465
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:25,780
 regularly, consistently reminds us

466
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:31,380
 our number one concern to live socially

467
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,820
 is to build up the family of God.

468
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,820
 Use our gifts, use our talents to build up the church,

469
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:44,740
 to plan a church, to strengthen our church.

470
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,060
 Go to a fellowship and pray with other believers.

471
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,980
 Let other believers encourage you

472
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,860
 and let your presence be an encouragement to other people.

473
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,460
 Build up the family of the church.

474
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,220
 Fifth, practice stewardship, faithful stewardship.

475
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:09,220
 The Bible tells us use our time faithfully to serve God.

476
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,140
 Use our talent to serve God.

477
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:19,140
 Use our treasure, our money, our offering

478
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:24,460
 to build up the ministry for the glory of God.

479
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:27,700
 So seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness.

480
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:30,180
 Let this be our priority.

481
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:35,180
 Let us reset our list of things that we wanna do,

482
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:40,660
 our list of resolutions so that we can glorify God together.

483
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:43,420
 Let us all pray together.

484
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,940
 Father, we wanna give you thanks for a time of renewal.

485
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:52,740
 As we say goodbye to year 2023 and welcome a new year,

486
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:59,500
 let this be a reminder to all of us to reset our priority,

487
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,940
 to seek first your kingdom and your righteousness.

488
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,360
 And let us not be too concerned and overly anxious

489
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,260
 about the essential things,

490
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:15,180
 because we know that you will take care of us

491
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:19,940
 and help us to serve you, to worship you wholeheartedly.

492
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,280
 Help us to live faithfully according to your word.

493
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,320
 In Christ, we pray.

494
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:34,320
