1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,480
 All right guys, let's turn to our Bible and we're going to work on the Apostles Creek and we've been

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,360
 Examining the basic of our faith the core beliefs of our faith and when people ask you what is

3
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,300
 Christianity all about and you should be able to give a ready answer, right?

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:27,440
 this is what the Creek of Apostles is all about right an ancient Creek almost 2,000 years old and

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,560
 Going back to almost the Apostolic Age

6
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:34,240
 So we are working through

7
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,440
 Possibly line by line

8
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,680
 Something like that and we started with the first statement and we're going to move on to the next section today

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,760
 But let's reveal the first statement. I believe God the Father Almighty

10
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,720
 Creator of heaven and earth. All right

11
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,900
 So I want you to really think about it because the Apostles Creek even though there's there are only 12 statements

12
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:04,220
 It's not a long document is pretty much a pocket size, right? You can fill into one screen on your phone

13
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:10,320
 But these 12 statements are the core beliefs the foundations of Christianity

14
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,620
 I believe in God the Father creator of heaven and earth and that statement the first one

15
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,180
 alone sets apart

16
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,580
 Christianity from all other religions

17
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,300
 Think about it. It sets apart

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,260
 Christianity from all other religions

19
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:32,860
 We live in the time of

20
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:38,900
 What we call pluralism, right? Everything should be considered equally, right?

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,820
 That's what pluralism means

22
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,260
 Or we value diversity

23
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:48,160
 We live in a time when we always hear people say

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:54,820
 All religions are the same right all religions are helping people to do good

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:57,460
 Right to help you improve

26
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:01,020
 And on all faiths the same, right?

27
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:05,740
 That is the cultural script. That is what the culture is telling us all

28
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:10,940
 Beliefs all religions are taught are teaching us how to be a better person

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:16,540
 That is the assumption right but this statement actually sets apart

30
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,500
 Christianity from all others think about Christianity and

31
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,340
 Buddhism

32
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,620
 Or Hinduism or Islam

33
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,780
 Are they all the same this statement says no because these

34
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:35,700
 Apostles creeds

35
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:42,100
 Begin with God being the creator of the universe and the world has a beginning

36
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,740
 the world has a

37
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:47,660
 beginning of a personal agent

38
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:56,260
 Someone has started the world God the creator it sets the Christian faith apart from many other

39
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,300
 Eastern religions

40
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,780
 for example Buddhism

41
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,940
 Is it also sets apart the biblical faith?

42
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,540
 from all other secular religions or

43
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,500
 ideologies right religions or ideologies

44
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,980
 atheism or

45
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,180
 materialism

46
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,020
 that belief

47
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,420
 essentially

48
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:23,980
 Matter is all there is right from eternal to eternal

49
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:26,740
 all

50
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,820
 matters

51
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,820
 But this statement says no

52
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,580
 The universe that we live in we are part of the universe

53
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,020
 exists all because of a

54
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,020
 personal God who created it and

55
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,900
 It has a reason to be

56
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,740
 This universe and you and me we exist. There was a reason right?

57
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:53,100
 But as I work through

58
00:03:53,100 --> 00:04:00,100
 Some of the passages in the Bible that talks about the beginning of the universe you understand. It's not a scientific report, right?

59
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,540
 So get this. Okay. This is your take home

60
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:05,620
 Go out from this church

61
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:11,340
 The rest of the week don't even think that the Bible is this scientific report

62
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,460
 No, it is not is this an ancient document?

63
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,220
 It is a document from many many years ago

64
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:22,100
 however, God used those concepts to

65
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,660
 To to teach us

66
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:32,500
 That who is in charge and who started all right. So Genesis 1 and 2 are not

67
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,540
 Scientific reports. All right

68
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,420
 They are theological report the theological statements telling us who

69
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,580
 Is behind all of this?

70
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,980
 I was reading a very very old book our print book and

71
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:53,980
 Written by J. I Pecker. I think he said it's so right. So I want to quote it

72
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:59,020
 He in this book I want to be a Christian

73
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:03,500
 Written long time ago our print but he said it's so right

74
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,140
 He said Genesis wanted to tell us who?

75
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,740
 with so many answers about how

76
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:13,300
 Some today think this is a defect

77
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:19,380
 but in a long huge perspective of history our present-day scientific

78
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,860
 preoccupation with how rather than who looks very odd in itself

79
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,700
 rather than criticizing these chapters

80
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:32,660
 For not feeding our secular modern contemporary interest

81
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:36,940
 Scientific interest we should take from them Genesis 1 & 2

82
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:41,420
 Needed we built of our perverse passion

83
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:48,500
 For knowing the nature to creation without regard to what matter most mainly nature's creator

84
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:52,780
 We are obsessed with the how right?

85
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:57,420
 Technology science right they have their place, but we are sometimes

86
00:05:57,420 --> 00:06:00,660
 totally obsessed by this

87
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:08,420
 We need to be rebuilt because we are interested in the how not the who the Bible tells us we should be concerned about the who

88
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,020
 Who do we worship and who do we follow? It's God himself the Creator

89
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:20,300
 He continues the message of these two chapters is this you have seen the sea the sky

90
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,220
 the Sun moon the stars and

91
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:30,460
 Wonderful complexity of the creation be it human beings and all that fantastic, isn't it? Well now meet the one

92
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,580
 Who is behind it all?

93
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:37,100
 Genesis 1 & 2 are telling us. Hey, you have enjoyed these works of art

94
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:42,820
 And now you must shake hands with the artist and you are thrilled by the music

95
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,260
 We now introduce you to the composer

96
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:51,700
 It is to show us the composer the artist the creator

97
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:56,100
 Rather than the creation. That's what Genesis is all about

98
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:00,460
 That's what Genesis 1 & 2 is all about and the Apostles Creek rightly

99
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:04,500
 Says that we believe in this Creator God himself

100
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:12,740
 Creator of heaven earth creator of our existence our world and then it continues to a huge section about

101
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,740
 Jesus Christ the Son of God

102
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:21,380
 Now you can tell from the highlight. This is the longest section of

103
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:30,100
 The whole Apostles Creek the longest section on Jesus Christ the central section the core of everything

104
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:38,100
 because there are short statements before the highlight and then there are short statements after it but

105
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,860
 these short statements

106
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,140
 sandwiched

107
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,940
 the middle and

108
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,620
 It is all about

109
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:48,260
 Christ himself Jesus Christ himself

110
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:50,540
 now Jesus

111
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,020
 It's a name. All right, that's the name

112
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,740
 in Greek

113
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,460
 or

114
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:59,660
 Greek is for Joshua and Joshua

115
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:05,220
 Was was originally a Hebrew name. So Joshua Jesus

116
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,900
 Mean the same thing

117
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:11,460
 It's a proper name, right just like you can call me mark, right?

118
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:17,740
 Now it tells us from the Bible that Jesus is

119
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,700
 the only Son of God and

120
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,940
 was Mary's son

121
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:24,780
 from virgin birth

122
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,820
 Now that means it is only possible

123
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,420
 with God's miracle

124
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,060
 the birth of Jesus a miracle child

125
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:40,420
 The accomplishment of the plan of God the redemption of God is only possible because God did

126
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:45,420
 Also tells us the humaneness of Jesus Christ his humanity

127
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,100
 He is from Nazareth

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,300
 in Galilee

129
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,820
 He was a carpenter a Jewish carpenter

130
00:08:53,820 --> 00:09:01,700
 He worked for three years as a rabbi and was put to death as the statement says was crucified and died

131
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,580
 in a specific time

132
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,980
 in the time of Pontius Pilate

133
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,860
 right

134
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,060
 so all the statement tells us that

135
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:14,140
 Jesus was a

136
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,580
 historical person, right a

137
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:19,860
 You a historical person

138
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:27,900
 You are right someday you die. Hopefully you live some footprint in the book or so

139
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,900
 All right on a tombstone

140
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:32,980
 You are historical

141
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:37,700
 Jesus was historical but he's more than a historical figure

142
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:42,500
 Because what Jesus has said or what Jesus has done

143
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:47,220
 It's beyond what a human could do or could say

144
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:52,300
 So Jesus is the centerpiece of the Apostle's Creed

145
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:57,620
 And then I said Jesus is the name but Christ is a title

146
00:09:57,620 --> 00:10:04,300
 All right, Christ is not a proper name. Just like pastor is not a name, right?

147
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,580
 You can call me mark, right? This is my proper name

148
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:16,220
 But my proper name is not pastor, right? The title is the pastor Christ is a title, right?

149
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,900
 Um, don't mistake it saying Jesus Christ because his last name is Christ

150
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:29,220
 Christ is not Chen. It's not Lee. It's not Smith or any last name, right? It's an office

151
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,780
 title

152
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,780
 It's from the Hebrew Bible from the Old Testament

153
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:34,780
 Messiah

154
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:38,540
 So Messiah is the Hebrew and then translated to Greek is Christ

155
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,620
 meaning anointed one

156
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,020
 In the Old Testament culture in the Hebrew culture whenever a king is being set apart

157
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:51,140
 To be to reign on earth to reign on behalf of God

158
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:55,860
 He is being set apart by pouring oil on his head on his hair

159
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,140
 Over his head that is anointment right to

160
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:03,340
 To set him apart as king

161
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,900
 Now so that's why Jesus Christ

162
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:13,540
 Means Jesus the Messiah, right Jesus the Christ the Messiah the king. It's a title

163
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:16,860
 only much later in the Christian

164
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,060
 Generations and generations after after Christ

165
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,900
 Christ becomes a proper name, right?

166
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:28,620
 from a proper

167
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:33,260
 Title become becoming a proper name. So that's why

168
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,420
 Even in the New Testament Jesus and Christ are synonymous

169
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:42,500
 You can call Christ Jesus or Jesus Christ, but you do know that the

170
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:50,660
 Word Christ means he is the king. He is being anointed by God. He died but rose again

171
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:57,860
 So he rightly reigns over all of us and even the universe when he comes back

172
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:06,660
 So whether we believe in Jesus Christ as the Bible says or not now, we still need to understand who Jesus really is. I

173
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,780
 Once had a conversation with a Buddhist monk in Chinatown

174
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:14,220
 Interesting, right?

175
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:17,100
 So we met in a community meeting

176
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:25,080
 Something like that and then after the meeting we kind of you know, shake hand and instills one another and then

177
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,140
 You know because they a Buddhist monk has a different dress, right?

178
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:35,900
 They got the rope right? I don't right and then I approach him and I

179
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:39,020
 Introduce myself. I'm I am

180
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,060
 My name is Mark, right and I'm Pastor Mark

181
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:51,180
 So he introduced himself and then we try to talk and then try to strike conversation and after the monk

182
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:55,820
 Learned that I'm a Christian church pastor and our conversation quickly

183
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:58,460
 Turn into as you can tell

184
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:04,380
 About our religions, right? And then this monk continues. He said oh

185
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,020
 Great your church pastor and we are the same

186
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:11,100
 And I was kind of astonished

187
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,900
 Yeah, really, you know, I didn't shake my head. Um

188
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,300
 He said we are the same

189
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:22,020
 Both your religion and my religion are essentially the same because we are teaching people how to do good, right?

190
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:28,720
 Oh, that's nice. You know, you're doing your part and I'm doing my part and I quickly answer, you know, respectively, of course

191
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,340
 Right, respectively. I said, um, you know what? Mr.

192
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:35,060
 monk, uh

193
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,460
 I

194
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:42,740
 Forgot his name. I forgot. He has his title. Yes. It's a very formal title. I said, hmm

195
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:45,900
 Not really

196
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:50,060
 And then he was kind of stunned and you know, I disagree with him, you know

197
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,620
 And I started to talk about you know, who Jesus is I

198
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,140
 Started to talk about who Jesus Christ is

199
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,700
 Right. He died on the cross to save us

200
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:04,900
 And he rose again. I

201
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:08,460
 Talked to him. We are being saved not because we do good

202
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:12,860
 We have been saved because someone else

203
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,220
 Did something on our behalf so that we are justified

204
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:24,620
 Right, so we become righteous at least positionally we become righteous

205
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:28,580
 so I so I can't kind of counter and then

206
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:31,740
 finally, you know after

207
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,820
 my, you know impromptu preaching

208
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,420
 to him

209
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,140
 He said okay, maybe the two religions are with a different I

210
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:49,220
 Said of course, we're different right what we expect you you try to teach people to do good

211
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:55,420
 But you know is apple and orange right you can't say okay we are

212
00:14:55,420 --> 00:15:02,500
 You know, you don't say you don't say dogs and cats are the same because both of them have four legs, right?

213
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:11,060
 Simply because of that right the comments the lowest common denominator, right? I think that's a logical fallacy, right?

214
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:13,020
 you got to

215
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:18,460
 Compare and contrast right in order to know the essence of the two, right?

216
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:25,420
 As I said in the beginning our culture is telling us everything is the same all are the same

217
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,860
 But you know, I bet to be the differ

218
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:31,020
 And the Bible does that too?

219
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:34,100
 Romans 5

220
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:40,620
 Romans 5 Paul is writing to the church. He said you see at just the right time

221
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:43,140
 When we were still powerless

222
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,580
 Christ died for the ungodly

223
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:55,140
 Very rarely will anyone die for a righteous man. Though for good men someone might possibly dare to die

224
00:15:55,140 --> 00:16:01,860
 But God demonstrates his own love for us in this look at this

225
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,420
 While we were still sinners Christ died for us

226
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,220
 This is there's not a hint of

227
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,780
 Improvement. There's not a hint of

228
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:18,980
 Being better so I can come to Christ. No, there's not a clue here

229
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:24,080
 We begin with the premise that we are sinners

230
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:28,740
 It says we are sinners. We are powerless. We are condemned and

231
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:32,580
 The pastor says we are ungodly

232
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:37,580
 Let me focus on this

233
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:44,020
 Emphasize this I emphasize this to many many people even those who have come to church for many many years

234
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:49,220
 Somehow so we don't get it. You know, let me emphasize this the Bible

235
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,580
 the Bible

236
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:54,980
 The Bible is not about teaching us to do good

237
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,980
 Scripture

238
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:06,020
 It's not about teaching you and me to do good, all right, so people are pretty stunned when I said this, right

239
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:10,340
 I remember that one time I was in the church. I was talking to

240
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,500
 Quite a few people from from China

241
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:19,740
 Actually, I was in Tel Aviv. I was in Israel. They have a little Chinese church there

242
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:27,180
 So I was invited to to speak so after speaking I was just discussing with some some of the people

243
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:33,380
 There and some of them are Christian some of them are not and I said that in order to stun them, you know in order to

244
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:39,900
 Shock, you know, I said, you know, we're looking at the Bible right? The Bible is not about teaching us to do good and

245
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,340
 They were like what?

246
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:49,540
 Because they have some sort of you know, notion of sacredness, right? This scripture, of course is about it's something good, right?

247
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:56,760
 Something to teach us good. No, I said no, I never found a verse in the Bible that teach us to do good

248
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,420
 They said Willie. I said yes, I'm serious

249
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:07,780
 Look at me. I'm pastor. Okay. I'm telling you the Bible is not about teaching us to do good to be good

250
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:12,900
 Let me say this again. The Bible the biblical faith is not about self-improvement

251
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:18,020
 So that we can be a better moral persons

252
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:20,260
 No

253
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:23,460
 Never find any word or verse in the Bible. I

254
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,620
 Really don't I study Bible for

255
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:29,660
 quite some years

256
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:32,020
 I really don't find any self-help

257
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:35,300
 moral lessons in the Bible I

258
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,620
 don't

259
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:41,940
 The Bible is not telling us to do good. No instead

260
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,940
 the Bible

261
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,740
 Is showing us we cannot do good

262
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:56,760
 We are not good and never can we be good enough that's what the Bible says

263
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:05,420
 The Bible says you cannot be good and you never

264
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:09,580
 Never can you be good enough?

265
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:13,260
 We are sinners

266
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,540
 We are powerless

267
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:17,540
 We're powerless to do good

268
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:21,260
 We're condemned in our sin in death

269
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:28,860
 So, what can we do that's what the Bible says Jesus came

270
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,180
 Jesus came to save us. That is the good news

271
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:39,140
 That is the gospel. That is what the Bible is trying to do

272
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:45,180
 So when we come to the Apostles Creek trying to understand who Jesus is

273
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,180
 Consider

274
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,420
 Carefully

275
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,420
 Who Jesus is?

276
00:19:54,420 --> 00:20:01,500
 If the Bible is the gospel is all about improving ourselves, you know being better so that we can come to church

277
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,860
 We can come before God

278
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,020
 Then Jesus didn't have to die, right?

279
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:12,540
 Jesus have to do whatever he has done or say whatever he has said, right?

280
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:21,020
 As we call in the Bible Jesus has said something and did something and many things that is beyond

281
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,460
 typical human

282
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,660
 Can do or can say I?

283
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:32,300
 Still think the way CS Lewis word this so well in his classic

284
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,900
 mere Christianity

285
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:41,220
 Now he was talking about who Jesus is and let me quote this kind of a long quote

286
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:44,340
 I was CS Lewis

287
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:48,420
 Once passed away many many years ago. He used to be a Oxford

288
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,540
 English

289
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,220
 literature guy

290
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:55,020
 Scholar he wrote this book mere Christianity

291
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,660
 He's talking about who Jesus is

292
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,580
 He said I'm trying here to prevent anyone saying the worldly foolish thing

293
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,380
 That people often say about him being Jesus Christ

294
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:12,140
 I'm ready to the people are saying I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher

295
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:16,180
 But I don't accept his claim to be God

296
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:20,600
 That is one thing we must not say said Lewis

297
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,860
 He said a man

298
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:26,500
 who was merely a man and

299
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:32,740
 Said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. Think about it

300
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:35,620
 He said right if

301
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
 Jesus said what he said

302
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,260
 He would not be a great moral teacher. No way

303
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,860
 He is

304
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,060
 either a

305
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,820
 Lunatic or

306
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:52,420
 He would be the devil help

307
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:59,660
 Think about it. Whatever Jesus said in the full gospel or in the New Testament recorded

308
00:21:59,660 --> 00:22:03,860
 He

309
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,580
 Would not be a great moral teacher no way and

310
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:11,460
 You must make your choice Lewis continues

311
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:19,660
 Either this man Jesus was and is the Son of God or else a madman or something worse

312
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:22,180
 You can shut him up

313
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:24,820
 for a fool you can spill at him and

314
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:29,060
 Kill him crucify him as a demon

315
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:37,420
 Or you can fall as feet and call him Lord and God but let us not come with a nonsense

316
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:42,420
 About him being a great moral teacher

317
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:48,100
 He has not left that choice open to us and he did not intend to

318
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,100
 Now that is the well-known

319
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:55,260
 Trilemma of says Lewis

320
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:03,900
 Trilemma means there's only three choices that is before us only three choices either Jesus is a lunatic

321
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,900
 crazy man or

322
00:23:06,900 --> 00:23:09,340
 Jesus is a liar

323
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:14,540
 someone who has deceived many many people even the sensible people or

324
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,660
 He is indeed what he came to be

325
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:23,460
 He's a lunatic or liar or the Lord of all

326
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:30,580
 He's got himself so think about it. I think this is pretty well word

327
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:34,620
 What the Bible is all about what gospel is all about? I?

328
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:40,140
 Often hear people say, you know when I invite them to come to church, right?

329
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:46,540
 They often respond. Oh, I'm not good enough to go to church, right? I'm not as holy as you are

330
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:52,540
 Right, you guys are holy you can come to the church. All right, but you know, I kind of you know

331
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,300
 I'm not gonna come right because this is too sacred

332
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:59,260
 No

333
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:01,260
 No

334
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,500
 No

335
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:07,860
 And they always respond oh, let me do better so I can come to church

336
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,420
 We think

337
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,580
 That's not what the Bible says

338
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:20,340
 And that is the very reason that we are not holy. We sinners that we come to church

339
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:26,100
 We come to the cross and Jesus died for us. I

340
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:32,220
 Think one of the best passages that talks about the person and work of Jesus Christ is

341
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,340
 Philippians 2

342
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,700
 Let me read that and expand on that

343
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:43,420
 Your attitude should be the same as the attitude of Christ Jesus

344
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:47,100
 Who

345
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:54,300
 Being in fairy nature of God did not consider equality with God something to be grabs

346
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,540
 But made himself nothing

347
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:00,540
 But this that this is trickier

348
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:03,340
 the I

349
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,020
 Think in English as well in Greek

350
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:12,100
 There was some something called reflexive pronoun, you know reflexive

351
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:14,780
 meaning of a word

352
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,740
 Reflexive meaning meaning there's an action that you do not to others

353
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,740
 But you do it to yourself

354
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:27,020
 That is called reflexiveness, right?

355
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:30,820
 Self-reflexiveness

356
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,820
 He made himself nothing

357
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:39,020
 He made himself nothing he chose to do that to himself

358
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,740
 No one forced him

359
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:48,180
 But he did it all because of his willingness

360
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:53,140
 To make himself nothing even though he was very nature of God

361
00:25:53,140 --> 00:26:01,180
 He made himself nothing taking the very nature of a servant being made in human likeness

362
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:06,180
 Being found in the appearance of men

363
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:13,500
 He humbled himself and became obedient to death even death on the cross

364
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:16,140
 therefore

365
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:23,140
 God exalted him to the highest place and gave him the name that is above every name

366
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:30,100
 that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow in heaven on earth and under the earth and

367
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:37,900
 Every tongue confessed that Jesus is the Lord Jesus Christ is the Lord to the glory of God the Father

368
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:41,220
 That is the good news

369
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,380
 That is what the church is preaching

370
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,460
 That is what the Bible is all about

371
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:51,460
 Jesus did it

372
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,500
 To us

373
00:26:54,500 --> 00:27:03,320
 Accomplish the salvation for all of us and die for our sins and he did he did it willingly as a slave

374
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:06,340
 Without his own self-will

375
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:11,700
 But only will of the Father to save you and me who are powerless in our sin

376
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:17,300
 So that we can be called children of God now, how how would this good news?

377
00:27:17,300 --> 00:27:22,340
 affect or change our way and our attitude I

378
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:29,020
 Think it will change and it should change all of us radically

379
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:34,580
 Think about all the relationships that we have with our friends

380
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:39,620
 Without other church members brother and sister in Christ

381
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:46,980
 In fact what this passage is all about is about church life verse 5 your attitude

382
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,940
 Your attitude as a church to one another

383
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:57,060
 Your attitude should be the same as the attitude of Christ Jesus. He did it to himself

384
00:27:57,060 --> 00:28:05,580
 He laid down his own right to die on the cross as a slave. We ought to use this kind of attitude

385
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:08,620
 Toward one another to care for one another

386
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:15,980
 That will affect or that would change our relationship with one another

387
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:21,340
 To love and to build up each other and forgive one another right?

388
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:27,660
 Now to extend this application it will affect

389
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:32,060
 Our marriages as well

390
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:36,540
 Right two sinners living together broken

391
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,340
 Not easy

392
00:28:40,340 --> 00:28:42,660
 But in light of what Christ has done

393
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:47,780
 Yes, we're broken but we are totally forgiven right

394
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:56,660
 Because of the grace of God that should change how we relate to one another right how spouses relate to one another

395
00:28:56,660 --> 00:29:01,500
 How spouses should forgive one another to the love one another totally

396
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,580
 And how it should change our way to live

397
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,460
 We are the instrument of God the great price of salvation

398
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:16,980
 Jesus has paid for is to redeem us so that we do not belong to anyone

399
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,940
 But God himself alone

400
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:22,900
 We are his instrument

401
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,820
 We are to be used by God himself

402
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,340
 We are the instrument of the gospel

403
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:35,380
 You go back to your campus you go back to your family you go back to your workplace

404
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:41,780
 You take a totally different role because God is using us

405
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:47,780
 Using us as instrument to invite other people to experience the grace of God

406
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:57,300
 Let me end with the Apostles Creek and if you have the same conviction I invite you to recite

407
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:00,780
 The Apostles Creek with me

408
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:04,460
 The Apostles Creek

409
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:07,980
 Let's do it together. I believe in God the Father Almighty

410
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:11,100
 creator of heaven and earth I

411
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,380
 Believe in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord

412
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:18,940
 He was conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary

413
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:27,260
 He suffered under Pontius Pilate was crucified died and was buried. He descended to the dead on the third day

414
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,780
 He rose again. He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father

415
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:34,580
 He will come again to judge the living and the dead

416
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:41,340
 I believe in the Holy Spirit the Holy Universal Church the chameleon of saints the forgiveness of sins

417
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,820
 the resurrection of the body and life everlasting

418
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,540
 Amen, let's all pray together

419
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:55,700

00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,860
 He is indeed the Lord of all

422
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,260
 He is indeed our King

423
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:07,340
 And we pray that you renew

424
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,420
 our sense of your grace

425
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:19,700
 So great of a salvation that while we were sinners while we were powerless while we were your enemies

426
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:22,620
 You came to save us

427
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:30,140
 Forgive all of our sins and our guilt and to heal us and to bring us back to you

428
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,980
 So that you

429

 we can stand before you as

431
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:40,100
 justified

432
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:43,340
 Righteous all because of what your Son has done for us

433
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:50,740
 And we will give you thanks and praise you because you deserve all praises

434
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:53,540
 And

435
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:55,900
 Lord indeed

436
00:31:55,900 --> 00:31:57,900
 We are redeemed

437
