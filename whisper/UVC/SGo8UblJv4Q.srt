1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
 I am going to teach you how to use Premiere Pro.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,000
 If you already know the basics, please skip to Part 2.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
 This is Part 1 for those who have not used it yet.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
 First, you open the program and click New Project.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
 I usually don't change all the settings.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:26,000
 What you need to change is to make sure your location.

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
 Make sure you open a new folder.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Make sure you set up everything.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,000
 Give it a title.

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:42,000
 This time I am using Premiere Pro Video Editing Part 1.

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
 After opening it, you will see what it is.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
 You don't have to worry about a lot of things.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
 You can adjust everything.

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,000
 Basically, these four boxes can be moved freely.

15
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
 You can move a lot of things.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
 For example, if you press the tool box, you can drag it to another place.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
 Yes, you can drag it up.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
 But everyone has their own preference.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
 So don't move things around.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
 For example, go to Tools.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
 You can drag it down and put it in your preferred position.

22
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:27,000
 The most important thing is to import your files, audio, video, and pictures.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
 So you will see the "Import Media to Start" at the bottom left of my screen.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
 You can right-click here and you will see "Import".

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
 But if you don't have this, you may not see it when you first do it.

26
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
 Go to the file above and find "Import".

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,000
 It will be the same.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,000
 First, you can choose a video or a picture.

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:57,000
 But sometimes, if there are some files that are not clear in the name, you may not remember what it is.

30
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
 There is a way to see it.

31
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
 Just highlight the name and double-click the icon.

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
 You will see it pop up in a corner.

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
 That window is your preview window.

34
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
 My setting is in the upper left corner.

35
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,000
 You can see the video by clicking the "Play" button.

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
 It's a preview, right?

37
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,000
 If you are a picture, you can see it.

38
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
 But you can't play it.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
 You can see the timeline is moving, but it won't move the other days.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
 It's a picture.

41
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
 As for the audio, you can play it.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 There is no topic, but there is sound.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 That's it.

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
 How to start making videos?

45
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,000
 You can see the timeline in the bottom.

46
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
 It's like your workspace.

47
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
 For example, I want to put a video in the timeline.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
 There are two ways.

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
 First, you can drag it directly.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
 You hold and drag it.

51
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
 Or you can click the "Left" button on the cursor on the screen.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
 You can drag it to the timeline.

53
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
 That's it.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
 You can start your timeline.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:22,000
 You can see the video is about 10 to 15 seconds.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,000
 The video can be extended or shortened by clicking the "Short" button.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
 You can see the video is getting shorter and shorter.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
 You are looking at the video getting longer and longer.

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 You can see the video is 1 minute and 30 seconds.

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:36,000
 This is the function of zoom in and zoom out.

61
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:43,000
 The above function is called V123.

62
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
 You can play more than one video.

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,000
 You can adjust the height.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,000
 You can also add audio.

65
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,000
 If you have a lot of audio or videos,

66
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,000
 you can right-click on the space next to the eye and click "Add Track".

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:10,000
 If you want to add more tracks, you can click "Delete Track".

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
 It will ask you if you want to delete the track.

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,000
 You can highlight and uncheck the tracks.

70
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
 I will tell you the difference later.

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,000
 You can mute the audio tracks.

72
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:30,000
 For example, I want to add a picture.

73
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
 You can click "Add" and click "Picture".

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,000
 When you play the video, the picture will be changed.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,000
 I will add one or two more videos to show you the difference.

76
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:53,000
 I will keep clicking "Video", "Picture", "Video", "Picture".

77
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:58,000
 I will add Tony's audio.

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,000
 You can see that I can't add audio because there is a "Video" button.

79
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
 I will add the audio.

80
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,000
 If you make a video, you will see that Tony's audio is very long.

81
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,000
 I will add a lot of audio to fill up the space.

82
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,000
 I will make the audio short this time.

83
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,000
 You can see that the audio is not long.

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
 We need to adjust the time.

85
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,000
 I have a music player, so I will play the music.

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
 This is the final product.

87
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,000
 I only have a few pictures.

88
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
 I want to make the audio longer.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
 What can I do?

90
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
 First, the picture is long and short.

91
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:55,000
 When you highlight the picture, the cursor will be on both ends.

92
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
 When the cursor is on the end of the picture, the red bracket will be changed.

93
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
 This is to shorten the picture.

94
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:15,000
 The picture will not move, so it will stay in the same position.

95
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,000
 You can drag the picture as long as you want, but it will not move.

96
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:25,000
 If I want to undo, I will press "Ctrl + Z".

97
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:31,000
 I will play the music.

98
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:39,000
 I want to make the audio longer, so I will play the music.

99
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,000
 The video can be long or short.

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
 I will adjust the duration.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
 Now the duration is 100%.

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,000
 I will adjust the duration to 50%.

103
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
 Why is the duration not changed?

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
 Actually, the duration is not changed.

105
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
 I can play the music longer.

106
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
 The video was long, but now it is longer.

107
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:05,000
 When I play the music, the video will be slower.

108
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
 Can you see it?

109
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
 The video is much slower.

110
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
 I will shorten the video.

111
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
 The video is longer, but the video is shorter.

112
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
 If the video is shorter, the duration is 150%.

113
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
 Now the video is only 16 seconds.

114
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
 The video is shorter.

115
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
 The video will be faster when I play the music.

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:29,000
 This is how you play with video.

117
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
 What else can be changed?

118
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:37,000
 For example, I need this picture to be 10 seconds long.

119
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
 But I am bored.

120
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
 There is a trick.

121
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:45,000
 Go to the "At the beginning" of the timeline.

122
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
 Go to the "Back 1 frame" of the timeline.

123
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
 This is a very useful trick.

124
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:57,000
 This is still a video of a girl.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
 This is the picture.

126
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
 How can I adjust the duration of this picture?

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
 How can I make this picture not boring?

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
 There is a way.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
 Zoom in and zoom out.

130
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
 First, highlight the picture.

131
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,000
 Then, click on the "Preview" box.

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
 Then, click on "Effect Controls".

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:25,000
 Then, click on "Highlight Picture".

134
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
 This is a little complicated.

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,000
 The program reads each frame.

136
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:43,000
 At the beginning of the frame, the frame rate is 100%.

137
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:47,000
 The position is 960x540.

138
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,000
 There is a stopwatch.

139
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
 First, click on the stopwatch.

140
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,000
 Then, you will see two points.

141
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
 What is strange?

142
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,000
 I will zoom in a little.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
 You will see three small points.

144
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:23,000
 At this time, the program will know the frame rate is 100%.

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,000
 I want to make it 200% now.

146
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
 You can see the frame rate is bigger.

147
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
 I want to zoom in the picture.

148
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:43,000
 But I want to zoom out after 5 seconds.

149
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:47,000
 So, you have to click on the "Add Keyframe" button.

150
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
 You have to add a command here.

151
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
 Click on this frame.

152
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
 You can see two points.

153
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
 The computer knows what to do at this moment.

154
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,000
 You can choose the frame rate you want to change.

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
 Click on the stopwatch.

156
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
 At this time, the frame rate is 200%.

157
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:11,000
 But I want to change it to 100% at this time.

158
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
 What should I do?

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
 I will zoom out now.

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:19,000
 But you don't have to do every frame in between.

161
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:23,000
 You just need to tell the program that you want to change the frame rate to 100% at this time.

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:29,000
 Then the program will play out the zoom function smoothly.

163
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
 I will play it for you.

164
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:39,000
 Don't just look at the bottom.

165
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
 You have to look at the top.

166
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
 I will show you again.

167
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
 It is zooming out.

168
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
 Now your video is not so boring.

169
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
 Because you have something moving.

170
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
 Although you are playing the picture.

171
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
 Zoom in and zoom out.

172
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,000
 Just move the scale is one of the ways.

173
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:05,000
 But do you remember that I asked you to put the stopwatch in the position?

174
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,000
 In addition to the scale, you can also play with the position.

175
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
 Okay, let's go back here.

176
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
 This is the final product.

177
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
 I want them to be like this.

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:21,000
 But at the beginning, I want the woman to be a little higher.

179
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
 What should I do?

180
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:27,000
 960 is like a vertical axis.

181
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
 Horizontal and vertical.

182
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:37,000
 When you put the cursor on the 960, you will see two arrows.

183
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:43,000
 You can hold it and move it left and right.

184
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:47,000
 You will see that the picture is actually moving.

185
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:53,000
 For example, I want to focus on a black man.

186
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
 Or maybe these two black people.

187
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:59,000
 At this time, focus on these two black people.

188
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:03,000
 But when I go outside, I want it to go back to the middle.

189
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,000
 I just need to move one time frame.

190
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
 Now when you play, there are different effects.

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:19,000
 You can play with this setting in many places.

192
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,000
 But remember the original position.

193
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:31,000
 When we put the picture in the middle, the settings of Premiere Pro are usually 986 and 540.

194
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,000
 540 is the top and bottom.

195
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:37,000
 If you don't remember, press 540.

196
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,000
 The number in the middle is 960 and 540.

197
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:49,000
 You can see that the screen is a little slow.

198
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,000
 I set it to full resolution.

199
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,000
 If you see the screen is moving, I usually set it to 1/4.

200
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,000
 Then the screen will be smoother.

201
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,000
 If you notice, I added a little more.

202
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
 Because I adjusted the settings.

203
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:15,000
 If you don't want to do anything, you can add more.

204
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,000
 You can highlight it individually.

205
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
 After highlighting, press delete to delete.

206
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
 Of course, you can press Ctrl + Z to undo.

207
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:33,000
 You can play with the picture to make it more vivid.

208
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,000
 Zoom in and zoom out.

209
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,000
 Zoom in and zoom out from the left and right.

210
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,000
 You can also adjust the time.

211
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
 You can also zoom in and zoom out.

212
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,000
 You can also do this function.

213
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
 For example, you can zoom in on this woman at the beginning.

214
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,000
 Then slowly zoom out.

215
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
 You can also see the background on the side.

216
00:13:53,000 --> 00:14:03,000
 You can see that the transition between each video is quite boring.

217
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:07,000
 Because when you play, it suddenly changes to another one.

218
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,000
 How to make a more interesting transition in the middle?

219
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
 This is called dissolve.

220
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
 It is not called transition in this program.

221
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
 How can I do this?

222
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
 You can go back to the import box.

223
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
 You can see the top of each box.

224
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
 If there is a double arrow, you can press it.

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
 Then look at the effects.

226
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
 It's not effects control.

227
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
 It's effects control.

228
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,000
 Then it tells you that there are many presets, audio transitions.

229
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
 You can slowly cut it.

230
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
 But if you know your function, you can type it directly.

231
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:43,000
 These transitions are called dissolve.

232
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
 You haven't finished playing, but it's usually out.

233
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
 It's out.

234
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
 There are many different dissolves.

235
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
 It's actually a transition.

236
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
 For example, cross dissolve.

237
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
 Highlight it and drag it down.

238
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,000
 Just put it at the end of the box.

239
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:05,000
 I want to show you something.

240
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
 I just went to the effects.

241
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,000
 Where did I go?

242
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,000
 You just have to press the project button.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
 You will be back.

244
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,000
 I found something.

245
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:19,000
 If you have two pictures.

246
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:23,000
 I have two pictures on the side.

247
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:27,000
 Put a transition in the middle of the two pictures.

248
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
 Go back to the effects.

249
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
 When you put cross dissolve here,

250
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,000
 You can see that I can put the dissolve in the middle of the two pictures.

251
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
 You can see that the two pictures are highlighted.

252
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,000
 You can put it on the left.

253
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
 On the right.

254
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
 But it's also in the middle.

255
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:53,000
 This is the dissolve function.

256
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
 Put it in the middle of the two pictures.

257
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,000
 When it transitions, it's called cross dissolve.

258
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
 You can see it slowly.

259
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
 Cross because both will appear at the same time.

260
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
 Then dissolve to another.

261
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
 A very smooth transition.

262
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,000
 If you like this style.

263
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
 If you don't like it, you can change to another.

264
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,000
 For example, if I don't want it, I can highlight it and press delete.

265
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
 I can dip it to black.

266
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:25,000
 You can see that the glow will be black and come out.

267
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
 Or dip to white.

268
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,000
 There are many different dissolve methods.

269
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:39,000
 There is a method called film dissolve.

270
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:47,000
 I think it's the same as cross dissolve.

271
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
 What I want to say is that no matter what you are,

272
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:55,000
 This dissolve transition can be very long and short.

273
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
 First highlight it.

274
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
 Then you will see that when the control box is opened,

275
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
 You will see that something pops out.

276
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:05,000
 I usually don't need to use the top one.

277
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
 I just need to do it here.

278
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,000
 Because after highlighting, you can see that the cursor is in the film dissolve box.

279
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
 There will be a red bracket.

280
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,000
 Press it to lengthen it.

281
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
 Just do it like this.

282
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:23,000
 You can go to the preview box.

283
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
 When you mouse over, you will see many different buttons.

284
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
 First, you can press the lengthen button.

285
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
 You can see that it is only lengthened one side.

286
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,000
 It is different from the previous one.

287
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,000
 Both sides are lengthened evenly.

288
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
 If you see this symbol,

289
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:41,000
 You can move the box forward and backward.

290
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
 There are different effects.

291
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
 Because when you move it forward,

292
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,000
 The left hand picture will disappear very quickly.

293
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
 The right hand picture will come out very quickly.

294
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
 There are different effects.

295
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
 I usually don't press the transition.

296
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,000
 I usually put the mouse in the middle and press the left hand button.

297
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
 It will be fine.

298
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
 If you have the same nature,

299
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
 It is easy to do the same thing.

300
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
 But if you want to do the same thing,

301
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,000
 Between a video,

302
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,000
 This is a video.

303
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:13,000
 This is a picture.

304
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:17,000
 I found that sometimes the cursor can't drop exactly in the middle.

305
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:21,000
 You see, I can't drop the cursor in the middle.

306
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
 What should I do?

307
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
 I can highlight the cursor.

308
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,000
 Remember that we have this function.

309
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
 Go to the effects control.

310
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
 There is this function.

311
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
 I can do it here.

312
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
 I put the cursor in the middle.

313
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
 I want the dissolve transition to be longer.

314
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
 I can drag it back.

315
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,000
 Sometimes you will find that the cursor can't be placed in the middle.

316
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,000
 You can try to move it to the effects control.

317
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
 You can play around with it.

318
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,000
 This is one of the transition methods.

319
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
 How to dissolve, how to transition.

320
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,000
 You can cross dissolve, dip to black, dip to white.

321
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
 These are very basic.

322
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
 You can find it here.

323
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
 It is what we need to do for now.

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
 If you think it is clean cut,

325
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
 It will be better if you jump to another place.

326
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:17,000
 You don't need to put anything between the clips.

327
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
 After talking about video, let's talk about audio.

328
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
 I have muted two audio clips.

329
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
 Let's listen to the audio.

330
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
 Let's listen to it.

331
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:33,000
 The background music is very good.

332
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
 But when Tony talks,

333
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
 I can't hear him at all.

334
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,000
 What should I do?

335
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
 I want to keep the background sound.

336
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
 The level is really good.

337
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
 What should I do?

338
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
 You can do one thing.

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
 Highlight the background.

340
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,000
 How to adjust the volume?

341
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:55,000
 If you want to lower the volume of the audio at the same time,

342
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
 There are two ways.

343
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
 First, highlight it.

344
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
 Right click, go to audio gain.

345
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,000
 You can see that it only changes the volume.

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,000
 You can increase the volume.

347
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,000
 Press positive number,

348
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
 Press 5, press 10.

349
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
 You can see that the volume is reduced.

350
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
 You can increase the volume.

351
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
 Press 5, press 10.

352
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
 You can see that the volume is reduced.

353
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
 You can increase the volume.

354
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
 If you want to decrease the volume,

355
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
 you can press negative.

356
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
 For example, I think it's better to increase the volume.

357
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
 You can decrease the volume.

358
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
 You can see that the volume is reduced.

359
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
 You can see that the volume is reduced.

360
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
 Let's listen to it again.

361
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:39,000
 It seems better.

362
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
 But Tony's voice is still very low.

363
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
 So I will increase the volume.

364
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
 I will increase the volume.

365
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
 Press 5.

366
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,000
 Let's listen to it again.

367
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,000
 It's better.

368
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,000
 Maybe...

369
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,000
 When Tony speaks,

370
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
 the background should be quieter.

371
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
 But the beginning of the background is very good.

372
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
 I don't want to increase the volume.

373
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
 I don't want to reduce the volume.

374
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
 What should I do?

375
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
 Can I just increase the volume?

376
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,000
 Yes, you can.

377
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
 But if you increase the volume,

378
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,000
 the sound will be too loud.

379
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,000
 You should reduce the volume.

380
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
 There are two ways.

381
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
 First,

382
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
 you can turn the audio

383
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
 into two audio.

384
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
 You can turn the audio into two audio.

385
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
 You can keep the same sound in the beginning.

386
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:33,000
 You can reduce the volume in the end.

387
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,000
 But the sound will not be as beautiful.

388
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,000
 Because the sound will be very awkward.

389
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
 The sound will be very awkward.

390
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
 How can you slow down the sound?

391
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,000
 How can you slow down the sound?

392
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
 First,

393
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
 put the timeline cursor

394
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
 a few frames before Tony speaks.

395
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
 put the timeline cursor a few frames before Tony speaks.

396
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
 Highlight the audio.

397
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
 Preview the box.

398
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
 If you don't turn on the effect controls,

399
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
 turn it on.

400
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
 If you don't turn on the effect controls,

401
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
 turn it on.

402
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
 If you don't turn on the effect controls,

403
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,000
 turn it on.

404
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
 This is called "Levels".

405
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,000
 Remember,

406
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
 you are asking the computer

407
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
 to do something at this time.

408
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
 So you need to set a time.

409
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
 Press the stopwatch button.

410
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
 Press the stopwatch button.

411
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
 Press the stopwatch button.

412
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,000
 You can see the diamond.

413
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,000
 You can see the diamond.

414
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,000
 It means the computer knows what to do.

415
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,000
 But what should you tell it?

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,000
 You want the sound to be

417
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
 quieter from here.

418
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
