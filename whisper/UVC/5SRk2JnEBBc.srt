1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
時間交畀Mark Sir

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,000
唔該曬啦Cindy

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
好我哋再睇呢一個嘅topic

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
我哋一路都係講緊

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
健康嘅教會

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
第一個問題想問大家

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
一個健康嘅教會當然就係

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
一班健康嘅基督徒嚟到組成

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
一個健康嘅基督徒

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
應該係點㗎

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,000
好似medical report咁樣

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
最近有冇睇醫生

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
有呀

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
我就去咗check up

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
醫生就同我講你小心啲

16
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
有啲嘢唔等你入口

17
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,000
你就唔好放入口

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
OK

19
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
佢就話你都唔曬啦

20
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
應該留意下你自己

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
跟住你又瞓得唔好

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
加加埋埋好多嘢你就玩完

23
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
佢就畀個report畀我

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
OK

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
有啲嘢係需要承認

26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
我自己都有啲嘅生活上面

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
一啲嘅

28
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
或者dietary上面

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
一啲嘅adjustment

30
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
食嘢少咗呀等等

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
食嘢少咗唔係因為窮

32
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
食嘢少咗因為有啲嘢係真係唔落得口嘅

33
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
咁就算啦

34
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
咁我就唔食咁多嗰啲我鍾意食嘅嘢

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
一個medical report

36
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
聖經畀我哋

37
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
教會基督徒

38
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
都好多時有一個medical report

39
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
去check check

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
去check check

41
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
到底你係咪健康先

42
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
check check到底你係咪healthy

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
我記得係呢個series裏面問過呢個問題

44
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
係咪信得耶穌來嘅

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
就知道

46
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
好明白

47
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
一個健康嘅教會

48
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
一個健康嘅

49
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
受靈心靈

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
就應該係點嘅

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
係咪信得耐就知嘅

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
唔係呀嘛

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
可能係初信嘅

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
你更加清楚

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
just shame on us

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
有時係信得耐嘅

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
反而唔係好知道

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
問一問

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
健康嘅基督徒係點

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
一個健康嘅教會應該係點嘅

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
ok 健康嘅教會應該係點呀

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
舉個例

63
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
一家好嘅餐館應該係點呀

64
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,000
係咪個menu乜嘢都有呀

65
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
係咪有成千樣menu

66
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
你入去揀嘅時候

67
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
唔知點揀嘅

68
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
有冇去過啲餐館呀

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
百幾個menu item

70
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
你知點揀

71
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
揀咗成15分鐘都未揀到

72
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
又唔得定㗎喎

73
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
唔得定嗰個嘅餐館

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
樣樣嘢都有齊

75
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
包羅萬有嘅

76
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
有一間好嘅餐館

77
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
另外一個例子

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
你話你家

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
你屋企

80
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
係咪樣嘢都有呀你屋企

81
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
但我問你呀

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
如果你最近你屋企想買啲咩

83
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
想到想買啲咩

84
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
爭啲咩呀你屋企

85
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
爭屋

86
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
爭啲咩電器呀

87
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
有啲需要用嘅用具呀

88
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
有冇呀

89
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
成日都有㗎係咪

90
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
買幾多買唔完

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
係咪你家屋企

92
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
乜嘢都有

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
就係一個健康嘅快樂嘅家

94
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
英文好有意思呀

95
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
英文係

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
我記得嗰陣時我哋

97
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
婚前輔導嘅時候我同我太太

98
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
嗰個counselor同我哋講

99
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You are not building a house

100
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
You are building a home

101
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
You are building a home

102
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
House同Home有咩分別

103
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
House同Home有咩分別

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
Home係講relationship

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,000
House係講咩

106
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
硬件

107
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
有啲咩爐頭呀

108
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
個廚房幾靚呀雲石做呀

109
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
地板幾靚呀

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
木嘅地板

111
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
冷氣幾好呀

112
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
但係裏面

113
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
係點嘅

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
就睇你個home係點

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
睇你個relationship係點

116
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
其實教會都係一樣

117
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
教會都係一樣

118
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
呢個topic值得我哋去諗下

119
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
乜嘢係一間

120
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
合上帝心意嘅教會

121
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
again

122
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
唔係將我哋嘅preference

123
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
放喺頭先

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
可能人哋問到你

125
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
一個好嘅教會係點樣嘅

126
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
你話樣樣嘢都有囉

127
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
有兒童士工

128
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
有培基士工有小學士工

129
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
有中學士工有大學士工

130
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
青少年士工等等所有嘢

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
全部都有晒

132
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
係咪一定係好嘅教會

133
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
again we are not building a house

134
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
we are building a home

135
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
right

136
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
again唔係我哋嘅preference

137
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
係最重要

138
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
係上帝嘅話語

139
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
呢個先係最高嘅權威

140
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
所以點解我哋一定要返返去

141
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
上帝嘅說話

142
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
上一次我哋睇咗

143
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
係哥林多前書第十二章

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
嗰度講到話每一個

145
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
喺我哋在座嘅只要我哋

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
喺基督裏面嘅如果你係未信嘅

147
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
你係仲係摸索緊嘅

148
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
除外

149
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
如果你已經信咗主嘅話

150
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
無論你信咗幾耐

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
聖靈呢按照佢嘅主權

152
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
係畀咗你

153
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
恩賜

154
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
畀你恩賜

155
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
嘅原因同埋個目的

156
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
就係為咗造就教會

157
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
係咪

158
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
哥林多前書第十二章

159
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
本來就係處理緊

160
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
spiritual gifts嘅問題

161
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
每一個人都有spiritual gifts

162
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
咁你哋點樣去到使到呢啲

163
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
spiritual gifts去造就教會

164
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
當然哥林多教會可能

165
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
係新約教會裏面

166
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
新約裏面眾多嘅教會裏面

167
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
最豐盛嘅一間教會

168
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
資源

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
資材最豐盛嘅應該

170
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
因為喺哥林多前書第一章

171
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
開始嘅時候

172
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
本來開頭嘅時候通常呢佢就會

173
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
話為教會係咩祈禱

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
佢都已經講咗句咁嘅

175
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
說話佢話因為

176
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
你哋呢

177
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
在神裏面在主裏面

178
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
凡事富足就

179
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
具有各種口才

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
各種知識

181
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
嘅

182
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
好唔好呢間教會

183
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
最sharp嘅人都係嗰度

184
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
社會裏面

185
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
教會裏面所有

186
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
有口才嘅人有知識

187
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
嘅人

188
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
都喺

189
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
教會裏面

190
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
但係呢個教會

191
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
又係最混亂

192
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
又係最混亂

193
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
因為裏面

194
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
有好多嘅人佢哋追求呢啲嘅

195
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
才幹同埋

196
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
恩慈

197
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
就覺得自己係十分熟練

198
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
覺得我比其他人

199
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
洞見更加好

200
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
我經歷呢就比較深

201
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
其中一個嘅恩慈

202
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
大家知道就係講方言嘅恩慈

203
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
我哋唔係嗰種嘅

204
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
傳統我哋唔係嗰種

205
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
即係第一節會講方言嗰種嘅

206
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
傳統我哋可能未必會直接

207
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
去即係處理到

208
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
佢裏面即係

209
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
處理講方言嘅問題

210
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
但保羅提醒咗乜嘢呢

211
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
最主要個中心

212
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
每一間教會都可以聽嘅

213
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
或者每一間教會都可以應用嘅

214
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
個原則就係乜

215
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
佢具有超凡嘅能力

216
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
OK 比人多

217
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
知才比人多

218
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
resources

219
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
你哋要知道保羅話係出自上帝

220
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
係聖靈

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
所賜畀你嘅按照佢嘅主權

222
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
按照佢嘅自由

223
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
你都可以賜畀你

224
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
以致你能夠

225
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
使用喺教會裏面

226
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
因此目的

227
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
就係為咗the common good

228
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
保羅就喺十二章嗰度講

229
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
用身體

230
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
嚟做一個比方

231
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
十二章最後

232
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
我哋繼續睇落去

233
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
二十七節

234
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
希盟士基督嘅身體係各自

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
都士之體

236
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
神喺教會裏面所設立嘅

237
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
第一係使徒

238
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
第二係prophet

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
先至

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
第三係教師

241
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
其次嘅係行義能嘅

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
再次嘅係

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
醫病嘅恩賜

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
幫助人嘅

245
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
治理人嘅

246
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
最後係說方言嘅

247
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
佢特登將

248
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
佢哋最渴求嘅嗰樣嘢

249
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
最能夠表現到嗰樣嘢

250
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
就係講方言

251
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
佢就放喺最尾嘅

252
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
唔係話嗰樣嘢冇價值

253
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
而係保羅話咩

254
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
恩賜嘅目的

255
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
係要去造就其他人

256
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
去使其他人

257
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
有common good

258
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
能夠去分享得到

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
如果係冇嘅話呢

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
嗰個恩賜可能就要諗一諗

261
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
點樣去發揮出嚟

262
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
保羅就係話你有嘅恩賜

263
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
就應當要去發展

264
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
去運用嘅

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
最重要

266
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
就係上帝要求你

267
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
係要去使用

268
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
你嘅恩賜

269
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
去祝福其他人

270
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
十二章

271
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
最尾嘅時候

272
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
睇落去就到第十三章

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,000
十二十三章

274
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
十二章第三節

275
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
佢講完哂啲恩賜嘅時候

276
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
佢話你哋要追求更大嘅恩賜

277
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
佢話哥林多教會

278
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
你有好多恩賜

279
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
好呀

280
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
你去追求嘅恩賜好

281
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
不過你爭咗一樣嘢

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
就要追求

283
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
最大嘅恩賜

284
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
The best gift

285
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
最大嘅

286
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
屬靈嘅恩賜係乜嘢呢

287
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
你哋要去追求

288
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
就係我而家將呢個

289
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
最妙嘅道去指示你

290
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
十三章就係我哋最熟悉嘅

291
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
一段經文應該

292
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
佢話我若能夠說

293
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
以前和合本就係

294
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
萬人嘅方言係咪

295
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
和修版

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
和合本嘅修訂版

297
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
就係我若能說人間嘅

298
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
方言甚至

299
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
天使嘅語言

300
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
有冇聽過天使語言

301
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
應該有

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
有冇

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
通常我都聽咗返唔到嚟

304
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
有啲人都係咁

305
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
有啲咁嘅經歷

306
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
near death experience

307
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
聽到天使好美妙嘅聲音

308
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
如果

309
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
我能夠講到

310
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
唱到呢啲咁嘅說話

311
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
呢啲咁嘅壞話

312
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
卻沒有愛

313
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
我就成為明嘅羅

314
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
響嘅拔一半

315
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
如果我能夠有先知講道嘅能力

316
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
可以明白

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
所有嘅傲備

318
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
各樣嘅知識有齊備嘅信心

319
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
使我能夠

320
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
而生添呢個信心

321
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
實在係

322
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
卻沒有愛算不得什麼

323
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
如果將所有嘅財產

324
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
嚟到去救濟窮人嘅

325
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
又犧牲自己嘅身體

326
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
讓人哋去誇讚嘅

327
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
呢個翻譯比較好啲

328
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
犧牲自己

329
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
使別人能夠誇獎我

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
卻沒有愛

331
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
與我無益

332
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,000
卻沒有愛三次出現

333
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
講咗幾個嘅

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
example

335
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
應該呢啲道理都好清楚

336
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
唔需要點解釋

337
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
一個教會

338
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
有幾多嘢都好

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
或者你要求幾多嘢都好

340
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
卻沒有愛

341
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
算不得什麼

342
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
is nothing

343
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
again係上帝嘅眼中

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
唔係我哋眼中

345
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
我哋可能覺得樣樣嘢

346
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
包羅萬有真係好

347
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
樣樣嘢都

348
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
tap tap掂

349
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
樣樣嘢都有齊哂

350
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
太好了

351
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
但係聖經講咩

352
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
卻沒有愛

353
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
算不得什麼

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
上帝往往

355
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
睇嘅嘢就同我哋係唔同

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,000
教會

357
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
喺過去幾年我相信我哋都

358
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
都好勞累

359
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
我哋作為同工

360
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
包括好多

361
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
好忠心去

362
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
侍奉嘅弟兄姊妹

363
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
我哋都會攰嘅

364
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
我都會攰

365
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
因為捱咗幾年

366
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:42,000
我好想喺度欣賞一啲

367
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
喺我哋台前幕後

368
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
有好多嘅同工

369
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
唔能夠一日個個都講

370
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
但我真係好appreciate

371
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
因為佢哋一路都冇quit過

372
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
喺我哋可以

373
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
安坐喺沙發

374
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
或者瞓喺床上面

375
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
我哋去睇下youtube

376
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
或者甚至唔睇

377
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,000
因為佢哋

378
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
佢哋一路冇quit過

379
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
重啟之後

380
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
我哋都係

381
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
不眠不休

382
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
我哋都係搏命咁做

383
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
我哋仲有好多弟兄姊妹

384
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
係做外展添

385
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
每次

386
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,000
去到做一啲外展工作

387
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
派下食物

388
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
去接觸下一啲街坊

389
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
一啲朋友

390
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
真係好唔話得

391
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
重啟之後

392
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
你一冇人嚟

393
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
佢都照開

394
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,000
啱呀

395
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,000
你可以選擇今日

396
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I don't feel like going

397
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
或者我細路都唔理

398
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
佢喺咩度

399
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
佢一樣喺度

400
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
我哋嗰幾個嘅義工

401
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
我真係好appreciate佢哋

402
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
冇休息嘅

403
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
冇休息嘅

404
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
冇休息嘅

405
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
冇休息嘅

406
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
喂

407
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
琴晚佢哋仲喺度避課

408
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,000
講講我老婆

409
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
我真係好唔話得

410
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
我覺得佢

411
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
好忠心咁侍奉

412
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
落晒力嘅

413
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
冇休息過嘅

414
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
你話成日叫我休息

415
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
不如你叫佢休息

416
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
喺我

417
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
咁多年同佢一齊侍奉

418
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
去教會

419
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
我發現一個道理

420
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
當我太太

421
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
高興嘅時候

422
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
教會應該係健康

423
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
當佢唔高興嘅時候

424
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
我就唔健康

425
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,000
我去教會

426
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,000
可能都係

427
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
麻麻地

428
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
我可以理解

429
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,000
因為我哋嚟到教會

430
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
我哋好多時都有

431
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
顧客嘅前設

432
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
因為我哋

433
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
嚟去接受服務

434
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
我哋嚟到呢度

435
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,000
我哋去接受服務

436
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
有邊個去餐館

437
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,000
食嘢個侍應係唔理你

438
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,000
你嬲唔嬲

439
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,000
嬲係咪

440
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
你點樣去教訓佢

441
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
唔畀貼士

442
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
冇錯

443
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
平時都唔畀

444
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,000
今次更加唔畀

445
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:34,000
平時有畀

446
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
算你啦

447
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
而家生意好難做

448
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
所以我而家

449
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
去畀貼士我畀多咗

450
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,000
因為我真係畀多

451
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
佢做得好唔好都好

452
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,000
但係教會就唔同

453
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
喂

454
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
如果挑剔得多

455
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
意見多多嘅話

456
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
手指尾又唔願意去郁嘅話

457
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
我又呼籲你

458
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
唔好做一個明嘅羅

459
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
響嘅笨

460
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
因為呢個對你冇益處

461
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
因為睇到嗎

462
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
係上帝要求你

463
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,000
呢個係你係上帝面前有嘅呼召

464
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
追求更大嘅恩賜

465
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
就係愛之道

466
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
The way of love

467
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
愛嘅道理

468
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,000
所以喺度呼籲你唔好做一個明嘅羅響

469
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
不如

470
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
你教會嘅時候

471
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
你掛住口唇邊另一句說話

472
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
How can I help you

473
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
What can I do

474
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
我自然識一個好好嘅長老

475
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
佢真係每次嚟教會

476
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
佢都係咁講

477
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
What can I do for you

478
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,000
How can I help

479
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
How can I pray for you

480
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
我有咩為你祈禱等等

481
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
起碼你掛住口唇邊一句咁嘅說話

482
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:04,000
你會提醒你自己

483
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
呢個係教會

484
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,000
上帝嘅教

485
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
我係其中一個上帝教嘅家人

486
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,000
What can I do

487
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Instead

488
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Instead

489
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
我嚟到係消費嘅

490
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,000
當然你係啱嚟教會

491
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
或者你摸索緊唔知信仰係乜嘢

492
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
你想摸索探索下

493
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
除外

494
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
但我想話

495
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
如果你係喺基督裏面嘅

496
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,000
你係信咗主嘅

497
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,000
你自然你嘅心態

498
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
你嘅取態應該係完全不一樣

499
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Right?

500
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
人見到你嘅取態都應該係不一樣

501
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
人哋會Wonder

502
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
原來係咁樣嘅

503
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000
唔似去餐館

504
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,000
唔似去消費

505
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
唔係Religious Consumerism

506
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Right?

507
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
特別係我哋中間信得耐嘅

508
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
有邊個信咗十年有多

509
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:10,000
喺我見到嘅

510
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
真係唔少

511
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
十年有多

512
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:20,000
十年做到個牧師出嚟

513
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:24,000
係讀神學讀三四年

514
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
信主五六年

515
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
你就可以

516
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
訓練到你自己

517
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
成為教會領袖

518
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
你教會

519
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
追求

520
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
更大嘅讀

521
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,000
更大嘅恩賜

522
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
愛之讀

523
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
你教會

524
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
How can I help you?

525
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
How can I use my gifts?

526
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
呢個就係Home

527
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
就唔係House

528
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,000
呢度我認識一位弟兄

529
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
我真係好感謝住

530
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
唔講名

531
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
佢工作好忙

532
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
成日要加班

533
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
佢話佢出唔到力

534
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
但幾次同佢傾偈

535
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
無論係屋企同佢傾偈

536
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,000
或者約佢黎傾偈

537
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
佢都係咁問嘅

538
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,000
佢有咩可以奉獻

539
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
有咩可以

540
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
我慷慨嘅去幫到你

541
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,000
好為呢啲嘅生命去感恩

542
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
白玫瑰嗰次

543
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
邊個講到話

544
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
十一奉獻歲前歲後

545
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
邊個講

546
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
係

547
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
十一奉獻歲前

548
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
定係歲後

549
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
佢話Interesting question

550
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,000
你唔覺得呢個question其實好silly

551
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
點解會咁問

552
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
你訓練你細路仔

553
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,000
我講過呢個比方

554
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
訓練你細路仔

555
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
佢開始識行嘅時候

556
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Don't touch the hot stove

557
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
個熱嘅爐頭你唔好掂

558
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
到大過嘅時候

559
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
如果佢八歲十歲嘅時候

560
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,000
佢都係唔掂個爐頭

561
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,000
十七歲二十歲佢都係唔掂個爐頭

562
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
三十歲都唔掂個爐頭

563
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,000
你同佢講點解你唔掂個爐頭

564
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
你由細到大教我Don't touch the stove

565
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,000
你唔覺得好silly咩

566
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,000
因為佢唔明白

567
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Don't touch the stove係咩意思

568
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
Use the stove properly

569
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Use the stove properly

570
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
到你成熟嘅時候

571
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
就自然唔需要問呢啲咁硬嘅規矩

572
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
你需要有智慧

573
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
因為你成熟咗

574
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
歲前歲後

575
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
點解會問呢啲問題

576
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
I think it's a silly question

577
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:56,000
I think it's a stupid question

578
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Okok

579
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
因為你要個number

580
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
咁咪比十分之一

581
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
十分之一

582
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,000
你鍾意有個number

583
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
十分之一

584
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
歲前歲後都好

585
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,000
邊個少嘅

586
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
十分之一

587
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
得唔得

588
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
我咁樣答你

589
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
咁你又唔需要掙扎咁多呢啲問題

590
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
奉獻

591
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,000
但係如果你話

592
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
係咪真係有所謂奉獻

593
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,000
如果你要歸納舊約裏面

594
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
嗰啲奉獻嘅

595
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
所謂條例

596
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
奉獻的律法

597
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
其實係30%

598
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,000
有冇諗過

599
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,000
在第一世紀耶穌嘅時代

600
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
佢話猶太人係比30%

601
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,000
因為仲有

602
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
有first harvest

603
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
跟住有每年

604
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
三次去朝聖嘅

605
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,000
等等加埋仲有比窮人

606
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
嗰啲咁樣等等

607
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,000
30幾%

608
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
美國歲高唔高

609
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
高呀

610
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
你試下去加拿大

611
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
加拿大可能仲高

612
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Well, I think it's a silly question

613
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,000
因為最主要嘅係乜嘢

614
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
係應該係

615
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,000
你同上帝嘅關係

616
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
嗰種嘅愛

617
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,000
嚟到去奉獻出嚟

618
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
其實最主要唔係十一奉獻

619
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
最主要係慷慨

620
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Generosity

621
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Generous

622
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
Generous

623
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
係咩意思

624
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
十一奉獻

625
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,000
十一奉獻咗

626
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
跟住嗰九分之十

627
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
十分之九

628
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
90%

629
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
就隨得我用

630
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,000
樣樣都係我自己

631
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,000
腦一分一毫都係上帝所賜

632
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
個point就係

633
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
我哋要

634
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Be generous

635
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
That's the whole point

636
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,000
唔係再問嗰啲細路仔要問嘅問題

637
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
要長大

638
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
我頭先問你

639
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,000
信咗住幾耐

640
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
十年嗰啲

641
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,000
冇理由要再問呢個問題

642
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,000
It's a silly and stupid question

643
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,000
因為上帝講乜嘢

644
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,000
你喺教會建立上帝嘅家

645
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:18,000
就係一個愛之道

646
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
愛之道

647
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
The way of love

648
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,000
十三章第四節就係七節

649
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,000
愛是恆久孕來

650
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
又有恩慈

651
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
愛是不疾度不自誇不張狂

652
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
呢度唔係講緊婚姻

653
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:38,000
呢段聖經所謂偉大的愛篇

654
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,000
呢段聖經如果你未曾

655
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,000
睇過聖經嘅話

656
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,000
你要知道呢段聖經

657
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
係歷史裏面最偉大的

658
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,000
愛篇

659
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
讀到邊度去先

660
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
不作害羞的事

661
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
不求自己的益處

662
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
不輕易發怒

663
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
不計算人的惡

664
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,000
不喜歡不義

665
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,000
只喜歡真理

666
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,000
凡事包容凡事相信

667
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,000
凡事盼望凡事忍耐

668
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
唔係講緊婚姻

669
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,000
講緊教會生活

670
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
講緊弟兄姊妹

671
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
大家之間應該怎樣去相處

672
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
呢個係最大的恩慈

673
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
更妙的度

674
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
就係愛之度

675
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,000
因為有幾多恩慈有幾多資材

676
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,000
有幾多programs有幾多活動

677
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
如果沒有呢樣嘅話

678
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
算不得乜嘢

679
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
So what

680
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
你睇你間屋有幾靚

681
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
值幾多錢

682
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
好巴閉係咪

683
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
你發現關係做得唔好

684
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
搞得唔好

685
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,000
係唔和諧嘅

686
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
家就不成家

687
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Who cares

688
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
你住嘅三千呎

689
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
九千呎

690
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
八萬房洋樓

691
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,000
I really don't care

692
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Care嘅你夫婦

693
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,000
你家庭

694
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,000
你之間嘅關係

695
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
如果關係好嘅話

696
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,000
住九百呎有乜所謂

697
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,000
Right

698
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,000
Seriously

699
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
食乜嘢有乜所謂

700
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
好話你日日食

701
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
蟹食龍蝦

702
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
日日食海鮮

703
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,000
So what

704
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
係咪膽固醇咁高啲

705
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,000
要有愛

706
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,000
你先至能夠成家

707
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
上帝嘅家都係一樣

708
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
愛是恆久忍耐又有恩慈

709
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
Explanatory

710
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
By the way 呢度雖然唔係講婚姻

711
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,000
但係樣樣嘢都apply to 婚姻

712
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
Of course

713
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
恆久忍耐

714
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
嗰度冇一樣嘢係同

715
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Romance有關

716
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
全部都係motion

717
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
唔係emotion

718
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:02,000
Motions of love

719
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,000
恆久忍耐

720
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,000
有恩慈唔嫉妒

721
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,000
唔自掛唔張角

722
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,000
唔作害羞

723
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,000
唔求自己嘅抑阻

724
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
先求對方嘅抑阻

725
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,000
凡事係忍耐

726
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,000
All motions

727
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
你留意度形容愛

728
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
有啲乜嘢係

729
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,000
抗衡世界嘅文化

730
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:32,000
世界好多時

731
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
講緊嘅愛

732
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,000
同呢啲往往係相反

733
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Quick temper

734
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,000
求自己嘅抑阻

735
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,000
輕易嘅法律

736
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
計算人嘅惡

737
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,000
琴晚我哋家人

738
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
去睇一套嘅電影

739
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
因為我個女Rachel

740
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
就好想

741
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
佢成日都重睇一啲電影

742
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
即係有啲電影

743
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
睇咗好多次佢都要再睇

744
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,000
佢琴晚就話

745
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,000
不如我哋一齊睇呢套

746
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
Cars我睇

747
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
我話唔係呀

748
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
睇Cars 1

749
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
你知唔知幾時拍緊呢套嘢

750
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,000
2006年

751
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,000
嘩

752
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,000
十幾年前

753
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,000
但係Remaster咗4K嘅

754
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
睇Cars

755
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,000
我一家人就睇Cars

756
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
個故事你記唔記得係講咩

757
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
故事就係講

758
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
一個年輕嘅快車

759
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
Lightning McQueen

760
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
紅色嗰隻

761
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,000
佢就係逢跑必贏嘅

762
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,000
比賽一定係贏

763
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
佢就好想贏一個大獎

764
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
一味就想世界冠軍

765
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,000
但係不幸

766
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
佢就被迫就留落咗

767
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,000
美國嗰啲小鎮

768
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,000
可能開Highway經過

769
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,000
有啲小鎮幾百人

770
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
好細好細嘅小鎮

771
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,000
佢就好想好想走

772
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
嗰個小鎮阻佢住

773
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
阻佢實現自己夢想

774
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,000
咁所以佢就留落咗

775
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
喺嗰度但係嗰個小鎮

776
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
又好富人情味

777
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
嗰度大家

778
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
雖然人唔多

779
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
但係好富人情味

780
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,000
點知喺嗰度

781
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
就留落咗喺嗰度嘅時候

782
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
佢就遇上咗一個係退休嘅

783
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
神車手

784
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
退休嘅神車手

785
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
嗰個神車手係贏過好多個獎杯

786
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,000
就係佢想贏嗰啲獎杯

787
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,000
贏過好幾屆

788
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,000
裡面其中一個對白我覺得好有意思

789
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
就係呢個神車手

790
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,000
就去同佢講

791
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,000
When was the last time

792
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
you care about something

793
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,000
except yourself

794
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
你諗下係上一次

795
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,000
你關懷嘅

796
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
關心嘅嘢

797
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,000
係同你自己無關

798
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,000
係幾時

799
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,000
愛之道就係咁

800
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
不求自己的益處

801
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:06,000
唔單止

802
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,000
係婚姻係咁

803
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
教會生活都係一樣

804
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,000
喺關係裡面

805
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
弟兄姊妹之間嘅關係

806
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,000
一個

807
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,000
走埋一齊

808
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
有嘅團契

809
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
所謂聚會

810
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
裡面有啲乜嘢

811
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
Sexually係好次要嘅嘢

812
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:30,000
最重要係嗰班人

813
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
你走埋一齊嘅時候

814
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,000
唔係求自己益處

815
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,000
係愛對方

816
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,000
喺我哋

817
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,000
以後嘅世界

818
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,000
我哋更加需要去重整呢樣嘢

819
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,000
有一樣嘢令我覺得好詫異

820
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,000
幾年嘅疫情

821
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
可以完全侵蝕

822
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
一個基督徒的生命

823
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
疫情之前好好地

824
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
疫情一嚟到嘅時候

825
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,000
佢成個信仰生命就打垮咗

826
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:08,000
That really amaze me

827
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
點可以係咁

828
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,000
你同上帝嘅關係

829
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,000
係一個永恆嘅關係

830
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:18,000
因為一個疫情

831
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
乜嘢都可以忘記

832
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
I just don't get it

833
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
或者一個疫情

834
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,000
令到我哋

835
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
唔識控制

836
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,000
我哋嘅情緒

837
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,000
我哋需要學習

838
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,000
學習乜嘢

839
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,000
本來就係話愛之道

840
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,000
佢講咗乜嘢 愛係必要

841
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,000
有恩切冇用

842
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
有活動冇用

843
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
你沒有愛算不得什麽

844
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
愛嘅定義

845
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,000
愛嘅長久

846
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,000
愛是永不止息

847
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
先知嘅講道

848
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
都歸於無有

849
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
講方言嘅

850
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
終必停止 知識也要歸於無有

851
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
我哋唔係嗰種嘅傳統

852
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:12,000
唔係靈恩嘅傳統

853
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,000
However

854
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
你有幾多嘅活動

855
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,000
幾多嘅人 幾多嘅services

856
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,000
終歸於無有

857
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
我哋而家所知嘅

858
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
只有限

859
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
先知講道嘅

860
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
有嘅恩賜嘅

861
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
都會係有限

862
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
到那完全嘅

863
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
有限嘅就會消逝

864
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,000
我哋而家做

865
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,000
小孩子

866
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
心思像小孩子

867
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
意念像小孩子

868
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
長大成人

869
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
用大子嘅嘢去雕起

870
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
而家我哋有嘅嘢

871
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,000
就係對住鏡子

872
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,000
模糊不清

873
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
到那時 我哋就要面對面建築

874
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,000
諗清楚

875
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,000
目的

876
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000
最終係要做啲咩

877
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,000
完全嘅來到位

878
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
建築面對面嘅時候

879
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,000
到底咩嘢係常存

880
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,000
信 忘 如 愛

881
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,000
第三樣裏面

882
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,000
最大嘅係愛

883
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,000
你諗下你花幾多心思

884
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,000
幾多精力

885
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
去做啲乜嘢

886
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,000
有冇花更多精力

887
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
你去行

888
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,000
愛嘅道

889
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
呢個先係最大嘅恩賜

890
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
結束嘅時候我想講一個例子

891
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,000
就係最近喺基督教嘅世界裏面

892
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
有一個好多嘅消息

893
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
呢間嘅

894
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,000
細細嘅大學

895
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,000
叫做Asbury University

896
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,000
喺Kentucky

897
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,000
就係2月8號嘅時候

898
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
一個平日嘅早會

899
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
一個chapel

900
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
學生一齊敬拜 然後聽道等等

901
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
點知完咗之後

902
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
嗰啲學生唔想完

903
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
佢哋就自發嘅

904
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
繼續聚會

905
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
繼續去敬拜

906
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
禱告 繼續去學習

907
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,000
甚至去奉獻 去侍奉

908
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,000
等等

909
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
一路一路咁樣去聚會

910
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,000
24小時輪流嘅

911
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,000
唔停止嘅

912
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,000
已經三個禮拜

913
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,000
最後校方話

914
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
我哋係時候停

915
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
我哋係時候停

916
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
校長講嘅嘢好有意思

917
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,000
無論你點樣去

918
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
詮釋呢件事都好

919
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,000
係咪一個復興 所謂revival

920
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,000
係咪聖靈所比嘅一個

921
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
屬靈嘅奉獻都好 點樣詮釋都好

922
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,000
校長講咩嘢

923
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,000
佢話people are hungry

924
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,000
佢哋想去到

925
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
渴求上帝

926
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
想去上帝嘅同在

927
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,000
嗰度面 去歸向上帝

928
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
去敬拜上帝

929
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
係咁樣嘅心態 咁樣嘅

930
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
情況 咁樣嘅現象

931
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
你點樣詮釋佢都好 點樣解釋都好

932
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
校長講咩呢

933
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:08,000
佢見證到乜嘢呢

934
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,000
見證到聖經裏面所形容嘅

935
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
聖靈嘅果子

936
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,000
聖靈嘅果子

937
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:18,000
聖靈嘅果子九樣

938
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,000
第一樣係乜

939
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,000
人愛

940
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,000
人愛喜樂和平忍耐

941
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,000
恩慈 良善信神

942
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
溫柔節制

943
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
佢所見證到嘅就係

944
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
呢啲大學生嘅生命

945
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
能夠展現到呢一樣嘢

946
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,000
I think he is right

947
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
唔係一咩emotional high等等

948
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,000
我哋好多時

949
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,000
嚟教會 最近聽到一個弟兄同我講

950
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,000
嘩如果我哋有個full band就好啦

951
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
好激昂 好激苦

952
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
好偉大嘅咁樣敬拜

953
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
情緒好澎湃嘅

954
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:58,000
咁樣好唔好呀

955
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
敬拜嘅時候 音樂嘅時候

956
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
音樂敬拜 好唔好呀

957
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:06,000
好 但係如果係顧客心態嘅我就唔做

958
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,000
What is that for

959
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
幾動人都好

00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
算不得什麼

961
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
就係呢啲人嘅生命

962
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
有冇去歸向上帝

963
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,000
呢個先係最重要

964
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
佢冇歸向上帝 而係你自己

965
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
個人嘅生命裏面有重整

966
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,000

970
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
甚至到整個社會

971
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,000
能夠有重整 呢個先係最重要

972
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,000
Right

973
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:42,000
有幾多呢啲咁嘅

974
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,000
放幾多炮仗都好

975
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
放幾多煙花都好

976
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
算不得什麼

977

最重要係你嘅生命

978
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,000
有冇被改變過

花時間

983
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
花精力去做呢樣嘢

984
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,000

985
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,000

986
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
你個人嘅生命

係能夠去實踐愛

988
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,000
