1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 And let's welcome Pastor Mark for the sermon.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,200
 - Hey, good to see all of you, at least most of us, right?

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,040
 I know it's a very exciting game, the World Cup.

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,280
 It comes down to penalty kicks,

5
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:22,020
 and I don't know, which team are you rooting for?

6
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:24,000
 Which team are you rooting for?

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,400
 Here.

8
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,520
 It's over?

9
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,280
 It's already over.

10
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,920
 So Argentina won, right?

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:32,400
 All right, all right, let's celebrate, let's celebrate.

12
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
 Okay, anyways.

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:38,920
 Well, good to have the update so we can pay attention,

14
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,560
 and we can concentrate of why we're here,

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,160
 because we're here to worship, right?

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,760
 So I would like to share something

17
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,640
 about the Christmas story recorded in the Bible,

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,320
 in the New Testament.

19
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,760
 When we come to Christmas,

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,680
 when we come to this Advent season,

21
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,800
 there are many questions that we may ask about Christmas.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,160
 For example, especially Christmas,

23
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:09,680
 you know, it has inherited a lot of different traditions,

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
 in our Western world, at least, right?

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,760
 So one tradition is Santa Claus, right?

26
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,680
 Santa Claus.

27
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:18,480
 Do you think Santa Claus has anything to do

28
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:20,840
 with the Bible Christmas story?

29
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,560
 What do you think?

30
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,400
 - No.

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,240
 - Yeah.

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,060
 (congregation laughing)

33
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:26,900
 You know where Santa Claus come from?

34
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,960
 - Coca-Cola.

35
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,800
 - Coca-Cola?

36
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,960
 (laughs)

37
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,800
 You know.

38
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,320
 - St. Nicholas?

39
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,720
 - St. Nicholas, yes, yes, you're right, James.

40
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,920
 Yeah, St. Nicholas.

41
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,600
 Is a bishop in today's Turkey.

42
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,840
 He was a Christian leader and known for being kind

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,280
 and helpful to those who are needy.

44
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:51,280
 Back in the days, AD 200, 300, something like that,

45
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,640
 or 200 to 300 years after Christ.

46
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,300
 So it's an early church leaders.

47
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,380
 One of them is called St. Nicholas.

48
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,300
 Because of his kind work,

49
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,520
 you know, the tradition has developed

50
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,200
 that someone who is giving gifts to those who are needy

51
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,400
 in the history, in the church history.

52
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,440
 So that's why we have Santa Claus, right?

53
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,800
 So although Santa Claus today has very little to do

54
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,400
 with the Christmas story,

55
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,920
 have very little to do with the Bible,

56
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,040
 but you need to understand the root of the tradition,

57
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,520
 the root of the legend comes from a bishop

58
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,480
 called St. Nicholas.

59
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,960
 Secondly, why December 25th?

60
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,040
 Why?

61
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,560
 Have you ever asked this question?

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,680
 Now, according to the Bible,

63
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,580
 actually Jesus was born in the summer days.

64
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,420
 You know?

65
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:49,240
 Actually in the summer days.

66
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,080
 You know why?

67
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,480
 Because Luke 2 tells us the shepherds

68
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,820
 are grazing the sheep in the field of Bethlehem.

69
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,480
 Now, according to the ancient way of working

70
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,060
 between farmers and shepherds,

71
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:07,880
 after the harvest of the barley and wheat,

72
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:11,560
 they would invite the shepherd to come with their sheep,

73
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,320
 and they will eat the stubble of the leftover

74
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,460
 from the harvest.

75
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:18,640
 So they would let them into the field.

76
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,440
 So that is right in the summer days, right?

77
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,640
 Right in the summer days.

78
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,240
 'Cause harvest happens in April and May,

79
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,760
 and then the summer season kicks in.

80
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,000
 The shepherd will come to the farming fields,

81
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,480
 to the land.

82
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,360
 They will graze in the land of the farmers.

83
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,120
 So there was a contract between the shepherd

84
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,960
 and the farmers, and they would let them in.

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,140
 So with that background,

86
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:50,300
 we kind of know Jesus was actually born in the summer days.

87
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,000
 All right?

88
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,760
 I'm wrong, okay?

89
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,120
 But why December 25th?

90
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,400
 Now, one theory, one theory,

91
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,480
 is that during the early church,

92
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,600
 when Christianity was being recognized,

93
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,180
 they found that on December 25th, or around this time,

94
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,800
 in the Roman empire, the Roman people

95
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,360
 would celebrate the sun god.

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,400
 It's a sun god festival.

97
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:19,560
 They would give gifts and lights,

98
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,980
 and something like that, like candles,

99
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,880
 to celebrate the arrival of sun god.

100
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,920
 But when Christianity is being recognized properly

101
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,200
 in the Roman empire,

102
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,600
 the Christians, the Roman Christians,

103
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,220
 they took over the festival,

104
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:43,320
 and replaced it with the celebration of Christmas,

105
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,920
 the coming of true God, son of God.

106
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,240
 So that's how it has developed,

107
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,600
 December 25th, instead of worshiping the false god,

108
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,960
 the sun god, instead of being controlled by him

109
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,920
 to worship him, the Christians were saying,

110
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:04,920
 let's celebrate the true God, son of God, Jesus Christ,

111
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,040
 who come into our world, right, to give us hope.

112
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,600
 Not the sun god, not the false god,

113
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,620
 but the true God, son of God.

114
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,920
 So with that background, you understand

115
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,080
 the first Christmas was actually counter-cultural,

116
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,080
 because the entire cultural world of the Roman empire

117
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,920
 was celebrating following the false god,

118
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,360
 you know, the sun, the moon, and the stars.

119
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,200
 But the Christians come along and saying,

120
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:31,560
 hey, let's not do that, and replace it

121
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,120
 with the true meaning, with the true God, son of God.

122
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,920
 So that's why December 25th, right?

123
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,240
 And another theory is how they figure out

124
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,240
 is 25th of December was the birth of Jesus Christ,

125
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,720
 that they count nine months from Passover.

126
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,160
 Because according to one tradition,

127
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,840
 Mary was conceived by the Holy Spirit on Passover,

128
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,320
 but there's no other better day for her to be conceived,

129
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,320
 I guess, so they thought of the conception happened

130
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,820
 in Passover, and then count nine months,

131
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:17,120
 because in the ancient days, they believe after conception,

132
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,880
 there'll be nine months in the womb,

133
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,120
 and then giving birth to a child.

134
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,440
 So they count nine months from Passover

135
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,120
 to end up on December 25th, right?

136
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,720
 But there are different Western and Eastern church,

137
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
 they have different traditions

138
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,000
 of using different calendars.

139
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,720
 So sometimes they calculate the Passover

140
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,720
 would be on a different day.

141
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:45,640
 So some of the Eastern Christians, Eastern Orthodox,

142
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,480
 they will not celebrate Christmas on December 25th.

143
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:52,080
 They instead, they celebrate in January.

144
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,720
 So if you go to a Eastern Orthodox church,

145
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,840
 you worship with the Orthodox communities,

146
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,480
 they would not celebrate on the 25th of December,

147
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:06,480
 they would do so on January 7th or 6th, something like that.

148
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,560
 So there are a lot of questions

149
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,620
 we can ask about Christmas.

150
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,520
 However, there are one question

151
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,880
 there is one question we have to ask

152
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:18,240
 is what does the Bible say about the Christmas story, right?

153
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,800
 So today I would like to turn to the Gospel of Luke,

154
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:26,560
 Luke chapter one, to take a few verses

155
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,440
 out of the first two chapters of the Gospel of Luke

156
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:33,040
 and see what the Bible writers want us to know

157
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,920
 about the Christmas story.

158
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:38,400
 Of course, there are tons of things that we can ask

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,620
 about the birth of Jesus Christ,

160
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,760
 the scenario, the circumstances,

161
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,640
 what kind of diaper did he use,

162
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,000
 there are all sorts of different things we can ask,

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,620
 but what the Bible want us to know

164
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,480
 and don't want us to miss,

165
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,320
 we have to go back to scripture, right?

166
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,360
 So there are two Gospels

167
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,560
 that talk about the Christmas story, okay?

168
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,400
 Which one?

169
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:02,680
 The Gospel of Luke is the first one, it's one of them,

170
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,680
 one of the two.

171
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:08,680
 The second one is Gospel of Matthew, right?

172
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,180
 Only the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke

173
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,780
 talk about the Christmas story.

174
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,740
 So Luke chapter one, here we go.

175
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:21,740
 When Herod was king of Judea,

176
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:24,300
 there was a Jewish priest called Zechariah.

177
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,340
 He was a member of the priestly order of Abijah

178
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,060
 and his wife, Elizabeth.

179
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:35,040
 She was also from the priestly line of Aaron.

180
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:39,980
 Now, Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous in God's eyes,

181
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:43,660
 careful to obey all of the Lord's commandments

182
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:44,900
 and regulations.

183
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:48,300
 They, however, had no children

184
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,780
 because Elizabeth was unable to conceive

185
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,460
 and they were both very old.

186
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,940
 Now, notice how the story goes.

187
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:02,300
 This is the stage setting first.

188
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,560
 Tell us what happened in the first Christmas, right?

189
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,080
 So chapter one talks about the birth of John the Baptist,

190
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,780
 the cousin of Jesus, the pioneer of Messiah, right?

191
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:15,560
 The foreigner of Messiah.

192
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,620
 So they talk about a couple, Zechariah and Elizabeth.

193
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:22,360
 Now, how does the Bible describe them?

194
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,560
 When you read the Bible,

195
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,000
 sometimes you can pick up some details

196
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,160
 and ask the question,

197
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,500
 what kind of social statements are these?

198
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:36,340
 Social statement meaning statements of descriptions

199
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:39,020
 that talks about their social status,

200
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,460
 their position in the society,

201
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,420
 their ranking in the society.

202
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,300
 What kind of people do they belong to?

203
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,300
 Zechariah and Elizabeth, old couple, no children, right?

204
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:55,580
 Now, in those days, in the biblical world,

205
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,180
 when you had no children,

206
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,160
 you cannot conceive, you don't have a child,

207
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,240
 especially you don't have a son.

208
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,900
 You are considered being under curse.

209
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,840
 You're being under curse.

210
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:15,000
 If you're able to give birth, you have God's blessing.

211
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:15,840
 But in those days,

212
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,980
 in the ancient society of honor and shame,

213
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:23,880
 not being able to conceive is considered as a curse,

214
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,920
 is considered as a shame.

215
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,740
 It's a social shame.

216
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,320
 So you don't have the social currency of boasting,

217
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,740
 hey, I have son, right?

218
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,700
 I have a daughter.

219
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,720
 I have my own family.

220
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,600
 I have a next generation.

221
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,120
 In those days, you are considered a curse

222
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,520
 if you cannot have a son or daughter.

223
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:45,520
 And also, they are hopeless.

224
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,640
 Elizabeth and Zechariah as a couple,

225
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,560
 very old, hopeless.

226
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,560
 So you have no hope of bearing another son

227
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,600
 because the day is coming, you're counting down,

228
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,840
 you're very, very old.

229
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,120
 So when Luke talks about the first Christmas,

230
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,020
 he introduces us to the first main characters,

231
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:16,200
 Elizabeth and Zechariah, under curse, hopeless, very old.

232
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,520
 Now, let's fast forward.

233
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,040
 Chapter one, the rest of the chapter one

234
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:25,200
 talking about the birth of John the Baptist.

235
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:29,860
 And then chapter two, we'll talk about the birth of Jesus,

236
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,280
 the real story of Christmas.

237
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,200
 Chapter two, verse one.

238
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,800
 At that time, the Roman emperor Augustus

239
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,800
 decreed that a census should be taken throughout the empire.

240
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,440
 This was the first census taken

241
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,680
 when Quirinius was the governor of Syria

242
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:52,440
 and all the people returned to their own ancestral towns

243
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,520
 to register for this census.

244
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:59,440
 So that's why we have the story, Mary and Joseph,

245
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,840
 they probably got a donkey.

246
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:03,000
 I guess they didn't.

247
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,200
 They didn't have enough money to rent a car or something.

248
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,720
 So they travel all the way from the north, Nazareth,

249
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,360
 where they are, and then all the way down to the south,

250
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,840
 to the central hill country, south of Jerusalem,

251
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,640
 to Bethlehem, go back to their hometown.

252
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,160
 And then the story goes, as you can imagine,

253
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,120
 they went back to their hometown

254
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,840
 in order to register for this Roman census.

255
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,320
 They couldn't find an Airbnb,

256
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,200
 so they end up in a barn or something.

257
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,260
 They end up in a fairly humble place.

258
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:36,380
 That's how the story goes.

259
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:41,160
 Now, notice when I read Luke 1, 5,

260
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:45,400
 the introduction of the Christmas story, John the Baptist,

261
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,760
 and then chapter two right here,

262
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
 talking about the birth of Jesus, the first Christmas,

263
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,720
 how many characters are being introduced?

264
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:59,480
 Or maybe I should ask, how many powerful characters

265
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,020
 are being introduced in those days?

266
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:06,460
 Chapter one, five, Herod the Great, right?

267
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,600
 Herod the Great.

268
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,320
 He was a mighty great king.

269
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,480
 He ruled the land of Palestine and Israel in those days.

270
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,960
 He has so much power.

271
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:18,880
 Actually, he had the absolute power in the region,

272
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,080
 in the eastern frontier of the empire.

273
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,600
 Here, chapter two, and other two powerful characters

274
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,240
 are being introduced.

275
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,080
 Augustus.

276
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,560
 Now, in those days, the superpower of the entire world

277
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,880
 was the Roman emperor,

278
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,320
 and Augustus was the first emperor of Roman history.

279
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,120
 And then the second character is Quirinius.

280
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,600
 Quirinius is the prophet of Syria,

281
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,340
 which include Israel and Palestine,

282
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:54,400
 the governor of Syria, and Quirinius is the commander.

283
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,800
 He's the governor of the entire province.

284
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,520
 Now, as you can tell,

285
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,920
 the three powerful characters in those days,

286
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,320
 absolute power, super powerful figures,

287
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,280
 are being introduced in the first Christmas story,

288
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,160
 according to the Gospel of Luke.

289
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,640
 Herod the Great, Quirinius, and then Augustus.

290
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,960
 Now, think about it.

291
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:23,160
 Now, if you walk into a bookstore, okay,

292
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:26,880
 I know bookstore is fading away, okay?

293
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
 Let's imagine you go to a library or go to a bookstore.

294
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,800
 You go to the biography section,

295
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,700
 biography section.

296
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,480
 What kind of biographies you will find?

297
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,200
 Or what kind of biographies will be the best sellers?

298
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,680
 Has to be a famous figure, right?

299
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:48,040
 Not too long ago, I was in the library.

300
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,040
 I bumped into a book written by Hillary Clinton.

301
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:56,360
 Biography of hers.

302
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,680
 She's famous, right?

303
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,740
 Or she's powerful.

304
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,300
 So these kind of biographies will be the best sellers.

305
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:11,240
 In Jesus' day, it was the same way.

306
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,900
 The powerful characters, the powerful people

307
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:18,560
 who have influence in their own world

308
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,280
 or in the lives of many other people,

309
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,200
 they have their own biographies.

310
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,740
 Sometimes they have inscriptions.

311
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:28,240
 Sometimes they have some public billboard

312
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,840
 to talk about their good deeds, to talk about their birth.

313
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:36,840
 For example, Augustus, he was born on a certain day,

314
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:41,440
 and that certain day becomes a special holiday

315
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,420
 for the entire empire, for all the people.

316
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,420
 And when Augustus was born,

317
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,940
 when people talk about his biographical information,

318
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,340
 Augustus was being called the son of gods,

319
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,380
 the savior of the world.

320
00:15:56,380 --> 00:16:00,820
 He bring peace, the Roman peace, the Pax Romana,

321
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:05,220
 because of the Romans, because of the Roman military might.

322
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:08,420
 You will have peace, Pax Romana, Roman peace.

323
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:12,000
 So when Augustus comes, when he was born,

324
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,180
 he brings the gospel.

325
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,180
 You know, the gospel was a political term in those days.

326
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,660
 The gospel meaning the news, the good news

327
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:26,640
 of the king being born, the kingdom being ushered in,

328
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,860
 being launched because of this figure.

329
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:34,860
 So because of Augustus, you have joy and peace

330
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,640
 and good tidings and gospels.

331
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:40,040
 And he is the son of gods.

332
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,240
 Now, these kind of powerful figures

333
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:46,840
 will have their own famous biographies,

334
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,920
 the best sellers of those days.

335
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,540
 People would read that.

336
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:54,520
 People would listen to those stories and thinking,

337
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,520
 geez, they really control our lives.

338
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:01,100
 They really are very powerful.

339
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,960
 But according to the gospel of Luke,

340
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,920
 when he writes about the story of Christmas,

341
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:12,680
 these guys, they are not occupying

342
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,460
 the foreground of a stage.

343
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:18,920
 They are not in the front of a stage.

344
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,820
 They are in the background of a stage.

345
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,640
 These guys who can do a lot of things

346
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,100
 to control the lives of the common people,

347
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,960
 they are in the background.

348
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,360
 And who is in the foreground?

349
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,480
 The minor characters.

350
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:38,400
 Zechariah, Elizabeth, John the Baptist,

351
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,940
 Joseph and Mary, and Jesus.

352
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:44,880
 They should belong to the background.

353
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
 But in the gospel of Luke,

354
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,420
 they are being brought forth to front stage.

355
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:54,680
 Now let's take a look at the first Christmas story,

356
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,180
 chapter two, verse four.

357
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:02,640
 And because Joseph was a descendant of King David,

358
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,240
 he had to go to his hometown Bethlehem in Judea,

359
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,180
 David's ancient home.

360
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:11,400
 He traveled there from the village of Nazareth

361
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,740
 in Galilee in the north.

362
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,400
 He took with him Mary to whom he was engaged,

363
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,960
 who was now expecting a child.

364
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,200
 And while Joseph and Mary were there,

365
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,240
 the time came for her baby to be born.

366
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,040
 She gave birth to her firstborn son, Jesus,

367
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:32,620
 wrapped him, and then put him in the manger.

368
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:36,740
 Because there was no lodging available for them.

369
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,600
 Now this is how the story goes, right?

370
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:44,060
 As I said, they came to their hometown Bethlehem.

371
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:47,600
 They had no place to stay.

372
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,060
 Now in this short passage,

373
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:56,480
 many times it talks about census, the Roman census.

374
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,200
 Now it happened that we know

375
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:03,500
 the Roman emperor would call for census

376
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:08,300
 for the entire emperor once every 14 years.

377
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:12,620
 So about 10 to 14 years, they would call for another census.

378
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:15,920
 And the census will dictate the people

379
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,100
 to go back to their hometown.

380
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,140
 Maybe they're working somewhere else,

381
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,060
 some other town, some other cities.

382
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:26,520
 But according to the decree of the Roman emperor,

383
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,780
 they have to return to their hometown to register,

384
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,180
 to pay taxes.

385
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:38,400
 Kind of like, you know, once a year we have to pay tax, right?

386
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,760
 In March, the tax day, the IRS.

387
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,300
 Here, Luke is talking about the Roman IRS

388
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,760
 calling you to go back to your hometown to pay for taxes.

389
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:54,980
 But a little bit different is that when they decree you

390
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:58,560
 or they dictate you to pay the Roman taxes,

391
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:04,240
 it is heavy tax, very heavy tax.

392
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:09,240
 So whenever the Roman emperor called for a worldwide census,

393
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:15,060
 there was always unrest in the society.

394
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:19,620
 People would fight back and people would revolt,

395
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,060
 something like that.

396
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:24,740
 As you can imagine what kind of time they live in.

397
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:29,740
 Joseph and Mary, they rush from Nazareth

398
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,980
 back to their hometown, Bethlehem.

399
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,780
 And you see a lot of social unrest,

400
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:37,380
 just like what we see today.

401
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,940
 It's very unsafe to travel.

402
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,500
 They end up in Bethlehem.

403
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,060
 And verse five says, "Now expecting a child," right?

404
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,660
 And you can imagine how difficult it is to travel

405
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,060
 with a pregnant woman, right?

406
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,960
 And the last verse here, it says,

407
00:20:57,040 --> 00:21:00,980
 there was no lodging available for them.

408
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:04,540
 Now, according to our modern imagination, as I told you,

409
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:07,900
 they went to Bethlehem and they couldn't find an Airbnb

410
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,900
 or a Motel 6, and then they end up in a barn or something.

411
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:14,500
 But if you understand the background of the story,

412
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,620
 most of the Palestinian houses were designed

413
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:21,120
 as a two-flat house.

414
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,540
 There were two stories.

415
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,000
 The top upper level is the guest room

416
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,560
 or the living room or the sleeping quarter,

417
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:34,680
 or the bedrooms, it's upstairs.

418
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:39,680
 And then downstairs is the manger

419
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,940
 or the kitchen or the area of productivity.

420
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:48,800
 They cook, they sew, they work on their farm stuff

421
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,760
 and crafts in the lower level,

422
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,580
 where you have sheep and donkeys and goats and all that.

423
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,320
 Now, if you can imagine, there were two stories of the house.

424
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,980
 The upper level is actually the guest room.

425
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:09,420
 Actually, that's what the gospel is telling us.

426
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:12,640
 The word being used is a special word

427
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,300
 for guest room, for the upper room.

428
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,340
 Remember Jesus had the last supper?

429
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,020
 Where did he have it with the disciples?

430
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:23,880
 The upper room.

431
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,960
 The gospel used the same word.

432
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,500
 It's the upper room that they had the last supper.

433
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,100
 They had the Passover meal, the last Passover meal.

434
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,180
 And the lower level is where the animals are.

435
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:40,780
 Now, this kind of design is very practical.

436
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,860
 You know why?

437
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:46,020
 Because when in the winter days or at night,

438
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,040
 who's keeping you warm?

439
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,620
 Now, in Chicago, it's getting really, really cold,

440
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:53,900
 getting really, really chilly here.

441
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,120
 We have heater, right?

442
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,020
 We have water heater, we have the pipe heater

443
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,500
 to keep us warm.

444
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,540
 But the Palestinian houses are designed in such a way

445
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,020
 as to keep warm of the people who stay

446
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:11,300
 or who sleep in the second floor.

447
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,060
 The first floor, who's keeping you warm?

448
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:17,260
 The donkey, the animals, right?

449
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,240
 Anyone who have pets here?

450
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,000
 Dogs and cats?

451
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,160
 Do you sleep with them?

452
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,540
 You do, right?

453
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,380
 Why?

454
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:28,220
 They want to, right?

455
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:32,120
 Why, why do they want to sleep with you?

456
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:35,040
 Because you keep them warm, right?

457
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:37,320
 And that they keep you warm, all right?

458
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:39,160
 So that's the same way.

459
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,000
 Lower level, where the donkeys are,

460
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,360
 where the horses or goats or sheep,

461
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,540
 they will keep the upper level warm, right?

462
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,580
 Hot air rises.

463
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:55,040
 So that's how the house was designed in those days.

464
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,660
 So if with that background,

465
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,580
 we can actually translate the last verse here,

466
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,300
 because there was no room in the guest room

467
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,140
 available for them.

468
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,200
 Now, as you can imagine, the Roman IRS comes in,

469
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,900
 everyone has to go back to their hometown, right?

470
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,740
 And when you go back to your hometown,

471
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:14,980
 where are you gonna stay?

472
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,960
 Usually you stay with your relatives, right?

473
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,320
 Your forefathers or your family members, right?

474
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,840
 Or your distant family members.

475
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,640
 You knock on their houses and say,

476
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,640
 "Hey, can I stay here?"

477
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,480
 Right?

478
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,120
 Something like that.

479
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:35,400
 Next week, I'm traveling to California

480
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,640
 after the Christmas service here.

481
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,920
 So four of us will travel back to Northern California,

482
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,860
 where most of my in-laws are there.

483
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,860
 You think we would have to rent an Airbnb?

484
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:56,020
 No, no, we knock on their houses.

485
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:59,460
 And we stay with them, right?

486
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,660
 That's what happened with Mary and Joseph,

487
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:04,060
 because Joseph's hometown is in Bethlehem.

488
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,900
 So they went back to their hometown.

489
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:10,800
 So many people are being squeezed into the guest room.

490
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:16,180
 And Mary and Joseph just happened to be at the doorstep.

491
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,960
 They couldn't find any place on the upper level.

492
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,820
 And by all means, Mary was pregnant, right?

493
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,660
 It's pretty tough for a pregnant woman

494
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:28,500
 to climb to the second level anyway, right?

495
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,620
 So they probably stay in the first floor, right?

496
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,940
 So there's nothing like, "Oh, they're so poor,

497
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:36,680
 "and we pity them," right?

498
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,360
 It's actually a story of inviting

499
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,120
 and welcoming the Holy Family.

500
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:47,020
 This family, whoever that is, in Bethlehem,

501
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:49,980
 are actually inviting Joseph and Mary.

502
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:53,260
 I can imagine they would go to the first floor

503
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:58,220
 and try to put things together, put things in order,

504
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:02,760
 so that Joseph and Mary can stay in a warm place, right?

505
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,380
 To wait for doing their things, their taxes in Bethlehem.

506
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,900
 With that background,

507
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:15,100
 Gospel of Luke chapter two is actually a story

508
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:19,060
 of inviting Jesus into their home, into their house.

509
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,960
 Now, we started with chapter one.

510
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,000
 Now we're in chapter two.

511
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,600
 And as you know, there are different parts

512
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,800
 of the Christmas story.

513
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,160
 The shepherd welcomed Jesus.

514
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,460
 They received the gospel.

515
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:37,120
 Zechariah, Elizabeth, they saw God is speaking.

516
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,840
 They saw God is working.

517
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,120
 The history of redemption continues.

518
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:47,160
 God show up again, speaks to them again.

519
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:51,520
 Chapter two, this family in Bethlehem

520
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,840
 welcomed Joseph and Mary,

521
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,780
 and ultimately, the birth of Jesus.

522
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,900
 It's a welcoming story.

523
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,080
 When Jesus comes,

524
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,960
 do you have room for him?

525
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,660
 Are you inviting him to come into your lives?

526
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:12,240
 Now, as I told you, chapter one and chapter two,

527
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,320
 all this superpower, all the important figures

528
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,740
 are being pushed back into the background.

529
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,440
 And what comes forth to the center of the stage,

530
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,960
 getting the spotlight, are the common people,

531
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:32,360
 the lower level, those who are ordinary,

532
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,800
 those who are being seen as unimportant people,

533
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,760
 or even shamed, being cursed.

534
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,840
 Unimportant people are taking the center stage

535
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,120
 in the Christmas story.

536
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:50,720
 Now, every year comes to the month of December,

537
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,940
 to the end of the year.

538
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:56,240
 If you notice, Time magazine

539
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,000
 always elect someone who is important, right?

540
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,280
 Someone who is important.

541
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,760
 To be the icon of the year,

542
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,500
 to be the person of the year, right?

543
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,360
 The icon of the year, this year,

544
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,000
 who is it, do you know?

545
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,940
 Michelle Yao.

546
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:16,640
 Michelle Yao, right?

547
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,800
 You know Michelle Yao?

548
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,820
 Michelle Yao.

549
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,240
 Y-E-O-H.

550
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,880
 Yo, right, yo, or Yao, right?

551
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,840
 She has been an action figure,

552
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:35,040
 Asian actress, for so many years, right?

553
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:37,500
 How is she right now?

554
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,560
 60s, 60s, yeah.

555
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,920
 She's being elected icon of the year.

556
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:48,040
 And the person of the year in 2022, who is that?

557
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:52,920
 Zelensky, Zelensky.

558
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:57,600
 Ukrainian prime minister, right?

559
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,240
 Because of him, he keep up the spirit of the Ukrainians,

560
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,960
 you know, to fight back of the Russian invasion.

561
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,440
 Now, this kind of people are being regarded important.

562
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:20,840
 Now, who among of us would be qualified

563
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,520
 to be called Time's magazine person of the year, right here?

564
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,280
 Who is it?

565
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,560
 Who would have the qualification to be like that, right?

566
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,560
 Nobody, probably, right?

567
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,100
 Nobody.

568
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,940
 None of us.

569
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:38,960
 So, according to the eyes of the world,

570
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,720
 we are not important.

571
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,840
 And sometimes we feel that way.

572
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:49,360
 Subjectively, personally, we think that people don't care.

573
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,240
 We don't think people would care about our future.

574
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,060
 What are we doing?

575
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:01,620
 But in the eyes of God, according to the gospel of Luke,

576
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,060
 you are important.

577
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:08,280
 The ordinary people have the spotlight.

578
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:12,660
 The ordinary people, the powerless people,

579
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,860
 as they receive Jesus,

580
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,860
 they would be regarded as valuable in God's sight.

581
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,580
 It's valuable in God's sight.

582
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:30,040
 Some years ago, I read something about Mother Teresa.

583
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:32,860
 You know Mother Teresa, right?

584
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,860
 And she was famous, right?

585
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,860
 You know, she was not very famous in the beginning.

586
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:42,140
 For many years, nobody knows about her existence.

587
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,340
 It's only because in 1970s, I believe it's 1970s,

588
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:51,340
 when a BBC reporter went to Calcutta to interview her,

589
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,620
 to ask what Mother Teresa is doing

590
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,140
 on the streets of Calcutta.

591
00:30:56,140 --> 00:31:00,560
 What she was doing is to wash the bodies

592
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,860
 of those who are dying on the streets,

593
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:06,060
 bring them home so that they can die in dignity.

594
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,260
 That is Mother Teresa.

595
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,040
 Day after day, she was doing something like that.

596
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,380
 So nobody knows, nobody pay attention.

597
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:19,540
 Only one day, a BBC reporter was curious

598
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:24,540
 about what she's doing, and air an interview.

599
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:27,940
 So the whole world know who Mother Teresa is.

600
00:31:27,940 --> 00:31:32,100
 But for many years, she was silent.

601
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,640
 She was quiet, doing her work.

602
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:39,980
 Mother Teresa once said, and I want to quote,

603
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:43,240
 "Not all of us can do great things,

604
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:49,100
 "but we can all do small things with great love."

605
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,220
 (audience member sighs)

606
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,220
 Not all of us can do great things,

607
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,780
 but we can do small things with great love.

608
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,540
 You see, that's the Christmas story.

609
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,300
 Not all of us can do great things, right?

610
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:07,100
 Sometimes we just thought that our works are insignificant.

611
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,900
 Nobody pay attention.

612
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:13,480
 But we can all do small and little things with great love.

613
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,340
 Couple weeks ago, I came into the church

614
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,640
 during the weekdays.

615
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:23,340
 So as usual, I check out some of the mails that come in.

616
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,780
 So I open some of the envelopes.

617
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:29,880
 Some of them are junk mails, right?

618
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:31,680
 But I receive a card.

619
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,540
 And then I notice, where is it from?

620
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:38,280
 It's from our state.

621
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,380
 It's not from Illinois, it's from other state

622
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,940
 of the country.

623
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:48,100
 So I was curious, who would write a card

624
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,280
 to us, right?

625
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,500
 So I open the envelope.

626
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,300
 There was a card in there.

627
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,300
 There was a small offering being made to our church.

628
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,180
 And I read the content of the card.

629
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:10,260
 It's addressed to the Yuvi family, to our church.

630
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:16,220
 It's written from a very old couple, very old parents.

631
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:22,220
 And they wrote to us and thanked our church

632
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:28,060
 for reaching out to one of his children.

633
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:35,420
 Because they have been praying for the children

634
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,380
 for a long time, adult children.

635
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:42,660
 Praying for them for a long, long time, for many years.

636
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:46,860
 And because of our ministry, we received this family

637
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,940
 into Christ.

638
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:55,900
 And I read that card, I read the message.

639
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:59,260
 I finally realized, this is what our church

640
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:02,260
 should be doing, right?

641
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:05,940
 This is what we are here.

642
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,580
 That's why we are here.

643
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,980
 That's the purpose of our existence.

644
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:12,580
 We're here, it's not because to please ourselves,

645
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:16,180
 but as instrument of the grace of God.

646
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:20,500
 We can receive someone who has been lost for a long time

647
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,100
 into, back to the family of God.

648
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,740
 And in fact, this is the spirit of Christmas.

649
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:29,900
 Now in this Christmas, as we end,

650
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:33,260
 I want you to ask yourself, what can you do?

651
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,860
 What small things can you do with great love?

652
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:44,660
 Perhaps visiting someone, or attending to someone

653
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:45,580
 who is lonely.

654
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,100
 Now ask about someone who has been forgotten.

655
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,500
 Who's gonna do that?

656
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:56,140
 You are going to do it.

657
00:34:56,140 --> 00:35:00,780
 Small and little things with great love, right?

658
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:06,100
 But the ultimate question is,

659
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:08,780
 do we have room for that great love?

660
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:13,940
 Jesus Christ himself came into your world.

661
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:17,820
 Open your home, open your lives,

662
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,020
 open your heart to receive it.

663
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:24,060
 Because without Jesus in our lives,

664
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,740
 we would not be able to do small things with great love

665
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,860
 in the kingdom of God.

666
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:33,180
 So think about some of the people you can reach out to

667
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:35,540
 in this season.

668
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:38,060
 Think about it, all right?

669
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,780
 Pray for them and do something.

670
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:45,540
 Doesn't have to be great things, small things,

671
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,700
 but with great love.

672
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,980
 That's the closing prayer.

673
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:52,980
 Father, we give you thanks because you see us as important.

674
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
 Father God, we give you thanks

675
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,460
 because we are valuable in your sight.

676
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:01,780
 And I pray that in this season,

677
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:06,780
 as we celebrate the birth of Jesus, our Lord, our Savior,

678
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,300
 we would remember that in your sight,

679
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:14,660
 in your vision, that we can be your instruments.

680
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,900
 Help us to do small things, to bless other people,

681
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:24,420
 to be your instrument, to bring love and joy and peace,

682
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:28,460
 the gospel, the true gospel to our world.

683
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:34,500
 Maybe someone that we know, maybe our friends,

684
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:37,340
 maybe writing a card, you know,

685
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:40,980
 send some words of encouragement to say hello,

686
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,780
 to connect, to reconnect.

687
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:47,180
 I ask that you will use us as your instrument

688
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:52,860
 to bring forth your peace and your joy in this Christmas.

689
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:55,300
 In Christ's name we pray, amen.

690
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:59,300
 Well, God bless you and Argentina one,

691
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,900
 and we can have lunch, okay?

692
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,940
 I wanna see you next Sunday, 25th.

693
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:07,500
 We're gonna have a banquet here,

694
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,700
 luncheon here with a special Christmas dinner.
