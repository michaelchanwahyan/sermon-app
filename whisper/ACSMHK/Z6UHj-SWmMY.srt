1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,000
這個時代每一個人都追求自由

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
自由的表現自己

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:20,000
但是聖經所講的自由是什麼呢?

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:26,000
我們自由的表現基督

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:35,000
因為在自我裡頭有許多的缺點

6
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:47,000
在墮落的人性裡面有許多的污點

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
如果我們盡量表現自我

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
就會把那些缺點、污點都表現出來了

9
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:03,000
這個時代的標語就是

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:15,000
自我表現表現自己完全沒有任何的限制

11
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,000
這是這個潮流的趨向

12
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,000
但是基督徒有另外一個潮流

13
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,000
這個很重要

14
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
我們有我們基督徒的潮流

15
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:43,000
我們這個潮流就是表現基督

16
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:49,000
在表現基督的時候會有一些難度

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
有一些問題

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,000
我們把這些難度、這些問題都要除去

19
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,000
那個時候我們就自由了

20
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,000
基督徒的自由有一個目的

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,000
要達成我們人生的目標

22
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
就是向基督

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:20,000
但是攔住我們達成這個目標的事

24
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:30,000
都是限制了我們屬靈的自由

25
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
有人說得好

26
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:41,000
基督徒的自由是不自由的自由

27
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
不自由是限制

28
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:57,000
我們接受限制為要真正自由來表現基督

29
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:07,000
所以我們願意不自由為要自由

30
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:18,000
我們要從聖經裡來看屬靈的自由律是什麼

31
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,000
我們要把它分析一下

32
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
我們看第一

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:33,000
我們的自由是在真理中的自由

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:43,000
我們看約翰福音八章三十二節

35
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:50,000
這是我們很熟悉的一節聖經

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:58,000
約翰福音八章三十二節

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
主耶穌說你們必曉得真理

38
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:12,000
真理必教你們得以自由

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,000
真理就好像那個火車的軌道一樣

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
這個火車開行的時候

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
如果它是在軌道上

42
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:33,000
它可以自由的前行

43
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
一切其他的都要避開

44
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:45,000
讓這個火車可以毫不攔阻的來進行

45
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
如果沒有軌道

46
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
這個火車寸步難行

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,000
屬靈的自由也是如此

48
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:02,000
我們這個自由是在真理裡面去運用的

49
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:13,000
今天很多的人對自由誤解了

50
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
他們認為自由就是隨便

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
我想怎麼做就怎麼做

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:26,000
他們認為自由就是我歡喜怎麼樣就怎麼樣

53
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
我想怎麼樣就怎麼樣

54
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
我要怎麼樣就怎麼樣

55
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:37,000
那是撒旦的自由

56
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,000
撒旦有一個招牌

57
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
招牌自由

58
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,000
本愛自由要自由的人到這裡來

59
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:53,000
我就給你們自由

60
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
好你們來了

61
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
你們現在無所欲為

62
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:03,000
想做什麼就做什麼

63
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
很多人一聽真好

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
這真是解放了解放了

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
我們都來了

66
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:18,000
結果呢他們被捆綁了

67
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
被自我捆綁了

68
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,000
他們被墮落的天性捆綁了

69
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:41,000
他們被反對真理的許多事物捆綁了

70
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
這個時候他們醒悟了

71
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:58,000
他們就發出了保羅所發出的呼聲

72
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:03,000
大家記得保羅的呼聲

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
很絕望的呼聲

74
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:17,000
那是在羅馬書七章二十四節

75
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
保羅說我真是苦啊

76
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,000
誰能救我脫離這個屈死的身體呢

77
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
保羅說告訴我

78
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
誰能救我脫離這個屈死的身體呢

79
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
他講的這句話是屈死的身體

80
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
這句話有一個歷史的背景

81
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,000
當時在羅馬帝國的時代

82
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,000
有一種很殘酷的死刑

83
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,000
如果一個人被定了這個死刑

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:08:02,000
那麼這個人就和一個死人的身體綁在一起

85
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:06,000
面對面 眼對眼 口對口

86
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
綁在一起丟不在外面

87
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
如果有人被判了這麼大的死刑

88
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
這個人就會被連在一起

89
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,000
連在一起 連在一起 從外面

90
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:22,000
白天在那裡 晚上也在那裡

91
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
一整天 一整晚

92
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:32,000
一直到這個活的人死的時候為止

93
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,000
這個活的人無法掙脫那個死人的身體

94
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:44,000
因為綁在一起

95
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,000
這個活人沒有自由

96
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,000
跟那個死人綁在一起

97
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,000
包羅爾的呼聲就是這個意思

98
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
我真是哭啊

99
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,000
我和一個死人綁在一起

100
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:09,000
這個死人是誰

101
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,000
如果是別人

102
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,000
他還可以掙脫 離開

103
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:27,000
但是這個死人就是自己天性裡面那個敗壞的因素

104
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:36,000
他說我真是哭啊 我沒有自由

105
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:42,000
在同一章 羅馬書七章十八節

106
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:47,000
包羅爾說 我願意做的善我不去做

107
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
我不願意行的惡我倒去做

108
00:09:50,000 --> 00:10:07,000
我願意去做好 但是我做不到

109
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,000
我不願意做壞 我做出來

110
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,000
For the world is present within me

111
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:18,000
But how to do or perform that which is good I find not

112
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
我真是哭啊 我沒有自由

113
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,000
我沒有自由來遵行天父的旨意

114
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:36,000
我沒有自由來跟從耶穌基督 效法他

115
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:41,000
但是下面 包羅爾的呼聲改變了

116
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:52,000
在七章二十五節 變成了一個歡呼 一個喜樂 得勝的呼聲

117
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:08,000
這些神靠著我們的主耶穌基督就能脫離了

118
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:24,000
這個呼聲在兩千年來 千千萬萬的人在回聲回應

119
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:32,000
千千萬萬的人說 在基督裡我們得勝了 我們得脫離了

120
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:49,000
一個跟從基督的人 基督的真理 把他釋放 使他自由了

121
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:57,000
如果一個人開車到了紅燈的地方

122
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,000
他說我是自由的 為什麼受紅燈的限制

123
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:13,000
好 我不受限制 我要自由 我衝紅燈

124
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
結果呢 他進了醫院

125
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:29,000
動也動不得 打了封蓋 完全沒有自由了

126
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:40,000
他的自由有規律 他的自由有規律

127
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
為什麼上帝要限制我們

128
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:56,000
我們說上帝啊 你為什麼限制我的自由 說這個不可以 那個不可以

129
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:08,000
後來明白了 這些限制都是出於天父的愛 要保護我

130
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:20,000
政府啊 為什麼要有紅燈的 沒紅燈我不是可以自由了嗎

131
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
這個紅燈是保護我

132
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:30,000
所以有人說得好

133
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:38,000
上帝 天父 在他的命令裡頭藏著他的愛

134
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:50,000
當我們順服的時候 就享受神的愛了

135
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:58,000
在我長大的地方是山東

136
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:10,000
我小的時候見到一些做母親的 做的事 我現在記得很清楚 覺得很寶貴

137
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,000
有的母親有很多孩子

138
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,000
母親還要做工

139
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,000
孩子還小 她要做工 沒辦法照顧孩子

140
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,000
怎麼辦呢

141
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
她想一個好辦法

142
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,000
她拿一條繩子

143
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,000
這個繩子的這一頭呢 綁在媽媽的腰上

144
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
這一頭呢 綁在小孩子的腰上

145
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,000
那麼這個繩子有多長呢

146
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,000
安全地帶那麼長

147
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:12,000
媽媽知道什麼地方危險

148
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
那麼她就這個繩子呢 限住那個孩子剛剛不能到那個危險的地方去

149
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:36,000
所以這個孩子就綁著這個繩子 在媽媽周圍跑來跑去 跑來跑去 很平安 很平安

150
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,000
有的時候孩子說 媽媽 為什麼用這個繩子綁著我啊

151
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,000
他還想辦法 看媽媽看不見的時候 想辦法解開這個繩子

152
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:00,000
可是媽媽一看見 喔 不可以 再給他綁好 再綁好

153
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:08,000
這個小孩子可能很反感

154
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,000
媽媽很專制 不給我自由

155
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:19,000
但是那就是愛的綑綁

156
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:27,000
聖經裡的話說 慈神愛所

157
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:34,000
在聖經裡說 慈愛的繩子 慈愛的所住

158
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,000
記了

159
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,000
真好

160
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,000
那麼這個爸爸這個孩子限住是愛他

161
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,000
這個孩子安全了 可以很平安的玩耍

162
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,000
母親也可以做工作

163
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:07,000
最好看的 一個媽媽 三條繩子

164
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:14,000
三個孩子周圍玩 玩 玩

165
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,000
媽媽一邊工作 一邊看一看 一邊看一看

166
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
微笑一下

167
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:26,000
我想到這個情況 再想到聖經說

168
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
天父的慈神愛所

169
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
我說主啊 我懂了 我懂了 我懂了

170
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
謝謝祢限制我 謝謝祢限制我

171
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:49,000
我們祖的那個繩子是真理的愛

172
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
繩子是真理的愛

173
00:17:51,000 --> 00:18:05,000
這是自由律的第一個意義

174
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
在真理中自由

175
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:15,000
在愛中自由

176
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
第二個是愛的自由

177
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,000
愛的自由

178
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:32,000
我們來看加勒太書五章十三節

179
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,000
五章十三節 保羅這樣說

180
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,000
弟兄們 你們蒙召是要得自由

181
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
這是神的旨意

182
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
祂召我們 叫我們得自由

183
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
感謝主 知識

184
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
不可將你們的自由

185
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,000
當作放縱情慾的機會

186
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
總要用愛心互相扶持

187
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
在加勒太書五章十三節

188
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,000
保羅說

189
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,000
弟兄們 你們蒙召是要得自由

190
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,000
只用不自由為了屬於靈魂的位置

191
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,000
但用愛心互相扶持

192
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:24,000
這裡再次提到神召我們

193
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
是真的要釋放我們

194
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,000
在基督律的自由

195
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
真是榮耀的寶貴的自由

196
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:39,000
但是這個自由不是放縱的自由

197
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:46,000
在這個自由裡面有一個基本的原則

198
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
總要 就是無論如何要

199
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:53,000
總要 是基本的意思

200
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:58,000
總要用愛心 愛心互相扶持

201
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:09,000
真的自由是在愛裡面

202
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:14,000
如果我愛別人

203
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,000
我在愛的原則之下

204
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
無論做什麼都是好的

205
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:24,000
我們可以說愛中完全自由

206
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:29,000
為什麼

207
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
因為愛是不加害於人的

208
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:40,000
舊約有許多條的律法

209
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
但是新約只有一條

210
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,000
那就是基督的律法

211
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
那就是基督的律法

212
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,000
你看 在這裡六章第二節

213
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,000
加了太書六章第二節

214
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:05,000
你們個人的重擔要互相擔當

215
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:09,000
如此就完全了基督的律法

216
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,000
互相擔當重擔就是愛的幫助

217
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,000
愛的分享

218
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:32,000
我們這樣做的時候就完全了基督的律法

219
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
就是愛

220
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:41,000
你看第五章十四節

221
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
看第五章十四節

222
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,000
五章十四節說

223
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:54,000
因為全律法都包在愛人如己這句話之內的

224
00:21:54,000 --> 00:22:05,000
千條萬條的律法在一個字裡面

225
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
就是愛人如己

226
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,000
這就是基督的律法

227
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:22,000
在這個律法裡面我們有完全的自由

228
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
愛釋放我們

229
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,000
愛有限著我們

230
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,000
這件事我做沒有愛心

231
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
我自我中心

232
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
我太自私了

233
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,000
我一般的愛

234
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,000
我錯了 我錯了

235
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:59,000
在愛以外沒有自由

236
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:04,000
如果你傷害人

237
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,000
最後人要傷害你

238
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,000
你沒有愛心

239
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
別人也對你沒有愛心

240
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:18,000
這個世界充滿了沒有愛心的衝突

241
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,000
世上的衝突都是因為沒有愛

242
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,000
我與你衝突我就限制你的自由

243
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:40,000
你與我衝突你就限制我的自由

244
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,000
衝突之中沒有自由

245
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:54,000
那就是互相彼此捆綁

246
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:57,000
我把你捆起來你把我捆起來

247
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,000
我們都成了受捆綁的人

248
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,000
不自由的人

249
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:09,000
因為我們沒有愛

250
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:13,000
愛釋放我們

251
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:18,000
愛完成我們

252
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,000
上帝就是愛

253
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:28,000
他的愛在耶穌基督裡顯出來

254
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
我們進到基督的愛裡面

255
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
就是一個最大的革命

256
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:40,000
人類歷史裡面最大的革命

257
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,000
就是愛的革命

258
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:50,000
我昨天早上講過

259
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,000
在韓國

260
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
在中國福音大爆炸

261
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:09,000
許多外國的人到韓國去參加

262
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:15,000
有一天我們到大會場去

263
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:22,000
我們坐在公共汽車裡頭

264
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
我們坐在公共汽車裡頭

265
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,000
外面是韓國的青年人

266
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,000
在雨中一面袍一面有一個口號呼喊

267
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:45,000
他們都呼喊得很有力

268
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
我們不曉得是什麼事

269
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
用韓國話

270
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,000
有韓國牧師向我們解釋

271
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,000
他們呼喊兩句話

272
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,000
就是Jesus revolution

273
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Jesus revolution

274
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Holy spirit power

275
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,000
Holy spirit power

276
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,000
兩句話

277
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,000
他們在跑

278
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
我們不懂

279
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
所以韓國的教師向我們解釋

280
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,000
是耶穌的革命

281
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,000
聖靈的能力

282
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,000
感謝主

283
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,000
Praise the lord

284
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,000
耶穌革命

285
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,000
這個是愛的革命

286
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,000
Jesus revolution

287
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,000
聖靈的能力

288
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,000
也是釋放的能力

289
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:26,000
充滿的能力

290
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:31,000
也是我們和基督聯合的能力

291
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,000
藉著聖靈基督的愛

292
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,000
充滿我們的心

293
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:45,000
羅馬書五章五節

294
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
因為神的愛

295
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
聖靈將神的愛

296
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
澆灌在我們心裡

297
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,000
感謝天父

298
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,000
Praise the lord

299
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,000
神的愛澆灌大量的充滿

300
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,000
在我們心裡

301
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,000
怎麼成的

302
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,000
聖靈

303
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
聖靈將神的愛

304
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,000
澆灌充滿在我們心靈裡

305
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,000
因為聖靈

306
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
是我們心靈的能力

307
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
在我們心靈裡

308
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,000
這兩樣最寶貴

309
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:27,000
我們在愛中自由了

310
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,000
這個自由是人類歷史裡面

311
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
最大的革命

312
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,000
你有這個革命嗎

313
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,000
在你的人生裡

314
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,000
你有經歷過革命嗎

315
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,000
你有嗎

316
00:27:47,000 --> 00:28:00,000
你現在的人生觀和過去還是一樣嗎

317
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,000
你的人生是革命之後的人生嗎

318
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,000
你的人生是革命之後的人生嗎

319
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,000
這是我們最重要的問題

320
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,000
你的答案是什麼

321
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,000
有沒有

322
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,000
有沒有

323
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,000
別的都是其次的

324
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:29,000
這個是最基本的問題

325
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:37,000
在同一節的聖經裡頭

326
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,000
教會出五章十三節

327
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
最後一句話

328
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:48,000
剛才我們讀過的

329
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,000
總要用愛心互相服侍

330
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,000
這裡提到愛心

331
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,000
又提到服侍

332
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
這裡提到愛

333
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,000
又提到服侍

334
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,000
我們有自由和愛

335
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
我們也有自由和服侍

336
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,000
兩者互相互相

337
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,000
你無法分開他們

338
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,000
如果我有愛心

339
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,000
我就願意服侍別人

340
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,000
愛心讓我共生

341
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:38,000
我帶著書腰給門徒洗腳

342
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:48,000
我看見一幅圖畫畫著耶穌給門徒洗腳

343
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:53,000
耶穌是什麼姿態呢

344
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
那個畫家表達的耶穌的姿態

345
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,000
是一陣笑 跪在那裡跟門徒洗腳

346
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:09,000
我看見這幅圖畫的時候

347
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
我心裡想

348
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
真是耶穌當時這樣的姿態嗎

349
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:20,000
那我想一想

350
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
就想到三個可能的姿態

351
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,000
當我思考這件事的時候

352
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
可能有三個可能

353
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,000
第一個姿態

354
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,000
主耶穌拿了一個小凳子

355
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,000
拉過來坐下洗腳

356
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,000
也許祂找到一個小凳子

357
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,000
祂就坐在那裡舒服地坐著

358
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:38,000
第二個可能

359
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,000
祂用廣東話講

360
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,000
廣東話 貓在那裡

361
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,000
蹲在那裡跟門徒洗腳

362
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,000
第三個可能

363
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,000
祂正在蹲下

364
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,000
第三個可能

365
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
第三個可能就是

366
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
一隻腳跪在那裡跟門徒洗腳

367
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:02,000
我想一想去

368
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,000
我想 啊 最後的結論

369
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,000
這個畫家

370
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,000
他 對了

371
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,000
他表達耶穌的姿態

372
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
我相信就是當時真正主的姿態

373
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,000
我認為 當我思考這件事的時候

374
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,000
畫家們的意見非常突出

375
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,000
因為這一定是耶穌

376
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,000
在洗膝的時候

377
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,000
擁有的姿態

378
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
祂自己正在蹲下

379
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
耶穌基督是榮耀的君王

380
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,000
耶穌是我們的主

381
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,000
祂竟然

382
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,000
躬身為門徒洗腳

383
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
服侍他們

384
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:49,000
為什麼

385
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,000
因為怕得礙

386
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
愛叫一個人躬身

387
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:04,000
愛叫人疏忧

388
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:15,000
愛叫我們給人洗腳

389
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:20,000
洗腳不是簡單的事

390
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,000
如果一個人叫你給他洗腳

391
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:32,000
這是你生平最大的侮辱

392
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,000
我給你洗腳

393
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Who are you

394
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
Who are you to wash your feet

395
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Probably you should wash my feet

396
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,000
所以世界上每個人都伸出自己的腳

397
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,000
That's why you see everyone sticking out their feet

398
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,000
waiting to be washed

399
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,000
你給我洗腳

400
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,000
You should wash mine

401
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
You should wash mine

402
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
世界上許多問題

403
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
是從這裡放出來的

404
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,000
每個人都伸出腳

405
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,000
要別人洗

406
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,000
沒有人肯洗

407
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,000
Can you see

408
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:06,000
That is the origin of a lot of problems that we are facing

409
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,000
Everyone wants somebody to serve them

410
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
當沒有人肯洗的時候

411
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,000
忽然我們一個發現

412
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
神的兒子

413
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,000
榮耀的主

414
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,000
耶穌基督肯給人洗腳

415
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,000
But then when no one else wants to take up such a nasty task

416
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,000
We see Jesus Christ

417
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,000
lay down

418
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
humbling himself

419
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,000
washing the feet of the disciples

420
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,000
We are surprised

421
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,000
We are surprised

422
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,000
我們積極的進行

423
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
我們受感動

424
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
We are moved

425
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:41,000
We are moved by that

426
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:45,000
我們看見一個大的奇妙的是

427
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:50,000
我們的主在愛中來服侍我們

428
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,000
But we can see such a wonderful thing

429
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:54,000
That Christ in love

430
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,000
can humble himself to serve us

431
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
我們在真理裡面自由

432
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
In truth we are set free

433
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
我們在愛裡面自由

434
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,000
In love we also have liberty

435
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
我們在服務裡面自由

436
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
In serving we also have liberty

437
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
還有

438
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,000
And also

439
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,000
我們在聖靈中自由

440
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:19,000
We also have the liberty in the spirit

441
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,000
我們看

442
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,000
格林多厚書三章十七節

443
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Let's turn to the second Corinthians

444
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,000
Chapter 3, verse 17

445
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
格林多厚書三章十七節

446
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,000
非常寶貴

447
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:37,000
It's a very precious passage to us

448
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:42,000
Second Corinthians, Chapter 3, verse 17

449
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,000
主的靈在哪裡

450
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:48,000
哪裡就得以自由

451
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Now the Lord is the spirit

452
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,000
And where the spirit of the Lord is

453
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,000
There is liberty

454
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,000
在聖靈中自由

455
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
The liberty in the spirit

456
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,000
聖靈在我們的心裡運行

457
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
The spirit works within our hearts

458
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,000
是內在的生命

459
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,000
It is the life that we have in us

460
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
所以聖經說

461
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
聖靈是生命的靈

462
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
That's why the scripture tells us

463
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,000
that the spirit is life

464
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
我們有了一個自由的生命

465
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
這個自由的內在的生命

466
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,000
就表現在外面

467
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,000
And because we have this freedom

468
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,000
and we have this life

469
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,000
Then this life can be expressed

470
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:33,000
如果我沒有聖靈給我的內在的自由

471
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
我外面無法自由

472
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
Unless we have the freedom

473
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,000
or the liberty of the spirit inside ourselves

474
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
We cannot really have the expression of liberty

475
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
在這個時代裡頭

476
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,000
因為問題太多了

477
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
有人想出個辦法

478
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
就是說限制

479
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
不可以做這個

480
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,000
不可以做這個

481
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:55,000
很多的條例

482
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,000
很多的法規

483
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Nowadays because there are so many societal problems

484
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
That's why as a result of that

485
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,000
We have all kinds of laws and regulations governing us

486
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,000
有沒有用

487
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,000
But then

488
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,000
沒有用

489
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,000
Is there any real effect?

490
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,000
法律沒有用

491
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,000
Laws doesn't really have any effect

492
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
條規沒有用

493
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,000
It doesn't have any effect on our morality

494
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:19,000
學校的校規沒有用

495
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And the laws, the principles in the schools

496
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
學校的校規只有一個用處

497
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,000
什麼用處呢

498
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,000
好多年前

499
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Many years ago

500
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,000
我在香港的時候

501
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,000
I was in Hong Kong

502
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,000
有一次到一個中學去傳福音

503
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
And I was given an evangelical service at a high school

504
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,000
那麼一天呢

505
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,000
我就坐在學校的電梯上樓上去

506
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:50,000
So I was going up to the top floors

507
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,000
On the elevator in the school

508
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,000
那個校長跟我在一起

509
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,000
And the principal of the school was with me

510
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
他就對我說

511
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,000
And he said to me

512
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:00,000
你看這個電梯裡頭

513
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,000
有用這個刀子刻的字

514
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,000
畫的畫

515
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,000
There was a lot of graffiti on the wall of the elevator

516
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,000
怎麼來的呢

517
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Where did it come from?

518
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,000
他說

519
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
有一天

520
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,000
One day he said

521
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,000
我報告給大家說

522
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,000
我們這個新電梯很寶貴

523
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,000
你們不要在上面把它弄髒了

524
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
不要弄壞了

525
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,000
I made the mistake of announcing that since we have a new elevator

526
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,000
We should take good care of it

527
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,000
沒有報告以前沒有事

528
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,000
And before I made that announcement

529
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,000
There was no problem

530
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,000
報告第二天就出現了

531
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,000
刀子刻的畫的

532
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,000
And after I made that announcement

533
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
That's the result

534
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,000
All these etchings on the wall

535
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:45,000
The graffiti is all over

536
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,000
這就是校規的唯一的用處

537
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,000
And that is the only result of having rules in the school

538
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,000
外面的校規沒有用

539
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
So we see it's futile to have all these rules

540
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:01,000
有的教會裡面有一個看法

541
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:05,000
就是legalistic approach to this problem

542
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
沒有用

543
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,000
你不可以

544
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Don't

545
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
So that's why some churches when they look at this

546
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
假如我們用立法主義的看法

547
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
A lot of things are just useless

548
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,000
There is no use

549
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,000
When you say no no no

550
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:23,000
People are not going to listen to that

551
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,000
生命的靈在哪裡

552
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,000
哪裡有自由

553
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,000
Where there is spirit, there is life

554
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,000
我們有內在的聖靈給我們基督的生命

555
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,000
那個時候我們會限制自己

556
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,000
我們會運用自由

557
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,000
Because we have been given the spirit of Christ

558
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Given this life

559
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,000
And we have this liberty

560
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,000
That's why we know how to use it

561
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,000
The true freedom, the true liberty

562
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
And constrain ourselves

563
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,000
還有

564
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,000
最後

565
00:38:55,000 --> 00:39:01,000
我們看更多前書十章二十三節

566
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,000
Let's turn to 1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 13

567
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:09,000
更多前書第十章二十三節

568
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:14,000
1 Corinthians chapter 10 verse 23

569
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,000
保羅說

570
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
凡事都可以行,但不都有益處

571
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,000
凡事都可以行,但不都造就人

572
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,000
Paul says here

573
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:30,000
All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient

574
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
All things are lawful for me, but all things are as if not

575
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,000
然後看三十一節

576
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,000
And then let's go down to verse 31

577
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
所以你們或吃或喝

578
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,000
無論做什麼

579
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,000
無論做什麼

580
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
都要為榮耀神而行

581
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,000
It says here

582
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,000
Whether therefore you eat or drink

583
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,000
or whatever you do

584
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
do all to the glory of God

585
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,000
這裡有個原則

586
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,000
在這個原則裡自由

587
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
Can you see the principle here?

588
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:04,000
Under such principle that we can find the freedom

589
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,000
榮耀神

590
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,000
To glorify God

591
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:08,000
如果這件事

592
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,000
榮耀神我就做

593
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,000
If this is something that glorifies God

594
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,000
Then I will do it

595
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
如果這件事不榮耀神

596
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,000
我就限制自己的自由

597
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,000
不去做

598
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,000
And if this is something that doesn't glorify God

599
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Then I'm going to limit myself

600
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,000
I'm not going to do it

601
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
這個原則非常寶貴

602
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
This is the principle, the law

603
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
It's the most precious one

604
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,000
什麼叫榮耀神呢

605
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,000
What does it mean to glorify God

606
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:42,000
我們榮耀神和做就人有關係

607
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,000
Glorification of God has something to do with edification of others

608
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,000
所以這兩件事包羅一起講

609
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
That's why pull the two together

610
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,000
如果這件事能夠幫助人

611
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,000
我去做

612
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:59,000
If this is helpful and it edifies others

613
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Then I will do it

614
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,000
如果這件事榮耀神我去做

615
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:05,000
If this is something that glorifies God

616
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,000
I will do it

617
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,000
榮耀神的關係和我與神的關係連在一起

618
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
And that's why my relationship with God

619
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
And my relationship with others

620
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,000
I have to consider those as one

621
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,000
Link them together

622
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
在今年的壽難節

623
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,000
And during Good Friday this year

624
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,000
在紐約各教會聯合有一個壽難節的聚會

625
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:38,000
And many churches had a special meeting in New York

626
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,000
那個用的地方就是Rockefeller所建造的大禮拜堂

627
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Riverside Church

628
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:50,000
And we borrowed the facility of the Riverside Church

629
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,000
It was built by Rockefeller

630
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,000
它裡面有一個地方叫Interchurch Hall

631
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:00,000
Inside there is a place called Interchurch Hall

632
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,000
我們去的時候

633
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,000
我們來到門口就看見牆上有大字

634
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
When we arrived

635
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,000
We noticed there were big characters on the wall

636
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,000
Whatever you do, do it to the glory of God

637
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:16,000
一進去就看見

638
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
When we arrived there

639
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
We saw these characters

640
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
說你們做什麼都是要偽造用妙主

641
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,000
這真是一個自由的基礎

642
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,000
This is the foundation, the principle of liberty

643
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,000
我們都站在這個基礎上

644
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,000
我們都自由了

645
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,000
We all stand on this foundation

646
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,000
Firmly established on it

647
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,000
We can have true liberty

648
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:44,000
神的榮耀把我們解放

649
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,000
是我們自由了

650
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Because God's glory has set us free

651
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
我們再看第二個原則

652
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Let's look at the second principle

653
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,000
就是示意

654
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
我們在講義裡面的示意

655
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:02,000
In fact, in your note, it's number 11

656
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:05,000
主動力

657
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:12,000
The law of initiative

658
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,000
我們看

659
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,000
五章,馬太福音五章四十一節

660
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,000
Let's turn to the gospel of Matthew chapter 5

661
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:32,000
verse 41

662
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,000
有人強迫你走一的路

663
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
你就同他走二的路

664
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
And if someone compels you to go one mile with them

665
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,000
go with them two miles

666
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
這是什麼意思呢

667
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
What is the meaning of that

668
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
這個有一個歷史的背景

669
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,000
There is a historical background to this

670
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:53,000
軍人

671
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:55,000
兵士

672
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,000
他們有權拉俘

673
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,000
任何的人他們可以拉來

674
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,000
替他們背行李

675
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,000
從一站背到另外一站

676
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
The Roman soldiers can conscript anyone

677
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:13,000
and ask them to help carry their armors

678
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,000
from one station to another station

679
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
他們的一站大概一里路

680
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:22,000
And then their stations were spaced about approximately one mile apart

681
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:25,000
所以當時的人都曉得這個情況

682
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:29,000
And so all the Jews living under the Roman rule knew that

683
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:31,000
所以耶穌說

684
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,000
如果有人強迫你走一的路

685
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,000
你呢

686
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,000
走完那一里再走一里

687
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,000
再走一里

688
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,000
That's why Jesus Christ instructed the followers

689
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:44,000
that if someone compels you to go that one mile

690
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
那是什麼意思呢

691
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
Not only that one mile you should go

692
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,000
but go with them too

693
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,000
What is the meaning of that

694
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,000
那不是一個傻瓜嗎

695
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,000
Does it mean that we should be fools

696
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
他要我走一里我們現在走二里

697
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
Because we have been asked only to go one mile

698
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,000
Why should we go two

699
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,000
這個傻瓜很特別

700
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,000
這個傻瓜太難得了

701
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,000
That's some kind of foolishness is that

702
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
這個世界需要這樣的傻瓜

703
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,000
And the world really needs a lot of foolishness like this

704
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
所以基督徒有時候要做傻瓜

705
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:20,000
So sometimes we Christians have to act in such a manner

706
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,000
that may appear to be foolish to the world

707
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,000
但是在其中有真正的智慧

708
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,000
But we know there is real wisdom in this

709
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,000
這是屬靈的智慧

710
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,000
And this is the wisdom of spirituality

711
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:37,000
這是天國的智慧

712
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,000
And this is spiritual wisdom

713
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
This is the wisdom of the kingdom of heaven

714
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:46,000
這個價值觀和一般的價值觀不同

715
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:49,000
Because we have a totally different value system

716
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:55,000
在這裡第二離就是主動的善

717
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,000
主動的善

718
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Here is the second mile

719
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
It's your initiative to show forth your good will, your goodness

720
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,000
有的人行善是不得已的

721
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,000
因為有壓力在他身上

722
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,000
不得不行善

723
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,000
Some of us when we do something so called good

724
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,000
We are compelled to do it

725
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,000
如果那個壓力拿去我們就不做了

726
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,000
We are under pressure to perform in such a manner

727
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:22,000
But when the pressure is taken away

728
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,000
We may not act the same way

729
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,000
所以我們的善是被動的善

730
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:30,000
So the goodness that we show forth

731
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,000
Is not an active kind of a goodness

732
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:39,000
我們的善常常是passive goodness

733
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,000
So the goodness that we show forth

734
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:43,000
Is passive mostly

735
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,000
現在主說不要停止在這個地步

736
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:51,000
要進到positive goodness

737
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:55,000
積極的善 主動的善

738
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:57,000
That's why Jesus Christ instruct us

739
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,000
To take a proactive attitude

740
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:02,000
So that we can initiate such goodness

741
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,000
第一禮不得已而做的

742
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:09,000
第二禮我自動做的 主動做的

743
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,000
To show that although we know

744
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,000
The first mile is only the requirement

745
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,000
But then we show forth our love

746
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,000
By going the second mile

747
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:21,000
耶穌基督就是一個second mile savior

748
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:25,000
是我們的第二禮路的救助

749
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
Jesus Christ He is our second mile savior

750
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:30,000
Because He went the second mile for us

751
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,000
我看見一本書

752
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:36,000
I read once 是OMF

753
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Overseas Missionary Fellowship出版的

754
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
The book was published by the Overseas Mission Fellowship

755
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:48,000
這本書叫做Second Mile People

756
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:51,000
The title of that book is Second Mile People

757
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
裡面講的都是見證

758
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
All testimonies in that book

759
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:59,000
都是那些因為愛心

760
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:01,000
基督的愛的感動激勵

761
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:06,000
他們就走出他們自己的那個原來的圈子

762
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,000
去主動愛人

763
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:12,000
All those testimonies of people

764
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,000
who have taken the initiative

765
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
to go outside of the requirement

766
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
and went the second mile

767
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:23,000
這些人都是基督徒

768
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
真正的基督徒

769
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,000
And those were Christians

770
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,000
And they were the real Christians

771
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,000
我們常常從基督徒說慣了

772
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:37,000
忘記了基督徒就是followers of Christ

773
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
We often say that we are Christians

774
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,000
But we have forgotten the fact that

775
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:46,000
基督徒是跟隨基督的

776
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
基督走第二禮路

777
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:50,000
我們跟從基督

778
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:55,000
學習願意走第二禮路

779
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,000
Because Jesus Christ is the second mile saviour

780
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:01,000
That's why we have to learn from him

781
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
And be willing to learn

782
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,000
And to take the initiative to go the second mile

783
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,000
我常常聽見中國的學者批評基督教

784
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:17,000
And often times I hear a lot of scholars from China

785
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:19,000
They criticize Christianity

786
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:25,000
中國人的倫理學有個特點

787
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:31,000
Because of the Chinese ethics system

788
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,000
We have different viewpoints

789
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
就是靠自己

790
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,000
The self reliance that is so evident in it

791
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,000
我要學法

792
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,000
我要怎麼樣

793
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:43,000
自己

794
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:45,000
The self reliance

795
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,000
I have to do this

796
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:47,000
I have to do good

797
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,000
靠自己的力量

798
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,000
It's by self

799
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:51,000
Always by ourselves

800
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,000
佛教也是要靠行善

801
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,000
自己的力量

802
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:58,000
Buddhism is to do it by yourself

803
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
中國的儒教孔子

804
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,000
要我們靠自己的力量去行善

805
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,000
And of course the Confucians

806
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,000
Their philosophy

807
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,000
It's also by ourselves that we accomplish this

808
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,000
中國的人本主義

809
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,000
Chinese humanism

810
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,000
也是靠極力

811
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
靠自己的力量去達成目標

812
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
And of course the Chinese humanism

813
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,000
The principles that they put forward

814
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,000
Is to accomplish that by yourself

815
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,000
他們說基督教沒有價值

816
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,000
And they say there is no value in Christianity

817
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:36,000
為什麼你靠信耶穌

818
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:39,000
Because you always have to put your trust in Christ

819
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:41,000
把責任都推到耶穌身上去

820
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,000
So it seems that we are trying to

821
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,000
Shed our responsibility on Jesus Christ

822
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:49,000
所以說基督教是他力的基督教

823
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:51,000
他就是他人的他

824
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:52,000
其他的他

825
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
他力就是別的力量

826
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
或以外的力量的基督教

827
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,000
And that's why they explain

828
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,000
Christianity is actually

829
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,000
The accomplishment of somebody else

830
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
By their doing

831
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:08,000
最高的宗教是靠自己的力量

832
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:13,000
第一等的宗教是靠自己以外的其他的力量

833
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,000
And that's why they think

834
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,000
The top religion is the religion that propels

835
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,000
That you rely on your own

836
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Rely on yourself

837
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,000
但是我們要問問基督教

838
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,000
到底是他力還是極力

839
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:30,000
But then we have to really ask ourselves

840
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,000
Christianity

841
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:34,000
Is it that we are basing the effort on somebody else

842
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Or is it basing on our trying

843
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,000
這個答案很重要

844
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:42,000
The answer to this question is very important

845
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,000
我們要從這個標準來看一看

846
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
基督教的價值到底怎麼樣

847
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:48,000
So from this standard

848
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:51,000
We can actually evaluate Christianity

849
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,000
這個問題的答案在哪裡

850
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:55,000
The answer to this

851
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,000
我們看菲律賓書第二章

852
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:01,000
Let's turn to the book of Philippians

853
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,000
The second chapter

854
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,000
第十三節

855
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,000
Philippians 2:13

856
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,000
菲律賓書二章十三節

857
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:17,000
因為你們立志行事

858
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,000
都是神在你們心裡運行

859
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:24,000
為了成就祂的美意

860
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:27,000
For it is God who worketh in you

861
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,000
both to will and to do of His good pleasure

862
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,000
這個話非常深奧

863
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,000
This is a profound passage

864
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,000
A very profound one

865
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,000
菲律賓書我們立志行事

866
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:44,000
Here it says that we try both to will and to do

867
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,000
這是我們的努力

868
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:50,000
It is our attempt, our will

869
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,000
這是我們的追求

870
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,000
This is something that we try to go forth with

871
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,000
這是我們的奮鬥

872
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,000
And this is our struggle

873
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,000
這是吉利

874
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,000
And this is our attempt

875
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:04,000
但是在這裡保羅說

876
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:07,000
你們立志行事

877
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,000
是神在你們心裡運行

878
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,000
But then Paul tells us that

879
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:15,000
It is God who worketh in you

880
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,000
這裡把神帶進來了

881
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:20,000
And here it introduces God into the picture

882
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:23,000
牽扯了自己的努力

883
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,000
So first it says both to will and to do by ourselves

884
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,000
然後告訴我們這個自己的努力

885
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:34,000
The name 真正的發動者是神

886
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,000
And then Paul explains to us

887
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
The will to do and our will to do and all these

888
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,000
Is actually coming from God

889
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,000
Because He worketh in us

890
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,000
他感動我們

891
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,000
Because He motivates us

892
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:50,000
他非常感動我們

893
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:52,000
He gives us the power

894
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:54,000
這是他力

895
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
That's His power

896
00:53:56,000 --> 00:54:00,000
吉利他力在這裡合在一起

897
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,000
We can see our effort and God's power

898
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,000
Are united here

899
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,000
這是最高的宗教

900
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:10,000
And this is the highest religion

901
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:14,000
單靠自己我們都知道自己靠不住

902
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:17,000
If we are too self-reliant

903
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:20,000
We often find out that we cannot really rely on ourselves

904
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,000
我們對人性認識越深

905
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:25,000
我們越對自己不信任

906
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Because the more we know about human nature

907
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,000
The less trust we will have for ourselves

908
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,000
第一次世界大戰以後

909
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:39,000
許多的哲學神學的論調都開始改變

910
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:41,000
After the first world war

911
00:54:41,000 --> 00:54:42,000
A lot of philosophy

912
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,000
A lot of those they changed

913
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:48,000
過去對人性有信任

914
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,000
很強的confidence in human nature

915
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:55,000
Before the first world war

916
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,000
There were a lot of trust and confidence

917
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:59,000
對人性有很大的信任

918
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,000
第一次世界大戰以後

919
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,000
發現人性這麼惡

920
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:07,000
是自我毀滅的

921
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:09,000
And then after the first world war

922
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:13,000
They come to find out how destructive is human nature

923
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:15,000
So they can no longer trust it

924
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:17,000
They were shocked to themselves

925
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:20,000
他們自己非常的驚奇

926
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,000
驚醒過來了

927
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:32,000
我們看見人性不足需要神性的幫助

928
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,000
That's why we see the deficit in our human nature

929
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:39,000
And this deficit has to be filled up by God

930
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
這個是基督教

931
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,000
And this is Christianity

932
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:49,000
神界的聖靈在基督裡幫助我們

933
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
幫我們重生

934
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:54,000
得到神的生命

935
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,000
得到聖靈的力量

936
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:58,000
得到基督的榜樣

937
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:00,000
我們有新的生命

938
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,000
新的生活

939
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,000
God by the spirit

940
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:06,000
give us this new life in us

941
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
so that we can live a new life

942
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:13,000
這是基督教的意義

943
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,000
And this is the meaning of Christianity

944
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:17,000
所以這裡有個主動

945
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,000
我們自己主動

946
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:20,000
自己主動

947
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,000
We can see the initiative

948
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,000
The war of initiative

949
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:26,000
這個主動是被動的主動

950
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:27,000
But then you have to understand

951
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:33,000
This initiative is actually motivated by God

952
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:39,000
這是一個passive positive

953
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,000
我們看見在這個裡頭

954
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:48,000
有我們的主動的善在裡頭

955
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,000
Here we see that within ourselves

956
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,000
that this will to do good

957
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,000
is actually God working in us

958
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:57,000
感謝天父

959
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,000
Praise to the Lord

960
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:04,000
我們不是沒有盼望的

961
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,000
We are here not without hope

962
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,000
我們在基督裡有盼望

963
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:11,000
Because we have this precious hope in Christ Jesus

964
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,000
我們在基督裡有自由

965
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:15,000
In Christ we also have liberty

966
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,000
我們在基督裡有新的生命生活

967
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:20,000
In Christ we have this new life

968
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,000
我們在基督裡有一個新的歸宿

969
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:30,000
In Christ we also have this new refuge

970
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:32,000
New destiny

971
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,000
我們低頭禱告

972
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,000
Let us pray together
