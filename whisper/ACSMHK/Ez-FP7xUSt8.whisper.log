[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   [Music]
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:13.600]   [Cantonese] Hello everyone, I am Dr. Chan Wing Chiu. I am a teacher at the Hong Kong Chinese University, Tung Kee School, Sha Lek College.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.600]   I am very happy to be here to introduce to you a book that has a great influence on me.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:25.600]   I am holding this book in my hand because I don't have a physical copy,
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   so I have a book for you to see. It is called "Mere Discipleship" by Lee Kam.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   I will share with you the content of this book and its influence on me.
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600]   The name of this book is "Mere Discipleship".
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.600]   Unfortunately, I introduced it in Chinese, but the original version of this book is only in English.
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600]   It does not have a Chinese translation.
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:00.600]   But I have thought about how to translate this book.
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.600]   I thought of another book.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.600]   Our readers may remember it.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.600]   C.S. Lewis wrote a book called "Mere Christianity".
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.600]   The book was published in 1952, so the readers may have some impression.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.600]   "Mere Christianity" has a Chinese translation.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   It is called "The Return of the Rebellion".
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600]   I think this book is very interesting.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.600]   Because the same word is used in the same book as Lee Kam's book.
[00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600]   It is called "Mere".
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.600]   If the two words are similar,
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.600]   if I use the idea of Lewis to translate this book,
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   it will be translated as "The Return of the Rebellion".
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.600]   The word "Mere" is related to "religion".
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   So we can recall that the author Lee Kam hoped to return to the origin of "The Return of the Rebellion".
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.600]   Let's re-experience the concept of the "Mere" again.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:23.600]   When this book was published, it was very useful to me.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   I remember in 2016, I was preparing a new course in Chong Kee.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   It is related to "The Return of the Rebellion".
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   When I was looking for this topic, I faced a problem.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.600]   Although I have been a pastor for decades,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   and I have done many "Mere" courses,
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.600]   I think that in terms of the concept of "The Return of the Rebellion",
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.600]   our course can be much more, and the training books can be much more.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   But I think that as time goes by,
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.600]   the people's concept of "The Return of the Rebellion" is a bit confused.
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   So at this turning point, I came across this book by Lee Kam.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   He is going to "repeat" "The Return of the Rebellion".
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   He is going to use this book to point out the problems.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   He is going to use this book to point out the problems.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:21.600]   At that time, I had many questions, but I didn't know how to express them.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   But this book helped me in terms of history and ideas.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   It allowed me to find some words to express,
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   and it helped me to be more fulfilled in my course.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.600]   Before talking about the background of this book,
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.600]   Lee Kam is a professor in a university in Tennessee,
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   which is in the middle of the United States.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   This university is not very famous.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   It is a Christian university, but its history is very long.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.600]   The name of the university is Lipscomb,
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   which is a name of a person.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   David Lipscomb was a famous person in Tennessee.
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   He appeared in the post-war period of the U.S.S.S.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.600]   He thought that the U.S.S.S. was a very interesting country
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   because it was a Christian country.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   But when the war broke out, the soldiers in the north and south were all Christians.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   He felt that this was not right,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   so he stood up and opposed the war.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.600]   He felt that as Christians, we should have a Christian sense of values.
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   So he fought against the idea of war from the perspective of God,
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   and he stood up to oppose the war.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   The war ended soon after,
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   and he was very popular.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   He founded a university called David Lipscomb,
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.600]   which is still very active today.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   Lee Kam is a professor in this university.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.600]   He also wants to embody the same idea.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   The source of this book is to re-think God's perspective
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   from all perspectives,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   from all political parties,
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   from all political parties,
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   and to re-think the picture of the door.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   When you read this book,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   you will see that it is very powerful and inspiring.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   It uses the story of the two tribes of Luangta
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   who slaughtered each other as a start.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   It is very bloody.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   It talks about two tribes fighting each other.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   Why does he use this example?
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   At that time, the United Nations considered Luangta
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   as the most Christian country.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   More than 90% of people said they were Christians.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   But during the process of Luangta,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.600]   Lee Kam said,
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   "How can a Christian citizen
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   be a believer,
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.600]   and they can stab their neighbor
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   and slaughter him?"
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   He used this bloody example to raise this question.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   As Christians,
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.600]   where is our value?
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   If we are the door,
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.600]   where is the idea of the door?
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   He went on to pursue this idea.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   Once he pursued this idea,
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   he went from bad to worse.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.600]   He went back to the history of the Church.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   In 321,
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   when Constantine was the Roman Emperor,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   he was 32 years old.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   He knew Jesus and had faith.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   From that time on,
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   Christianity no longer needed to hide
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   in a hidden place.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   Because the Emperor claimed to have faith in Christianity.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:35.600]   But in this matter,
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   the reflection until today,
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   what happened?
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   The Church was raised up.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   The perspective of God was lowered.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   This is the situation.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   I will repeat it again.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   In the 4th century,
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   the perspective of the Church was raised up.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   The perspective of God was lowered.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   Why did the perspective of the Church appear?
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:07.600]   Because the Emperor was the Golden Lord.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.600]   The Emperor was the Descendant.
[00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   The Christianity could have a system
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.600]   and a religion in an open place.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.600]   Even the King of the Church,
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.600]   the country and the religion
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.600]   would not be separated.
[00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   All of a sudden,
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.600]   the status of religion was raised up.
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:34.600]   The people used their political and economic thinking
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   to build up their faith.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   In the past 1700 years,
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   we did not consider this issue.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   Many times, the growth of the Church,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   the revival of the Church, etc.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   were short-lived and not done enough.
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:56.600]   Including Martin Luther's Reformation,
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.600]   he had a system of Catholicism.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.600]   He had a so-called "Faithful and Pure"
[00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   when he entered the new Catholic system.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.600]   He did not change the system.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:14.600]   He just introduced a different system,
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   a Catholic system,
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.600]   into the new Catholic system.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.600]   In this book,
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.600]   Lee Kam reflects on history
[00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:27.600]   and helps us to reflect.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:32.600]   We cannot go back to 10, 20 or 30 years ago.
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   We have to go back to a very early period.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   The Church was raised up.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   In this book, he helps us to reflect.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.600]   He gives us a diagnosis,
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.600]   a diagnosis, a name of the disease.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   In this case, he calls it "Post-Tandem White Psycho".
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.600]   If a person is a "Post-Tandem White Psycho",
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:59.600]   he is not clear about the things around him.
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.600]   He is very self-centered.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   He develops the content of this book from this aspect.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.600]   The book is divided into three parts.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   The first part is about the first part.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   The second part is about the history of the Church.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.600]   He gives many examples up to now.
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.600]   The third part is about how we can re-form
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   and how we can jointly develop
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   the "Post-Tandem White Psycho"
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:36.600]   and return to the truth of the "Post-Tandem White Psycho".
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.600]   Thank you for having the opportunity to explore this book.
[00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   I am very happy to give you a brief introduction.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.600]   Thank you.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:53.760]   (upbeat music)
