[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.600]   (music)
[00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.040]   Hello, brothers and sisters
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.440]   I am Professor Tan Chi-chiu
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.400]   from the School of the Holy Spirit
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.880]   I am very happy to share with you
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.680]   a book I like very much
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.880]   "Destroyer of the Gods"
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.380]   written by Larry Hurtado
[00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.520]   Larry Hurtado was my instructor
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.520]   when I was studying my PhD in Edinburgh
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.460]   He wrote this book in 2016
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.400]   As you can see, the title is "Destroyer of the Gods"
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:45.380]   It is about the destruction of the gods
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:49.920]   He intentionally described the "gods"
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.080]   He clearly compared the true God of Christianity
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.880]   with the gods of the Roman Empire in the 1st century
[00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.260]   The book is about the special features of Christianity
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.560]   He also mentioned the distinctiveness of Christianity in the title
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.340]   It is about the Christian ideas
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.180]   Today we may think of Christianity as a common belief
[00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.020]   We may think of Christianity as one of the religions
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.720]   with its own classicism and other things
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.220]   We may think of Christianity as a common belief
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.760]   But in the first three centuries or at the beginning of Christianity
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.560]   what is the difference between Christianity and the Roman Empire?
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.200]   The book is for the reader to re-examine and reflect on
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.140]   This book is a historical search
[00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.580]   It is not a book for interpretation
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.620]   It is a book for the reader to re-examine and reflect on
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.200]   The book has five chapters
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.140]   The first chapter is about the Christian view of Christianity
[00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.700]   Christianity is very interesting
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.240]   It is described as a person without a god
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.280]   How can Christianity be without a god?
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.180]   It is because Christianity believes in one God
[00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.880]   but does not believe in the gods of heaven
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.420]   This is strange to the Roman Empire
[00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.220]   How can a single God be a separate God
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.620]   and separate the other gods from the other gods?
[00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.660]   Christianity is also very different from the Jewish religion
[00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.460]   The Jewish religion also believes in one God
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:08.740]   But in the beginning of Christianity, Jesus Christ, the son of God, was made a savior
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.080]   He was placed in a place of worship
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.480]   The book uses the word "devotion"
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.720]   It is like he and God have the same status
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.720]   to receive our worship
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.120]   When you pray, you are in the name of the Lord
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.620]   When you confess, you are in the name of the Lord
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.500]   When you are baptized, you are in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:35.160]   This book is for us to see
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.240]   The non-Christians, whether they are Jews or Romans
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.180]   feel that this kind of faith is very strange
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.880]   So, apart from the first chapter, which is from a non-Christian perspective
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.580]   the second and third chapters
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.620]   also talk about a new type of faith
[00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:56.420]   and a different status
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.520]   These people believe that Jesus Christ is a special one
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.060]   When they say he is the son of God
[00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:15.800]   their belief is different
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.800]   When you think about it
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:21.120]   what does a new type of faith
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.420]   and a different status mean?
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.320]   It means that what they believe
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.060]   is no longer the fullness of God
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.660]   Those are false gods
[00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:36.220]   The only true God and his son Jesus Christ
[00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.760]   is what this book wants to emphasize
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.260]   That kind of faith is different from others
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.940]   and has a very different status
[00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.680]   It is no longer the same as those false gods
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.940]   When there is no such relationship
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.740]   it is also different from Judaism
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.400]   Because when the Jews were to be converted
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.800]   to the country of Jerusalem
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.840]   and to be converted to Judaism
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.340]   from the perspective of the non-Christians
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.480]   they had already given up their national identity
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:16.680]   and their ancestors
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.620]   to become Jews
[00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:23.320]   So, what is different from Judaism
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.880]   is that it emphasizes our belief
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:27.180]   that we believe in one God
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.520]   and this one God does not mean that you belong to a nation
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.720]   Because this one God
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.820]   the faith that Jesus Christ brought to us
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.860]   is transcendental
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.060]   A trans-ethnic faith
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:43.760]   a trans-local faith
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.900]   is no longer a faith that belongs to a certain place
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.140]   a certain regime or a certain country
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.380]   but a faith that transcends the nation and the region
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.380]   It is a very different identity
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.980]   and this identity is what Jesus Christ
[00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:04.220]   claims to have brought to us
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:06.220]   Another important point to mention
[00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:09.760]   is that when Christianity is very different from other religions
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.620]   it is a bookish religion
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.140]   Bookish means that it is very faithful to books
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.000]   and it is very faithful from the beginning
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.240]   What does bookish mean?
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.980]   Bookish means that it is a very faithful religion
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.080]   It means that there are some
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.920]   that we later called "signs"
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.920]   which are simply the books of the Gospel
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.060]   and the books of the Bible
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.020]   In the early days
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:39.060]   they were already a classic
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.860]   and shaped their faith
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.360]   The whole faith was based on
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.760]   the books that were written
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.460]   This is very different from the faith of the present day
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:52.700]   In Judaism, they also focus on the classics
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.460]   but they focus on the hand-written scriptures
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.460]   and the commandments
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:02.340]   But in Christianity, there is no such commandment
[00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.140]   no such "sign"
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:08.840]   no such form
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.280]   This is also strange to the non-Christians
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:13.080]   because they emphasize a book
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.620]   and this book is changing their lives
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:19.420]   This book is giving them a new life
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.420]   and their faith
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.520]   is only based on what the non-Christians think
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.460]   It is like what you said today
[00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.660]   that you go to the temple to worship God
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.100]   and you add perfume to Him
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.040]   and you worship Him
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:35.300]   It is a form of mutual benefit
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:36.500]   You worship Him
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.800]   and God blesses you
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.280]   and you become rich
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:41.620]   and everything is good
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:43.380]   But in Christianity, it is not like that
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:47.680]   So this kind of identity and bookish religion
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.080]   is helping people to reflect on what is happening
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.920]   Why do you surround yourself with books
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.260]   that are about Jesus
[00:07:56.260 --> 00:07:58.260]   and that can change so much
[00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:06.140]   and you no longer do the worshiping of idols
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.500]   And in the last chapter, "A New Way to Live"
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.080]   it talks about how their life behaviors have changed
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:16.480]   The non-Christians think that
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.340]   if they have a baby and don't like it
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.740]   and it is a girl or something else
[00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.820]   they can just throw it away
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.480]   These Christians, because of these books
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:26.120]   have changed their lives
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:27.220]   They think it is not right
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.560]   They are human beings
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:29.920]   and are loved by God
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.700]   A God would love a human being
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:36.200]   and it is not about gender or race
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.740]   So their lives have changed
[00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:42.840]   Their views on sex, marriage, and how to see people
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.180]   and the connection between people
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.680]   They have a different view
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.380]   So in the first century
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:52.280]   they formed a very unique
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:55.720]   and new nation
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:58.660]   So this book helps us to explore
[00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:03.900]   the Christianity we see as a norm
[00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.360]   and to reflect on what was happening
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.700]   in the first three centuries
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.100]   It helps us to reflect again
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:14.740]   and not to take it for granted
[00:09:14.740 --> 00:09:17.140]   What is unique about Christianity
[00:09:17.140 --> 00:09:20.880]   is that it challenges the society
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.080]   and the social culture
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:25.620]   and the religious system
[00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.080]   and the political system
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:28.480]   to rethink
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.860]   If there is a God in this world
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.180]   who is the One True God
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.360]   what would He think?
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.460]   He is really exploring humanity
[00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:39.560]   and leaving these books
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:42.100]   to help us to reflect again
[00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:43.760]   So 2000 years ago was like this
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.700]   Today, in 2024
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:48.980]   it is worth thinking about
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:50.180]   what we believe in
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.840]   and what is the connection
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:55.080]   between our lives, our culture
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.480]   and the world that changes so quickly
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.060]   (upbeat music)
