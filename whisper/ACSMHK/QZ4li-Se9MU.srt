00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:05,200
 Hello, everyone

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,160
 My name is Lee Tien-kwan

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,960
 I am a teacher at the Catholic Academy of the Holy See

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,840
 I teach systematic theology

6
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,400
 Today I would like to introduce a book

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,200
 about the study of the Five Elements

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,800
 Many people have asked me

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,280
 what books to introduce

10
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,040
 when I teach or share this topic

11
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,640
 So today I would like to introduce a book

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:23,680
 that is often referred to as "church"

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,640
 in the Chinese language

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,320
 or "theology"

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
 Today I would like to introduce a book

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 that is based on the study of the Five Elements

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,600
 or even a broader study

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,240
 of the Five Elements, called "Pentecostalism"

19
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:38,640
 It is a broader study

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:41,840
 and is not often mentioned in the Chinese language

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,480
 This book is called "Global Pentecostalism"

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,600
 The title is

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,040
 "The New Phase of Christian Social Engagement"

24
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,440
 It is written by two scholars

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,240
 They are not members of the Five Elements

26
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,680
 One is Donald E. Mueller

27
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,360
 He studies religious and social science

28
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,920
 The other is Ted Yamamori

29
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,760
 He is an NGO that deals with poverty

30
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,440
 When the two of them work together

31
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,120
 they want to conduct research

32
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:09,040
 on developing countries

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,440
 especially on Christian churches

34
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,880
 that are developing rapidly

35
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,080
 and have no police support

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
 but are active in serving society

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,640
 and even bringing about social transformation

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,280
 in the church

39
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,120
 In their research

40
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:32,640
 they found that 85% of the churches

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,680
 were the Five Elements and the Holy Spirit

42
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,200
 So they changed the title of the book

43
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,200
 to "Pentecostalism"

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,200
 The book is based on

45
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,320
 the study of the Five Elements

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,640
 in a global way

47
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,600
 Because when we study the Five Elements

48
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,880
 or the Pentecostalism

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,000
 especially in the Chinese language

50
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,520
 we use the "three-wave theory"

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,520
 We say that the United States is the center

52
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,920
 and the "made in USA" is the direction

53
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,000
 But today many people

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:07,600
 are looking at it from a global perspective

55
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,040
 They found that

56
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,440
 the Pentecostalism

57
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,120
 is not only the development of the United States

58
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
 the development of the "one, two, three waves"

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,640
 but also the development of different revival movements

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,520
 in the world

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,760
 So they divided the groups

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,560
 into five major groups

63
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,840
 The first group is the classical Pentecostalism

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,920
 which is the five-fold tradition

65
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,800
 The second group is the individualistic

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,200
 but five-fold-style

67
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
 or the local-style

68
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,080
 or the local-style

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,240
 or the local-style

70
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:48,800
 The third group is the spiritual movement

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,440
 or the third-wave-influenced

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,000
 or the third-wave-influenced

73
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,360
 The fourth group is the individualistic

74
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,240
 but the five-fold-style

75
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:05,040
 or the local-style

76
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,120
 The fifth group is very special

77
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,400
 It is very rare to see

78
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,600
 It is a group of individual believers

79
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,960
 who participated in a special meeting

80
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,520
 and had spiritual experience

81
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,600
 Because of this experience

82
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,400
 they also had many faith-filled activities

83
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,480
 From a global perspective

84
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,360
 it is a rich study of the three-wave theory

85
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,720
 of the Pentecostalism

86
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,960
 Especially the local churches

87
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,600
 which are not influenced by the West

88
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,160
 This is a great criticism of the three-wave theory

89
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,400
 The second feature is that

90
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,640
 this book is studied by non-Pentecostalists

91
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,400
 or the people of the Bible

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,760
 They mainly use cross-scientific research

93
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,440
 especially religious psychology

94
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,600
 The study of the three-wave theory

95
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,080
 shows us a broader direction of the Pentecostalism

96
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,800
 especially in the university

97
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,400
 not limited to the diocese or church

98
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,440
 There are also many scientific integrations

99
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,680
 They use social theories

100
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,320
 such as Marx, Jurgen, Sigmund Freud

101
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,640
 to study the three-wave theory

102
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,040
 Of course, the authors

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,800
 or the two authors

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,560
 emphasize that

105
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,320
 these social theories

106
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,960
 often weaken religious phenomena

107
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
 But from their perspective

108
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,280
 I think they have a breakthrough

109
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,920
 In addition to social theories

110
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:41,760
 they also use the email theorem

111
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,280
 to study worship

112
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,360
 and how to integrate the whole community

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,200
 into a single theory

114
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,800
 They are also careful

115
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
 to avoid neglecting

116
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,680
 or denying some supernatural works

117
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,320
 This is a key point or breakthrough

118
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,720
 in their research

119
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,160
 This book emphasizes

120
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,800
 the Christian social engagement

121
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,680
 As I said

122
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,240
 85% of the church

123
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,360
 is Pentecostal and spiritual

124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,520
 In fact, it means

125
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,520
 that many of our understanding of the Pentecostalism

126
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,360
 is based on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit

127
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,520
 or they emphasize the aspect of the Holy Spirit

128
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,480
 But today, from a global perspective

129
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,760
 when we look at this data

130
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:29,440
 they are not conservative

131
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,560
 Christian believers

132
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,760
 They are very involved in society

133
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,520
 and participate in the transformation of society

134
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
 So in this book

135
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
 they call these Christian believers

136
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,880
 or Pentecostal believers

137
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,960
 "progressive Pentecostalism"

138
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,560
 which means they are progressive

139
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,120
 or they are believers who are in favor of Pentecostalism

140
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,880
 This is a new perspective

141
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,040
 of the Pentecostalism research

142
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,600
 and the Pentecostalism church

143
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
 It is very interesting

144
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,760
 It compares the Pentecostalism

145
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,080
 with the Pentecostalism in Latin America

146
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:07,680
 There is a quote

147
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
 that I think is worth reading

148
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,880
 It says

149
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,680
 "Liberation theology opted for the poor

150
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,760
 at the same time that the poor were opting for Pentecostalism"

151
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,600
 In fact, it says

152
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
 that in Latin America

153
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,400
 the reformation of society was the doctrine of the Holy Spirit

154
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,080
 But in the public sphere

155
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,200
 many people's needs

156
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,240
 whether they are sick

157
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,240
 or in economic need

158
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,400
 are not satisfied by the doctrine of the Holy Spirit

159
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,240
 but by the Five-Day Feast

160
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,400
 or the Church of the Holy Spirit

161
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,400
 Their social programs

162
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,400
 such as orphanages, medical care

163
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,400
 social support

164
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,240
 and even job hunting

165
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
 have been extended to

166
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,280
 Protestant ethics

167
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,720
 Pentecostal ethics

168
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,600
 and many other economic topics

169
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,160
 which are also very important

170
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,400
 in the Five-Day Feast

171
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,480
 Here you can see

172
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,800
 the uniqueness of this book

173
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,360
 At the end, there are two bullet points

174
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,400
 The first bullet point is that

175
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,000
 this book is very special

176
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,080
 It introduces Hong Kong

177
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,560
 Of course, when these two authors

178
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,360
 visited Hong Kong and Singapore

179
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,560
 they were a bit skeptical

180
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,360
 whether they were developing countries

181
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,240
 But they did research on these churches

182
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,600
 They studied the Church of the Holy Spirit

183
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,960
 the Pentecostal Church

184
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,000
 At first, they were a bit skeptical

185
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,760
 But gradually they found that

186
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:36,000
 they did not want to establish an organization

187
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,760
 but to lead by the Holy Spirit

188
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,920
 So they did not need to raise funds

189
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,600
 They did not want to establish a church

190
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:44,080
 but to build a group of people

191
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,040
 who love each other because of God's love

192
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,120
 This made them very optimistic

193
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,520
 Of course, they also visited a pastor

194
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,520
 in Hong Kong to explain the doctrine

195
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,800
 The pastor was a PhD student

196
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,720
 in an important Canadian school

197
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,640
 Of course, he was not a pastor of the Five-Day Feast

198
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,280
 But he saw that there were many new ideas

199
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,400
 about the Five-Day Feast

200
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,640
 This is also a very important point

201
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:14,480
 in this book

202
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:17,600
 Of course, they also visited the Holy See

203
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
 the Holy See in the Central Park

204
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,200
 So this is worth mentioning

205
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,040
 The second bullet point is that

206
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:27,120
 if you are interested in the Five-Day Feast

207
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,360
 you can read two more extended translations

208
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,040
 The first is the "Pentecostalism" published in 1997

209
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:41,600
 This is a global study of the Five-Day Feast

210
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,440
 It has already broken the "Three-Wheel Theory"

211
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,600
 It was published in 1997

212
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
 The other one is a new one

213
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,480
 It is a handbook on Pentecostal theology

214
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,840
 This book is very good

215
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,960
 because it covers almost all the topics

216
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:00,080
 of the Five-Day Feast

217
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:03,680
 Each chapter is written by a research expert

218
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,960
 or a book expert

219
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,240
 It is only about ten pages

220
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,320
 You can understand the whole topic

221
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
 It is very worth reading

222
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:15,520
 I hope that when you are interested in Pentecostalism

223
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,440
 you can read the above book

224
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,480
 Thank you

225
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:28,800
