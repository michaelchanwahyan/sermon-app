00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,680
 Biblical Basis of Missions. This morning we have come to our second subtitle, the

2
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:19,560
 basis of missions in the Gospels, that is Christ and missions. My message this

3
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:28,720
 morning is divided into three parts. First, Christ as a missionary. Second,

4
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:36,360
 Christ's teaching on the kingdom of God and missions. Third, the Great Commission

5
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:47,320
 and missions. Now, a) Christ as a missionary. The Gospels are records of the

6
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:54,400
 redeeming love of God through Christ. Love is always a mission because it

7
00:00:54,400 --> 00:01:00,640
 reaches out for its own fulfillment. The divine mission of love has a missionary

8
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,440
 and that missionary is Christ. A missionary is one who is sent to

9
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:15,600
 accomplish a mission. Does Christ think of himself as a missionary? Yes. He

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:23,480
 mentions 39 times that he is sent by God as recorded in the Gospel of John alone.

11
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:32,600
 But this divine missionary has also sent us out as missionaries. He says, "As the

12
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:41,320
 Father has sent me, so send I you." He is the proto-missionary and as such he has

13
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:48,000
 set an example for us to follow. It is therefore very important for us to find

14
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,320
 out how he acted as a missionary. Our findings will point out the right path

15
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:03,560
 for us to follow. I'm going to mention six points in regard to Christ as a

16
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,600
 missionary. First, Christ's teaching in regard to the goals of his own mission.

17
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:17,400
 Second, Christ's missionary methods. Third, Christ's missionary attitude. Fourth,

18
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,960
 Christ's missionary spirit. Fifth, Christ's missionary commitment. Sixth, Christ's

19
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:33,200
 missionary field. Now first, Christ's teaching in regard to the goals of his own

20
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:42,160
 mission. What are the goals of Christ's mission? First, he came to seek and save

21
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:50,320
 the lost. The Lord says in Luke 19 10, "The Son of Man came to seek and to save

22
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:56,400
 that which was lost." Christ came to the world to bring the lost back to God and

23
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,880
 heal the estrangement between man and God. This is the task of reconciliation.

24
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:11,320
 In effecting this reconciliation, he gave his life a ransom for many. Mark 10 45.

25
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:19,960
 Second, he came to give the abundant life. He said, "I'm come that they might have

26
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:26,760
 life and that they might have it more abundantly." John 10 10. This is the task

27
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,920
 of imparting and vigorizing spiritual life in the believers. Christ did not

28
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,120
 come just to settle the legal aspect, so to speak, of our salvation, but also to

29
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:47,040
 give us a new life which is united with his own. Christ did not come just to

30
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,400
 teach us what is good and what is bad. His is not merely a teaching mission, but

31
00:03:53,400 --> 00:04:00,520
 essentially a life-giving mission. The life that he gives has all its native

32
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:07,240
 properties for fruit-bearing. Moral goodness and excellence are fruits of

33
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:14,520
 this new life. Mankind has had many excellent teachers of morality, but only

34
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:25,320
 one the Redeemer and life-giver. Third, he came to show the Father. He said, "He that

35
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,920
 hath seen me hath seen the Father." John 14 9. No one hath seen God at any time.

36
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:38,640
 The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared

37
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:47,280
 him. John 1 18. In the incarnation of Christ, the God of eternity entered into

38
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:53,560
 time, and the infinite intersected the finite, which is a great mystery to our

39
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:59,760
 minds. But more important to us is that the incarnation of Christ shows us in

40
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:07,640
 concrete terms the ineffable majesty, beauty, and perfection of God. The life

41
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:13,640
 and work of Christ reveals to us the true image of God, so much so that Christ

42
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:20,320
 said to Thomas, "He that hath seen me hath seen the Father." We see the light of the

43
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,640
 knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ. 2 Corinthians 4 6.

44
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:34,040
 Christ's was the great mission of reflecting the glorious image of God. It

45
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:40,520
 is not only Christ's mission, but also ours. We Christians are to bear the

46
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:47,640
 likeness of Christ, which in turn is the express image of God. Paul says in

47
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:55,000
 Romans 8 29, "Whom God did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to

48
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,360
 the image of his Son." Our conformity to the likeness of Christ is so important

49
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:09,520
 that is called by Paul the predestinated will of God. Fourth, he came to fulfill

50
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:16,360
 the law. He said, "Think not that I'm come to destroy the law or the prophets. I'm

51
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:24,040
 not come to destroy, but to fulfill." Matthew 5 17. Christ came to fulfill the

52
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:30,880
 law in two ways. First, he obeyed the law in all his earthly life. Second, he bore

53
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,960
 our failure in keeping the law and paid our debt to the law on the cross. He did

54
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,880
 not pay our debt to Satan, as some people think, because we do not owe Satan

55
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,440
 anything, but we do owe the debt of obeying the law of God. So Paul says,

56
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:54,520
 "Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law being made a curse for us."

57
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:02,040
 Galatians 3 13. Christ has also given us power to keep the Spirit, not the letter

58
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:11,760
 of the law. Fifth, he came to set people free from sin. He said, "If the Son shall

59
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:19,560
 make you free, ye shall be free indeed." John 8 36. For this purpose the Son of

60
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,840
 God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil. 1 John 3 8.

61
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:32,040
 Since the work of Satan is sin, Christ came to destroy sin and save us from

62
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:39,080
 sin. Christ as prophet saves us from the ignorance of sin. Christ as

63
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:45,080
 priest saves us from the guilt of sin as well as from the root of sin. Christ as

64
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:52,160
 king saves us from the power of sin. Christ's remedy for sin is therefore the

65
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:58,640
 cross, which means identification, a twofold identification, objective

66
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:04,320
 identification and subjective identification. Objective identification

67
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:10,840
 means that Christ identified himself with us on the cross, that is, he died on

68
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:16,640
 the cross for us. This is the doctrine of the substitutional death of Christ.

69
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,440
 Subjective identification means that we identify ourselves with Christ on the

70
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:28,160
 cross, that is, we die with Christ on the cross, which means self-crucifixion or

71
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:34,840
 self-negation. Self-negation deals with self-centeredness, which is the root of

72
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:40,080
 all sin. In one word, objective identification, which is the

73
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,000
 substitutional death of Christ, saves us from the guilt of sin and subjective

74
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:53,760
 identification, which means self-negation, saves us from the root of sin. Sixth, he

75
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,720
 came to reveal truth. He said, "For this cause I came into the world, that I

76
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:08,840
 should bear witness unto the truth." John 18, 37. Christ not only revealed truth to

77
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:15,400
 us, he is truth. Christ is truth in two senses. First, he is truth because his

78
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,760
 life is the perfect embodiment of truth. Second, he is truth not because he

79
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,520
 conforms to truth as something independent of him and normative to him,

80
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:33,160
 but because truth emanates from him. Moreover, the fact that Christ is truth

81
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,560
 indicates that truth is not merely something intellectual in nature, but

82
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,880
 something living, living relationship with God, with people, with things, and

83
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:51,160
 with oneself. Christians are not students of truth as theories, but they are

84
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,840
 disciples of the living Word of God, which is Christ. A student studies books,

85
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:04,320
 but a disciple learns of his master and teacher. The above are the goals of the

86
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,880
 mission of Christ as explicitly stated by himself. Christ's mission is, in a

87
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:17,400
 secondary sense, our mission. Christ said to his disciples, "He that believeth on me

88
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:24,520
 the works I do, shall he do also." John 14, 12. Our mission, therefore, is

89
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:32,200
 primarily the task of reconciliation, of bringing others into new life,

90
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:37,840
 and into discipleship of the living Word of God, of showing the likeness of Christ,

91
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,560
 of witnessing to the grace of forgiveness of sin, and to the power of

92
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:48,160
 sin, which we can possess through faith, of leading people into a self-denying

93
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:57,040
 and thereby a fruit-bearing life. Now what are Christ's missionary methods?

94
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:07,360
 I'm going to mention two methods that Christ used. First, identification. Christ

95
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:14,440
 became man, living among men, and as Son of Man he fulfilled his mission. He did

96
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:21,040
 not use a substitute, but he came to the world himself. He did not abhor the womb

97
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:27,480
 of a virgin, the manger, the hard life of a carpenter, the sickening association

98
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,800
 with degraded sinners, the hatred and insult of men, and finally the agony of

99
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:39,840
 Gethsemane and the suffering of Calvary. He went through all this in order to

100
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:47,880
 save us. Paul sums up all this in three beautiful verses. Christ, who being in the

101
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:53,800
 form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no

102
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:59,120
 reputation, and took upon himself the form of a servant, and was made in the

103
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,400
 likeness of man, and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself and

104
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:13,240
 became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Philippians 2 verses 6 to 8.

105
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,240
 We notice five things in these verses which Christ did in his identification

106
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,480
 with us. First, he willingly gave up rights and privileges which belong to

107
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:34,400
 him. Second, he humbled himself in spirit. Third, he identified himself entirely

108
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:42,560
 with those whom he wanted to serve. Fourth, he obeyed the will of God. Fifth, he died

109
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,840
 to himself and lived for others. These five points are the secret of Christ's

110
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:53,920
 success in his mission, and they are also the secret of the success of any

111
00:12:53,920 --> 00:13:03,000
 missionary or missioner of Christ. Second, exemplification. Christ lived his

112
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:08,760
 teaching. The uniqueness of Christ as a teacher lies in the fact that he

113
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:14,800
 practiced his words. He taught his disciples to humble themselves and serve

114
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,480
 one another, and he washed their feet. He taught them the lesson of prayerfulness,

115
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:26,040
 and he prayed at dawn, at night, in company, and in solitude. He taught them

116
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,120
 the lesson of forgiving enemies, and he prayed for those who nailed him to the

117
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:41,720
 cross. Yes, he's the greatest teacher in all human history. What is Christ's

118
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:49,320
 missionary attitude? He said, "The Son of Man came not to be ministered unto, but

119
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:55,800
 to minister." Mark 10, 45. Christ did not come to the world with a scepter in his

120
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:02,120
 hand, but with a yoke on his neck. When the Son of Man under a yoke calls us to

121
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:07,520
 come to him and share his yoke, we are moved and we readily accept his calling

122
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,880
 and counted a great privilege to serve with him. It was in connection with

123
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:18,920
 service that Christ gave his teaching on true greatness, which has five

124
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:25,440
 significant points for our edification. First, Christians should have a totally

125
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,040
 different attitude in life from other people. Christ said, "Ye know that they

126
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,520
 which are counted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, and

127
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:43,640
 their great ones exercise authority upon them. But so shall it not be among you."

128
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:52,960
 Mark 10, verses 42 and 43. Second, true greatness is measured by service. Mark 10,

129
00:14:52,960 --> 00:15:02,880
 43. Third, God honors humility which produces service. Matthew 23, 12. Fourth, a

130
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:10,960
 prize must be paid for true greatness. Mark 10, 38. Fifth, Christ is the best example

131
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:20,360
 for our service. Mark 10, 45. What is Christ's missionary spirit? He said, "Not as

132
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:29,960
 I will, but as thou wilt." Matthew 26, 39. There was a great agony in the heart of

133
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:35,160
 Christ, the agony of struggling between the will and his own will. Out of the

134
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:42,360
 struggle came his glorious resolution, "Not as I will, but as thou wilt." Christ

135
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:48,760
 did not seek self-fulfillment, but the fulfillment of the will of God. This is

136
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:54,960
 also a real and continual struggle in the life of every missionary. A successful

137
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,880
 and fruitful missionary comes out of it with the battle cry, "Not as I will, but as

138
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:08,920
 thou wilt." Now let's think about Christ's missionary commitment. He was obedient

139
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:15,760
 unto death. Philippians 2, 8. It is recorded in Mark that when Jesus went up

140
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:20,320
 to Jerusalem for the last time, there was something in his face that made his

141
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:27,480
 disciples amazed and afraid. Mark 10, 32. What was it? The Bible does not tell us

142
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,320
 what it was, but gathering from the context, I believe it is quite clear that

143
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:38,400
 there was an extraordinary air of determinedness and firmness in the

144
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:42,720
 expression of the face of Christ, which deeply impressed his disciples and

145
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,800
 created a sense of awe in their minds. The Bible says here that Jesus went

146
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:55,240
 ahead of his disciples on their way to Jerusalem. Evidently, there was something

147
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:01,120
 unusual about Jesus walking before them, and the logical explanation for it is

148
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:07,200
 that the pace of Jesus was unconsciously quickened by his resolute decision to

149
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:15,320
 accept suffering and death in obedience to the will of God. Finally, Christ's

150
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:23,480
 mission field. He says, "And other sheep I have which are not of this fold, them

151
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,280
 also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice, and there shall be one fold and

152
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:37,800
 one shepherd." John 10, 16. Christ did not limit his mission field to the Jews. His

153
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:43,760
 fold is open to all nations. He said, "If I be lifted up, I will draw all men unto

154
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:56,960
 me." John 12, 32. Now, B, Christ's teaching on the kingdom of God and missions. A large

155
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:03,000
 portion of Christ's teaching is about the kingdom of God. He made it very clear

156
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,520
 that the scope of the kingdom of God is worldwide and not limited to the Jews.

157
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,400
 First, Christ teaches that many people shall come from the east and from the

158
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,320
 west and from the north and from the south and shall sit down feasting in the

159
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,960
 kingdom of God. Luke 13, 29. The blessings of the kingdom of God are for all the

160
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,680
 people of the world. The picture of the kingdom of God as a feast is very

161
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:38,280
 precious, but evidently an invitation has to be sent out to the nations and the

162
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:44,040
 guests must be brought to the feast. The sending and gathering constitute our

163
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:49,720
 mission. The missioners of the king are ordered to go to the east and to the

164
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:54,840
 west and to the north and to the south to proclaim the good news of the feast

165
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:59,520
 of the kingdom and gather those who will respond to the great invitation of the

166
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:06,040
 king to the feast. Those guests who were in the time past Gentiles in the flesh

167
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:11,800
 called uncircumcision without Christ being aliens from the commonwealth of

168
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:17,400
 Israel and stranger from the covenants of promise having no hope and without

169
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:23,400
 God in the world are now made nigh to God by the blood of Christ. Ephesians 2

170
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:32,160
 verses 11 to 13. The far off are made nigh. The strangers have become sons. The

171
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:37,320
 outsiders are now recipients of the covenants of promise. The hopeless and

172
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,760
 godless now constitute the feasters in the kingdom of God. What a glorious

173
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:51,720
 transformation. Second, Christ teaches that the Gentiles will not only be among

174
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:56,520
 among the feasters in the kingdom of God but will also together with the

175
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:07,040
 believing Jews inherit the kingdom of God. Matthew 21 43. Christ said to Paul in

176
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:13,600
 a vision, "I have appeared unto thee for this purpose to make thee a minister and

177
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:18,520
 a witness both of the things which thou hast seen and of those things in the

178
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,120
 which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from the people and from the

179
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:28,920
 Gentiles unto whom now I send thee to open their eyes and to turn them from

180
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,880
 darkness to light and from the power of Satan unto God that they may receive

181
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,920
 forgiveness of sins and inheritance among them which are sanctified by

182
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:48,040
 faith that is in me." Acts 26 verses 16 to 18. Christ sent Paul as a

183
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,200
 missioner to gather the Gentile believers into the inheritance of his

184
00:20:53,200 --> 00:21:01,720
 kingdom and today he sends us to do the same thing for all nations. Third, Christ

185
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,280
 teaches that the gospel of this kingdom will be preached in all the world.

186
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:14,320
 Matthew 24 14. By whom? By missionaries who are gospel bearers to the ends of

187
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,160
 the earth. Christ pointed out very clearly that the gospel of this kingdom

188
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:25,920
 must be preached in all the world before his second coming. We can therefore say

189
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:32,640
 that the missionaries for the gospel or the gospel bearers are also heralds of

190
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:42,600
 his coming. Now the Great Commission and missions. Missions is the task of

191
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:48,800
 carrying out the Great Commission. If all other bases of missions fail, surely

192
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:56,360
 the Great Commission alone established the logic of missions. First, the

193
00:21:56,360 --> 00:22:03,400
 recipients of the Great Commission. "Go ye therefore ye." Now who are the ye? Some

194
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:08,680
 Christians say that the Great Commission was given to the apostles alone. That

195
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:14,120
 this is not true is readily demonstrated by the following points. First, the

196
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:19,160
 apostles could not possibly accomplish the task of preaching to every creature

197
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:25,240
 all nations in their lifetime. Second, if we say that the Great Commission is only

198
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,960
 meant for the apostles because it was addressed to them, then we must follow by

199
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:34,840
 asserting that all Christ's teaching was only meant for one generation of

200
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:41,920
 believers because it was addressed to them. That is evidently not truth. Third,

201
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:47,200
 we must also remember that the same Commission was given for the second time

202
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:52,680
 in different words to a larger group of disciples than the apostles as recorded

203
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:59,920
 in Acts 1.8. This fact clearly indicates that the Great Commission was meant for

204
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:06,320
 all the followers of Christ. The inevitable conclusion is that the Great

205
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,480
 Commission is meant for the apostles as well as for all believers of

206
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:20,040
 all generations including you and I and me. All of us must have a share in it, no

207
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:28,720
 matter in whatever way. Second, the nature of the Great Commission, a commandment to

208
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:35,880
 be obeyed. The Great Commission is not merely an exhortation or advice. It is a

209
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:43,200
 commandment. If we are under authority, we simply have to obey. Christians are

210
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,880
 soldiers and as soldiers we are expected to obey orders from Christ, our

211
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,960
 Commander-in-Chief. We do not treat orders as options and act at our own

212
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:02,400
 impulses. Every one of us must in one way or another have a share in passing on

213
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,160
 the blessing of the gospel to others near and far. It is a test of our

214
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:16,880
 obedience to Christ. The idea of Christ as the invisible visitor in our homes is

215
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,120
 very beautiful, which has been popularized by a decorative plate hanging

216
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:26,600
 on the walls of the many Christian homes with these words painted on them.

217
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:33,520
 Christ is the invisible visitor in this house and silent listener to

218
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:39,280
 every conversation. Many Christians want Christ but they only want him as a

219
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:46,200
 visitor and no more. A visitor has to be very careful in what he says and does. He

220
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:51,120
 must not say anything or do anything that displeases the host or the hostess.

221
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:56,960
 Christ as an occasional visitor does not have a say in the managing of the house

222
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:04,480
 and he's easily disposed of. But Christ demands Lordship in our homes and in our

223
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,720
 lives where he just takes over and has control in everything. It is interesting

224
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:17,000
 and significant to find that the word Savior is used with Jesus appears only

225
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:21,560
 20 some times in the New Testament whereas the word Lord as related to

226
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:31,280
 Jesus is used over 500 times. The ratio is 1 to 20 which is truly significant. If

227
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:36,000
 we acknowledge the Lordship of Jesus Christ at all we must obey his

228
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,440
 commandments and one of his most important commandments is the Great

229
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:50,840
 Commission. Third, the scope of the Great Commission. Every creature, all nations,

230
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:55,760
 Christ commanded his followers to go into all the world and preach the gospel

231
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:01,560
 to every creature. They were to be his witnesses unto the utmost part of the

232
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:07,680
 world. We praise God for those messengers of the gospel who in obedience to the

233
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,360
 Great Commission have gone into the regions beyond across the centuries with

234
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:18,640
 the torch of the love of God at the price of their lives. Today we in the

235
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,080
 seventies of the 20th century still have our ends of the earth where the gospel

236
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,440
 of Christ has not yet reached. Today we have the last mile to run in the race of

237
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:36,160
 world evangelization and it is a hard mile which presents a tough challenge to

238
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,120
 the faithful followers of Christ. The best in us rises to meet this challenge

239
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:47,400
 with faith and dedication. Under the grace of God our generation may be the

240
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,080
 one that has the honor and privilege of crowning the long run of world

241
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,760
 evangelization. As the chairman of the consultation and continuation committee

242
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:04,360
 of the first all-Asia mission consultation I'm glad to be able to

243
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:08,800
 report to you that more and more churches in Asian countries have been

244
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,360
 awakened to their own missionary responsibilities and they wish to join

245
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:20,520
 their Western brethren in carrying out the Great Commission. Our goal is to send

246
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:28,280
 200 new missionaries to our mission fields in '74. Let us listen to the

247
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:34,560
 missionary cry of the prophet Isaiah, "Enlarge the place of thy tent and let

248
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:41,240
 them stretch forth the curtains of thine habitations. Spare not, lengthen thy cause

249
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:47,040
 and strengthen thy states for thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the

250
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:54,320
 left." Let the chorus of this cry resound in our minds and hearts, "Lengthen thy

251
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:01,840
 cause, lengthen thy cause." Fourth, the task of the Great Commission. The first

252
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:07,000
 task in the Great Commission is to proclaim. The Lord said to his disciples,

253
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:14,800
 "Go into all the world and preach." To preach is to proclaim to the world what

254
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:21,040
 God has done through Christ. Proclamation is an essential part of the

255
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:26,680
 Great Commission. There could be no biblical evangelism without proclamation.

256
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:33,560
 Witness by presence is good, but it is not enough. Proclamation can take

257
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:39,840
 different forms, but it has got to be there. The second task in the Great

258
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,200
 Commission is to convert. The Lord said to his disciples, "Go ye therefore,

259
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,800
 baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit."

260
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:58,080
 Baptism indicates conversion. We are commissioned by Christ to convert people

261
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,000
 to him, not to the Church as an institution. Evangelism without

262
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:09,480
 conversions is not biblical evangelism. The third task in the Great Commission

263
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:15,400
 is to disciple. The Lord said to his disciples, "Go ye therefore, teach all

264
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:21,840
 nations, teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you."

265
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,600
 The task of the Great Commission does not end with baptism, but it continues

266
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:32,360
 with the ministry of teaching. The Lord has made it very clear in the Great

267
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,080
 Commission that the purpose of teaching is to observe whatsoever I have

268
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:43,960
 commanded you. There is a legitimate distinction between teaching to know and

269
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:50,000
 teaching to do. The former is studying while the latter is discipling.

270
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:55,640
 The true Christian is a disciple rather than a student. Teaching without

271
00:29:55,640 --> 00:30:02,120
 discipling is a great failure. The Great Commission moves from proclaiming to

272
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:09,200
 converting and then to discipling. Any one of the three missing is a breachment

273
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:16,040
 of the Great Commission. Fifth, the procedure of the Great Commission. Acts

274
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:21,120
 1.8 is an integral part of the Great Commission. It teaches us that

275
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,600
 Jerusalem does have a part in the Great Commission. If Jerusalem is removed, then

276
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:32,880
 the Great Commission does not have a start. But we must not end with Jerusalem.

277
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:38,160
 There are many Christians and churches that make Jerusalem both the start and

278
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:44,360
 the end of their program. They never move beyond Jerusalem. Jerusalem has become

279
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:50,000
 their outermost part of the world. What a small map and what a small vision and

280
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:56,640
 what a small heart. On the other hand, there are those Christians and churches

281
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,680
 that have neglected their Jerusalem. They think all the time of the outermost

282
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:07,080
 part of the earth and overlook the immediate need around them. The Great

283
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:12,840
 Commission commands us to attend to the foreign mission field as well as to the

284
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:20,360
 mission field that lies at our threshold. Sixth, the assurance for the Great

285
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:27,400
 Commission. The assurance for the Great Commission consists in two factors. First,

286
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:32,720
 promise. The Lord promised his disciples that he was going to be with them

287
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:38,680
 always. They enjoy his presence most when they are engaged in carrying out the

288
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:47,760
 Great Commission. What a precious comfort and encouragement. Second, authority. The

289
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:52,760
 Lord has all power in heaven and in earth and it was on the basis of this

290
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:58,280
 power and authority that he gave to his disciples the Great Commission. This

291
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:04,400
 authority guarantees the final success of the Great Commission. The power and

292
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:09,800
 authority of Christ constituted the assurance that the apostles had in their

293
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:14,960
 minds in regard to evangelism and missions. They had faith in the person

294
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,880
 power of Christ. They knew in whom they believed. For instance, in reading through

295
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:25,600
 the first epistle of John, no one can escape the impression of John's sureness

296
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:30,400
 of the person of Christ. He says in the first three verses of the first chapter,

297
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,000
 "That which was from the beginning which we have heard, which we have seen with

298
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:41,280
 our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of

299
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:47,760
 life. For the word was manifested and we have seen it and bear witness. That which

300
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:53,880
 we have seen and heard declare we unto you." These accumulated repetitions

301
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,040
 indicate the absolute sureness that John had in his mind and heart in regard to

302
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:06,440
 the person of Christ who was the center of his proclamation. In the case of the

303
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,360
 Apostle Peter, he testified to the reality and truth of his message to the

304
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:19,120
 Christians of his day by a vivid reference to his experience with Jesus

305
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:25,880
 on the Mount of Transfiguration as we find in 2 Peter 1.18. This blessed memory

306
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:31,800
 and assurance made him so zealous in evangelism and in his efforts to edify

307
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:38,520
 the saints of his day. When we think of the Apostles as a group, we are reminded

308
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:43,560
 of the scene of their first meeting with the Risen Lord as recorded in John

309
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:50,400
 chapter 20 verses 19 to 21. The first thing the Risen Lord did when he appeared

310
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:56,120
 to them was to show them his pierced hands and side. And the Bible says, "Then

311
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:01,800
 were the disciples glad." Why glad? Those who were marks of a great tragedy and

312
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:07,880
 terrible suffering that befell Jesus their beloved master. Why glad? They were

313
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:13,000
 glad because when they saw his pierced hands and side, they became assured of

314
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,080
 the reality of the Risen Lord. How can you help being glad if you know for sure

315
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:24,280
 that your Jesus is the Lord that rose from the dead victorious from sin over

316
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:31,520
 sin, death and Satan? Please note a very important sequence here. The Lord showed

317
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,680
 his pierced hands and side to his disciples before he commissioned them

318
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:43,720
 for world evangelization. He said, "As my father has sent me, so send I you."

319
00:34:43,720 --> 00:34:49,560
 Assurance precedes commission. No one wants to be commissioned for a hopeless

320
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,000
 task, but the disciples gladly accepted the Lord's commission because they knew

321
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,520
 who gave it to them. I'm sure whenever they suffered trials, difficulties and

322
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,840
 persecution later on in their task of evangelism, they would recall the pierced

323
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:11,840
 hands and side which they had seen with their own eyes and would be comforted

324
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:19,120
 and strengthened. This indelible memory meant two things to them. They were

325
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,400
 assured of the reality of their message about the Risen Lord and they were

326
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:28,720
 constrained by the great love represented by those marks of unspeakable

327
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,960
 suffering of the Lord. That is enough for them and enough for us. The Risen Lord

328
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:41,160
 said to the disciples, "Peace be unto you." It is interesting to notice that these

329
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,040
 precious words were repeated in the following verse. I'm sure that this

330
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:52,040
 repetition is significant. In these three verses we find three things which

331
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:57,720
 happened in immediate succession. The first, "Peace be unto you," the showing of

332
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:03,160
 the pierced hands and side, and the second, "Peace be unto you." Evidently, the

333
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:08,160
 second, "Peace be unto you," has especially to do with the assurance that came with

334
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:14,080
 the showing of the pierced hands and side. Objectively, only the Risen Lord can

335
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:19,640
 give us real peace. Subjectively, only our assurance of the reality of the

336
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:24,800
 resurrection of the Lord can produce real peace in our hearts. Who can have

337
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,020
 peace of heart if he has given his whole life to a cause in which he has only a

338
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:36,380
 shaky confidence? But all of us can dedicate our lives with rejoicing to the

339
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:43,840
 cause of Christ whose final victory is absolutely assured. The Apostle John had

340
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:48,200
 a very interesting and significant experience as recorded in the book of

341
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,800
 Revelation. He was given to see the vision of the victory of Christ. In

342
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,440
 chapter 4, he sees God on his throne with the whole plan of salvation

343
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,040
 unfolded before him. And in this glorious vision, a cry of victory pealed in the

344
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:12,120
 sky, "Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, he hath prevailed."

345
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:18,720
 Revelation 5, 5. What a glorious proclamation. John looked around expecting

346
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,520
 to see a strong lion, but instead he saw a lamb that was slain. Two opposite images

347
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,760
 are united in God's wonderful plan, a lion and a lamb. The lion is the lamb and

348
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,400
 the lamb is the lion. The power of God's lion lies exactly in the weakness of

349
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:44,600
 God's lamb that was slain. The New English Bible says in Revelation 5, 6,

350
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:51,280
 "A lamb with the marks of slaughter upon him." Evidently, these marks refer to the

351
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,360
 prints of nails in his hands and feet. John saw the lamb take over the scroll

352
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:02,080
 with his pierced hand. It is the pierced hand that can open the sealed scroll of

353
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:08,000
 the plan of God and bring it to pass. It is the pierced hand that touched John

354
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,740
 when he fell on the ground as dead and raised him to life again. It is the

355
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:19,200
 pierced hand that holds the key of hell and death. It is the pierced hand that

356
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,280
 holds the key of David. It openeth and no man shuddeth. It is the pierced hand that

357
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,680
 holds the seven stars which are the leaders of the seven churches. In one

358
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:37,280
 word, it is the pierced hand that can carry through the whole plan of God. When

359
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,800
 John saw this vision, I'm sure his whole outlook was changed. He took heart in

360
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:47,640
 face of terrible persecution. All the things that he had suffered for Christ

361
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,960
 began to take on a new meaning and they became so precious to him. It is

362
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,480
 interesting to notice in Revelation 1, 12 that John turned around and saw the

363
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:05,640
 vision of the Lord in glory. Indeed, we have to turn from our outward situation

364
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,640
 and look to the Lord before we can have a new vision and this vision will turn

365
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:16,440
 everything around. It always does us good to turn away from our immediate

366
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:22,720
 circumstances and take a good look at the victorious Lord who holds everything

367
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,360
 in his hand. We all remember that after the Apostles were threatened by the

368
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:33,680
 authorities of the city of Jerusalem, they went back to their own company and

369
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:38,960
 lifted their voice to God with one accord and said, "Lord, thou hast made

370
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,360
 heaven and earth and the sea and all that in them is. Who by the mouth of thy

371
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:49,640
 servant David has said, 'Why did the heathen rage and the people imagine vain

372
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:55,120
 things?' The kings of the earth stood up and the rulers gathered together against

373
00:39:55,120 --> 00:40:00,920
 the Lord and against his Christ. For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom

374
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:06,440
 thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the

375
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:11,680
 people of Israel, were gathered together for to do whatsoever thy hand and thy

376
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,280
 counsel determined before to be done. And now, Lord, behold their threatenings and

377
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,720
 grant unto thy servants that with all boldness they may speak thy word. And

378
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:28,160
 when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together

379
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,760
 and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and they spoke the word of God

380
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:40,720
 with boldness." Acts 4 verses 23 to 31. Here the apostles were sure of three

381
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:46,640
 things. First, God is the maker of heaven and earth and everything is in his

382
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:53,080
 control. Second, God foretold what was going to happen and it has happened. And

383
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:59,680
 third, God is going to carry through all his plan. This threefold assurance

384
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,360
 resulted in joy and boldness. As they prayed with this assurance, God echoed to

385
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:12,240
 their faith by shaping the place where they were assembled. Boldness is what we

386
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:17,800
 need today. Boldness to proclaim the gospel of the all-sufficiency of Christ

387
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:23,440
 in a cynical and humanistic age like ours. Boldness to ask for greater things

388
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,200
 to be done for God. Boldness to make larger plans for God. Boldness to make

389
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,760
 greater sacrifice for his kingdom. But this boldness comes from assurance. The

390
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,040
 Lord called his disciples a little flock. This little flock of the apostles were

391
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:47,480
 naturally afraid of the formidable task before them, but they took courage when

392
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:52,280
 they heard the Lord say to them, "Fear not, little flock, for it is your Father's

393
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:59,600
 pleasure to give you the kingdom." They were comforted and emboldened because

394
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:07,920
 they knew what was going to happen. They were going to inherit the kingdom of God.

395
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,680
 The Apostle Paul, writing to Timothy from a prison in Rome, said, "I suffer trouble

396
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,440
 even to bonds, but the word of God is not bound." Second Timothy 2.9. Paul looked

397
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:25,880
 beyond his bonds and saw the spread wings of the gospel. He was sure of the

398
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:31,480
 expansion of the church under the power of God. Then he goes on to say in verse

399
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:38,960
 12, "If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him." It sounds strange to

400
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,280
 talk about reigning in a prison, but all this becomes normal when seen in the

401
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,760
 light of his assurance. Paul expresses the same assurance in his epistle to the

402
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:54,800
 Philippines, "But I would ye understand, brethren, that the things which happen

403
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:00,440
 unto me have fallen out rather unto the furtherance of the king of the gospel, so

404
00:43:00,440 --> 00:43:05,040
 that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places.

405
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:10,680
 And many of the brethren of the Lord, waxing confident by my bonds, are much

406
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:16,680
 more bold to speak the word without fear." Philippians 1.18. "Even as all things

407
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:22,320
 work together for good to them that love God, so do all things work together for

408
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:27,960
 the furtherance of the gospel." In regard to world evangelization, the Lord said to

409
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:33,880
 his disciples that his gospel would be preached in all the world. Matthew 24.14.

410
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:39,120
 These words all sounded incredible at the time when they were

411
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:45,440
 spoken, but they have been wonderfully fulfilled today before our own eyes. God

412
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,760
 has seen to it that it is done. He has raised up faithful Christians as his

413
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:58,000
 instruments to carry out his plan. Even our faithfulness is a work of his

414
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,440
 faithfulness in fulfilling his promises. The assurance of the apostles is also

415
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,800
 ours. Jesus Christ, our risen Lord, stands behind the Great Commission which he has

416
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:18,360
 given us. Let us march on with assurance and dedication from victory to victory

417
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:26,720
 until the dawning of the glorious day of consummation of God's plan of salvation.
