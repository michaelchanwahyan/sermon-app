[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   (music)
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.540]   Hello brothers and sisters
[00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.500]   I am Fr. Cuan Shui-min
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.100]   teaching at the Church of St. George's
[00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.440]   Today I am introducing a book
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.280]   written by a French theologian
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.080]   Jean-Luc Nantz
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.120]   The book is called
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.780]   "Disenclosure, the Deconstruction of Christianity"
[00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.360]   The author is a prominent European theologian
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.220]   Although this book is about Christianity
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.000]   it is not a book on the theology of Christ
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.900]   and it is not a book to defend Christianity
[00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.240]   or to oppose Christianity
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   Nantz's main purpose
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.580]   is to put Christianity
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.180]   in the context of Western history
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.580]   Western culture and civilization
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.680]   to explore and examine
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.060]   the characteristics of Christianity
[00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.160]   Through these characteristics
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.020]   we can see that
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.220]   when Western civilization and modernity
[00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.760]   are in a state of closure and disintegration
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.300]   how can Christianity
[00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.200]   open up a new way of thinking?
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.480]   What does a normal person believe?
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.740]   A normal person believes that
[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.940]   Christianity is a God
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.840]   whom we believe to be high above
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.880]   a God who is extremely high
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.960]   and worthy of worship
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.620]   Therefore, I think that for many people
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.660]   Christianity is a relationship with God
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.800]   or we follow His words
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.200]   read the Bible
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.000]   or follow the Bible
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.540]   Nantz felt that this kind of understanding of Christianity
[00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.380]   was not without reason
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.220]   but was rather shallow
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.360]   and could not grasp the very important essence of Christianity
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.560]   He mentioned that what is faith?
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.860]   Faith is a relationship
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.600]   between life and nothingness
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.100]   and nothingness is not a negative meaning
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.540]   not a negative meaning
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.140]   but a meaning of
[00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.280]   "infinite openness"
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.520]   To use an analogy
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.020]   this "infinite openness" is like
[00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.720]   when Abraham left his family
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.660]   to enter a very open but unknown land
[00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.600]   Therefore, faith is not about beliefs
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.400]   nor about beliefs
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.440]   but about the journey we can embark on
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.240]   What does the book "This Enclosure" mean?
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.680]   I have seen a good translation of this in Chinese
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.180]   It is translated as "解圍"
[00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.420]   "解" means to open, to loosen, to surround
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.060]   or to seal
[00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.560]   So what does "解圍" mean?
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.940]   What does "this enclosure" mean?
[00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.700]   It means to seal up
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:19.740]   to surround and loosen
[00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:25.620]   Specifically, it means to seal up
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.820]   or to seal up the world view
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.120]   How can we loosen it up?
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.120]   Nazi thought that the essence of Christianity
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.700]   was the so-called "this enclosure"
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.660]   which is the essence of the unsealing of the world
[00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.500]   The title of this book is
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.440]   "The Construction of Christianity"
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.380]   in Chinese, it means "the deconstruction of Christianity"
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.080]   The meaning of "this enclosure" is not to destroy Christianity
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.960]   nor to overthrow Christianity
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.860]   What does "this enclosure" mean?
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.120]   It means that Nazi used his analysis
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.800]   and his discovery of the Christian tradition and faith
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.440]   to rediscover the internal tension and the chastity
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:24.080]   and thereby to rediscover the internal tension and chastity
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.080]   and thereby to rediscover the internal tension and the chastity
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.480]   and thereby to rediscover the internal tension and the chastity
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.820]   The deconstruction of Christianity
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:39.020]   was simply to rediscover the internal tension and chastity
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.500]   was simply to rediscover the internal tension and chastity
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.200]   and thereby to rediscover the world sense
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.440]   The term "world sense" is in hyphen
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.580]   This hyphen is very important
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:53.780]   When you read the book
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:58.440]   you may want to understand what the hyphen means
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.080]   and thereby to rediscover the world sense
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.760]   and thereby to revitalize our times
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.520]   Most importantly, he believed that
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.820]   the world sense was not a rational
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.900]   or a belief or a Bible
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.540]   Nazi believed that this deconstruction
[00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.600]   could be a very powerful framework
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.900]   to face the current time
[00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.120]   and to use a new perspective to understand the world
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:42.260]   and to rediscover the world sense
[00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.660]   in this uncertain but prosperous world
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:50.160]   However, Nazi was not so one-sided
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.400]   In this book, he found that
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.900]   Christianity has two sides
[00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.980]   On the one hand, we know that
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:02.380]   in the history of Christianity
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.880]   Christianity has often been very rigid
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   On the other hand, Nazi found that
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.920]   Christianity has a tradition and history
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:14.320]   that are indeed open-minded
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.560]   and often strive for the future
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.360]   at the critical moments of history
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.560]   and to make a difference in the present
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.560]   so that we can go back to the way we were
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:30.140]   and have the courage to leave our own family
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:31.940]   We can say that
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.480]   Nazi's attitude towards Christianity
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.140]   is actually quite complicated
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.140]   It is both positive and negative
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:46.780]   This shows the exquisite point of view of Nazi
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:52.920]   Let's take a look at the logic of this book
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.400]   First, we find that
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.100]   Nazi was analyzing Western culture
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.260]   When he analyzed Western culture
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.040]   or when he started the Enlightenment movement
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.340]   he thought that reason was the only way to solve human problems
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:10.340]   However, when he came to this day
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.780]   he found that this method
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.080]   had reached the end of his life
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.980]   Although reason is very important
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:21.820]   he found that reason could not cover
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.020]   many complex aspects of life
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.360]   Therefore, if we see reason as the only way to solve problems
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.700]   our life will be left with many blank spaces
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.800]   which are easily filled with dangerous ideologies
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.640]   which have led to many crises in history
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.640]   or even disasters
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.980]   For example, violence
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.520]   or the hard to allow differences
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.480]   or the rejection of others
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:57.220]   or the Marxism-Leninism
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.720]   or the authoritarianism
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:02.200]   or the opportunism of the market
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.600]   There are many difficulties in human history
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.400]   including the origin of the rich
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.940]   and the growing gap between power
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:15.940]   Nazi thought that if we want to face these challenges
[00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:21.740]   we must face and embrace the mystery and the mystery
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:23.720]   Of course, in this so-called
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.220]   "pure rationality" and "respectful" area
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.620]   Nazi never advocated the return of religion
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.720]   and did not advocate the so-called "return of the religious"
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.800]   because he thought that the return of religion
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.300]   would only bring trouble to humanity
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:45.240]   like throwing a stone at your own feet
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:50.780]   So, Nazi urged us to face and embrace the mystery
[00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:53.480]   in the Western Christianity
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.620]   and the Christian "disenclosure"
[00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:01.460]   which has existed inside
[00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:07.160]   This book has been a great source of inspiration
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:09.960]   for us to read
[00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:14.600]   The author suggested that we start with two chapters
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.100]   One is called "Atheism and Monotheism"
[00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:27.680]   and the other is called "The Construction of Monotheism"
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.480]   The two chapters can roughly explain
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.880]   the basic concept of the book
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.760]   What does this mean?
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.620]   It means that the modern atheism
[00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:42.760]   is basically born from the Christian monotheism
[00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.460]   But if there is no so-called
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:49.800]   "monotheism" in the ancient Greek philosophy
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.400]   then the Christian monotheism
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.600]   may not have appeared in history
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.340]   So, simply put, the analysis found that
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:03.180]   atheism and monotheism are not opposites
[00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:08.020]   but are in fact a complex relationship
[00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:14.360]   Both emphasize the principle of "uniqueness and supreme"
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.060]   but the two are different in how to face
[00:10:17.060 --> 00:10:22.460]   and respond to the so-called "uniqueness and supreme"
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.340]   The Christian monotheism calls this "uniqueness"
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:29.940]   and "supreme" as God
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:32.480]   At the same time, we find that
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:36.580]   this kind of God, which is seen as
[00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:40.980]   "uniqueness, supreme" and "superior"
[00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:44.020]   seems to be a stronger God
[00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:47.560]   but at the same time, it also
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:50.560]   can be colorful and unifying
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:54.560]   to experience the divine
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.400]   with the experience of "limitedness"
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.140]   in this world
[00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:02.940]   until the whole world slowly becomes "unique"
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:06.040]   and loses its "uniqueness"
[00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:09.380]   and finally the two worlds are closed
[00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.580]   Of course, God's "superiority"
[00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:16.760]   also opens up the ability to "unify"
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.320]   and thus the two worlds cannot be completely closed
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.100]   On the other hand, according to the so-called "monotheism"
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:27.440]   it is actually a product of the so-called "divine"
[00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:30.940]   emptying the divine
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.300]   What does the so-called "monotheism" like to do?
[00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:37.180]   It likes to seal the principle of "supreme"
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:43.320]   with reason, science, power, etc.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.620]   But in the end, it is also in the whole history
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.860]   to experience the so-called "meaning"
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.160]   or the wasteland of "sense" and "truth"
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.900]   Nancy believes that if we want to get rid of
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.160]   this civilized confinement
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:04.340]   we must deconstruct the "one-god" theory
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:07.740]   God is understood as a complete "duality"
[00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.780]   and it is a permanent escape
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:14.080]   from our definition or limitation
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.020]   In this sense
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:18.880]   God is not the "one-god" theory
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:21.380]   that is worshiped
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:24.020]   nor is it the "superiority" theory
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.520]   that is vigorously pursued
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:28.560]   and is to be understood
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.460]   What is the so-called "God"?
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:34.040]   God is "absence"
[00:12:34.040 --> 00:12:36.740]   God is "absence"
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.900]   But don't get me wrong
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.380]   I don't mean
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.880]   God ignores the world
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.480]   God is missing
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:47.580]   or God is free to go around the world
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:50.380]   I don't mean that
[00:12:50.380 --> 00:12:54.460]   I mean that God's presence is absence itself
[00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.620]   God's presence is absence itself
[00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:03.060]   This kind of absence is not empty
[00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:06.200]   but rather full of power
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:08.140]   full of openness
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.100]   and full of possibility
[00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:14.240]   This openness can be a space for growth
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.980]   and a new experience for the meaning, relationship
[00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.780]   and the existence of God
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.420]   Interestingly
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.180]   Nancy used the "absence theism"
[00:13:24.180 --> 00:13:27.160]   which we can translate as "absence theism"
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:29.920]   to deconstruct the "one-god" theory
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.020]   and the "one-god" theory
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:34.900]   God basically
[00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:39.500]   breaks the confinement of the main character
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.740]   God is neither the main character
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.300]   nor a subject
[00:13:44.300 --> 00:13:48.680]   but a spread of openness
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:51.180]   mystery and a convention
[00:13:51.180 --> 00:13:52.920]   We will see a few chapters
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:58.020]   about faith
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:01.560]   These chapters basically
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.660]   explore a large number of theologians
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.700]   including the reformist master Derrida
[00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:11.000]   This process shows the complexity of Christianity
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.060]   and its internal structure
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:16.940]   One of the chapters deals directly with the Gospels
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:19.400]   If you are interested in the Bible
[00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:22.340]   I am sure you will be very interested in this chapter
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.580]   because it clearly shows the activity
[00:14:25.580 --> 00:14:29.480]   and embodiment of the faith
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:32.720]   and the activity and embodiment of the faith
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:37.820]   The other chapter deals with the "disclosure of the gospel"
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.420]   It is interesting that
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:42.520]   it not only explores the "one-god" theory
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:46.800]   but also the Christian experience
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.840]   The title of the chapter is "Disclosure"
[00:14:50.840 --> 00:14:54.340]   which provides a very conclusive point of view
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:57.340]   In general, this book invites us
[00:14:57.340 --> 00:15:00.240]   to rethink our faith
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:03.240]   and allows us to discover
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.980]   that Christianity has the ability to disclose
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:09.780]   In short, "Disclosure"
[00:15:09.780 --> 00:15:11.420]   clearly illustrates the fact that
[00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.760]   the "one-god" is a kind of openness
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:20.020]   God is both presence and absence
[00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:22.360]   He is far and close
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:23.900]   He is both within our grasp
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.260]   and beyond our grasp
[00:15:27.260 --> 00:15:29.900]   This book is a philosophical book
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.000]   but I believe that for those who love faith
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.600]   and reflect on the Gospels
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.500]   you will find that this book
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.980]   is surprising and insightful
[00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:43.320]   at the same time, it is challenging
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:47.020]   but also very hopeful
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.280]   I hope you will like this book
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:55.020]   [music]
