00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:13,600
 [Cantonese] Hello everyone, I am Dr. Chan Wing Chiu. I am a teacher at the Hong Kong Chinese University, Tung Kee School, Sha Lek College.

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,600
 I am very happy to be here to introduce to you a book that has a great influence on me.

4
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,600
 I am holding this book in my hand because I don't have a physical copy,

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:34,600
 so I have a book for you to see. It is called "Mere Discipleship" by Lee Kam.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:41,600
 I will share with you the content of this book and its influence on me.

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,600
 The name of this book is "Mere Discipleship".

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:50,600
 Unfortunately, I introduced it in Chinese, but the original version of this book is only in English.

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,600
 It does not have a Chinese translation.

10
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:00,600
 But I have thought about how to translate this book.

11
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,600
 I thought of another book.

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:06,600
 Our readers may remember it.

13
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:11,600
 C.S. Lewis wrote a book called "Mere Christianity".

14
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,600
 The book was published in 1952, so the readers may have some impression.

15
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:23,600
 "Mere Christianity" has a Chinese translation.

16
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,600
 It is called "The Return of the Rebellion".

17
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,600
 I think this book is very interesting.

18
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,600
 Because the same word is used in the same book as Lee Kam's book.

19
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,600
 It is called "Mere".

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,600
 If the two words are similar,

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,600
 if I use the idea of Lewis to translate this book,

22
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:53,600
 it will be translated as "The Return of the Rebellion".

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 The word "Mere" is related to "religion".

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:10,600
 So we can recall that the author Lee Kam hoped to return to the origin of "The Return of the Rebellion".

25
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:16,600
 Let's re-experience the concept of the "Mere" again.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:23,600
 When this book was published, it was very useful to me.

27
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:30,600
 I remember in 2016, I was preparing a new course in Chong Kee.

28
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,600
 It is related to "The Return of the Rebellion".

29
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:38,600
 When I was looking for this topic, I faced a problem.

30
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,600
 Although I have been a pastor for decades,

31
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,600
 and I have done many "Mere" courses,

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,600
 I think that in terms of the concept of "The Return of the Rebellion",

33
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,600
 our course can be much more, and the training books can be much more.

34
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,600
 But I think that as time goes by,

35
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,600
 the people's concept of "The Return of the Rebellion" is a bit confused.

36
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:02,600
 So at this turning point, I came across this book by Lee Kam.

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,600
 He is going to "repeat" "The Return of the Rebellion".

38
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:10,600
 He is going to use this book to point out the problems.

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:15,600
 He is going to use this book to point out the problems.

40
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,600
 At that time, I had many questions, but I didn't know how to express them.

41
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:26,600
 But this book helped me in terms of history and ideas.

42
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,600
 It allowed me to find some words to express,

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,600
 and it helped me to be more fulfilled in my course.

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
 Before talking about the background of this book,

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:47,600
 Lee Kam is a professor in a university in Tennessee,

46
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,600
 which is in the middle of the United States.

47
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,600
 This university is not very famous.

48
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
 It is a Christian university, but its history is very long.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,600
 The name of the university is Lipscomb,

50
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,600
 which is a name of a person.

51
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:14,600
 David Lipscomb was a famous person in Tennessee.

52
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,600
 He appeared in the post-war period of the U.S.S.S.

53
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,600
 He thought that the U.S.S.S. was a very interesting country

54
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,600
 because it was a Christian country.

55
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:31,600
 But when the war broke out, the soldiers in the north and south were all Christians.

56
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,600
 He felt that this was not right,

57
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:39,600
 so he stood up and opposed the war.

58
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,600
 He felt that as Christians, we should have a Christian sense of values.

59
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:52,600
 So he fought against the idea of war from the perspective of God,

60
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:58,600
 and he stood up to oppose the war.

61
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,600
 The war ended soon after,

62
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,600
 and he was very popular.

63
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,600
 He founded a university called David Lipscomb,

64
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,600
 which is still very active today.

65
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,600
 Lee Kam is a professor in this university.

66
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
 He also wants to embody the same idea.

67
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 The source of this book is to re-think God's perspective

68
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,600
 from all perspectives,

69
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,600
 from all political parties,

70
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
 from all political parties,

71
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,600
 and to re-think the picture of the door.

72
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,600
 When you read this book,

73
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,600
 you will see that it is very powerful and inspiring.

74
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,600
 It uses the story of the two tribes of Luangta

75
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,600
 who slaughtered each other as a start.

76
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
 It is very bloody.

77
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,600
 It talks about two tribes fighting each other.

78
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,600
 Why does he use this example?

79
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
 At that time, the United Nations considered Luangta

80
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,600
 as the most Christian country.

81
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,600
 More than 90% of people said they were Christians.

82
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,600
 But during the process of Luangta,

83
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
 Lee Kam said,

84
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,600
 "How can a Christian citizen

85
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,600
 be a believer,

86
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,600
 and they can stab their neighbor

87
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:39,600
 and slaughter him?"

88
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,600
 He used this bloody example to raise this question.

89
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,600
 As Christians,

90
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,600
 where is our value?

91
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
 If we are the door,

92
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,600
 where is the idea of the door?

93
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,600
 He went on to pursue this idea.

94
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,600
 Once he pursued this idea,

95
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,600
 he went from bad to worse.

96
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,600
 He went back to the history of the Church.

97
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:09,600
 In 321,

98
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:13,600
 when Constantine was the Roman Emperor,

99
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,600
 he was 32 years old.

100
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,600
 He knew Jesus and had faith.

101
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,600
 From that time on,

102
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,600
 Christianity no longer needed to hide

103
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,600
 in a hidden place.

104
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:33,600
 Because the Emperor claimed to have faith in Christianity.

105
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,600
 But in this matter,

106
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
 the reflection until today,

107
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,600
 what happened?

108
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,600
 The Church was raised up.

109
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,600
 The perspective of God was lowered.

110
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
 This is the situation.

111
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,600
 I will repeat it again.

112
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,600
 In the 4th century,

113
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,600
 the perspective of the Church was raised up.

114
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,600
 The perspective of God was lowered.

115
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,600
 Why did the perspective of the Church appear?

116
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,600
 Because the Emperor was the Golden Lord.

117
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,600
 The Emperor was the Descendant.

118
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,600
 The Christianity could have a system

119
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:17,600
 and a religion in an open place.

120
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,600
 Even the King of the Church,

121
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,600
 the country and the religion

122
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:23,600
 would not be separated.

123
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,600
 All of a sudden,

124
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,600
 the status of religion was raised up.

125
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:34,600
 The people used their political and economic thinking

126
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:38,600
 to build up their faith.

127
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
 In the past 1700 years,

128
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,600
 we did not consider this issue.

129
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,600
 Many times, the growth of the Church,

130
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,600
 the revival of the Church, etc.

131
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,600
 were short-lived and not done enough.

132
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,600
 Including Martin Luther's Reformation,

133
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:59,600
 he had a system of Catholicism.

134
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,600
 He had a so-called "Faithful and Pure"

135
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,600
 when he entered the new Catholic system.

136
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,600
 He did not change the system.

137
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,600
 He just introduced a different system,

138
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
 a Catholic system,

139
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,600
 into the new Catholic system.

140
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
 In this book,

141
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,600
 Lee Kam reflects on history

142
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
 and helps us to reflect.

143
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:32,600
 We cannot go back to 10, 20 or 30 years ago.

144
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,600
 We have to go back to a very early period.

145
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,600
 The Church was raised up.

146
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,600
 In this book, he helps us to reflect.

147
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:45,600
 He gives us a diagnosis,

148
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
 a diagnosis, a name of the disease.

149
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:53,600
 In this case, he calls it "Post-Tandem White Psycho".

150
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,600
 If a person is a "Post-Tandem White Psycho",

151
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,600
 he is not clear about the things around him.

152
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,600
 He is very self-centered.

153
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,600
 He develops the content of this book from this aspect.

154
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,600
 The book is divided into three parts.

155
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,600
 The first part is about the first part.

156
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,600
 The second part is about the history of the Church.

157
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
 He gives many examples up to now.

158
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,600
 The third part is about how we can re-form

159
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,600
 and how we can jointly develop

160
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,600
 the "Post-Tandem White Psycho"

161
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:36,600
 and return to the truth of the "Post-Tandem White Psycho".

162
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,600
 Thank you for having the opportunity to explore this book.

163
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,600
 I am very happy to give you a brief introduction.

164
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,600
 Thank you.

165
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,180
 (upbeat music)

166
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,760
 (upbeat music)
