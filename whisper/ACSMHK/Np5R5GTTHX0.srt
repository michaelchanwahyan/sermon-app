00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The subject for our meditation this morning before the throne of grace is seven visions of spiritual fire in the Bible.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Seven visions of spiritual fire in the Bible.

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Now today we are living in an age of fire.

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:29,000
The fire of wars, the fire of carnal desires.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:37,000
It is the will of God that we as his children should be in possession of a different kind of fire.

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The fire of faith, the fire of prayer, the fire of dedication, the fire of hope and above all the fire of the Holy Spirit.

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:04,000
It is with this kind of spiritual fire that we are able to overcome the carnal fires and the worldly fires.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:16,000
We find at least seven visions of spiritual fire in the Bible which are full of significance and meaning for the Christian life.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
And this morning we are going to have a brief study of them.

10
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In the first place there is the vision of the fire of the glory of God.

11
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Will you please turn to your Bibles to the book of Ezekiel chapter 1 verses 26 to 28.

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Ezekiel 1 verses 26 to 28.

13
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I am reading from King James Version which may be of use with you but in use with me.

14
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Beginning with verse 26.

15
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:08,000
And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone.

16
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
And upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.

17
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:26,000
And I saw as the color of amber as the appearance of fire round about within it from the appearance of his loins even upward.

18
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:37,000
And from the appearance of his loins even downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about.

19
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:46,000
As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain so was the appearance of the brightness round about.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:53,000
This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord.

21
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Now we find here that the two most outstanding factors of this vision of the glory of the Lord are the fire and the rainbow.

22
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:12,000
As you know the fire is symbolic of the holiness and judgment and righteousness of God.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,000
While the rainbow represents the grace of God.

24
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:27,000
So the righteousness and the grace of God or the fire and the rainbow constitute the glory of God.

25
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:46,000
And it is most important for us to find in the book of Ezekiel that this vision of the glory of the Lord brought about the greatest turning point in the life and ministry of the prophet Ezekiel.

26
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,000
This vision changed his whole life and his whole outlook.

27
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Ever since he saw this vision the glory of the Lord became the motivating power in his life.

28
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:10,000
And he began to have a longing for the realization of the glory of God in the lives of his own people.

29
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:17,000
He came to see everything in the light of the glory of the Lord.

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:29,000
For instance in the book of Ezekiel the vision of the glory of the Lord is immediately contrasted to three things.

31
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:36,000
First to the abominations and temple of God in Jerusalem.

32
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Second to the sins of the common people.

33
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And third to the evil doings of the officials of the leaders of the people.

34
00:04:46,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now this sharp contrast reveals the ugliness of the sins of the people of Israel to him in his true perspectives.

35
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:13,000
In chapter 8 verse 2 we read, "I beheld and lo, a likeness as the appearance of fire."

36
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Now this is the vision of the glory of God.

37
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,000
And then immediately we read in the following verse, verse 3.

38
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,000
The spirit brought me in the vision of the Lord to Jerusalem to the door of the inner gate,

39
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,000
where was the seat of the image of jealousy which provoketh to jealousy.

40
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Now this refers to the abominations in the house of God.

41
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Again in chapter 9 verse 3, the vision of the glory of the Lord is immediately followed a description of the sins of the common people.

42
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The same pattern occurs in chapter 10 verse 20 and onward.

43
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:07,000
So this failure made Ezekiel's heart very very heavy.

44
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Because all these things contradicted the glory of the Lord.

45
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:21,000
We find the burdened heart of Ezekiel in chapter 3 verses 14 and 15.

46
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Verse chapter 3 verses 14 and 15.

47
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:35,000
And I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, but the hand of the Lord was strong on me.

48
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Then I came to them of the captivity, and I sat where they sat, and remained astonished among them seven days.

49
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Now please notice the words bitterness, the heat of my spirit, astonished.

50
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Now these are words charged with deep emotions which have risen from a mixed source.

51
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:15,000
From his indignation against the sinful ways of his own people, from his reluctance to proclaim to them God's judgment on them,

52
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:22,000
and from his deep desire to save them from the coming calamities.

53
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Now all this is the outcome of his vision of the glory of God.

54
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:37,000
There was created in his heart a strong desire to pass on this vision of the glory of God to his own people,

55
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:46,000
and correct the things that acted against the glory of God.

56
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,000
The vision of the glory of God not only changed the life and ministry of Ezekiel,

57
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:59,000
but indeed it has changed the life of everyone that saw it as recorded in the Bible.

58
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:07,000
The apostle Paul saw it on his way to Damascus, and he fell to the ground.

59
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He rose up a completely different man.

60
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,000
His outward eyes were blinded, but his inner eyes were opened.

61
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Saul fell, but Paul rose.

62
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Peter, John, and James saw the glory of God on the Mount of Transfiguration,

63
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,000
and there he fell on their faces, and Peter said, "It is good to be here."

64
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:41,000
There was created in their minds and hearts a strong desire to abide with the Lord of Glory.

65
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:52,000
John the Baptist saw the vision of the glory of God, and he said, "He must increase, and I must decrease."

66
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,000
John the Apostle saw the glory of God on the Isle of Patmos,

67
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:03,000
and he sang victory in face of trials and persecution.

68
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Steven saw the glory of God when he was being stoned to death by the angry Jews,

69
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,000
and then his heart was filled with divine love,

70
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
and he prayed the same kind of prayer as the Lord did on the cross,

71
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and he expressed the most wondrous victory over bitterness of heart and death.

72
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:35,000
So the vision of the glory of God did wondrous things to them,

73
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
and it will do the same thing for us.

74
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It is also interesting to find in the book of Ezekiel 9, verse 4,

75
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:53,000
that there were people in the city of Jerusalem who wept for the iniquities of that city,

76
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,000
and on their foreheads the messenger of God made a special mark

77
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:05,000
to indicate that they were favored people of God.

78
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,000
They were the people that had the same heart of God as God.

79
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
They had the heart of God.

80
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:16,000
They hated the things that God hated,

81
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,000
and they loved the things that God loved.

82
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,000
We find three special kinds of people in the Bible

83
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,000
on whose foreheads God has made a special mark

84
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:35,000
to indicate that they have special relationship with God.

85
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,000
We find them in the book of Revelation, chapter 3, verse 12.

86
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:45,000
We are told here that they are the people that obey the word of God.

87
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:52,000
They have entered into the doors of opportunity as the Lord opens it for them.

88
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:58,000
They have become the pillars of the house of God,

89
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,000
having made great contributions to the cause of Christ.

90
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:09,000
We find these people in the book of Revelation, chapter 14, the first verses.

91
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:14,000
These are the people who have followed Jesus Christ all the way,

92
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,000
who have dedicated their lives to the Lord without any reservation.

93
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Again, we find them in Ezekiel, chapter 9, verse 4, which we just mentioned,

94
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,000
and they are the people who have the heart of God in them,

95
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,000
who wept for the iniquities of the people of God in the city of Jerusalem,

96
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:45,000
hating what God hated, loving what God loved.

97
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:50,000
We pray that we may have a share of their experience.

98
00:11:50,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The second vision is the vision of the burning bush,

99
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:06,000
or the vision of the fire of continual burning zeal for God.

100
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,000
We find this vision in Exodus, chapter 3, verses 1 to 5.

101
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Now here we have the vision that God gave to Moses,

102
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:24,000
the vision of a bush burning with fire, yet not consumed by the fire.

103
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
This vision has a threefold significance.

104
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,000
In the first place, it is symbolic of God's preserving power and grace for his people.

105
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The bush represents the people of God,

106
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:43,000
while the fire represents persecution and trial.

107
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:50,000
The people of God were going through fiery persecutions and trials in the land of Egypt,

108
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,000
but God preserved them.

109
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:58,000
God was able to preserve them from all this.

110
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:05,000
In the second place, this vision was not only true with the people of Israel at the time of Moses,

111
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,000
but also true with the whole history of the people of Israel.

112
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Again and again, down through the centuries,

113
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,000
the people of Israel have gone through fiery persecutions in history.

114
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:30,000
And it is nothing short of a miracle that they have not been wiped out of history completely.

115
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
God has preserved them.

116
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:38,000
In Hong Kong, my heart was greatly encouraged

117
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:49,000
as I watched the news on the TV about the parade of Christians in the streets in the city of Moscow, Russia.

118
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Thousands and thousands of Christians joined the parade,

119
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,000
among whom were many young people,

120
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,000
in spite of pressure and persecution.

121
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,000
God is able, God is able to preserve his people.

122
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:12,000
God has preserved over 10,000 churches in Russia.

123
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Last February, I was in West Germany at invitation to speak at meetings during what they called the Missions Week,

124
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,000
one week in the south and another in the north.

125
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:31,000
And during that time I stayed with the Lutheran pastor of the state church.

126
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,000
This pastor has written a book about the situation of Christians in Russia.

127
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,000
And I asked him a question.

128
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
I said, "How many Christians do you think are there in Russia?

129
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
20 millions?"

130
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,000
He said, "No, there must be 50 millions of them."

131
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,000
I was surprised to hear that.

132
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,000
God is able, God is able to preserve his people

133
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
under any circumstance.

134
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Two years ago, a member of my church, a young man,

135
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,000
went to a seminary to train as a full-time Christian worker.

136
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:19,000
The main factor in his decision to become a full-time Christian worker

137
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
was his experience in South China.

138
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Now over two years ago, he went to Canton, South China,

139
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,000
to visit his relatives there.

140
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
And he managed to bring with him nine Bibles.

141
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
He got them through.

142
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:40,000
And there he gave them to his relatives and his friends.

143
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:46,000
To his great surprise, he discovered that the young people in Canton

144
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,000
were very responsive to the gospel.

145
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
So he made three trips in a few months' time.

146
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
He experienced the gospel as the power of God unto salvation.

147
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,000
As a result of this experience,

148
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:11,000
he made up his mind to become a full-time Christian worker.

149
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Again I say, God is able.

150
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:19,000
In the third place, this version is also symbolic of God's

151
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
provision for the personal need of Moses.

152
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
God enabled Moses to serve him with continued burning zeal.

153
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Moses had a burning love for God and for his fellow people.

154
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:39,000
He loved God and he loved his fellow people.

155
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,000
He served them faithfully.

156
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
He burned in all his service.

157
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:55,000
God sustained his burning zeal for him during those 40 long years.

158
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:02,000
He was kept faithful to God during that time, all that time.

159
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:07,000
God preserved his burning zeal for him.

160
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:12,000
A number of years ago, I went to Tokyo for meetings.

161
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Now after one of the meetings, a Chinese gentleman came up to speak to me.

162
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
I never dreamed that I would meet him there.

163
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,000
He was one of my schoolmates during our junior high school days

164
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,000
in our hometown in north China, Qingdao City.

165
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:37,000
Then he told me the wonderful story of his conversion

166
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:44,000
in which I saw the fire of zeal in witnessing for the Lord.

167
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
When the war broke out between China and Japan,

168
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,000
he fled away from our hometown in the north

169
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
and went further and farther and farther south

170
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,000
until he settled down in the city of Canton

171
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
in the southernmost province of China.

172
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
There he entered into a medical college.

173
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
When he was a third year medical student,

174
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
he was down with a serious case of TB.

175
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Then because of further developments of the war,

176
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,000
he was transferred to another hospital further inland

177
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,000
where after close examination,

178
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:30,000
he was laid aside as a hopeless case of TB.

179
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:36,000
He was laid in a special room waiting for death.

180
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,000
But there, every morning, a doctor, a Christian doctor,

181
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
came to see him to pray for him.

182
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,000
And one day, the doctor knelt down by his bedside and prayed for him.

183
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
And after he had left,

184
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:57,000
he noticed that his bedside was wet with tears.

185
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:00,000
He was deeply moved as well as puzzled.

186
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
He thought to himself,

187
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:07,000
"This doctor is no relative of mine, nor a friend.

188
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Why should he have prayed for me like this?"

189
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,000
He was deeply moved, and his heart was opened,

190
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
and he accepted Jesus Christ as his personal Savior.

191
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,000
And then a great miracle happened.

192
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,000
He was completely healed in a few days' time.

193
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
And then he got up from his deathbed

194
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:36,000
and he began to witness to the Lord in the various wars.

195
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Two great miracles happened that time.

196
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,000
The first one was the miracle of healing.

197
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,000
The other, the miracle of burning love for others,

198
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:53,000
which is a greater miracle.

199
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
And I've been able to verify this fact

200
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,000
through another friend who was there during the war years.

201
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,000
He told me the name of the doctor.

202
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,000
I'm glad that it's a true story.

203
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:11,000
The third vision is the vision of the fire of sanctification

204
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:15,000
leading to renewed dedication.

205
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
The vision of the fire of sanctification

206
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,000
leading to renewed dedication.

207
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Isaiah chapter 6, verses 1 to 8.

208
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
We're all so familiar with this vision.

209
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:36,000
In this vision, the prophet Isaiah was cleansed

210
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
by a piece of burning coal from the altar.

211
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,000
And this resulted in his renewed dedication.

212
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:50,000
He cried out to God, "Here am I. Send me."

213
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Now before this experience, the prophet Isaiah

214
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
had been already serving God.

215
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
But this experience of sanctification

216
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,000
brought him into a fuller dedication,

217
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,000
a deeper fellowship with God,

218
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:14,000
a more fruitful ministry, and a more useful life.

219
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
In my study of the book Revelation,

220
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I've discovered something which has been

221
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,000
a great inspiration and help to me ever since.

222
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,000
I discovered a number of years ago

223
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,000
that in the wonderful symbolism

224
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:33,000
employed by the Holy Spirit in the book of Revelation,

225
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:40,000
God himself is represented as Jasper in chapter 4.

226
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And then in chapter 21,

227
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,000
the overall glory of the city of New Jerusalem

228
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,000
is described as Jasper.

229
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,000
And once again, the walls of the city of New Jerusalem

230
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,000
are built with Jasper.

231
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,000
And yet again, the first foundation

232
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,000
of the city of New Jerusalem is Jasper.

233
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,000
So Jasper, Jasper, Jasper, Jasper.

234
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
Now why so much of Jasper?

235
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Is it because that the apostle John

236
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
had a special fancy for Jasper?

237
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
As we all know, Jasper is symbolic

238
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
of holiness and heavenliness.

239
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:25,000
Now this symbolism teaches us that

240
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:30,000
God is holy, and everything about God is holy,

241
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,000
and we as his people must be holy too.

242
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
When we are purged of all things

243
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
that are unworthy of Christ,

244
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:44,000
we become vessels of honor,

245
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:47,000
meat for the master's use.

246
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:51,000
May God bring about this deeper experience

247
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,000
of sanctification in the lives

248
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,000
of every one of us here.

249
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,000
The fourth vision is the vision

250
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:02,000
of the fire of victory.

251
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,000
2 Kings chapter 6 verse 13.

252
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,000
2 Kings chapter 6 verse 13.

253
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
We find here that

254
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:16,000
when the prophet Elijah and his servant

255
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:20,000
were surrounded by chariots and horsemen,

256
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Elisha said to his servant,

257
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
"Fear not, for they that be with us

258
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
are more than they that be with them."

259
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,000
Then he prayed for his servant,

260
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,000
and then God opened his eyes,

261
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:38,000
and he saw chariots and horses of fire

262
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,000
round about Elisha.

263
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The same kind of vision occurred

264
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,000
when Elijah, the master of Elisha,

265
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:51,000
was caught up to God in a chariot of fire.

266
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:58,000
So this is the vision of fire by spiritual power.

267
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,000
It is most interesting to find in the Bible

268
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,000
that both Elijah and Elisha

269
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
are called by a very special name.

270
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
They are called the chariot of Israel

271
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
and the horsemen thereof.

272
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
What a wonderful name.

273
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,000
Now that is exactly what these two men of God

274
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
meant to the nation of Israel.

275
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
They brought strength and victory

276
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
to the people of God.

277
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,000
They were equivalent to thousands and thousands

278
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,000
of horsemen and chariots

279
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,000
because they were men of God,

280
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:38,000
men of faith, men of prayer,

281
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,000
men of dedication,

282
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,000
and men filled with the power of the Holy Spirit.

283
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Now I want to say emphatically today

284
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
that it is the will of God

285
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
that there should be a revival

286
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
of the spirit of Elijah

287
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,000
in the last days before the second coming

288
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,000
of Jesus Christ our Lord.

289
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,000
Now this statement is based on

290
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Revelation chapter 11 verse 3

291
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:11,000
which talks about the coming of Elijah

292
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,000
which talks about the two witnesses

293
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:17,000
one of whom is generally identified

294
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,000
as the prophet Elijah.

295
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,000
Elijah will come back again.

296
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,000
Now there are different interpretations

297
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
of the coming of Elijah into the world again.

298
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
There are people who say

299
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
Elijah will come back in person.

300
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Others say no.

301
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:40,000
Someone like Elijah will come back to the world

302
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
as in the case of John the Baptist

303
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,000
as Elijah before the first coming of the Lord.

304
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Still others say it means

305
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:55,000
a new emphasis on the witness to Christ

306
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
by the prophets of whom

307
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,000
Elijah was the chief representative.

308
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
But what I want to point out

309
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,000
emphatically this morning is this.

310
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:12,000
In any case,a revival of the spirit of Elijah is involved.

311
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,000
Let me repeat that.

312
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,000
In any case,however you interpret this verse,

313
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,000
there is one point involved.

314
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:24,000
That is,a revival of the spirit of Elijah

315
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,000
before the second coming of Jesus Christ.

316
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
So we are justified in saying

317
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,000
it is the will of God

318
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,000
that there should be,

319
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,000
there should be a revival of the spirit of Elijah

320
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,000
in these last days

321
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
before the second coming of Jesus Christ.

322
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,000
Now what is the spirit of Elijah?

323
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,000
When I think of Elijah,I think of fire.

324
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,000
The fire of his faith,

325
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,000
the fire of his prayer,

326
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,000
the fire of his dedication

327
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,000
and the fire of the Holy Spirit in his life.

328
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,000
This is exactly what we need today.

329
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:09,000
We need a revival of Elijah's spirit of faith

330
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,000
in an age of unbelief.

331
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
We need a revival of Elijah's spirit of prayer

332
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,000
in an age when praying Christians

333
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:21,000
are getting less and less,fewer and fewer.

334
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,000
We need a revival of Elijah's spirit of dedication

335
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,000
in an age when many,many Christians

336
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,000
are self-centered,

337
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
egoistically minded

338
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,000
and materialistically oriented.

339
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:41,000
We do need,we do need a call,

340
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,000
a general call,a universal call

341
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:48,000
for revival of the spirit of Elijah today

342
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
in your life and mine

343
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
and in the general life of the Christian churches

344
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:58,000
across the whole world.

345
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,000
The fifth vision is the vision of the fire of service.

346
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:07,000
We find this again in the first chapter

347
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:09,000
of the book of Ezekiel.

348
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,000
Ezekiel 1.

349
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Here we have the vision of the four living creatures.

350
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:21,000
The four living creatures represent a two-fold,

351
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
has a two-fold meaning.

352
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
In the first place,

353
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,000
it's symbolic of redeemed humanity

354
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:33,000
as exhibited in the life of Jesus Christ.

355
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
In the second place,

356
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,000
they are a special kind of angels

357
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,000
representing the ideal service of God.

358
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,000
So they represent both the redeemed humanity

359
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
as exhibited in the life of Christ

360
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:53,000
and ideal service of God.

361
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,000
Now in verse 13 of this chapter,

362
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,000
we find that there is fire

363
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,000
in the four living creatures.

364
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Two kinds of fire,

365
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,000
coal fire and lamp fire.

366
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Now coal fire is symbolic of the righteousness

367
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
and judgment of God

368
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:16,000
as explained to us in chapter 10 verse 2.

369
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,000
And the lamp fire indicates the light

370
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:24,000
that the truth of God throws into their service.

371
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:28,000
But in addition to these two meanings

372
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,000
of the fire in the four living creatures,

373
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,000
there is another meaning

374
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
which is suggested naturally to us

375
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
by this fire in the four living creatures,

376
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
and that is the fire of service,

377
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,000
which reminds us of the words of Paul,

378
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:50,000
"Servant in the spirit, serving the Lord always,"

379
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,000
according to the Chinese Bible.

380
00:29:52,000 --> 00:30:00,000
"Be fervent in spirit, serving the Lord always."

381
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
The fire of service.

382
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,000
As you know,

383
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,000
there are two kinds of special angels in the Bible,

384
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the seraphim and the cherubim.

385
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,000
The word seraphim means fire

386
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:13,000
and the word cherubim means knowledge.

387
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
And since these two kinds of angels

388
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
represent the ideal service of God,

389
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
so it is only evident

390
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:22,000
that it is the will of God

391
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,000
that there should be the combination

392
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,000
of fire and knowledge in our service for Him.

393
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
There should be a combination

394
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:36,000
of fire and knowledge in our service for God.

395
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
We do not only serve Him with cold knowledge,

396
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,000
no, but also with fire.

397
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Not only fire, but also knowledge.

398
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
Both are needed.

399
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,000
My heart is thrilled

400
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,000
whenever I see a professor of theology

401
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:55,000
preaching with real faith and conviction

402
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,000
and spirit of dedication.

403
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,000
I always praise God whenever I see that,

404
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,000
and I look for that.

405
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,000
That's the kind of people that we need today.

406
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,000
Serving God with a combination,

407
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:13,000
a precious combination of fire and knowledge.

408
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:17,000
The sixth vision is the vision of the fire of prayer.

409
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Revelation chapter 8, verses 3 to 5.

410
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,000
Revelation 8, verses 3 to 5.

411
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And another angel came and stood at the altar

412
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
having a golden censer.

413
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
And there was given unto him much incense

414
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,000
that he should offer it with the prayers

415
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
of all saints upon the golden altar

416
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,000
which was before the throne.

417
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,000
And the smoke of the incense

418
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,000
which came with the prayers of the saints

419
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:52,000
ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.

420
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,000
And the angel took the censer

421
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
and filled it with fire of the altar

422
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
and cast it into the earth.

423
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,000
And there, there were voices

424
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
and thundering, thunderings and lightnings

425
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:09,000
and an earthquake.

426
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,000
We see here an angel

427
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,000
filling the golden censer with fire

428
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:18,000
and casting it into the earth.

429
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,000
And then things begin to happen

430
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,000
in relation to the outworking,

431
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
outcarrying of God's plan of salvation on earth.

432
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,000
As you know, the golden censer

433
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,000
is symbolic of the prayer of Christ

434
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:41,000
as well as the prayer of the people of Christ.

435
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,000
We are told here that

436
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,000
when the fire of prayer is kindled

437
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,000
things begin to happen

438
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
in relation to the outcarrying

439
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
of God's plan of salvation.

440
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
So this vision teaches us

441
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,000
the most important lesson

442
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,000
that there is a close relationship

443
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:02,000
between our prayer

444
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,000
and the outcarrying of the plan of God.

445
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
I was privileged to be present

446
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,000
at Explosive 74 in Seoul, Korea.

447
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,000
And I was invited to speak

448
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:21,000
to 6,000 Korean pastors

449
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:25,000
morning after morning for four mornings.

450
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:28,000
And I remember when I arrived

451
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,000
for the third morning,

452
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
I arrived to discover

453
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,000
that the place was half empty.

454
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I wondered why.

455
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Then I was told a great, great fact.

456
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
The pastor said last night

457
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,000
600,000 Christians gathered together

458
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:50,000
for an all-night prayer meeting.

459
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Please listen.

460
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
600,000.

461
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,000
No, I have not made a mistake.

462
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,000
600,000 Korean Christians

463
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:03,000
met for an all-night prayer meeting.

464
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,000
So half of the pastors

465
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,000
were still sleeping that morning

466
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,000
when I arrived.

467
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,000
That was the first time

468
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,000
I ever thanked God

469
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,000
for a half-empty place.

470
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:21,000
A Korean pastor said to me,

471
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,000
Now, Pastor Ten,

472
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
if 600,000 Christians

473
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
have gathered to pray like that,

474
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,000
God is bound to do something special

475
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,000
not only for Korea,

476
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,000
but for the whole world.

477
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,000
I believe in it.

478
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Some people have asked me,

479
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,000
Now, what's the result of this

480
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,000
praying of the Korean Christians?

481
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,000
It has been reported

482
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,000
that the rate of the growth

483
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,000
of the Christian community in Korea

484
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
is four times faster

485
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,000
than that of the growth

486
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,000
of the population of Korea.

487
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:58,000
That's the only place in the whole world

488
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,000
that this happens,

489
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,000
four times faster

490
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,000
with the growth

491
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,000
of Christian community in Korea.

492
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Praise God for that.

493
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:12,000
This is a great testimony

494
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,000
to the whole world

495
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
and to all Christians across the world.

496
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
We are called upon

497
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:21,000
to have a revival of believing prayer

498
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,000
in these last days.

499
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,000
God needs it.

500
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:28,000
And you and I need it.

501
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
And the Church of Christ needs it.

502
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
And finally,

503
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,000
the vision of the fire of the Holy Spirit,

504
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,000
which we find in the book

505
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
Revelation chapter 4, verse 5.

506
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,000
Now, this vision is called

507
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:47,000
the vision of the seven lamps of fire

508
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:49,000
before the throne of God.

509
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,000
And the meaning of this vision

510
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,000
is explained to us clearly

511
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,000
in this verse itself.

512
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,000
This represents the seven spirits of God,

513
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,000
which in turn means

514
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:06,000
the complete ministry of the Holy Spirit.

515
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:09,000
This fire of the Holy Spirit

516
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:13,000
reminds us of the Pentecostal scene.

517
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,000
Three things happened

518
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
at the coming of the Holy Spirit

519
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,000
at Pentecost.

520
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
First, a rushing mighty wind,

521
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
symbolic of power,

522
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,000
and a strong breath of new life,

523
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,000
which the believers,

524
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
the apostles, the disciples experienced.

525
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,000
Second, there were tons, tons of fire

526
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,000
falling on the heads of the disciples,

527
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,000
representing burning witnessing for the Lord.

528
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:51,000
And third, there was the phenomena

529
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
of speaking with tongues,

530
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
which was a prophetic picture

531
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,000
of the fact that

532
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,000
under the power of the Holy Spirit,

533
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,000
the gospel of Christ would be preached

534
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,000
in all the parts of the world

535
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,000
where various tongues are spoken.

536
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:15,000
When this was first revealed to me,

537
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,000
oh, my heart was filled with praise.

538
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,000
Lord, I praise Thee

539
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:23,000
for giving us this prophetic picture

540
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
of things to happen,

541
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
things that are happening today

542
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,000
before our own eyes

543
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,000
were given to us

544
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,000
in this prophetic picture

545
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,000
two thousand years ago.

546
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,000
If we say Jesus Christ

547
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,000
is both the author and finisher of our faith,

548
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,000
then we can say the Holy Spirit

549
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,000
is both the author and finisher

550
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
of Christian missions.

551
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,000
We have nothing to fear

552
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,000
in evangelism and the missions

553
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,000
because the Holy Spirit promotes it

554
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,000
and He will finish it.

555
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,000
The Lord thinks so much of the Holy Spirit

556
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,000
that He virtually forbade His disciples

557
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,000
to start their work

558
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:15,000
before they had been endued from power on high.

559
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,000
The Lord said to His disciples,

560
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,000
"Ye shall receive power

561
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,000
after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you.

562
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,000
Then you'll be my witnesses

563
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,000
from Jerusalem right to the ends

564
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
of the earth."

565
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,000
The Lord also said something to His disciples

566
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:40,000
which at the time they could not understand.

567
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:44,000
As recorded in the book of John chapter 14, verse 12,

568
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
"The Lord said to them,

569
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,000
'The things that I do ye shall do also,

570
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,000
and greater things than these shall ye do;

571
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,000
for I go to my Father.'

572
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
The Lord went to His Father,

573
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
and the Holy Spirit came down,

574
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
and in the power of the Holy Spirit

575
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
the disciples of Jesus Christ

576
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
were enabled to do greater things

577
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,000
than Jesus Himself had done on earth.

578
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:10,000
They understood it later on.

579
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
It has been proved to be true.

580
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,000
Under the power of the Holy Spirit,

581
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,000
the gospel has spread to the ends of the world.

582
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,000
This is a testimony to us

583
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,000
to strengthen our faith today.

584
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,000
So there should be a universal call

585
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,000
for a renewed emphasis

586
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:36,000
on the power and working of the Holy Spirit

587
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,000
in our personal lives

588
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,000
as well as in the general life

589
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:42,000
of the Christian church everywhere.

590
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,000
These are the seven visions of fire

591
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:49,000
which we find in the Bible.

592
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:51,000
And it is our united prayer,

593
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,000
heartfelt prayer,

594
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:58,000
Lord, send down Thy fire on us

595
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,000
that we may continually burn for Thee.
