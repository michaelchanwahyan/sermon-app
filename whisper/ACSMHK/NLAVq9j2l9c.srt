00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:21,000
(英文) this morning we are going to conclude our study on the biblical basis of missions by taking up the fourth and last subtitle. The basis of missions in the epistles, that is, the church and missions.

(英文)

39
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:12,000
(英文)

40
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:41,000
(英文)

41
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
(英文)

42
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:48,000
(英文)

43
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:56,000
(英文)

44
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:10,000
(英文)

45
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:31,000
(英文)

46
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:38,000
(英文)

47
00:11:38,000 --> 00:12:03,000
(英文)

48
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
(英文)

49
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
(英文)

50
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
(英文)

51
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
(英文)

52
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:18,000
She is built on the living word of God, as revealed through three channels, the prophets, the apostles and above all Jesus Christ.

53
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Her building materials are all living, the living stone which is Christ as the corner stone and the living stones which are born again Christians, and the living word.

54
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:35,000
She is inhabited by the living God.

55
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Every activity in the church should aim at the building up of the members living relationship with God.

56
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Here again we see something important in regard to missions.

57
00:12:51,000 --> 00:13:02,000
The goal of missions is not merely to reproduce on the mission fields all the denominations which we have in the homelands with all their dividedness,

58
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,000
but to establish churches that are built on the pattern of the living word of God,

59
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:16,000
where sound spiritual principles are lively employed in worship, government and program.

60
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Sixth, the church as bride of Christ.

61
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,000
The apostle Paul calls the union of the church with Christ a great mystery.

62
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It is indeed a great mystery of love, of which the union of husband and wife is a symbol.

63
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:42,000
This illustration of the relationship between the church and Christ is true both corporately and individually.

64
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Corporately the church as a whole is a bride of Christ.

65
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Individually every born again Christian is a bride of Christ.

66
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Second Corinthians 11.2

67
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,000
The central point of this illustration is union in love.

68
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Love is more of the heart than the mind.

69
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:09,000
And it follows that the Christian life is more of the heart than the mind.

70
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Mind is very important and it is far from me to belittle the significance of the mind.

71
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,000
But I do want to point out that in an age that glorifies the mind,

72
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:30,000
it is very important for us Christians to keep our faith a matter of the heart rather than the head.

73
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Of course the either or approach is not ideal.

74
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
The best is both.

75
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:44,000
We need both a heart relationship with God and an understanding of the mind.

76
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
That is exactly the answer we find in the Bible.

77
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,000
I used to appreciate a question poised by a certain scholar.

78
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,000
He asks,which of the two would you prefer?

79
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,000
The seraphim which means fire or cherubim which means knowledge?

80
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:09,000
But later it dawned upon me when I was reading my Bible one day

81
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,000
that there was fire right in the center of the cherubim which means knowledge

82
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:20,000
as recorded in the first chapter of the book of Ezekiel.

83
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:28,000
So knowledge and fire are beautifully united together in the revealed word of God.

84
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:36,000
We need both the fire of the heart and the wisdom of the mind.

85
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:43,000
Evangelicals today need more training of the mind before they can meet the need today.

86
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,000
But this is done not at the expense of the deep experience of the heart.

87
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Every missionary going out to another land must have a deep heart experience of gospel truths

88
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,000
before they can pass on the living message.

89
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The mind is often localized but the heart is a universal language which everybody understands.

90
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Missionaries who go to the mission fields with degrees but without a deep heart experience with Christ

91
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:21,000
will fail and come home shattered and disillusioned.

92
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Seventh,the church as a candlestick.

93
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Paul speaks of Christians as children of light.

94
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Five,eight.

95
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Which reminds us of the apostle John's vision of the seven churches as seven candlesticks.

96
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,000
The church is meant by God to be a light in the world.

97
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,000
The light of the gospel is to shine through the church in all the world.

98
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Sunday light is still the motto of all the missionary minded churches.

99
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:57,000
It is still the chorus of the hymn of missions.

100
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Light is always outreaching and never ingrown.

101
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:10,000
Christians and churches that are torch bearers are always aggressive in evangelism and missions.

102
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,000
On the other hand,when Paul speaks of Christians as children of light,

103
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:19,000
he is thinking of their Christ-like character.

104
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:24,000
This leads us to another side of our task as light bearers,

105
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,000
which is sometimes called non-verbal witness.

106
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Verbal and non-verbal witness constitute the Christian light.

107
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
Eighth,the church as army of Christ.

108
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:48,000
The picture of the church as an army is vividly painted by Paul in Ephesians chapter 6.

109
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:57,000
The armor of this army consists of both defensive and offensive equipment and weapons.

110
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:02,000
The church is to be both defensive and offensive.

111
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
She is both conservative and progressive.

112
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,000
She defends and conserves purity of doctrine and purity of character,

113
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:17,000
but it also moves on in an offensive attack on Satan and sin,

114
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,000
as well as in an active and aggressive evangelism to bring people to God's side of the battle.

115
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Where does the church of Christ stand in an anti-traditional age like ours?

116
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
She is anti all things that are anti-Christ,

117
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:43,000
and she is most conservative in keeping the true Christian heritage.

118
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What is the true Christian heritage?

119
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,000
It is found in the Lord's letters to the seven churches in Asia Minor

120
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
as recorded in the book of Revelation chapters 2 and 3.

121
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,000
The Lord commended the victorious Christians in these churches

122
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,000
for a number of things which constitute the precious Christian heritage.

123
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
It is a sevenfold heritage.

124
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:16,000
Purity of doctrine and the first love as exemplified by the Ephesian church.

125
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Boldness and firmness in face of persecution

126
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,000
as expressed by the church at Smyrna.

127
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Good works as found in the church at Thyatira.

128
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Emphasis on spirituality rather than on form

129
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,000
as exhibited by the victorious members of the church at Sardis.

130
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:44,000
Purity of character as represented by the white garment

131
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
worn by the remnant in the church at Sardis.

132
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
Obedience and faith in evangelism and missions

133
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
as shown by the church at Philadelphia.

134
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
This sevenfold heritage is the true mainstream of Christianity

135
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,000
and it is behind this holy tradition that we firmly stand.

136
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:12,000
We have noticed that one of the seven points just mentioned above

137
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,000
is taking hold of every open door

138
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,000
and entering into it with evangelism and missions.

139
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:25,000
This is part of our great heritage and we must uphold.

140
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
As the army of Christ, let us march on with believing and bold evangelism and missions

141
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,000
to the utmost part of the world.

142
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:41,000
B. The urgency of the church's mission.

143
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:47,000
The mission of the church is urgent because in the first place

144
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,000
the gospel is the only way of salvation.

145
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
The gospel is the only way of salvation.

146
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:59,000
The apostle Paul says in his first epistle to Timothy

147
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:04,000
there is one God and one mediator between God and men

148
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,000
the man Christ Jesus who gave himself a ransom for all.

149
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
1 Timothy 2.5

150
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,000
This is in keeping with Peter's preaching when he said

151
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,000
there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved.

152
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Acts 4.12

153
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
The claim of the gospel of Christ as the only way of salvation

154
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,000
is clearly stated in the gospels and in the epistles.

155
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,000
This is what we believe and proclaim.

156
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:40,000
In an age of relativism and syncretism like ours

157
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:46,000
the voice of universalism and self-salvation is strong.

158
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:51,000
Probably the two strongest philosophies or thought forms

159
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,000
in universities all over the world today

160
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,000
are logical positivism and relativism

161
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,000
as some well-known scholars have pointed out.

162
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:08,000
The former denies the possibility of knowing things as they really are.

163
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,000
If anything is considered to be known, it is only known in the laboratory.

164
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:18,000
There is no knowledge besides scientific knowledge.

165
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Relativism tries to make everything relative.

166
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:28,000
When relative is carried into theology, it has given birth to four forms of thought.

167
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:35,000
A new conception of God, new morality, new evangelism and new secularism.

168
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:39,000
In the new concept of God, God himself is made relative.

169
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,000
Instead of the great I am, he has become the God of becoming.

170
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,000
In the new morality, morals are made relative with no absolute standard except love,

171
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,000
which in turn is left to relative and subjective interpretations.

172
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:03,000
In new evangelism, the absolute finality of Christ in salvation is made relative.

173
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:07,000
In new secularism, the sacred are made relative

174
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:13,000
and as a result we are left with a religionless Christianity.

175
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Over against this relativism, we have the biblical claim of the gospel of Christ

176
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,000
as the only way of salvation.

177
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,000
If we really believe in this absolute claim of the gospel,

178
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
we have to act in accordance with it.

179
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,000
True faith always involves action.

180
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Conviction in faith and indifference in action are never compatible with each other.

181
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,000
The logic of the urgency of evangelism and missions

182
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:49,000
is readily established by the absolute claim of the gospel.

183
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
It is becoming more and more evident

184
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:57,000
that only Bible-believing Christians are really concerned

185
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,000
with the carrying out of the Great Commission.

186
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
We all agree with Paul when he says,

187
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:07,000
"Whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."

188
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
But how do we react when we hear Paul continue to say,

189
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:16,000
"How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?

190
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:20,000
"And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?

191
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
"And how shall they hear without a preacher?

192
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,000
"And how shall they preach except they be sent?"

193
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
Shall we add here,

194
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,000
"How can we send except there are those who are willing to go?"

195
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,000
Second, loyalty and faithfulness to the Lord's Commission.

196
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,000
We find a good example for loyalty and faithfulness to the Lord's Commission

197
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
in the life of Paul.

198
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Paul was very clear about the Lord's Commission to him

199
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:55,000
which he received at his conversion.

200
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
He mentions this commission many times in his epistles

201
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:04,000
as well as in his testimonies as recorded in the Book of Acts.

202
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,000
How did he carry out his commission?

203
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,000
He said to the Colossian Christians

204
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,000
that he rejoiced in his sufferings

205
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:18,000
as a commissioned minister of the gospel among the Gentiles.

206
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
He said to the Corinthian Christians

207
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
that in his ministry as a commissioner of the gospel

208
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
he fainted not,

209
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,000
troubled on every side yet not distressed,

210
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
perplexed but not in despair,

211
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,000
persecuted but not forsaken,

212
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:38,000
cast down but not destroyed,

213
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,000
always bearing the body,

214
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,000
the dying of the Lord Jesus,

215
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,000
that the life also of Jesus

216
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,000
might be made manifest in his body.

217
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,000
He said to Timothy,

218
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:53,000
"I am appointed a preacher and an apostle

219
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
and a teacher of the Gentiles,

220
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,000
for the which cause I also suffer these things.

221
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Nevertheless I am not ashamed."

222
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,000
He said to the elders of the Ephesian church,

223
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,000
"The Holy Spirit witnesses in every city,

224
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:13,000
saying that bonds and afflictions abide me,

225
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,000
but none of these things move me,

226
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,000
neither count I my life dear unto myself,

227
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
so that I might finish my cause with joy

228
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:26,000
and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus

229
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
to testify the gospel of the grace of God."

230
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:35,000
What wonderful words from the lips of a dedicated missionary!

231
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Probably the best two illustrations

232
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,000
of Paul's tremendous spirit of commitment

233
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
to his commission are found in the Book of Acts.

234
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:49,000
We find in chapter 14, verses 19 to 21

235
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:53,000
that Paul was stoned by the people of the city of Lystra.

236
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,000
They took Paul for dead

237
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
and pulled him out of the city.

238
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,000
It is possible that Paul was dead,

239
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
but God raised him to life again.

240
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,000
What did he do after he came to himself?

241
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,000
He went back into the very city

242
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,000
where he had been treated so brutally.

243
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
What for?

244
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Just to boast of his wonderful recovery?

245
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
There could be only one reason,

246
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,000
and that is Paul was deeply concerned

247
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,000
about the spiritual need of those people

248
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,000
and he wanted to preach the gospel to them.

249
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,000
We read in the following verse

250
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,000
that Paul was back in the city of Lystra

251
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,000
for the third time in a short time later.

252
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,000
What bravery and what spirit of commitment!

253
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,000
The other illustration is recorded

254
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,000
in Acts chapter 24, verses 24 and 25.

255
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:53,000
Here we see Paul brought before the Roman governor,

256
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,000
Felix, for trial.

257
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,000
Paul took this opportunity to witness to gospel truth

258
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,000
What did Paul say?

259
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,000
It is recorded here in this passage.

260
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,000
He reasoned of righteousness, temperance,

261
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
and judgment to come.

262
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Paul knew that Felix was a governor

263
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,000
who was used to receiving large brides,

264
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,000
yet he talked about righteousness.

265
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,000
He knew that Felix was living with a Jewish woman

266
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,000
who was not his wife,

267
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,000
yet he talked about temperance.

268
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,000
He knew that his life was in the hand of Felix,

269
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,000
yet he talked about the judgment of God.

270
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,000
What bravery!

271
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,000
Paul knew very well that it was dangerous for him

272
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
to talk about these things before a man like Felix,

273
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:46,000
but out of a sense of faithfulness to his commission,

274
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,000
as well as out of a desire to awaken Felix

275
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,000
to his spiritual need,

276
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:56,000
he ignored the danger and rose up to his duty.

277
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:01,000
Again I say what faithfulness and commitment?

278
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
It is recorded here that the Roman governor

279
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
trembled before the spiritual giant.

280
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:12,000
Paul tells us that we as Christians

281
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,000
are also commissioned by God.

282
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,000
He says in 2 Corinthians 5, verse 19,

283
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,000
God was in Christ,

284
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,000
reconciling the world unto himself,

285
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
not imputing their trespasses unto them,

286
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation.

287
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,000
All Christians are commissioned ambassadors

288
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:39,000
for the great task of reconciliation,

289
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,000
the task of bringing people back to God

290
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,000
through evangelism and missions.

291
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Third, the sure judgment of God.

292
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,000
The apostle Paul had a sense of urgency

293
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,000
in his missions,

294
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,000
which stems from his sureness

295
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,000
of the judgment of God.

296
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Paul says,

297
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,000
knowing the terror of the Lord,

298
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,000
we persuade men.

299
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,000
2 Corinthians 5, verse 11.

300
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:09,000
Paul's concept of his mission is universal

301
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,000
because he says,

302
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
Now we know that what things

303
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,000
soever the law saith,

304
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,000
it saith to them that are under the law,

305
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,000
that every mouth may be stopped,

306
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,000
and all the world may become guilty before God.

307
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,000
Therefore by the deeds of the law,

308
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:31,000
there shall no flesh be justified in his sight.

309
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,000
The whole world lies under the judgment of God,

310
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
so the whole world needs

311
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,000
the gospel of grace through Christ.

312
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:44,000
Paul experienced great stirring of his spirit at Athens,

313
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:48,000
and he said to the people gathered at Areopagus,

314
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:52,000
Now God commandeth all men everywhere to repent,

315
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
because he hath appointed a day

316
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,000
in the which he will judge the world in righteousness

317
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,000
by that man whom he hath ordained.

318
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:05,000
Acts 17, verses 30 and 31.

319
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:08,000
Evangelism is often linked together

320
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,000
with the judgment of God in the epistles of Paul.

321
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
For instance,

322
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Paul says in 2 Timothy, chapter 4, verse 1,

323
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,000
I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus,

324
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,000
who shall judge the quick and the dead

325
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
at his appearing and his kingdom,

326
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
preach the word,

327
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,000
be instant in schism and out of schism.

328
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
Here we have three things,

329
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
evangelism,judgment,and a sense of urgency.

330
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:42,000
If we really believe that all men will be judged by Christ

331
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,000
according to their relationship with him,

332
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
we will be serious with evangelism and missions,

333
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,000
seizing at every opportunity to preach the gospel.

334
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Fourth, ardent desire to glorify God.

335
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Deep down in his heart,

336
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,000
Paul had a strong desire to glorify God

337
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,000
by bringing more people to God to sing his praise.

338
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,000
He says in Romans, 15, verses 19 to 11,

339
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,000
that the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy

340
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,000
as it is written,

341
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
for this cause I will confess to thee

342
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:23,000
among the Gentiles I sing unto thy name.

343
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,000
Again Paul says in 2 Corinthians, 4, 15,

344
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,000
that the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving

345
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:34,000
of many people redound to the glory of God.

346
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,000
This verse means that the more Christians there are,

347
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:42,000
the more will God be glorified.

348
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
This desire in the heart of Paul

349
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:49,000
is a good illustration of the Lord's teaching on prayer.

350
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:52,000
The foremost thought in our prayer should be,

351
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,000
according to the Lord's prayer,

352
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:56,000
Hallowed be thy name.

353
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,000
The only way to realize this desire

354
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,000
is to bring more and more people to God,

355
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,000
because the name of God is hallowed

356
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,000
only among those who know him

357
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:09,000
and worship him and praise him.

358
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,000
When Paul saw the city of Athens full of idols,

359
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:15,000
his spirit was greatly stirred

360
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
because the glory of God was robbed.

361
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
This ardent desire to glorify God

362
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,000
is a strong impetus for evangelism missions

363
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,000
in the life of Paul, so with us.

364
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,000
Fifth,

365
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,000
constrained by the love of Christ to share.

366
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5, 14,

367
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,000
The love of Christ constraineth us,

368
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,000
because we thus judge that if one died for all,

369
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,000
then we're all dead,

370
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:49,000
and that he died for all,

371
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,000
that they which live should not henceforth

372
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:53,000
live unto themselves,

373
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,000
but unto him which died for them and rose again.

374
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,000
Paul says here that

375
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,000
we are constrained by the love of Christ

376
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
not to live for ourselves,

377
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,000
but to live for him who died for us.

378
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:11,000
But how do we live for him?

379
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,000
Paul tells us in the following verse

380
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,000
that we live for him by engaging ourselves

381
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,000
in the task of the reconciliation,

382
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:23,000
bringing people into peace with God.

383
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:26,000
Greek scholars tell us

384
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,000
that the Greek word for the English word

385
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,000
constrain is a strong word,

386
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,000
suggesting the idea of a flood.

387
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Paul's heart was, as it were,

388
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,000
flooded by the love of Christ,

389
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
and he was moved away from himself,

390
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,000
and he began to live for Christ,

391
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,000
engaging himself in the task

392
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,000
of sharing the love of Christ with others

393
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,000
through evangelism and missions.

394
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:52,000
It is impossible to engage ourselves

395
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:56,000
in missions without this constraint.

396
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,000
Ari Jaffrey,

397
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,000
the co-founder of the Alliance Bible Seminary,

398
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,000
where I'm teaching now,

399
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,000
went to South China as a missionary

400
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,000
over 70 years ago.

401
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
He suffered from a weak heart

402
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
and he had diabetes,

403
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,000
but his day usually began at 4 a.m.,

404
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
4 o'clock in the morning.

405
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
After his personal devotional time,

406
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:25,000
he would begin writing articles in Chinese

407
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,000
for the Bible magazine

408
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,000
of which he was the editor.

409
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,000
He designed a special kind of desk

410
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,000
which could be pulled over his bed

411
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:37,000
so that he could write lying down in bed

412
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:40,000
in order to conserve his strength.

413
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:44,000
After 30 years of service in South China,

414
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,000
God called him to go to Vietnam

415
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,000
for pioneering work.

416
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,000
He went and began the work

417
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,000
which has now grown

418
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:55,000
to a membership of 60,000 Christians.

419
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Again,God called him to go to Indonesia,

420
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,000
where he had to start all over again.

421
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:06,000
He obeyed and started a rapidly growing work

422
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,000
until his death in Japanese concentration camp.

423
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,000
He was constrained by the love of Christ.

424
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Sixth,the second coming of Christ.

425
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:20,000
In the epistles,

426
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,000
evangelism and missions are closely associated

427
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,000
with the second coming of Christ.

428
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,000
To the evangelical mind,

429
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,000
the second coming of Christ

430
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,000
is always an incentive to evangelism and missions.

431
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,000
This concept has a sound basis in the epistles,

432
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
which in turn has its origin

433
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,000
in the teaching of Christ.

434
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,000
The apostle Peter speaks of the second coming of Christ

435
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,000
and God's desire to save more people

436
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,000
in the same sentence.

437
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,000
2 Peter 3.9

438
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,000
God wants to have his plan of salvation completed

439
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,000
before the second coming of Christ.

440
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:02,000
The apostle Paul speaks of the fullness of the Gentiles

441
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:06,000
against the background of the second coming of Christ.

442
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,000
Romans 11.25

443
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,000
All this is in good keeping

444
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:13,000
with the teaching of Christ himself

445
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:17,000
in Matthew 24.14 where he says,

446
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,000
This gospel of the kingdom

447
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,000
shall be preached in all the world

448
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,000
for a witness unto all nations,

449
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,000
and then shall the end come.

450
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,000
In the light of this verse,

451
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
missions has to do with the hastening

452
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,000
of the second coming of Christ.

453
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,000
There are many signs

454
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:37,000
which indicate that

455
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,000
the second coming of Christ

456
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
is getting nearer and nearer.

457
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,000
But instead of reaching the climax of world missions,

458
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,000
we are experiencing an anti-climax.

459
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:54,000
The evil one is getting busier and busier

460
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,000
in putting up hindrances to God's plan.

461
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
His tactics are twofold,

462
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,000
without the church and within the church.

463
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Without the church,

464
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
Satan is hardening and blinding

465
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
the inner eyes of more and more people

466
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,000
against the light of the gospel of Christ.

467
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,000
Within the church,

468
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:16,000
he is setting up mechanisms

469
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,000
that create in the minds of Christians

470
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:24,000
the impression that the day of missions is over,

471
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,000
and there isn't much that they can do.

472
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,000
As a result of all this,

473
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,000
there are signs of a slackening of pace

474
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,000
in the missionary efforts in the western countries.

475
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,000
But over against this,

476
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:42,000
the Lord is organizing a double counterattack.

477
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,000
On the one hand,

478
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:49,000
he is rallying together all Bible-believing Christians

479
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,000
for a renewed missionary movement.

480
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
On the other,

481
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,000
he is awakening the younger churches

482
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,000
in the so-called "Third World"

483
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
to realize their missionary responsibilities.

484
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Probably the fact that

485
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,000
you find names from the Third World

486
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,000
in the list of speakers at this convention

487
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:11,000
is a prophetic indication

488
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:14,000
that the East and the West are going to join forces

489
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
for the great task of missions.

490
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:21,000
We are running the last mile again, I say,

491
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
in the world missionary enterprise.

492
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,000
It is a hard mile,

493
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,000
but it is a challenge

494
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,000
to our loyalty and faithfulness

495
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,000
and commitment to the Great Commission.

496
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:37,000
See the consummation.

497
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,000
God is a God of perfect plan.

498
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,000
All his plans will be fulfilled.

499
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,000
The word "fullness"

500
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,000
used in connection with the plans of God

501
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,000
is very precious.

502
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
God accomplishes all his plans

503
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,000
at the fullness of time.

504
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,000
For instance,

505
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
the incarnation of Christ took place

506
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,000
when the fullness of the time has come.

507
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Galatians 4.4.

508
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
It did not happen by chance.

509
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,000
God had made perfect plans for it in history.

510
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,000
Paul uses this word "fullness"

511
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,000
in regard to God's plan for the people of Israel.

512
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,000
He says in Romans 11.25,

513
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
"Blindness in part is happened to Israel

514
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
until the fullness of the Gentiles become in,

515
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,000
and so all Israel shall be saved."

516
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:32,000
God has not forsaken his chosen people,

517
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:35,000
but has a wonderful plan of salvation for them.

518
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,000
There is perfect timing.

519
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,000
Even as God delivered his people

520
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,000
from the Babylonian captivity

521
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,000
at the fullness of the prophesied 70 years,

522
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,000
which,Lord, looked impossible at the time

523
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,000
because of adverse circumstances,

524
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,000
so will God save them again

525
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
at the fullness of the Gentiles.

526
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,000
Christ himself uses this word "fullness"

527
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,000
in regard to his second coming.

528
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
He says,

529
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,000
"They shall fall by the edge of the sword

530
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
and shall be led away captive into all nations,

531
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles

532
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,000
until the fullness,

533
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,000
the fullness of the times of the Gentiles."

534
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:19,000
Luke 21.24.

535
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:25,000
The Lord said this in the context of his prophecies

536
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,000
about his second coming.

537
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,000
Even as God made plans for the first coming of Christ,

538
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:35,000
so has God made perfect plans for his second coming,

539
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,000
which is the hope of the Church.

540
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,000
Everything is leading to that glorious event in history.

541
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:44,000
The prophets foretold it,

542
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,000
the Lord himself confirmed it,

543
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,000
the apostles proclaimed it,

544
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:52,000
all signs today are pointing to it.

545
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,000
Biblical evangelism and missions

546
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,000
are filled with significance

547
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,000
in view of the second coming of Christ.

548
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:02,000
Missions are not doomed to failure,

549
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,000
but to a glorious consummation

550
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,000
as recorded in the book of Revelation,

551
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,000
chapter 7, verses 9 and 10.

552
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:13,000
"Lo, a great multitude,

553
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
which no man can number,

554
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,000
of all nations and kindreds

555
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:19,000
and people and tongues,

556
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,000
stood before the throne and before the Lamb,

557
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,000
clothed with white robes and palms in their hands,

558
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,000
and cried with a loud voice,

559
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:31,000
saying, 'Salvation to our God,

560
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,000
which sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb!'

561
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,000
This is the vision of the apostle John,

562
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,000
and it is also ours.

563
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:45,000
But before and leading to the final realization

564
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:47,000
of this glorious vision,

565
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:51,000
you and I have the task of evangelism

566
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:54,500
我們有宗教和任務在我們肩上。
