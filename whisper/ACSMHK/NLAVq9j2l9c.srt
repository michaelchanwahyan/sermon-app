1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,840
 This morning, we are going to conclude our study on the biblical basis of missions

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,600
 by taking up the fourth and last subtitle,

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:17,560
 "The Basis of Missions in the Epistles,"

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:22,600
 that is, "The Church and Missions."

5
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,460
 My message this morning, again, has three sections.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:32,520
 A, the nature of the Church and missions.

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:37,400
 B, the urgency of the Church's mission.

8
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:43,760
 C, the consummation of the Church and missions.

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,000
 Now, A, the nature of the Church and missions.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,760
 The Apostle Paul uses eight illustrations

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,560
 to explain the nature of the Church in his epistle to the Ephesians.

12
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:06,460
 We find the missionary responsibility of the Church in all these eight illustrations.

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:11,860
 First, the Church as the body of Christ.

14
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,160
 The Apostle Paul calls the Church the body of Christ, Ephesians 1.23.

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:25,460
 And in this metaphor, he points out something which has important bearing on missions.

16
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:32,360
 He says in chapter 2, verse 16, that the Jews and the Gentiles have become one body,

17
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,160
 the body of Christ, which is the Church.

18
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,660
 The middle wall of partition no longer exists in the Church of Christ.

19
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:51,360
 Since God has included the Gentiles in his Church, it follows logically that the Church has a universal mission

20
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:57,660
 through which the body of Christ continues to grow in all parts of the world.

21
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:05,660
 Paul also says in Colossians 3.11 that in the Church there is neither Greek nor Jew,

22
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:17,460
 neither circumcision nor uncircumcision, barbarian, synthine, bond nor free, but Christ is all in all.

23
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:22,960
 This glorious vision is being realized through missions.

24
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:27,760
 Every member of the human body is expected to fulfill his function,

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,560
 and all members of the body are expected to work in perfect unity.

26
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,360
 That is the only way for the body to keep healthy and growing.

27
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:45,260
 Christ expects the same thing from his body, which is the Church.

28
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:51,160
 Paul, speaking the mind of Christ, says in chapter 4, verse 16,

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,460
 "The whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every part supplieth,

30
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:03,060
 according to the effectual working in the measure of every part,

31
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,260
 maketh increase of the body."

32
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:11,160
 It is when every member of the Church of Christ understands his duties

33
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:18,460
 and joins together with one and another in harmonious action that the Church will grow.

34
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:26,260
 Here we have the two basic principles of Church growth, unity and total mobilization.

35
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:31,160
 Second, the Church as new man.

36
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:36,360
 Corporately, the whole Church is called by Paul a new man,

37
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:43,460
 consisting of two parties, the Jews and the Gentiles, chapter 2, verse 15.

38
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:49,260
 Individually, every member of the body of Christ is called a new man,

39
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:58,260
 which is created according to the image of God, consisting in righteousness and true holiness, 4.24.

40
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:06,460
 All true believers have become new creatures in Christ, irrespective of their nationalities.

41
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:11,760
 This teaching sheds a very important light on the task of missions.

42
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:17,360
 The aim of missionary work is not to sell Church membership,

43
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,260
 but to increase the number of new creatures in Christ.

44
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:29,960
 If we mainly think of membership, we easily fall under the curse of creedalism.

45
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,960
 There is an important distinction between creed and creedalism.

46
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:43,360
 Creed is absolutely necessary because it is the crystallization of what we believe.

47
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,460
 We cannot really believe without knowing clearly what we believe.

48
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:55,160
 Creed is a concrete statement of our faith, but creedalism is different.

49
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:59,660
 Creedalism means the conscious or unconscious attitude

50
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:05,860
 that as long as we have brought people to a position where they can say yes to our creeds,

51
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:08,760
 we have done our job.

52
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:15,860
 Wherever creedalism prevails, the Churches are satisfied with formal membership

53
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:24,160
 and show no real concern for lack of signs of spiritual life in the lives of Church members.

54
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:32,260
 A spiritually healthy Church is less impressed with numbers than spiritual vitality.

55
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,160
 I do not belittle the significance of numbers.

56
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:42,060
 They do tell something, and sometimes they are even indispensable.

57
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:50,460
 What I do mean is this. Numbers are meaningless unless they indicate spiritual reality

58
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,360
 or they lead to somewhere.

59
00:05:53,360 --> 00:06:02,560
 In fact, Churches that lay emphasis on spiritual reality are usually Churches that grow statistically.

60
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,960
 Third, the Church as the household of God.

61
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:15,060
 Paul says in Ephesians chapter 2, verse 19,

62
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:20,060
 that the Gentile believers are brought into the household of God,

63
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,660
 which is virtually identical with the Church.

64
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:31,360
 The word household, or home, or family, suggests the idea of love and fellowship.

65
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:37,660
 The Church as the household of God is a place where the love of God is manifested

66
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:42,060
 and where the children of God enjoy fellowship with one another.

67
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:50,860
 One of the responsibilities of a local Church is to provide opportunities of fellowship for her members.

68
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:55,060
 The Church exists for a five-fold purpose.

69
00:06:55,060 --> 00:07:01,760
 Worship, teaching, evangelism, service, and fellowship.

70
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:06,060
 The Christian life is essentially a life of fellowship.

71
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,660
 It has its root in fellowship with God vertically,

72
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,260
 and it expresses itself in fellowship with Christians horizontally.

73
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:22,360
 When the Christian life is devoid of fellowship, it is substantially short of reality.

74
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,260
 It has been said that one Christian is no Christian.

75
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:33,260
 Maybe it is overstated, but there is surely truth in it.

76
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,260
 It tells us that the real Christian life is a fellowship life.

77
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:42,560
 Fellowship is the context of the Christian life.

78
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,260
 You cannot live a life without context.

79
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:51,060
 The Christian fellowship is glorious because it is a family fellowship

80
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:55,260
 of all the redeemed of God from all over the world.

81
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:03,860
 The Church of Christ is a universal family consisting of people of all races and all nationalities.

82
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:11,860
 Missionary service, therefore, means the effort of extending this glorious international family of Christ

83
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:19,060
 where there is true equality and acceptance and love between all its members.

84
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:29,460
 This is, in fact, the fulfillment of Confucius' audacious ideal of one brotherhood of all people within the four seas.

85
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:34,760
 Fourth, the Church as the Kingdom of God.

86
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:40,160
 Paul calls the Gentile Christians fellow citizens with the saints.

87
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:46,060
 2.19, the word "citizen" implies a nation or a kingdom.

88
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,860
 The Apostle Peter calls the Church a holy nation, 1 Peter 2.9.

89
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:59,560
 And the Apostle Paul calls her the Kingdom of God's dear Son, Colossians 1.13.

90
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,160
 We can, therefore, use either nation or kingdom for the Church.

91
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:12,260
 The first basic idea behind the concept of a kingdom is authority or power.

92
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:21,160
 Paul says, "The kingdom of God is not in word, but in power." 1 Corinthians 4.20.

93
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,260
 This power is manifested in two things.

94
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:30,860
 First, in the obedience of the citizens of the kingdom to the will of the king.

95
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:35,760
 Second, in the citizens' victory over sin and Satan.

96
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:43,560
 The second basic idea behind the concept of a kingdom is found in Romans 14.17.

97
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:51,260
 He says here, "The kingdom of God is righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit."

98
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:57,860
 This means that the kingdom of God expresses itself in a specific type of life

99
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:04,460
 in which righteousness, peace, and joy are the predominant characteristics.

100
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:12,660
 The translation from the power of darkness into the kingdom of God's dear Son is a glorious experience.

101
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:21,160
 This translation is as concrete and as definite and as real as the birth of a new baby.

102
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:30,160
 Everyone who has been thus translated finds in his heart and life obedience, righteousness, peace, and joy.

103
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:36,860
 It is a great privilege and joy to have a share in the mission of furthering this kingdom

104
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:43,060
 and the whole world by bringing people into its glorious blessedness.

105
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:47,960
 Fifth, the church as spiritual temple.

106
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:54,160
 The church is, as Paul puts it, "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets,

107
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:01,660
 Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together

108
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:07,160
 groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord, in whom ye are also built together

109
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,960
 for an habitation of God through the Spirit."

110
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,060
 2, verses 20 and 21.

111
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:21,660
 The church is depicted here as a holy temple which is a habitation of God through the Holy Spirit.

112
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:29,160
 Or, as Peter puts it, the church is a spiritual house built with living stones.

113
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,660
 1 Peter 2, 5.

114
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:38,760
 This illustration of the church teaches us at least two important lessons.

115
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,360
 In the first place, the church is spiritual.

116
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,460
 She is a place where spiritual laws and principles are employed,

117
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:55,660
 a place where spiritual sacrifices are offered and spiritual fruits are born,

118
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:59,760
 a place where spiritual gifts are exercised in service,

119
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:04,160
 a place where the Holy Spirit moves freely.

120
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:08,060
 In the second place, the church is living.

121
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:13,460
 She is built on the living Word of God as revealed through three channels,

122
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,660
 the prophets, the apostles, and above all, Jesus Christ.

123
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,560
 Her building materials are all living.

124
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,660
 The living stone which is Christ as the cornerstone,

125
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:32,660
 and the living stones which are born again Christians, and the living Word.

126
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:36,460
 She is inhabited by the living God.

127
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:46,560
 Every activity in the church should aim at the building up of the member's living relationship with God.

128
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,260
 Here again, we see something important in regard to missions.

129
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,660
 The goal of missions is not merely to reproduce on the mission fields

130
00:12:56,660 --> 00:13:02,060
 all the denominations which we have in the homelands with all their dividedness,

131
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:08,460
 but to establish churches that are built on the pattern of the living Word of God

132
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:17,260
 where sound spiritual principles are lively employed in worship, government, and program.

133
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:21,760
 Sixth, the church as bride of Christ.

134
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:27,760
 The Apostle Paul calls the union of the church with Christ a great mystery.

135
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,960
 It is indeed a great mystery of love of which the union of husband and wife is a symbol.

136
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:42,760
 This illustration of the relationship between the church and Christ is true both corporately and individually.

137
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:46,860
 Corporately, the church as a whole is a bride of Christ.

138
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,760
 Individually, every born-again Christian is a bride of Christ.

139
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,760
 Second Corinthians 11.2.

140
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:00,960
 The central point of this illustration is union in love.

141
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:04,660
 Love is more of the heart than the mind.

142
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:10,960
 And it follows that the Christian life is more of the heart than the mind.

143
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:16,760
 Mind is very important and it is far from me to belittle the significance of the mind.

144
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,760
 But I do want to point out that in an age that glorifies the mind,

145
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:30,760
 it is very important for us Christians to keep our faith a matter of the heart rather than the head.

146
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:35,860
 Of course, the either/or approach is not ideal.

147
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,060
 The best is both.

148
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:45,360
 We need both a heart relationship with God and an understanding of the mind.

149
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,660
 That is exactly the answer we find in the Bible.

150
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:54,060
 I used to appreciate a question poised by a certain scholar.

151
00:14:54,060 --> 00:15:03,860
 He asks, "Which of the two would you prefer, the seraphim, which means fire, or cherubim, which means knowledge?"

152
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,860
 But later it dawned upon me when I was reading my Bible one day

153
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:15,860
 that there was fire right in the center of the cherubim, which means knowledge,

154
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:20,860
 as recorded in the first chapter of the book of Ezekiel.

155
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:28,360
 So knowledge and fire are beautifully united together in the revealed Word of God.

156
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:37,860
 We need both the fire of the heart and the wisdom of the mind.

157
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:43,360
 Evangelicals today need more training of the mind before they can meet the need today.

158
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,860
 But this is done not at the expense of the deep experience of the heart.

159
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:56,360
 Every missionary going out to another land must have a deep heart experience of gospel truths

160
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:59,860
 before they can pass on the living message.

161
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:08,860
 The mind is often localized, but the heart is a universal language which everybody understands.

162
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:15,860
 Missionaries who go to the mission fields with degrees but without a deep heart experience with Christ

163
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:20,860
 will fail and come home shattered and disillusioned.

164
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,360
 Seventh, the church as a candlestick.

165
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:29,360
 Paul speaks of Christians as children of light.

166
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,860
 Five, eight.

167
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:37,860
 Which reminds us of the Apostle John's vision of the seven churches as seven candlesticks.

168
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:41,860
 The church is meant by God to be a light in the world.

169
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,860
 The light of the gospel is to shine through the church in all the world.

170
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:51,860
 Send the light is still the motto of all the missionary minded churches.

171
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:56,860
 It is still the chorus of the hymn of missions.

172
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:01,860
 Light is always outreaching and never ingrown.

173
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:09,860
 The Christians and churches that are torch bearers are always aggressive in evangelism and missions.

174
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:14,860
 On the other hand, when Paul speaks of Christians as children of light,

175
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:18,860
 he is thinking of their Christ-like character.

176
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:27,860
 This leads us to another side of our task as light bearers, which is sometimes called non-verbal witness.

177
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:34,860
 Verbal and non-verbal witness constitute the Christian light.

178
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:39,860
 Eighth, the church as army of Christ.

179
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:47,860
 The picture of the church as an army is vividly painted by Paul in Ephesians chapter six.

180
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:56,860
 The armor of this army consists of both defensive and offensive equipment and weapons.

181
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:01,860
 The church is to be both defensive and offensive.

182
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,860
 She is both conservative and progressive.

183
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:10,860
 She defends and conserves purity of doctrine and purity of character,

184
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,860
 but it also moves on in an offensive attack on Satan and sin,

185
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:25,860
 as well as in an active and aggressive evangelism to bring people to God's side of the battle.

186
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:33,860
 Where does the church of Christ stand in an anti-traditional age like ours?

187
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,860
 She is anti all things that are anti-Christ,

188
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:43,860
 and she is most conservative in keeping the true Christian heritage.

189
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:46,860
 What is the true Christian heritage?

190
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:55,860
 It is found in the Lord's letters to the seven churches in Asia Minor as recorded in the book of Revelation chapters two and three.

191
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:05,860
 The Lord commended the victorious Christians in these churches for a number of things which constitute the precious Christian heritage.

192
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,860
 It is a sevenfold heritage.

193
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:16,860
 Purity of doctrine and the first love as exemplified by the Ephesian church.

194
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:24,860
 Boldness and firmness in face of persecution as expressed by the church at Smyrna.

195
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,860
 Good works as found in the church at Thyatira.

196
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:38,860
 Emphasis on spirituality rather than on form as exhibited by the victorious members of the church at Sardis.

197
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:47,860
 Purity of character as represented by the white garment worn by the remnant in the church at Sardis.

198
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:54,860
 Obedience and faith in evangelism and missions as shown by the church at Philadelphia.

199
00:19:54,860 --> 00:20:00,860
 This sevenfold heritage is the true mainstream of Christianity,

200
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:06,860
 and it is behind this holy tradition that we firmly stand.

201
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:19,860
 We have noticed that one of the seven points just mentioned above is taking hold of every open door and entering into it with evangelism and missions.

202
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:26,860
 This is part of our great heritage and we must uphold.

203
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:36,860
 As the army of Christ, let us march on with believing and bold evangelism and missions to the utmost part of the world.

204
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:42,860
 B) The urgency of the church's mission.

205
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:50,860
 The mission of the church is urgent because in the first place the gospel is the only way of salvation.

206
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,860
 The gospel is the only way of salvation.

207
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,860
 The Apostle Paul says in his first epistle to Timothy,

208
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:08,860
 "There is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself a ransom for all."

209
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:11,860
 1 Timothy 2.5

210
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:15,860
 This is in keeping with Peter's preaching when he said,

211
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:22,860
 "There is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." Acts 4.12

212
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:31,860
 The claim of the gospel of Christ as the only way of salvation is clearly stated in the gospels and in the epistles.

213
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:34,860
 This is what we believe and proclaim.

214
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:46,860
 In an age of relativism and syncretism like ours, the voice of universalism and self-salvation is strong.

215
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:58,860
 Probably the two strongest philosophies or thought forms in universities all over the world today are logical positivism and relativism,

216
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:02,860
 as some well-known scholars have pointed out.

217
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:07,860
 The former denies the possibility of knowing things as they really are.

218
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:13,860
 If anything is considered to be known, it is only known in the laboratory.

219
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,860
 There is no knowledge besides scientific knowledge.

220
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:22,860
 Relativism tries to make everything relative.

221
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:27,860
 When relative is carried into theology, it has given birth to four forms of thought.

222
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:34,860
 A new conception of God, new morality, new evangelism, and new secularism.

223
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,860
 In the new concept of God, God himself is made relative.

224
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,860
 Instead of the great I am, he has become the God of becoming.

225
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:50,860
 In the new morality, morals are made relative with no absolute standard except love,

226
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,860
 which in turn is left to relative and subjective interpretations.

227
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:02,860
 In new evangelism, the absolute finality of Christ in salvation is made relative.

228
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:12,860
 In new secularism, the sacred are made relative, and as a result, we are left with a religionless Christianity.

229
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:21,860
 Over against this relativism, we have the biblical claim of the gospel of Christ as the only way of salvation.

230
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:29,860
 If we really believe in this absolute claim of the gospel, we have to act in accordance with it.

231
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:32,860
 True faith always involves action.

232
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:39,860
 Conviction in faith and indifference in action are never compatible with each other.

233
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:49,860
 The logic of the urgency of evangelism and missions is readily established by the absolute claim of the gospel.

234
00:23:49,860 --> 00:24:00,860
 It is becoming more and more evident that only Bible-believing Christians are really concerned with the carrying out of the Great Commission.

235
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:07,860
 We all agree with Paul when he says, "Whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."

236
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,860
 But how do we react when we hear Paul continue to say,

237
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:19,860
 "How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard?

238
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:26,860
 And how shall they hear without a preacher? And how shall they preach except they be sent?"

239
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:35,860
 Shall we add here, "How can we send except there are those who are willing to go?"

240
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:41,860
 Second, loyalty and faithfulness to the Law's Commission.

241
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:47,860
 We find a good example for loyalty and faithfulness to the Law's Commission in the life of Paul.

242
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:54,860
 Paul was very clear about the Law's Commission to him which he received at his conversion.

243
00:24:54,860 --> 00:25:04,860
 He mentions this commission many times in his epistles as well as in his testimonies as recorded in the Book of Acts.

244
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:07,860
 How did he carry out his commission?

245
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:17,860
 He said to the Colossian Christians that he rejoiced in his sufferings as a commissioned minister of the gospel among the Gentiles.

246
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:26,860
 He said to the Corinthian Christians that in his ministry as a commissioner of the gospel, he fainted not,

247
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:35,860
 troubled on every side yet not distressed, perplexed but not in despair, persecuted but not forsaken,

248
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:41,860
 cast down but not destroyed, always bearing the body, the dying of the Lord Jesus,

249
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:47,860
 that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in his body.

250
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:58,860
 He said to Timothy, "I am appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles for the which cause I also suffer these things.

251
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:02,860
 Nevertheless, I am not ashamed."

252
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:12,860
 He said to the elders of the Ephesian church, "The Holy Spirit witnesses in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me,

253
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:18,860
 but none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself,

254
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:29,860
 so that I might finish my cause with joy and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of God."

255
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:35,860
 What wonderful words from the lips of a dedicated missionary.

256
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:43,860
 Probably the best two illustrations of Paul's tremendous spirit of commitment to his commission are found in the book of Acts.

257
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:52,860
 We find in chapter 14 verses 19 to 21 that Paul was stoned by the people of the city of Lystra.

258
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:58,860
 They took Paul for dead and pulled him out of the city.

259
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:05,860
 It is possible that Paul was dead, but God raised him to life again.

260
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:08,860
 What did he do after he came to himself?

261
00:27:08,860 --> 00:27:14,860
 He went back into the very city where he had been treated so brutally.

262
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:19,860
 What for? Just to boast of his wonderful recovery?

263
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:29,860
 There could be only one reason, and that is Paul was deeply concerned about the spiritual need of those people and he wanted to preach the gospel to them.

264
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:37,860
 We read in the following verse that Paul was back in the city of Lystra for the third time in a short time later.

265
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,860
 What bravery and what spirit of commitment.

266
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:49,860
 Another illustration is recorded in Acts chapter 24 verses 24 and 25.

267
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:55,860
 Here we see Paul brought before the Roman governor Felix for trial.

268
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:00,860
 Paul took this opportunity to witness to gospel truth.

269
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:03,860
 What did Paul say?

270
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:11,860
 It is recorded here in this passage, "He reasoned of righteousness, temperance, and judgment to come."

271
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:20,860
 Paul knew that Felix was a governor who was used to receiving large bribes, yet he talked about righteousness.

272
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:27,860
 He knew that Felix was living with a Jewish woman who was not his wife, yet he talked about temperance.

273
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:34,860
 He knew that his life was in the hand of Felix, yet he talked about the judgment of God.

274
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,860
 What bravery.

275
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:42,860
 Paul knew very well that it was dangerous for him to talk about these things before a man like Felix,

276
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:51,860
 but out of a sense of faithfulness to his commission as well as out of a desire to awaken Felix to his spiritual need,

277
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:56,860
 he ignored the danger and rose up to his duty.

278
00:28:56,860 --> 00:29:01,860
 Again I say, what faithfulness and commitment.

279
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:09,860
 It is recorded here that the Roman governor trembled before the spiritual giant.

280
00:29:09,860 --> 00:29:14,860
 Paul tells us that we as Christians are also commissioned by God.

281
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,860
 He says in 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 19,

282
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:26,860
 "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them,

283
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:32,860
 and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation."

284
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:38,860
 All Christians are commissioned ambassadors for the great task of reconciliation,

285
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:45,860
 the task of bringing people back to God through evangelism and missions.

286
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:49,860
 Third, the sure judgment of God.

287
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:57,860
 The apostle Paul had a sense of urgency in his missions which stems from his sureness of the judgment of God.

288
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:03,860
 Paul says, "Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men."

289
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,860
 2 Corinthians 5 verse 11.

290
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:10,860
 Paul's concept of his mission is universal because he says,

291
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:17,860
 "Now we know that what things soever the law saith, it saith to them that are under the law,

292
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:23,860
 that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.

293
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:30,860
 Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight."

294
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:38,860
 The whole world lies under the judgment of God, so the whole world needs the gospel of grace through Christ.

295
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:47,860
 Paul experienced great stirring of his spirit at Athens, and he said to the people gathered at Arepagus,

296
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:51,860
 "Now God commandeth all men everywhere to repent,

297
00:30:51,860 --> 00:31:00,860
 because he hath appointed a day in the which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained."

298
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:04,860
 Acts 17 verses 30 and 31.

299
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:10,860
 Evangelism is often linked together with the judgment of God in the epistles of Paul.

300
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:17,860
 For instance, Paul says in 2 Timothy chapter 4 verse 1,

301
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:26,860
 "I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom,

302
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:31,860
 preach the word, be instant in schism and out of schism."

303
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:38,860
 Here we have three things, evangelism, judgment, and a sense of urgency.

304
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:44,860
 If we really believe that all men will be judged by Christ according to their relationship with him,

305
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:53,860
 we will be serious with evangelism and missions, seizing at every opportunity to preach the gospel.

306
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:59,860
 Fourth, ardent desire to glorify God.

307
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:08,860
 Deep down in his heart, Paul had a strong desire to glorify God by bringing more people to God to sing his praise.

308
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:12,860
 He says in Romans 15 verses 19 to 11,

309
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:17,860
 "That the Gentiles may glorify God for his mercy as it is written,

310
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:22,860
 'For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles I sing unto thy name.'"

311
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:33,860
 Again, Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4 verse 15, "That the abundant grace might through the thanksgiving of many people redound to the glory of God."

312
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:41,860
 This verse means that the more Christians there are, the more will God be glorified.

313
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:48,860
 This desire in the heart of Paul is a good illustration of the Lord's teaching on prayer.

314
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:55,860
 The foremost thought in our prayer should be, according to the Lord's Prayer, "Hallowed be thy name."

315
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:01,860
 The only way to realize this desire is to bring more and more people to God,

316
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:08,860
 because the name of God is hallowed only among those who know him and worship him and praise him.

317
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:18,860
 When Paul saw the city of Athens full of idols, his spirit was greatly stirred because the glory of God was robbed.

318
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:29,860
 This ardent desire to glorify God is a strong impetus for evangelism missions in the life of Paul. So with us.

319
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:36,860
 Fifth, constrained by the love of Christ to share.

320
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:42,860
 Paul says in 2 Corinthians 5 verse 14, "The love of Christ constraineth us,

321
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:47,860
 because we thus judge that if one died for all, then we're all dead,

322
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:52,860
 and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves,

323
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:56,860
 but unto him which died for them and rose again."

324
00:33:56,860 --> 00:34:04,860
 Paul says here that we are constrained by the love of Christ not to live for ourselves,

325
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:07,860
 but to live for him who died for us.

326
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,860
 But how do we live for him?

327
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:18,860
 Paul tells us in the following verse that we live for him by engaging ourselves in the task of reconciliation,

328
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,860
 bringing people into peace with God.

329
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:29,860
 Greek scholars tell us that the Greek word for the English word "constrain" is a strong word,

330
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,860
 suggesting the idea of a flood.

331
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,860
 Paul's heart was, as it were, flooded by the love of Christ,

332
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:38,860
 and he was moved away from himself,

333
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:47,860
 and he began to live for Christ, engaging himself in the task of sharing the love of Christ with others through evangelism and missions.

334
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:55,860
 It is impossible to engage ourselves in missions without this constraint.

335
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:03,860
 R.E. Jaffrey, the co-founder of the Alliance Bible Seminary where I'm teaching now,

336
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:07,860
 went to South China as a missionary over 70 years ago.

337
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,860
 He suffered from a weak heart and he had diabetes,

338
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:18,860
 but his day usually began at 4 a.m., 4 o'clock in the morning.

339
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:28,860
 After his personal devotional time, he would begin writing articles in Chinese for the Bible magazine of which he was the editor.

340
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:39,860
 He designed a special kind of desk which could be pulled over his bed so that he could write lying down in bed in order to conserve his strength.

341
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:47,860
 After 30 years of service in South China, God called him to go to Vietnam for pioneering work.

342
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:54,860
 He went and began the work which has now grown to a membership of 60,000 Christians.

343
00:35:54,860 --> 00:36:00,860
 Again, God called him to go to Indonesia where he had to start all over again.

344
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:09,860
 He obeyed and started a rapidly growing work until his death in Japanese concentration camp.

345
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:13,860
 He was constrained by the love of Christ.

346
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:17,860
 Sixth, the second coming of Christ.

347
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:25,860
 In the epistles, evangelism and missions are closely associated with the second coming of Christ.

348
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:33,860
 To the evangelical mind, the second coming of Christ is always an incentive to evangelism and missions.

349
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:42,860
 This concept has a sound basis in the epistles which in turn has its origin in the teaching of Christ.

350
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:50,860
 The apostle Peter speaks of the second coming of Christ and God's desire to save more people in the same sentence.

351
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:58,860
 2 Peter 3.9. God wants to have his plan of salvation completed before the second coming of Christ.

352
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:05,860
 The apostle Paul speaks of the fullness of the Gentiles against the background of the second coming of Christ.

353
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:16,860
 Romans 11.25. All this is in good keeping with the teaching of Christ himself in Matthew 24.14 where he says,

354
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:26,860
 "This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come."

355
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:33,860
 In the light of this verse, missions has to do with the hastening of the second coming of Christ.

356
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:41,860
 There are many signs which indicate that the second coming of Christ is getting nearer and nearer.

357
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:49,860
 But instead of reaching the climax of world missions, we are experiencing an anti-climax.

358
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:56,860
 The evil one is getting busier and busier in putting up hindrances to God's plan.

359
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:02,860
 His tactics are twofold, without the church and within the church.

360
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:10,860
 Without the church, Satan is hardening and blinding the inner eyes of more and more people against the light of the gospel of Christ.

361
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:23,860
 Within the church, he is setting up mechanisms that create in the minds of Christians the impression that the day of missions is over,

362
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,860
 and there isn't much that they can do.

363
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:35,860
 As a result of all this, there are signs of a slackening of pace in the missionary efforts in the western countries.

364
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:41,860
 But over against this, the Lord is organizing a double counter-attack.

365
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:51,860
 On the one hand, he is rallying together all Bible-believing Christians for a renewed missionary movement.

366
00:38:51,860 --> 00:39:01,860
 On the other, he is awakening the younger churches in the so-called "Third World" to realize their missionary responsibilities.

367
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:08,860
 Probably the fact that you find names from the Third World in the list of speakers at this convention

368
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:16,860
 is a prophetic indication that the East and the West are going to join forces for the great task of missions.

369
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:23,860
 We are running the last mile again, I say, in the world missionary enterprise.

370
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:32,860
 It is a hard mile, but it is a challenge to our loyalty and faithfulness and commitment to the Great Commission.

371
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:36,860
 See the consummation.

372
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:40,860
 God is a God of perfect plan.

373
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:43,860
 All his plans will be fulfilled.

374
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:49,860
 The word "fullness" used in connection with the plans of God is very precious.

375
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,860
 God accomplishes all his plans at the fullness of time.

376
00:39:54,860 --> 00:40:02,860
 For instance, the incarnation of Christ took place when the fullness of the time has come, Galatians 4.4.

377
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:04,860
 It did not happen by chance.

378
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:08,860
 God had made perfect plans for it in history.

379
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:15,860
 Paul uses this word "fullness" in regard to God's plan for the people of Israel.

380
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:25,860
 He says in Romans 11.25, "Blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles become in,

381
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:28,860
 and so all Israel shall be saved."

382
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:34,860
 God has not forsaken his chosen people, but has a wonderful plan of salvation for them.

383
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:38,860
 There is perfect timing.

384
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:45,860
 Even as God delivered his people from the Babylonian captivity at the fullness of the prophesied 70 years,

385
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:51,860
 which, Lord, looked impossible at the time because of adverse circumstances,

386
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:56,860
 so will God save them again at the fullness of the Gentiles.

387
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,860
 Christ himself uses this word "fullness" in regard to his second coming.

388
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:08,860
 He says, "They shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations,

389
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:16,860
 and Jerusalem shall be trodden down of the Gentiles until the fullness of the times of the Gentiles."

390
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,860
 Luke 21.24.

391
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:26,860
 The Lord said this in the context of his prophecies about his second coming.

392
00:41:26,860 --> 00:41:34,860
 Even as God made plans for the first coming of Christ, so has God made perfect plans for his second coming,

393
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,860
 which is the hope of the Church.

394
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:40,860
 Everything is leading to that glorious event in history.

395
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:51,860
 The prophets foretold it, the Lord himself confirmed it, the apostles proclaimed it, all signs today are pointing to it.

396
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:58,860
 Biblical evangelism and missions are filled with significance in view of the second coming of Christ.

397
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:09,860
 Missions are not doomed to failure, but to a glorious consummation, as recorded in the book of Revelation 7, verses 9 and 10.

398
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:18,860
 "Lo, a great multitude, which no man can number, of all nations and kindreds and people and tongues,

399
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:25,860
 stood before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes and palms in their hands,

400
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:34,860
 and cried with a loud voice, saying, 'Salvation to our God, which sitteth upon the throne and unto the Lamb!'"

401
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:40,860
 This is the vision of the apostle John, and it is also ours.

402
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:53,860
 But before and leading to the final realization of this glorious vision, you and I have the task of evangelism and missions on our shoulders.
