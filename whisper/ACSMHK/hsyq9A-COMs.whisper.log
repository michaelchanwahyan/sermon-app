[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.100]   The gathering of 15,000 students here at the convention is a strong indication to the world
[00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:21.400]   that Christian young people today are still vitally concerned about evangelism and missions
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.440]   as an expression of their obedience to the Lord's great commission.
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:36.400]   This convention is a tremendous encouragement as well as challenge to all Christians of
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:41.520]   the world in regard to missions.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.120]   You have come here to study evangelism missions and more important to find out God's will
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.360]   for your lives.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:58.420]   I pray that this convention will be an instrument in the hand of the Almighty God for the reinforcement
[00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.800]   of the missionary cause in the whole world.
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:13.760]   I want to express my gratitude to the planning committee of this convention for giving me
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.840]   this precious privilege of having a share in the great fellowship of this convention.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:27.320]   I deeply feel my own unworthiness to stand here as a speaker.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.140]   Your prayer for me will be greatly valued and appreciated.
[00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:42.500]   The theme of my message these four mornings is biblical basis of missions.
[00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.500]   I divide this theme into four subtitles.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.100]   First the basis of missions in the Old Testament.
[00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.180]   Second the basis of missions in the Gospels, that is Christ and missions.
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:07.820]   Third the basis of missions in the Book of Acts, that is the Holy Spirit and missions.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.940]   Fourth the basis of missions in the Epistles, that is the Church and missions.
[00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.820]   This morning we take up the first subtitle.
[00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.580]   The basis of missions in the Old Testament.
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.660]   The Bible is a record of a mission, the divine mission of saving the human race, carried
[00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.860]   out by the triune God and his commissioned people.
[00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.680]   The history of the people of Israel is the history of a mission.
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:48.120]   The record of the corporate mission of the people of Israel began with the fascinating
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.260]   story of a personal mission, the mission of Abraham.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.580]   The burden of Abraham's mission is clearly stated in God's calling to him.
[00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:06.260]   God said to him, "I will bless thee and thou shall be a blessing and in thee shall all
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.580]   families of the earth be blessed."
[00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:17.700]   That was a great mission, the mission of blessing the whole world.
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.780]   Abraham became a great missionary, all missionary.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.860]   God called Abraham and he responded in faith.
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:33.260]   He left behind his old way of life and started the pilgrimage of a heavenly errand.
[00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:39.180]   Abraham is called the father of faith, but his faith was means to an end and that end
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.300]   was a mission.
[00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.340]   Faith by itself is without content.
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.260]   In the life of Abraham, faith was required of him because the carrying out of his mission
[00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.940]   was often met with hindrances and difficulties which could be overcome only by faith in God,
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.420]   the originator of the mission.
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.060]   God's calling to Abraham also applies to his descendants.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:11.340]   For God said to Abraham, "In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed."
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.420]   The word seed has a threefold reference.
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.220]   In the first place, it refers to the people of Israel.
[00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:24.400]   For God said to Abraham, "I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.260]   the sand which is upon the seashore."
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:33.260]   God's purpose in raising up the nation of Israel was to show the world through their
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:40.220]   history his way of salvation and thereby bring all the nations of the world to enjoy his
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.340]   blessings.
[00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.220]   In the second place, the word seed refers to Jesus Christ.
[00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.860]   All heavenly blessings have come to us through Jesus Christ, so Paul tells us in the opening
[00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:55.400]   verses of his epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:02.060]   In the third place, the word seed refers to Christians who are called by Paul the spiritual
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.820]   children of Abraham.
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.620]   The apostle Peter has made it very clear to us that we Christians are called by God to
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.060]   the great task of blessing others, which is our mission.
[00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.220]   First Peter 3.9.
[00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.920]   Christians are missionaries.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.940]   We cannot be true Christians without being missionaries.
[00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:32.220]   We are here at this convention to realize that we are all commissioned by God for the
[00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:37.580]   great mission of taking God's blessings to the whole world.
[00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:43.500]   None of us can rightfully excuse himself from this mission.
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.900]   So Abraham's mission passed on to his descendants.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.380]   God's calling to Abraham was also given to his son Isaac.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:58.800]   And the Lord appeared unto Isaac and said, "I will bless thee and I will perform the
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.980]   promise which I gave unto Abraham thy father.
[00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:08.620]   And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."
[00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.260]   It was also given to Jacob.
[00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.100]   And behold, the Lord stood above and said to Jacob, "I am the Lord God of Abraham, and
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.260]   in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."
[00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.860]   This line of thought does not stop here.
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:32.020]   Through the mouth of Jacob, a great blessing was given to Joseph, who was the next link
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:35.140]   in the line of this mission.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:45.460]   We read in Genesis 49.22, "Joseph is a fruitful bough whose branches ran over the wall."
[00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.860]   What a beautiful metaphor for a vessel of blessing.
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.340]   We can therefore say that the spiritual trademark of the patriarchs of the people of Israel
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.260]   was "blessed to bless."
[00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:06.940]   Then this note of mission suddenly disappeared from the time of Moses onward, when the people
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:13.940]   of Israel were engaged in a desperate struggle for survival of existence and for maintenance
[00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.620]   of their faith in Jehovah.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:23.060]   The general tone of this period naturally and necessarily became one of separation from
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:28.500]   other nations in order to keep their heads above the water of the influence of heathen
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.660]   corruption and degeneration.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:38.340]   They were in a great danger of losing their spiritual identities and of being carried
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:45.460]   away by the flood of conformity to the lifestyle of their immediate neighbors.
[00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:52.020]   This historical background provides us with the light in which we see the true perspectives
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:58.620]   of the need of both the positive and negative aspects of the Christian life.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:02.660]   Positive to be means of blessing to other people.
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:09.500]   Negative to be kept from drifting into conformity to the world, which in its principles is opposed
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.620]   to our mission of blessing others.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.820]   These two aspects make up the divine balance which we must maintain in order to travel
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:22.780]   on the right path.
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:27.700]   Then time came for God to remind his people again of their mission.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.180]   God did it through the prophets.
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:35.420]   In the utterances of the prophets, we again see the people of Israel in the hand of God
[00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:39.660]   as vessel of blessing for the whole world.
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:45.900]   Their mission was definitely and clearly to go beyond their national lines and aim at
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:51.780]   the bringing of all nations to a true knowledge of God.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.540]   The teaching of the prophets tells us at least three things that have to do with missions.
[00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:01.340]   First, the universality of God's claim.
[00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:05.380]   Second, the universality of God's plan of salvation.
[00:09:05.380 --> 00:09:10.380]   Third, the universality of the messianic kingdom.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.740]   Now first, the universality of God's claim and missions.
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:23.060]   The absolute and universal claim of God is most clearly, definitely, and fully set forth
[00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:29.900]   in one single chapter in the Old Testament, the 45th chapter of the book of Isaiah, which
[00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:34.620]   is one of the most significant chapters of the whole Bible.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:39.220]   We find at least eight claims of God in this chapter.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.340]   First, Jehovah is the only God.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:48.260]   This claim is repeated nine times in this chapter.
[00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:54.460]   This God must be proclaimed and acknowledged and worshipped in all the world.
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:10:01.980]   Second, Jehovah is the God of creation, verse 18, the Lord that created the heavens, that
[00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:04.940]   formed the earth and made it.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:09.380]   The whole creation declares the glory of its creator.
[00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:14.820]   This universal lordship and ownership should be announced everywhere.
[00:10:14.820 --> 00:10:22.900]   Third, Jehovah is the God of the human race, verse 12, I have made the earth and created
[00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.820]   man upon it.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.320]   The whole human race belongs to God by virtue of creation.
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.540]   This fact must be made known to all men.
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:42.300]   Fourth, Jehovah is the God of moral order, therefore of judgment, verse 8, let the skies
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:47.100]   pour down righteousness, I the Lord have created it.
[00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:53.100]   There is only one moral order in the world and that is the order established by God and
[00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.020]   he is therefore the only judge.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:11:04.020]   Fifth, Jehovah is the God of history, verse 11, ask me of things to come, who have declared
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.940]   this from ancient times?
[00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.060]   Have not I the Lord?
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:16.580]   God shaped the history of mankind and directed toward the final fulfillment of his plan.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:24.060]   This is biblical philosophy of history which lends great support to world evangelization.
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:32.700]   Sixth, Jehovah is the God of revelation, verse 19, I have not spoken in secret.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:38.860]   God has not left the knowledge of him to the secrecy of the subtle reasonings of the wise
[00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:44.260]   but has manifested it through the prophets for all men.
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:52.020]   Seventh, Jehovah is the God of salvation for all men, verse 22, look unto me and be ye
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.460]   saved, all the ends of the earth.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:04.660]   Eighth, Jehovah is the Lord of all men, verse 23, unto me every knee shall bow.
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:10.380]   This is a microscopic presentation of almost the whole Christian doctrine.
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:17.860]   All these universal claims of God require worldwide action in evangelism and missions.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:24.660]   Second, the universality of God's plan of salvation and missions.
[00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:29.940]   In the minds of many of the prophets, the scope of God's plan of salvation certainly
[00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:33.860]   went beyond Israel and included the Gentiles.
[00:12:33.860 --> 00:12:39.220]   The prophet Isaiah said, neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:45.700]   the Lord speak, saying, the Lord hath utterly separated me from his people.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:52.020]   The prophet Zephaniah prophesied that all nations will call upon the name of God.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:58.240]   He said, I will give to the people purified lips that all of them may call on the name
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:59.800]   of the Lord.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:05.900]   The concept of purification was no longer exclusive with the people of Israel.
[00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:12.140]   The prophet Malachi made it clear that the right of worshipping God was going to be bestowed
[00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:14.380]   upon the Gentiles.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:20.260]   From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:27.100]   the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering,
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:30.300]   saith the Lord of hosts.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:36.620]   The development of the concept of the universality of God's plan of salvation in the prophecies
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:42.140]   of the Old Testament can be arranged in the following order of degree.
[00:13:42.140 --> 00:13:48.700]   First, the title of the people of God will be widened in its application to include all
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.980]   nations who were at one time strangers.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:59.980]   The prophet Hosea said, I will say to them which are not my people, thou art my people,
[00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:03.340]   and they shall say, thou art my God.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:09.860]   Second, the once closed house of God will be open to all nations who will rejoice with
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:13.900]   the people of Israel in the praise of God.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:19.800]   The house of worship will be no longer the peculiar privilege of the chosen people.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:25.780]   It was against this background that the prophet Isaiah said, his rest, referring to the house
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:28.340]   of God, shall be glorious.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:35.740]   Third, the Messiah's flag of love and protection will be flung over all nations.
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:42.140]   He will no longer be a national savior, but savior and king of the whole earth.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:49.020]   The prophet Isaiah declared that there shall be a root of Jesse, referring to Messiah,
[00:14:49.020 --> 00:14:52.300]   which will stand for an ensign of the people.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.940]   To it shall the Gentiles seek.
[00:14:55.940 --> 00:15:01.420]   Fourth, nations will be partakers of God's forgiveness of sin.
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:06.820]   The grace of purification will be granted to the Gentiles as much as to the people of
[00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:08.180]   Israel.
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:13.980]   The prophet Isaiah said, and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:19.380]   cast over all people and the evil that is spread over all nations.
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:24.980]   He will swallow up death in victory, and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:31.220]   faces, and the rebuke of his people shall be taken away from off all the earth.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:33.820]   For the Lord hath spoken it.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:40.420]   The redeemed people of all nations will commune with God with clean lips.
[00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:48.780]   Fifth, the Gentiles will turn away from their ways of iniquity and glorify God.
[00:15:48.780 --> 00:15:55.220]   Sixth, people of the ends of the earth will be taught of God's truth, and the isles shall
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:57.580]   wait for his law.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:03.580]   Seventh, the redeemed of God in the whole world will walk in the light of God.
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:08.300]   I will make judgment to rest for a light of the Gentiles.
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.980]   Eighth, not only that the Gentiles will join the people of God, but also that they will
[00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.500]   be found in the leadership of the people of God.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.460]   They will be priests and Levites.
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:26.660]   I will also of them refer to the Gentiles for priests and Levites, saith the Lord.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:33.220]   This concept was far too advanced for the average Israelite to understand.
[00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:38.220]   All this was going to be done through the instrumentality of the people of God.
[00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:43.980]   It was the prophet Zephaniah who used the clearest words to delineate the mission of
[00:16:43.980 --> 00:16:44.980]   Israel.
[00:16:44.980 --> 00:16:51.580]   He said, "It shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:56.660]   Jude and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing."
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:00.940]   Zephaniah pointed out the failure of Israel.
[00:17:00.940 --> 00:17:03.900]   They were a curse.
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:06.980]   How miserably they failed in their mission.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.140]   But God did not give them up.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:14.820]   He was going to save them and help them to carry out their mission, to be a blessing
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:17.340]   to the whole world.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:24.700]   Third, the universality of the Messianic kingdom and missions.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:31.660]   The concept of the Messianic kingdom is essential and central in the Old Testament prophecies.
[00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:37.860]   Again, the scope of this kingdom far transcends the boundaries of Israel.
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:45.500]   The idea of mission is intrinsically present in the universality of the Messianic kingdom.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:50.220]   I'm going to mention three things about the Messianic kingdom.
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:54.780]   The king, the capital, and the dominion.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:18:03.820]   The king of the Messianic kingdom has a threefold role as servant, as prophet, and as ruler.
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:11.180]   The Messianic king as a servant and a missioner is a most significant and profound concept
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.180]   in the sublime prophecies of the book of Isaiah.
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:19.780]   And it is one of the wonders of God's plan of salvation.
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:25.700]   The Messianic king had a mission, the fulfillment of which involves suffering and sacrifice
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.060]   on his own part.
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:34.620]   As the servant, the king's visage was marred more than any man and his form more than the
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:36.300]   sons of man.
[00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:42.660]   The prophet Isaiah also emphatically pointed out that the sufferings of this servant king
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:50.220]   sprinkle many nations, which means that the efficacy of his sacrifice riches the whole
[00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.220]   world.
[00:18:53.220 --> 00:18:57.180]   The Messiah is king, servant, prophet.
[00:18:57.180 --> 00:19:03.220]   His role as prophet is by no means the slightest of his offices.
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:07.580]   He shall be exalted and extolled and be very high.
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:12.820]   Kings shall shut their mouths at him, for that which had not been told them shall they
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:18.460]   see and that which they had not heard shall they consider.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:25.620]   To the Gentiles, the Messiah will be their light, the light of truth, wisdom, and judgment.
[00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:32.900]   This light was to be sent to the ends of the earth by the people of God.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:36.080]   The Messiah will be ruler of all nations.
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.840]   His kingdom will cover the whole earth.
[00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:44.300]   God said, "Behold, I have given him," referring to the Davidic king, "for a witness to the
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.260]   people, a leader and commander to his people.
[00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:54.740]   Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, a nation that knew not thee
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:59.520]   shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God."
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:05.260]   It is clearly pointed out here that the Messiah will be the king of nations, not merely the
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:07.220]   king of Israel.
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:13.420]   The lordship of this king shall be proclaimed throughout the width and breadth of the globe
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.940]   through evangelism and missions.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:23.940]   The capital of the Messianic kingdom, Jerusalem as the capital of the Messianic kingdom, will
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:27.540]   be the center of blessing for the whole world.
[00:20:27.540 --> 00:20:34.300]   The 87th Psalm presents to us a precious and beautiful picture of the world's significance
[00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.980]   of Jerusalem.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.460]   The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.260]   I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as they that know me.
[00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:49.780]   Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia.
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:55.780]   And of Zion it shall be said, "This and that man was born in her."
[00:20:55.780 --> 00:21:03.460]   This means that Zion or Jerusalem is the spiritual fatherland of many Gentile peoples.
[00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:08.220]   Then the Psalmist goes on to describe the joy and blessings of the sons and daughters
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.220]   of Jerusalem.
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:15.060]   "The singers as well as the players on instruments shall be there in Jerusalem and they shall
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.180]   say, 'All my springs of joy are in thee.'"
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:24.340]   The prophet Isaiah sings of Jerusalem as the center of Messianic blessings.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:31.820]   "The Gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising."
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:38.060]   In regard to the dominion of the Messianic kingdom, the prophet Zechariah cries in prophecy,
[00:21:38.060 --> 00:21:41.180]   "Behold, thy king cometh unto thee.
[00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:48.420]   He is just and having salvation, lowly and riding upon a nass and upon a colt.
[00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:54.140]   His dominion shall be from sea even to sea and from the river even to the ends of the
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.140]   earth."
[00:21:55.140 --> 00:22:02.020]   Evidently, this wonderful prophecy has been fulfilled in Jesus Christ who entered Jerusalem
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:08.820]   on a colt and whose spiritual dominion is from sea to sea even to the ends of the earth.
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:13.700]   All this has been brought about by God through missions.
[00:22:13.700 --> 00:22:21.180]   Even God has done it in the past, he is doing it at the present time.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:26.580]   I'll skip the next section on the prophet's missionary visions.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:33.660]   Now for the last part of my message this morning, let us do some thinking about the crises in
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:37.620]   the history of Israel regarding their mission.
[00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:41.740]   The first crisis was Abraham's hearing.
[00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:43.700]   Abraham's hearing.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:48.100]   Abraham, as great as he was in faith, had his failure.
[00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:53.660]   He stopped short of God's calling when he discontinued his journey at Haran, halfway
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:58.780]   between his native country and the land where God wanted him to go.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:04.140]   But thanks to God, he only stopped there for a limited period of time.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.540]   God called him again and he rose and pressed on.
[00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:13.940]   In regard to Abraham's experience, let us take special notice of two things which are
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.420]   of special importance.
[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:22.420]   In the first place, God asked him to get out of his own country and from his kindred and
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:26.740]   from his father's house and to a land he would show him.
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:33.220]   That was an absolute condition which Abraham must fulfill before he could reach a place
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:37.540]   where he was blessed and became a blessing to others.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:43.700]   We are reminded here that we must be willing to have a radical departure from our accustomed
[00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:49.660]   way of life, which is so natural and so easy to our self-centeredness, and move on to a
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:57.500]   new path of life which is rightly called the land of milk and honey because it is spiritually
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:24:00.100]   fruitful.
[00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:07.060]   Abraham was faced with a tremendous choice, a choice on which hand not only his own destiny,
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:14.940]   but also the destiny of a nation and indeed the destiny of the whole world.
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:18.620]   It was a most serious crisis.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:23.820]   Abraham made the right choice and he obeyed the call of God.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:30.620]   The change of his name from Abraham to Abraham is a beautiful symbol of the transformation
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.380]   that took place in his life.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:39.260]   Abraham means exalted father, but Abraham means father of nations.
[00:24:39.260 --> 00:24:45.980]   This change of name indicates that the center of Abraham's life moved from himself to his
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:49.540]   relationship with others.
[00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:55.940]   Abraham's offering of his only beloved son as a sacrifice to God was the peak of his
[00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:59.060]   life of self-negation.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:06.580]   Only following the selfless act, God reiterated his great promise to him, "In thee shall all
[00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:09.920]   the families of the earth be blessed."
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:16.420]   In the second place, there are at least two conditions which Abraham must fulfill before
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:20.900]   he could accept the call of God and became a vessel of blessing.
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:28.300]   The first condition is that Abraham must understand that his own blessing and the blessing of
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:32.780]   other people are linked together as one thing.
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.700]   They can never be separated from each other.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:38.780]   He could not take the one and leave the other.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:42.260]   The two form one organic whole.
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:48.060]   Abraham did understand this twofold nature of the call of God and he obeyed.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:53.880]   God always hides his blessings for us in our willingness to be a blessing to others.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:56.980]   God hides his love in his commandment.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:01.140]   God hides his rich rewards in our obedience.
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:06.060]   God hides his best treasures in a self-denying life.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:10.260]   God's ways are higher than our ways.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:17.220]   Christ says, "Give and it shall be given unto you, good measure pressed down and shaken
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:23.360]   together and running over shall man give it into your bosom."
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.740]   The second condition is that Abraham must have faith before he could accept the call
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:35.140]   of God to be a blessing because trial and hardship are involved in such a life.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:39.780]   Many times in his life, things seem to go against the promises of God.
[00:26:39.780 --> 00:26:45.260]   God's promises to him had to do with three things, his seed, the promised land and the
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:51.140]   nations, but he was greatly tried in all these three aspects.
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:26:55.900]   God promised to give him the land of Canaan, but he arrived there only to find it already
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.340]   occupied by others.
[00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:03.980]   God promised to give him a son, but he had to wait for 25 years.
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:08.740]   God promised that he would be a blessing to nations, but he actually brought trouble to
[00:27:08.740 --> 00:27:11.060]   the land of Jerar.
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:17.220]   In view of all this, he simply must have faith before he could stand firm in face of all
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:18.580]   these trials.
[00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:25.700]   Today, we too must have faith before we can have victory over all the forces that assemble
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:30.340]   to drive us away from the path of blessing.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:36.860]   The second great crisis in the history of Israel rose when the Israelites began their
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.460]   wandering in the wilderness.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.780]   They had crossed the Red Sea and had been delivered from the land of slavery, but that
[00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.820]   was only the beginning of their salvation.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:50.420]   They were saved, but saved for what?
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:55.660]   Certainly, they were not saved in order to wander in the wilderness.
[00:27:55.660 --> 00:27:58.180]   They were wandering away their lives.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:27:59.820]   What a tragedy!
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:05.500]   Unless they stopped wandering and crossed the River Jordan, their salvation from Egypt
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.660]   would be countenance.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:12.900]   They would never inherit the land of promise and fulfill God's plan.
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:16.100]   They wandered for 40 years in the wilderness.
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:22.220]   They squandered away most years of their lives in the barrenness of life.
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:23.940]   What a heartache!
[00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:27.980]   The wandering life is a life without goal and purpose.
[00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:29.980]   It never gets anywhere.
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.240]   It will finish in bitter emptiness.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.700]   But the grace of God did not fail.
[00:28:36.700 --> 00:28:42.140]   There were Joshua and Caleb and those who followed them in crossing the River Jordan,
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.420]   and they inherited the land of promise.
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:51.720]   The third crisis in the history of Israel took place when they faced the issue of choosing
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.980]   between Jehovah and man as their king.
[00:28:55.980 --> 00:29:01.180]   At this most critical hour, they made the tragic decision of enthroning man instead
[00:29:01.180 --> 00:29:03.060]   of God.
[00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:09.020]   Man taking the place of God always results in self-centeredness, which is the root of
[00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:11.660]   all sin and miseries.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:17.020]   When man rebels against God, he in fact rebels against his own good.
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:23.380]   In rejecting the rule of God, man takes the only alternative left for him, the alternative
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:27.300]   of falling under the tyranny of self.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:33.000]   The situation of man today is essentially the same as 3,000 years ago when the people
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.900]   of Israel made the tragic mistake.
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:42.460]   The modern man is trying his best to get rid of God, and he has indeed set up his own kings
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.980]   under whose reign he suffers merciless slavery.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:52.020]   There is the king of sex, there is the king of drugs, there is the king of violence, there
[00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:55.860]   is the king of meaninglessness of life.
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:04.820]   Man has become a curse and a burden to himself as well as to others instead of a blessing.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:10.220]   Today under the cloak of freedom, man is suffering slavery.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:16.100]   One of the popular slogans today is that man has come of age and has no longer need of
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:17.100]   God.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:24.980]   Yes, God is dead and man is free, free to fall under the yoke of standardless subjectivism
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:33.460]   and self-centeredness, which has the promise of becoming the worst tyranny ever known yet.
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:38.860]   The fourth crisis, fleeing from the errand of peace.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:44.700]   God in his grace planned to save the people of the gentile city of Nineveh, and he revealed
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.940]   his mind to Jonah.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:52.660]   God commissioned Jonah as a missionary to take the message of reconciliation to Nineveh,
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:59.100]   but being preoccupied with a narrow and misled patriotism, he fled away from his mission
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:02.620]   and went to Tarshish instead of Nineveh.
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:08.420]   This attitude on the part of Jonah shows how ignorant the people of Israel were in regard
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:10.060]   to their mission.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:14.980]   It seems that by this time in the history of the chosen people, the significance of
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:20.820]   God's calling to Abraham had more or less completely gone out of their minds.
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:27.260]   It is a great tragedy that Jonah as a prophet should have lost sight of God's main purpose
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:30.140]   in all his plan.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:32.620]   Jonah was a man of contradictions.
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:38.780]   His name Jonah means a dove, which is symbolic of peace, yet he refused to be a messenger
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:40.580]   of peace.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:46.220]   He was a prophet who should understand the will of God and obey it and help others to
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:52.260]   obey it, yet he acted contrary to the explicit commandment of God.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:57.060]   He told the people on board the boat that he knew Jehovah, who was the Lord of heaven
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:02.900]   and earth, yet he would not allow him to be the Lord of his own life.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:11.420]   He said that he knew the love of God, yet he acted as if the love of God was non-existent.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:19.060]   God graciously intervened and Jonah learned a great lesson through suffering, but he did
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:25.300]   not really learn the lesson well until he saw the heart of God as recorded in the fourth
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.860]   chapter of the book of Jonah.
[00:32:27.860 --> 00:32:33.220]   In this light, we can easily see that the book of Jonah is one of the greatest books
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:40.180]   of the Bible because it picked up the lost thread of Israel's mission.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:47.420]   It seems that suffering is almost indispensable in the hand of God as a corrective measure
[00:32:47.420 --> 00:32:55.160]   for his constantly erring people, both in the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:00.700]   As we all well remember, the early church began to spread the gospel outside Jerusalem
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:03.260]   when they were persecuted.
[00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:05.380]   Does it have to come in that way?
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:11.740]   Do we have to suffer before we obey the will of God?
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:18.180]   The fifth crisis, tower building instead of bridge building.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:23.860]   In the minds of David and Solomon, the building of the temple was meant to be a bridge, the
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:28.740]   bridge of making known the grace and truth of God to the whole world.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:35.060]   Solomon, in his dedication prayer for the temple, definitely included the Gentiles among
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:38.940]   the recipients of blessings from the house of God.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:45.900]   But to the people of Israel, this bridge became a tower, the tower of national pride.
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:52.860]   The Bible tells us that following man's estrangement from God, he began to be interested in tower
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:58.940]   building, of which the tower of Babel was the prototype.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:05.420]   Man wants to exalt and glorify himself by building himself towers of fame.
[00:34:05.420 --> 00:34:12.060]   As a result, there are so many high towers that the view of Calvary is completely blocked
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:14.300]   out.
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:21.100]   There are so many tower builders and so few bridge builders that God has a hard time in
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:26.620]   finding people who are willing to be blessing bearers.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:32.580]   In the history of Israel, the temple became more of a symbol of national self-centeredness
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.940]   than that of blessing to others.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:42.020]   Are we tower builders or bridge builders?
[00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:53.820]   The sixth crisis, dissociation of election from its purpose.
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:58.820]   The people of Israel were proud of their election as the chosen people of God, but they forgot
[00:34:58.820 --> 00:35:03.980]   that they were elected for a purpose, the purpose of blessing the whole world through
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:04.980]   them.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.940]   They took the privilege of election and laid aside its purpose.
[00:35:09.940 --> 00:35:14.660]   This was the fatal dissociation which hindered the plan of God.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:20.980]   As a matter of fact, the people of Israel were laid aside by God because they laid aside
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:23.180]   their mission.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:29.140]   The apostle Paul has made it very clear to us in Romans 11 that the people of Israel
[00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:35.940]   lost their privilege exactly because of this failure, and that God, in his infinite wisdom,
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:42.420]   made use of their failure to bless the whole world by putting the church in their place.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:46.460]   Shall we commit the same fatal mistake?
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:52.340]   If we believe that we as Christians are the elect people of God, shall we too take the
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:57.540]   privilege and lay aside the responsibility?
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:36:03.420]   When the apostle Paul talked about predestination, he did so against the background of active
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:10.700]   evangelism. The biblical doctrine of predestination is not merely the statement that some people
[00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:18.620]   are preordained by God to eternal life, but it is that statement plus active evangelism,
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:22.020]   which is its living context.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:26.640]   Truth taken out of its living context is no longer truth.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:32.180]   The doctrine of election as related to the people of Israel and the doctrine of predestination
[00:36:32.180 --> 00:36:39.860]   as related to Christians have one basic thing in common, that is, both of them mean election
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:43.660]   and mission.
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.180]   The seventh crisis, Esther's great decision.
[00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:53.500]   The destiny of the Israelite people hinged on Esther's decision.
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:59.740]   Whether he chose to care for her own privilege and pleasure in the Persian palace, or she
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:04.020]   preferred risking her life for the good of her people.
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:09.100]   It was only too easy for her to decide on the former, as we often do.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:16.540]   But the strong and resolute voice of one man of God influenced her and guided her thinking,
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:19.740]   and she made the right decision.
[00:37:19.740 --> 00:37:27.980]   Her soul was shaken by the challenge of Mordecai, who said to her, "And who knowest whether
[00:37:27.980 --> 00:37:32.300]   thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:38.420]   Then she began to think of her responsibility in the light of her privileged position as
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:46.020]   the queen of the empire, and that altered the whole fate of the people of Israel.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:52.500]   Yes, it is not exaggerating to say that the right understanding of the balance between
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:58.420]   privilege and responsibility and acting thereupon on the part of the average Christian will
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:03.660]   change the whole course of the Church of Christ today.
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:09.660]   Thank God for having graciously raised up a Mordecaian voice of warning and challenge
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:17.900]   for every generation, so that all Christians may be reminded of their mission.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:25.420]   I think I'm justified in saying that this convention is one of the major forces in the
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:30.540]   movings of God along the line of carrying out his worldwide mission.
[00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:37.420]   May God raise up many missionaries in this convention to further his mission of blessing
[00:38:37.420 --> 00:38:38.620]   near and far.
