00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,640
 Hello, I am Wong Kwok Wai

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,040
 Director of the Chinese Academy of Psychiatry

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:10,840
 and a pastor of the Catholic Church

5
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,640
 Today I would like to introduce a book

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,200
 called "Alone Together"

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,960
 It is translated from Chinese to Japanese

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:21,400
 and is called "在一起孤獨"

9
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,360
 The author is Sherry Turco

10
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,320
 She studied psychology and psychology

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,200
 in the United States in the 1970s

12
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:34,720
 She started her research in the US

13
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,200
 in the 70s

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:38,200
 She studied the relationship between people

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:44,640
 and the internet and computers

16
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,040
 that were developed over time

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,040
 In the early 70s and 80s

18
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,760
 when the internet and computers were popular

19
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,000
 she was very excited

20
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,360
 She thought that people could communicate

21
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,480
 with each other in a large number of ways

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,520
 and that it would help human relations

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,200
 But when she continued to do research

24
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,320
 she found that it was not necessarily the case

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,960
 She found that today

26
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,480
 especially when it is convenient to communicate by mobile phone

27
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,920
 or by short message

28
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:15,280
 it may be a negative influence on us

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,320
 In fact, we often think that technology is a tool

30
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,200
 like I use it, it won't affect us

31
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,720
 But it is not

32
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,680
 Let's see

33
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,600
 If we have a tool

34
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,560
 we use it a lot

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,280
 our hands will get numb

36
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,960
 And we will find that technology

37
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,240
 is also a potential impact on our culture

38
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,680
 For example

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,200
 before the bell

40
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,600
 when was the time to go to class

41
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,560
 when was the time to finish the teacher's speech

42
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,040
 When he finished his speech

43
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,080
 when he finished what he wanted to say

44
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,920
 But how do we decide today

45
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,240
 when the worship is over

46
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,920
 We just look at the bell

47
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,440
 So we find that the emergence of technology

48
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,480
 is affecting our culture

49
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,600
 So this author's research

50
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,120
 especially in the field of communication

51
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,160
 tells us

52
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:06,880
 how our human relations

53
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,720
 are affected by mobile phones and short messages

54
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,480
 Simply put, she found that

55
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,640
 these short messages and communications

56
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,880
 let us put people around us

57
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,760
 or the objects we communicate with

58
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,400
 in a very safe place

59
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,280
 What does it mean?

60
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:24,040
 I can touch it

61
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,120
 But it won't get close to a place

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,240
 that is affecting me

63
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
 Maybe everyone will do this in a short message

64
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,880
 I can touch it

65
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,440
 But it may be very simple

66
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,360
 Do I need to see it

67
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,600
 to see its eyebrows?

68
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,720
 It's not very useful

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,920
 So we are very comfortable

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,160
 We can put it in a place where we can touch it

71
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,240
 The author's point is to connect it

72
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,520
 But he said

73
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
 As time goes by

74
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,840
 especially the younger generation

75
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,640
 have less chance to meet people and talk to them

76
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,520
 They don't know how to look at people's eyebrows

77
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,560
 or respond to them

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,880
 They don't know how to communicate with people

79
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,720
 He said

80
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,760
 We know how to connect with people

81
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,160
 but we don't know how to communicate with people

82
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,680
 But he also observed one thing

83
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,040
 It turns out that people

84
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,800
 have a deep relationship with others

85
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,240
 It's very important

86
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,240
 So he said

87
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,160
 What phenomenon will technology bring?

88
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,360
 We are looking forward to having a deep communication with people

89
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,480
 But we are not very good at doing things

90
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,400
 because of the influence of technology

91
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,640
 It brings such an impact

92
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,080
 I especially like

93
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,200
 This author is not a Christian

94
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,240
 But the results of his research

95
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,440
 are very consistent with what the Bible says

96
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,680
 The Bible says

97
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,960
 Loneliness is a bad thing

98
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,040
 Lonely

99
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,520
 So God wants to solve loneliness

100
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,160
 Maybe he uses a lot of animals in the beginning

101
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,720
 to see if he can be his companion

102
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
 But it doesn't work

103
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,880
 God eventually has to be a man

104
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:52,120
 And we immediately find that

105
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,040
 it is a very troublesome thing

106
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,880
 Maybe God requires a lot from us

107
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,640
 Maybe God has a lot of restrictions

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,240
 It is very difficult for us to love each other

109
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,800
 But according to this author

110
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,200
 if we only put our relationship with others

111
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,600
 in a state of "I am comfortable"

112
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,920
 and "It's for my own good"

113
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,000
 it is not a very satisfactory relationship

114
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,480
 Let's go back to the Bible

115
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,800
 God bestowed the cross to Adam

116
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,760
 But in the end, everyone committed a crime

117
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,640
 and it was very troublesome

118
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
 The interesting thing is

119
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,000
 our interpersonal relationship

120
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,080
 may teach us that

121
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,480
 yes, love each other

122
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,480
 It may be very troublesome to

123
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,720
 hold on to someone I don't like

124
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,240
 But the richness of our life

125
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,560
 our love for each other

126
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,880
 can be obtained in these relationships

127
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,920
 So I think this book is very open

128
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,960
 If you have time to read it

129
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,960
 I hope you will like it

130
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:53,960
