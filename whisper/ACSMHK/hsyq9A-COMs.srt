1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,100
 The gathering of 15,000 students here at the convention is a strong indication to the world

2
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:21,400
 that Christian young people today are still vitally concerned about evangelism and missions

3
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:28,440
 as an expression of their obedience to the Lord's great commission.

4
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:36,400
 This convention is a tremendous encouragement as well as challenge to all Christians of

5
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:41,520
 the world in regard to missions.

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:48,120
 You have come here to study evangelism missions and more important to find out God's will

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,360
 for your lives.

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:58,420
 I pray that this convention will be an instrument in the hand of the Almighty God for the reinforcement

9
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,800
 of the missionary cause in the whole world.

10
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:13,760
 I want to express my gratitude to the planning committee of this convention for giving me

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:20,840
 this precious privilege of having a share in the great fellowship of this convention.

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,320
 I deeply feel my own unworthiness to stand here as a speaker.

13
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,140
 Your prayer for me will be greatly valued and appreciated.

14
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:42,500
 The theme of my message these four mornings is biblical basis of missions.

15
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:48,500
 I divide this theme into four subtitles.

16
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:53,100
 First the basis of missions in the Old Testament.

17
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,180
 Second the basis of missions in the Gospels, that is Christ and missions.

18
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:07,820
 Third the basis of missions in the Book of Acts, that is the Holy Spirit and missions.

19
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:15,940
 Fourth the basis of missions in the Epistles, that is the Church and missions.

20
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,820
 This morning we take up the first subtitle.

21
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,580
 The basis of missions in the Old Testament.

22
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:32,660
 The Bible is a record of a mission, the divine mission of saving the human race, carried

23
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:37,860
 out by the triune God and his commissioned people.

24
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:42,680
 The history of the people of Israel is the history of a mission.

25
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,120
 The record of the corporate mission of the people of Israel began with the fascinating

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,260
 story of a personal mission, the mission of Abraham.

27
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:59,580
 The burden of Abraham's mission is clearly stated in God's calling to him.

28
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:06,260
 God said to him, "I will bless thee and thou shall be a blessing and in thee shall all

29
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:09,580
 families of the earth be blessed."

30
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:17,700
 That was a great mission, the mission of blessing the whole world.

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,780
 Abraham became a great missionary, all missionary.

32
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,860
 God called Abraham and he responded in faith.

33
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:33,260
 He left behind his old way of life and started the pilgrimage of a heavenly errand.

34
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:39,180
 Abraham is called the father of faith, but his faith was means to an end and that end

35
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:41,300
 was a mission.

36
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,340
 Faith by itself is without content.

37
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:50,260
 In the life of Abraham, faith was required of him because the carrying out of his mission

38
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:56,940
 was often met with hindrances and difficulties which could be overcome only by faith in God,

39
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,420
 the originator of the mission.

40
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,060
 God's calling to Abraham also applies to his descendants.

41
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:11,340
 For God said to Abraham, "In thy seed shall all nations of the earth be blessed."

42
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:14,420
 The word seed has a threefold reference.

43
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,220
 In the first place, it refers to the people of Israel.

44
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:24,400
 For God said to Abraham, "I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as

45
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,260
 the sand which is upon the seashore."

46
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,260
 God's purpose in raising up the nation of Israel was to show the world through their

47
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:40,220
 history his way of salvation and thereby bring all the nations of the world to enjoy his

48
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,340
 blessings.

49
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:46,220
 In the second place, the word seed refers to Jesus Christ.

50
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,860
 All heavenly blessings have come to us through Jesus Christ, so Paul tells us in the opening

51
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:55,400
 verses of his epistle to the Ephesians.

52
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,060
 In the third place, the word seed refers to Christians who are called by Paul the spiritual

53
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,820
 children of Abraham.

54
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:10,620
 The apostle Peter has made it very clear to us that we Christians are called by God to

55
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,060
 the great task of blessing others, which is our mission.

56
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,220
 First Peter 3.9.

57
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,920
 Christians are missionaries.

58
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,940
 We cannot be true Christians without being missionaries.

59
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:32,220
 We are here at this convention to realize that we are all commissioned by God for the

60
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,580
 great mission of taking God's blessings to the whole world.

61
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:43,500
 None of us can rightfully excuse himself from this mission.

62
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,900
 So Abraham's mission passed on to his descendants.

63
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:53,380
 God's calling to Abraham was also given to his son Isaac.

64
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:58,800
 And the Lord appeared unto Isaac and said, "I will bless thee and I will perform the

65
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,980
 promise which I gave unto Abraham thy father.

66
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:08,620
 And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed."

67
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:11,260
 It was also given to Jacob.

68
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:17,100
 And behold, the Lord stood above and said to Jacob, "I am the Lord God of Abraham, and

69
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:22,260
 in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed."

70
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,860
 This line of thought does not stop here.

71
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:32,020
 Through the mouth of Jacob, a great blessing was given to Joseph, who was the next link

72
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,140
 in the line of this mission.

73
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:45,460
 We read in Genesis 49.22, "Joseph is a fruitful bough whose branches ran over the wall."

74
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:49,860
 What a beautiful metaphor for a vessel of blessing.

75
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:55,340
 We can therefore say that the spiritual trademark of the patriarchs of the people of Israel

76
00:06:55,340 --> 00:07:00,260
 was "blessed to bless."

77
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:06,940
 Then this note of mission suddenly disappeared from the time of Moses onward, when the people

78
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:13,940
 of Israel were engaged in a desperate struggle for survival of existence and for maintenance

79
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,620
 of their faith in Jehovah.

80
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:23,060
 The general tone of this period naturally and necessarily became one of separation from

81
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,500
 other nations in order to keep their heads above the water of the influence of heathen

82
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,660
 corruption and degeneration.

83
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:38,340
 They were in a great danger of losing their spiritual identities and of being carried

84
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:45,460
 away by the flood of conformity to the lifestyle of their immediate neighbors.

85
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:52,020
 This historical background provides us with the light in which we see the true perspectives

86
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,620
 of the need of both the positive and negative aspects of the Christian life.

87
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,660
 Positive to be means of blessing to other people.

88
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:09,500
 Negative to be kept from drifting into conformity to the world, which in its principles is opposed

89
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,620
 to our mission of blessing others.

90
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:19,820
 These two aspects make up the divine balance which we must maintain in order to travel

91
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,780
 on the right path.

92
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,700
 Then time came for God to remind his people again of their mission.

93
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:30,180
 God did it through the prophets.

94
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:35,420
 In the utterances of the prophets, we again see the people of Israel in the hand of God

95
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,660
 as vessel of blessing for the whole world.

96
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:45,900
 Their mission was definitely and clearly to go beyond their national lines and aim at

97
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:51,780
 the bringing of all nations to a true knowledge of God.

98
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:57,540
 The teaching of the prophets tells us at least three things that have to do with missions.

99
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,340
 First, the universality of God's claim.

100
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:05,380
 Second, the universality of God's plan of salvation.

101
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:10,380
 Third, the universality of the messianic kingdom.

102
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:15,740
 Now first, the universality of God's claim and missions.

103
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:23,060
 The absolute and universal claim of God is most clearly, definitely, and fully set forth

104
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:29,900
 in one single chapter in the Old Testament, the 45th chapter of the book of Isaiah, which

105
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:34,620
 is one of the most significant chapters of the whole Bible.

106
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:39,220
 We find at least eight claims of God in this chapter.

107
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:43,340
 First, Jehovah is the only God.

108
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,260
 This claim is repeated nine times in this chapter.

109
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:54,460
 This God must be proclaimed and acknowledged and worshipped in all the world.

110
00:09:54,460 --> 00:10:01,980
 Second, Jehovah is the God of creation, verse 18, the Lord that created the heavens, that

111
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,940
 formed the earth and made it.

112
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,380
 The whole creation declares the glory of its creator.

113
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:14,820
 This universal lordship and ownership should be announced everywhere.

114
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:22,900
 Third, Jehovah is the God of the human race, verse 12, I have made the earth and created

115
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,820
 man upon it.

116
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:29,320
 The whole human race belongs to God by virtue of creation.

117
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:33,540
 This fact must be made known to all men.

118
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:42,300
 Fourth, Jehovah is the God of moral order, therefore of judgment, verse 8, let the skies

119
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,100
 pour down righteousness, I the Lord have created it.

120
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:53,100
 There is only one moral order in the world and that is the order established by God and

121
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,020
 he is therefore the only judge.

122
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:04,020
 Fifth, Jehovah is the God of history, verse 11, ask me of things to come, who have declared

123
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:06,940
 this from ancient times?

124
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,060
 Have not I the Lord?

125
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:16,580
 God shaped the history of mankind and directed toward the final fulfillment of his plan.

126
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:24,060
 This is biblical philosophy of history which lends great support to world evangelization.

127
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:32,700
 Sixth, Jehovah is the God of revelation, verse 19, I have not spoken in secret.

128
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,860
 God has not left the knowledge of him to the secrecy of the subtle reasonings of the wise

129
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:44,260
 but has manifested it through the prophets for all men.

130
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:52,020
 Seventh, Jehovah is the God of salvation for all men, verse 22, look unto me and be ye

131
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,460
 saved, all the ends of the earth.

132
00:11:55,460 --> 00:12:04,660
 Eighth, Jehovah is the Lord of all men, verse 23, unto me every knee shall bow.

133
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:10,380
 This is a microscopic presentation of almost the whole Christian doctrine.

134
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:17,860
 All these universal claims of God require worldwide action in evangelism and missions.

135
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:24,660
 Second, the universality of God's plan of salvation and missions.

136
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:29,940
 In the minds of many of the prophets, the scope of God's plan of salvation certainly

137
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,860
 went beyond Israel and included the Gentiles.

138
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:39,220
 The prophet Isaiah said, neither let the son of the stranger that hath joined himself to

139
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,700
 the Lord speak, saying, the Lord hath utterly separated me from his people.

140
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:52,020
 The prophet Zephaniah prophesied that all nations will call upon the name of God.

141
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:58,240
 He said, I will give to the people purified lips that all of them may call on the name

142
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,800
 of the Lord.

143
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:05,900
 The concept of purification was no longer exclusive with the people of Israel.

144
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:12,140
 The prophet Malachi made it clear that the right of worshipping God was going to be bestowed

145
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,380
 upon the Gentiles.

146
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:20,260
 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same, my name shall be great among

147
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:27,100
 the Gentiles, and in every place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering,

148
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,300
 saith the Lord of hosts.

149
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:36,620
 The development of the concept of the universality of God's plan of salvation in the prophecies

150
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:42,140
 of the Old Testament can be arranged in the following order of degree.

151
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:48,700
 First, the title of the people of God will be widened in its application to include all

152
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:52,980
 nations who were at one time strangers.

153
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:59,980
 The prophet Hosea said, I will say to them which are not my people, thou art my people,

154
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,340
 and they shall say, thou art my God.

155
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:09,860
 Second, the once closed house of God will be open to all nations who will rejoice with

156
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,900
 the people of Israel in the praise of God.

157
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:19,800
 The house of worship will be no longer the peculiar privilege of the chosen people.

158
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:25,780
 It was against this background that the prophet Isaiah said, his rest, referring to the house

159
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,340
 of God, shall be glorious.

160
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:35,740
 Third, the Messiah's flag of love and protection will be flung over all nations.

161
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:42,140
 He will no longer be a national savior, but savior and king of the whole earth.

162
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:49,020
 The prophet Isaiah declared that there shall be a root of Jesse, referring to Messiah,

163
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,300
 which will stand for an ensign of the people.

164
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:55,940
 To it shall the Gentiles seek.

165
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:01,420
 Fourth, nations will be partakers of God's forgiveness of sin.

166
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:06,820
 The grace of purification will be granted to the Gentiles as much as to the people of

167
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,180
 Israel.

168
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:13,980
 The prophet Isaiah said, and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering

169
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:19,380
 cast over all people and the evil that is spread over all nations.

170
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,980
 He will swallow up death in victory, and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all

171
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:31,220
 faces, and the rebuke of his people shall be taken away from off all the earth.

172
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:33,820
 For the Lord hath spoken it.

173
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:40,420
 The redeemed people of all nations will commune with God with clean lips.

174
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:48,780
 Fifth, the Gentiles will turn away from their ways of iniquity and glorify God.

175
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:55,220
 Sixth, people of the ends of the earth will be taught of God's truth, and the isles shall

176
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:57,580
 wait for his law.

177
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:03,580
 Seventh, the redeemed of God in the whole world will walk in the light of God.

178
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:08,300
 I will make judgment to rest for a light of the Gentiles.

179
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:13,980
 Eighth, not only that the Gentiles will join the people of God, but also that they will

180
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,500
 be found in the leadership of the people of God.

181
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,460
 They will be priests and Levites.

182
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:26,660
 I will also of them refer to the Gentiles for priests and Levites, saith the Lord.

183
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:33,220
 This concept was far too advanced for the average Israelite to understand.

184
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:38,220
 All this was going to be done through the instrumentality of the people of God.

185
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:43,980
 It was the prophet Zephaniah who used the clearest words to delineate the mission of

186
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,980
 Israel.

187
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:51,580
 He said, "It shall come to pass that as ye were a curse among the heathen, O house of

188
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:56,660
 Jude and house of Israel, so will I save you, and ye shall be a blessing."

189
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:00,940
 Zephaniah pointed out the failure of Israel.

190
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,900
 They were a curse.

191
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,980
 How miserably they failed in their mission.

192
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,140
 But God did not give them up.

193
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:14,820
 He was going to save them and help them to carry out their mission, to be a blessing

194
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,340
 to the whole world.

195
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:24,700
 Third, the universality of the Messianic kingdom and missions.

196
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:31,660
 The concept of the Messianic kingdom is essential and central in the Old Testament prophecies.

197
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:37,860
 Again, the scope of this kingdom far transcends the boundaries of Israel.

198
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:45,500
 The idea of mission is intrinsically present in the universality of the Messianic kingdom.

199
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:50,220
 I'm going to mention three things about the Messianic kingdom.

200
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:54,780
 The king, the capital, and the dominion.

201
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:03,820
 The king of the Messianic kingdom has a threefold role as servant, as prophet, and as ruler.

202
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:11,180
 The Messianic king as a servant and a missioner is a most significant and profound concept

203
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:15,180
 in the sublime prophecies of the book of Isaiah.

204
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:19,780
 And it is one of the wonders of God's plan of salvation.

205
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:25,700
 The Messianic king had a mission, the fulfillment of which involves suffering and sacrifice

206
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,060
 on his own part.

207
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:34,620
 As the servant, the king's visage was marred more than any man and his form more than the

208
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,300
 sons of man.

209
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:42,660
 The prophet Isaiah also emphatically pointed out that the sufferings of this servant king

210
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:50,220
 sprinkle many nations, which means that the efficacy of his sacrifice riches the whole

211
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,220
 world.

212
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:57,180
 The Messiah is king, servant, prophet.

213
00:18:57,180 --> 00:19:03,220
 His role as prophet is by no means the slightest of his offices.

214
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:07,580
 He shall be exalted and extolled and be very high.

215
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:12,820
 Kings shall shut their mouths at him, for that which had not been told them shall they

216
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:18,460
 see and that which they had not heard shall they consider.

217
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:25,620
 To the Gentiles, the Messiah will be their light, the light of truth, wisdom, and judgment.

218
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:32,900
 This light was to be sent to the ends of the earth by the people of God.

219
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,080
 The Messiah will be ruler of all nations.

220
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,840
 His kingdom will cover the whole earth.

221
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:44,300
 God said, "Behold, I have given him," referring to the Davidic king, "for a witness to the

222
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,260
 people, a leader and commander to his people.

223
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:54,740
 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, a nation that knew not thee

224
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:59,520
 shall run unto thee because of the Lord thy God."

225
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,260
 It is clearly pointed out here that the Messiah will be the king of nations, not merely the

226
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:07,220
 king of Israel.

227
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:13,420
 The lordship of this king shall be proclaimed throughout the width and breadth of the globe

228
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,940
 through evangelism and missions.

229
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:23,940
 The capital of the Messianic kingdom, Jerusalem as the capital of the Messianic kingdom, will

230
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,540
 be the center of blessing for the whole world.

231
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:34,300
 The 87th Psalm presents to us a precious and beautiful picture of the world's significance

232
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,980
 of Jerusalem.

233
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,460
 The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.

234
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:45,260
 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon as they that know me.

235
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:49,780
 Behold, Philistia and Tyre with Ethiopia.

236
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:55,780
 And of Zion it shall be said, "This and that man was born in her."

237
00:20:55,780 --> 00:21:03,460
 This means that Zion or Jerusalem is the spiritual fatherland of many Gentile peoples.

238
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:08,220
 Then the Psalmist goes on to describe the joy and blessings of the sons and daughters

239
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,220
 of Jerusalem.

240
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:15,060
 "The singers as well as the players on instruments shall be there in Jerusalem and they shall

241
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:19,180
 say, 'All my springs of joy are in thee.'"

242
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:24,340
 The prophet Isaiah sings of Jerusalem as the center of Messianic blessings.

243
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:31,820
 "The Gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising."

244
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:38,060
 In regard to the dominion of the Messianic kingdom, the prophet Zechariah cries in prophecy,

245
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,180
 "Behold, thy king cometh unto thee.

246
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:48,420
 He is just and having salvation, lowly and riding upon a nass and upon a colt.

247
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:54,140
 His dominion shall be from sea even to sea and from the river even to the ends of the

248
00:21:54,140 --> 00:21:55,140
 earth."

249
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:02,020
 Evidently, this wonderful prophecy has been fulfilled in Jesus Christ who entered Jerusalem

250
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:08,820
 on a colt and whose spiritual dominion is from sea to sea even to the ends of the earth.

251
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:13,700
 All this has been brought about by God through missions.

252
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:21,180
 Even God has done it in the past, he is doing it at the present time.

253
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:26,580
 I'll skip the next section on the prophet's missionary visions.

254
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:33,660
 Now for the last part of my message this morning, let us do some thinking about the crises in

255
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:37,620
 the history of Israel regarding their mission.

256
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:41,740
 The first crisis was Abraham's hearing.

257
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,700
 Abraham's hearing.

258
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:48,100
 Abraham, as great as he was in faith, had his failure.

259
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:53,660
 He stopped short of God's calling when he discontinued his journey at Haran, halfway

260
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:58,780
 between his native country and the land where God wanted him to go.

261
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:04,140
 But thanks to God, he only stopped there for a limited period of time.

262
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,540
 God called him again and he rose and pressed on.

263
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:13,940
 In regard to Abraham's experience, let us take special notice of two things which are

264
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,420
 of special importance.

265
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:22,420
 In the first place, God asked him to get out of his own country and from his kindred and

266
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:26,740
 from his father's house and to a land he would show him.

267
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:33,220
 That was an absolute condition which Abraham must fulfill before he could reach a place

268
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:37,540
 where he was blessed and became a blessing to others.

269
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:43,700
 We are reminded here that we must be willing to have a radical departure from our accustomed

270
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:49,660
 way of life, which is so natural and so easy to our self-centeredness, and move on to a

271
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:57,500
 new path of life which is rightly called the land of milk and honey because it is spiritually

272
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,100
 fruitful.

273
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:07,060
 Abraham was faced with a tremendous choice, a choice on which hand not only his own destiny,

274
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:14,940
 but also the destiny of a nation and indeed the destiny of the whole world.

275
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:18,620
 It was a most serious crisis.

276
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,820
 Abraham made the right choice and he obeyed the call of God.

277
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:30,620
 The change of his name from Abraham to Abraham is a beautiful symbol of the transformation

278
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:33,380
 that took place in his life.

279
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:39,260
 Abraham means exalted father, but Abraham means father of nations.

280
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:45,980
 This change of name indicates that the center of Abraham's life moved from himself to his

281
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:49,540
 relationship with others.

282
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:55,940
 Abraham's offering of his only beloved son as a sacrifice to God was the peak of his

283
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:59,060
 life of self-negation.

284
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:06,580
 Only following the selfless act, God reiterated his great promise to him, "In thee shall all

285
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:09,920
 the families of the earth be blessed."

286
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:16,420
 In the second place, there are at least two conditions which Abraham must fulfill before

287
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:20,900
 he could accept the call of God and became a vessel of blessing.

288
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:28,300
 The first condition is that Abraham must understand that his own blessing and the blessing of

289
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:32,780
 other people are linked together as one thing.

290
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,700
 They can never be separated from each other.

291
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,780
 He could not take the one and leave the other.

292
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,260
 The two form one organic whole.

293
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:48,060
 Abraham did understand this twofold nature of the call of God and he obeyed.

294
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:53,880
 God always hides his blessings for us in our willingness to be a blessing to others.

295
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,980
 God hides his love in his commandment.

296
00:25:56,980 --> 00:26:01,140
 God hides his rich rewards in our obedience.

297
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:06,060
 God hides his best treasures in a self-denying life.

298
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:10,260
 God's ways are higher than our ways.

299
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:17,220
 Christ says, "Give and it shall be given unto you, good measure pressed down and shaken

300
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:23,360
 together and running over shall man give it into your bosom."

301
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:28,740
 The second condition is that Abraham must have faith before he could accept the call

302
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:35,140
 of God to be a blessing because trial and hardship are involved in such a life.

303
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:39,780
 Many times in his life, things seem to go against the promises of God.

304
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:45,260
 God's promises to him had to do with three things, his seed, the promised land and the

305
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:51,140
 nations, but he was greatly tried in all these three aspects.

306
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:55,900
 God promised to give him the land of Canaan, but he arrived there only to find it already

307
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:58,340
 occupied by others.

308
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:03,980
 God promised to give him a son, but he had to wait for 25 years.

309
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:08,740
 God promised that he would be a blessing to nations, but he actually brought trouble to

310
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:11,060
 the land of Jerar.

311
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:17,220
 In view of all this, he simply must have faith before he could stand firm in face of all

312
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,580
 these trials.

313
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:25,700
 Today, we too must have faith before we can have victory over all the forces that assemble

314
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,340
 to drive us away from the path of blessing.

315
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:36,860
 The second great crisis in the history of Israel rose when the Israelites began their

316
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,460
 wandering in the wilderness.

317
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,780
 They had crossed the Red Sea and had been delivered from the land of slavery, but that

318
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:47,820
 was only the beginning of their salvation.

319
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,420
 They were saved, but saved for what?

320
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:55,660
 Certainly, they were not saved in order to wander in the wilderness.

321
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:58,180
 They were wandering away their lives.

322
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,820
 What a tragedy!

323
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,500
 Unless they stopped wandering and crossed the River Jordan, their salvation from Egypt

324
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,660
 would be countenance.

325
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:12,900
 They would never inherit the land of promise and fulfill God's plan.

326
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:16,100
 They wandered for 40 years in the wilderness.

327
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:22,220
 They squandered away most years of their lives in the barrenness of life.

328
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,940
 What a heartache!

329
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:27,980
 The wandering life is a life without goal and purpose.

330
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,980
 It never gets anywhere.

331
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:34,240
 It will finish in bitter emptiness.

332
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,700
 But the grace of God did not fail.

333
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:42,140
 There were Joshua and Caleb and those who followed them in crossing the River Jordan,

334
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:46,420
 and they inherited the land of promise.

335
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:51,720
 The third crisis in the history of Israel took place when they faced the issue of choosing

336
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:55,980
 between Jehovah and man as their king.

337
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:01,180
 At this most critical hour, they made the tragic decision of enthroning man instead

338
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,060
 of God.

339
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:09,020
 Man taking the place of God always results in self-centeredness, which is the root of

340
00:29:09,020 --> 00:29:11,660
 all sin and miseries.

341
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:17,020
 When man rebels against God, he in fact rebels against his own good.

342
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:23,380
 In rejecting the rule of God, man takes the only alternative left for him, the alternative

343
00:29:23,380 --> 00:29:27,300
 of falling under the tyranny of self.

344
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:33,000
 The situation of man today is essentially the same as 3,000 years ago when the people

345
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:35,900
 of Israel made the tragic mistake.

346
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:42,460
 The modern man is trying his best to get rid of God, and he has indeed set up his own kings

347
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:46,980
 under whose reign he suffers merciless slavery.

348
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,020
 There is the king of sex, there is the king of drugs, there is the king of violence, there

349
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:55,860
 is the king of meaninglessness of life.

350
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:04,820
 Man has become a curse and a burden to himself as well as to others instead of a blessing.

351
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:10,220
 Today under the cloak of freedom, man is suffering slavery.

352
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:16,100
 One of the popular slogans today is that man has come of age and has no longer need of

353
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
 God.

354
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:24,980
 Yes, God is dead and man is free, free to fall under the yoke of standardless subjectivism

355
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:33,460
 and self-centeredness, which has the promise of becoming the worst tyranny ever known yet.

356
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:38,860
 The fourth crisis, fleeing from the errand of peace.

357
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:44,700
 God in his grace planned to save the people of the gentile city of Nineveh, and he revealed

358
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,940
 his mind to Jonah.

359
00:30:46,940 --> 00:30:52,660
 God commissioned Jonah as a missionary to take the message of reconciliation to Nineveh,

360
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:59,100
 but being preoccupied with a narrow and misled patriotism, he fled away from his mission

361
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,620
 and went to Tarshish instead of Nineveh.

362
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:08,420
 This attitude on the part of Jonah shows how ignorant the people of Israel were in regard

363
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,060
 to their mission.

364
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,980
 It seems that by this time in the history of the chosen people, the significance of

365
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:20,820
 God's calling to Abraham had more or less completely gone out of their minds.

366
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:27,260
 It is a great tragedy that Jonah as a prophet should have lost sight of God's main purpose

367
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:30,140
 in all his plan.

368
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:32,620
 Jonah was a man of contradictions.

369
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:38,780
 His name Jonah means a dove, which is symbolic of peace, yet he refused to be a messenger

370
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,580
 of peace.

371
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,220
 He was a prophet who should understand the will of God and obey it and help others to

372
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:52,260
 obey it, yet he acted contrary to the explicit commandment of God.

373
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,060
 He told the people on board the boat that he knew Jehovah, who was the Lord of heaven

374
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:02,900
 and earth, yet he would not allow him to be the Lord of his own life.

375
00:32:02,900 --> 00:32:11,420
 He said that he knew the love of God, yet he acted as if the love of God was non-existent.

376
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:19,060
 God graciously intervened and Jonah learned a great lesson through suffering, but he did

377
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:25,300
 not really learn the lesson well until he saw the heart of God as recorded in the fourth

378
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,860
 chapter of the book of Jonah.

379
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:33,220
 In this light, we can easily see that the book of Jonah is one of the greatest books

380
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:40,180
 of the Bible because it picked up the lost thread of Israel's mission.

381
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:47,420
 It seems that suffering is almost indispensable in the hand of God as a corrective measure

382
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:55,160
 for his constantly erring people, both in the Old Testament and in the New.

383
00:32:55,160 --> 00:33:00,700
 As we all well remember, the early church began to spread the gospel outside Jerusalem

384
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:03,260
 when they were persecuted.

385
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,380
 Does it have to come in that way?

386
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:11,740
 Do we have to suffer before we obey the will of God?

387
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:18,180
 The fifth crisis, tower building instead of bridge building.

388
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:23,860
 In the minds of David and Solomon, the building of the temple was meant to be a bridge, the

389
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:28,740
 bridge of making known the grace and truth of God to the whole world.

390
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:35,060
 Solomon, in his dedication prayer for the temple, definitely included the Gentiles among

391
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:38,940
 the recipients of blessings from the house of God.

392
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,900
 But to the people of Israel, this bridge became a tower, the tower of national pride.

393
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:52,860
 The Bible tells us that following man's estrangement from God, he began to be interested in tower

394
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:58,940
 building, of which the tower of Babel was the prototype.

395
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:05,420
 Man wants to exalt and glorify himself by building himself towers of fame.

396
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:12,060
 As a result, there are so many high towers that the view of Calvary is completely blocked

397
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,300
 out.

398
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:21,100
 There are so many tower builders and so few bridge builders that God has a hard time in

399
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:26,620
 finding people who are willing to be blessing bearers.

400
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:32,580
 In the history of Israel, the temple became more of a symbol of national self-centeredness

401
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:35,940
 than that of blessing to others.

402
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,020
 Are we tower builders or bridge builders?

403
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:53,820
 The sixth crisis, dissociation of election from its purpose.

404
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:58,820
 The people of Israel were proud of their election as the chosen people of God, but they forgot

405
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:03,980
 that they were elected for a purpose, the purpose of blessing the whole world through

406
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,980
 them.

407
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,940
 They took the privilege of election and laid aside its purpose.

408
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:14,660
 This was the fatal dissociation which hindered the plan of God.

409
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:20,980
 As a matter of fact, the people of Israel were laid aside by God because they laid aside

410
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,180
 their mission.

411
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:29,140
 The apostle Paul has made it very clear to us in Romans 11 that the people of Israel

412
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:35,940
 lost their privilege exactly because of this failure, and that God, in his infinite wisdom,

413
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:42,420
 made use of their failure to bless the whole world by putting the church in their place.

414
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:46,460
 Shall we commit the same fatal mistake?

415
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:52,340
 If we believe that we as Christians are the elect people of God, shall we too take the

416
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:57,540
 privilege and lay aside the responsibility?

417
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:03,420
 When the apostle Paul talked about predestination, he did so against the background of active

418
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:10,700
 evangelism. The biblical doctrine of predestination is not merely the statement that some people

419
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:18,620
 are preordained by God to eternal life, but it is that statement plus active evangelism,

420
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,020
 which is its living context.

421
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:26,640
 Truth taken out of its living context is no longer truth.

422
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:32,180
 The doctrine of election as related to the people of Israel and the doctrine of predestination

423
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:39,860
 as related to Christians have one basic thing in common, that is, both of them mean election

424
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,660
 and mission.

425
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:48,180
 The seventh crisis, Esther's great decision.

426
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:53,500
 The destiny of the Israelite people hinged on Esther's decision.

427
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:59,740
 Whether he chose to care for her own privilege and pleasure in the Persian palace, or she

428
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:04,020
 preferred risking her life for the good of her people.

429
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:09,100
 It was only too easy for her to decide on the former, as we often do.

430
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:16,540
 But the strong and resolute voice of one man of God influenced her and guided her thinking,

431
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:19,740
 and she made the right decision.

432
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:27,980
 Her soul was shaken by the challenge of Mordecai, who said to her, "And who knowest whether

433
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:32,300
 thou art come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"

434
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:38,420
 Then she began to think of her responsibility in the light of her privileged position as

435
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:46,020
 the queen of the empire, and that altered the whole fate of the people of Israel.

436
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:52,500
 Yes, it is not exaggerating to say that the right understanding of the balance between

437
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:58,420
 privilege and responsibility and acting thereupon on the part of the average Christian will

438
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:03,660
 change the whole course of the Church of Christ today.

439
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:09,660
 Thank God for having graciously raised up a Mordecaian voice of warning and challenge

440
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:17,900
 for every generation, so that all Christians may be reminded of their mission.

441
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:25,420
 I think I'm justified in saying that this convention is one of the major forces in the

442
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:30,540
 movings of God along the line of carrying out his worldwide mission.

443
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:37,420
 May God raise up many missionaries in this convention to further his mission of blessing

444
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,620
 near and far.
