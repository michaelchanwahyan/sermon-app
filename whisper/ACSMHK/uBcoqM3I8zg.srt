1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,840
 Let us continue our study of the biblical basis of missions.

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:18,440
 This morning we have come to our third subtitle, "The Basis of Missions in Acts," that is,

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:22,280
 the Holy Spirit and Missions.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:30,760
 My message this morning is arranged under five headings, A, the Holy Spirit as author

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:41,480
 and finisher of missions; B, the Holy Spirit as promoter of missions; C, the Holy Spirit

6
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:51,760
 as power for missions; D, the Holy Spirit as strategist for missions; E, the Holy Spirit

7
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,960
 as supplier for missions.

8
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,560
 Now A, the Holy Spirit as author and finisher of missions.

9
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:10,400
 The Lord committed to his followers the task of evangelizing the world, but clearly and

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:17,160
 emphatically he told them that they had power to fulfill the great commission only when

11
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:21,120
 they had received the Holy Spirit.

12
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:28,220
 Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Spirit is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses

13
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:35,080
 unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and in Samaria and unto the utmost part of the

14
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,760
 earth.

15
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:44,400
 Power is, in every sphere of work, the one all-important requisite.

16
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:50,120
 Even more this is true with the Church's mission, for we wrestle not against flesh

17
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:57,040
 and blood, but against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,320
 in high places.

19
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:07,560
 We need a supernatural power against a supernatural enemy, and only the Holy Spirit can supply

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,920
 this power.

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,920
 The Lord thought so much of this power from on high that he even forbade his disciples

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:23,480
 to begin their mission before they were equipped with this divine supply.

23
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,920
 How can we afford to think differently from our Lord?

24
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,360
 In speaking of the Holy Spirit, the Lord said something which was too much for the disciples

25
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,560
 to take in, something they thought hardly sensible.

26
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:45,600
 The Lord actually said, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believeth on me, the

27
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:52,440
 works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do, because I go

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,840
 to my Father."

29
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:01,160
 They could not understand these amazing words at the time, but later they all learned to

30
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,840
 know that they were true.

31
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,160
 The Holy Spirit was going to mean greater efficiency than even Christ's presence in

32
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:13,840
 the flesh had meant to them before.

33
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,520
 Christ called the Holy Spirit another comforter.

34
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:23,840
 The word "another" indicates that the Holy Spirit was going to be to the disciples all

35
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,440
 that the Lord Jesus had been to them previously.

36
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,760
 Not only that, but also through this another comforter, they would be enabled to do greater

37
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:38,600
 works than Jesus himself had done.

38
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:43,400
 There's no going away with him, and there's no limit to his presence.

39
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,100
 Another, all sufficiency for them.

40
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:53,880
 We can never overestimate the importance of the Holy Spirit.

41
00:03:53,880 --> 00:04:00,040
 He was the center of the Lord's last discourse, and it was none other than the Holy Spirit

42
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:07,100
 concerning whom Jesus gave his last commandment to his disciples just before his ascension.

43
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:13,960
 He said to them, "Tarry ye, tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with

44
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,000
 power from on high."

45
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:23,960
 Acts 11, 13, we simply cannot brush aside something on which the Lord has laid so much

46
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,560
 emphasis.

47
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:33,480
 It is therefore logical for us to say that missions began with the Holy Spirit, but the

48
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,020
 significance of the Holy Spirit in regard to missions does not stop here.

49
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,360
 He is also the finisher of missions.

50
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,040
 The supernatural sign of speaking with tongues, which accompanied the coming of the Holy Spirit

51
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,280
 at Pentecost, was itself a clear and divinely appointed indication that the power of the

52
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:02,440
 Holy Spirit was going to send the gospel to all races and nations where different tongues

53
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,360
 are spoken.

54
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:13,000
 We can therefore also say that the Holy Spirit is the guarantor of the success of world missions.

55
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,400
 We clearly see today that this divinely appointed indication has come true.

56
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,320
 The gospel has been preached in almost all tongues.

57
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:30,560
 B, the Holy Spirit as the promoter of missions.

58
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:36,340
 The book of Acts of the apostles is really the book of the Acts of Jesus through the

59
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:39,800
 apostles by the Holy Spirit.

60
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:45,120
 The Holy Spirit took a leading part in every move of the early church.

61
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:53,560
 We see him explicitly at work in all of the most important events in the early church.

62
00:05:53,560 --> 00:06:00,880
 For instance, the Holy Spirit was at work when the church first broke out in power with

63
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,240
 3,000 and 5,000 people convicted and converted on a single occasion.

64
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:13,520
 When Peter and the other disciples witnessed boldly in the face of persecution.

65
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:19,240
 When the early Christians overcame selfishness and gave more than liberal aid to the Lord's

66
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
 work.

67
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:27,200
 When the first martyrdom took place, showing glorious victory over persecution and vengeance.

68
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:33,800
 When the gospel of salvation reached the first Gentile family in the city of Caesarea.

69
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,920
 When the message of the forgiveness of sin began to spread to Ethiopia and Africa through

70
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,240
 Philip speaking to the powerful eunuch.

71
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:50,920
 When the churches in Judea, Galilee, and Samaria came to be firmly established.

72
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:57,680
 When that wonderful missionary minded church at Antioch began to be prosperous as a preparation

73
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,760
 for foreign missions.

74
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:06,360
 When the mutual love of the first churches was manifested by collecting a love offering

75
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,040
 through the inspired prophecy of Agabus.

76
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:14,400
 When the Antioch church launched their missionary program.

77
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:22,760
 When Paul overcame his first enemy of influence in the person of Elemas on the isle of Cyprus.

78
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:30,360
 When the apostolic gospel team rejoiced over persecution at Antioch of Pisidia.

79
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:37,360
 When the apostles recognized work among the Gentiles and announced the great proclamation

80
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,880
 of freedom from law for Gentile Christians at the first council of Jerusalem.

81
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,160
 When Paul was forbidden to continue his work in Asia Minor and was led into Europe, an

82
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,400
 act of far reaching significance.

83
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,440
 When leaders were chosen to look after an indigenous church at Ephesus.

84
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:08,120
 Behind all these important events and movements of the early church, we find the Holy Spirit

85
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:12,160
 to be the real promoting and sustaining power.

86
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:18,520
 Moreover, no one can fail to observe that most of the events on this list have to do

87
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,720
 with missions.

88
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:26,960
 Are we therefore not justified in saying that the chief concern of the Holy Spirit in the

89
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:31,960
 early churches was the promotion and empowerment of missions?

90
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:35,160
 Yes, I think so.

91
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,000
 See, the Holy Spirit has powerful missions.

92
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:45,560
 First, outpourings of the Holy Spirit on missionary work.

93
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:52,440
 There is an important distinction between the infilling of the Holy Spirit and the on-falling

94
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,160
 or oncoming or outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

95
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:03,360
 The infilling of the Holy Spirit has mainly to do with depth of spiritual quality and

96
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,160
 character and with power in service.

97
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:13,680
 Whereas the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is a sovereign act of God to indicate the

98
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:21,840
 ushering in of a new era or the beginning of a new movement or expansion.

99
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:28,080
 The outpouring of the Holy Spirit happened only four times in the Book of Acts.

100
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,040
 Each of these was accompanied by supernatural signs.

101
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:40,040
 It is most revealing to find out that all these four times were related to missions.

102
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:46,360
 The first time was coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, and the Lord referred to it

103
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:50,120
 as the empowering for world missions.

104
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:58,200
 The second time was when the Gospel reached the first non-Jewish city of Samaria, chapter

105
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,460
 8, verses 15 to 18.

106
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:07,600
 The third took place when Peter was sent by the Holy Spirit to preach in the first Gentile

107
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:16,920
 family of Cornelius in the city of Caesarea, 10, verses 45 and 46.

108
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:23,800
 Finally, the fourth time came about when Paul broke into new ground, showing clearly the

109
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:31,600
 distinction between the Gospel of Jesus and the teaching of John the Baptist, 19, verses

110
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,220
 1 to 6.

111
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:41,440
 These are facts which show how concerned and how related the Holy Spirit is to missions.

112
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,320
 Second, the empowerment of the Holy Spirit for fruitfulness in missions.

113
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:55,640
 When Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, he preached and 3,000 souls were converted.

114
00:10:55,640 --> 00:11:01,680
 It was not the number of decisions that counted, for we are all familiar with the notorious

115
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,440
 fact that there is a shocking discrepancy between the number of decisions made at campaigns

116
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,720
 and real conversions.

117
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:15,880
 It was the quality of such a large number of new converts that showed the power of the

118
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:23,800
 Holy Spirit, and they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship,

119
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,760
 and in breaking of bread and in prayers.

120
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:34,120
 Barnabas was filled with the Holy Spirit, and much people were added unto the Lord,

121
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,960
 11, 24.

122
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,600
 Not unto the church, but unto the Lord.

123
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
 That must mean true conversions.

124
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,480
 There were both Jews and Gentiles among them.

125
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:53,320
 As a result, a prosperous and spiritually minded church was established.

126
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,720
 Down through the centuries, there have been amazing instances of the rapidity of results

127
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,560
 under the power of the Holy Spirit.

128
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,360
 Let us take a few examples.

129
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:14,840
 In the 96 years following 1811, there were over a million converts in West Polynesia.

130
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:23,000
 In Burma, during the first 80 years of evangelistic work, an average of one new convert was baptized

131
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:29,720
 every three hours around the clock, and one in ten of such converts became an active worker

132
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,560
 for the Lord.

133
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:39,080
 In the Fiji Islands, James Cavett, who went there in time to bury the remains of 80 human

134
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:46,200
 victims of a cannibal feast, lived to see crowds of converted savages around the Lord's

135
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,720
 table for holy communion.

136
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:59,040
 At the end of the 50 years between 1835 and 1885, 1,300 churches could be counted.

137
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,480
 Instances like these could be multiplied again and again.

138
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:09,800
 Third, the empowerment of the Holy Spirit for missionary expansion.

139
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,640
 The Spirit-filled church at Jerusalem expanded along three main routes.

140
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:22,600
 First, by the converted devout Jews who were present at the Pentecostal scene and who went

141
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,880
 back to their own places with the gospel.

142
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:32,840
 Second, by the Christians who scattered after the martyrdom of the Spirit-filled Stephen

143
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:39,920
 and the persecution that followed, and then in turn by the Spirit-led ministry of Philip,

144
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,560
 advancing to Samaria and Ethiopia.

145
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,360
 Third, by other scattering Christians who took the northern route to Phoenix, Cyprus,

146
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:58,360
 and Antioch, and in turn from the Spirit-filled church at Antioch to Asia Minor and Europe.

147
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:04,080
 We see the Holy Spirit at work in all these directions.

148
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:08,720
 Church history abounds with illustrations of this truth.

149
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:15,360
 At significant turns in the history of the church, which we may call hours of travail,

150
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,560
 before or during the birth of new life or new expansion, we see special phenomena of

151
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,880
 the manifestation of the power of the Holy Spirit.

152
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:32,480
 For instance, at the beginning of the Wesleyan revival, which influenced the history of England

153
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:39,160
 to such a remarkable extent, and which, through men like Whitefield, contributed to the great

154
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:45,960
 awakening in New England under the leadership of Jonathan Edwards, we see a visitation of

155
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:52,200
 the power of the Holy Spirit, which is sometimes called the Methodist Pentecost.

156
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:55,960
 We find these words in John Wesley's journal.

157
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:06,920
 January 1, 1739, Mr. Hall, Kynchon, Ingham, Whitefield, Butchens, and my brother Charles

158
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:13,640
 were present at our love feast in Fetter Lane with about sixty brethren.

159
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:20,720
 About three in the morning, as we were continuing instant in prayer, the power of God came mightily

160
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,260
 upon us.

161
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:28,720
 As soon as we were recovered a little from that awe and amazement at the presence of

162
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,400
 his majesty, we broke out with one voice, "We praise thee, O God; we acknowledge thee

163
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,840
 to be the Lord."

164
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:46,860
 George Whitefield recalled this occasion and remarked, "It was a Pentecostal time indeed.

165
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:54,040
 One month later, he preached to twenty thousand colliers at Kingswood, Bristol, with marvellous

166
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,480
 results.

167
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:01,680
 The great movement expanded to all England, to all Great Britain, to America, and to many

168
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,620
 other countries.

169
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,840
 Many scholars agree with Professor A.M.

170
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:12,800
 Renwick of Edinburgh in saying that even William Carey, the London Missionary Society, and

171
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,240
 the strong evangelical wing in the Church of England are all fruits of this mighty revival."

172
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:27,760
 Fourth, the empowerment of the Holy Spirit for victory over Satan in missions.

173
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:34,520
 On his first mission field, Paul met with a formidable enemy in a sorcerer by the name

174
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:41,000
 of Elemas, who had great influence with the deputy of the country against the Christian

175
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,000
 faith.

176
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:50,680
 Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, rebuked him and made him temporarily blind by a miracle,

177
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:56,680
 and thereby broke the cast of the power of darkness over the island of Cyprus.

178
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:03,720
 Paul pointed out in his rebuke that Elemas was a tool of Satan to hinder the course of

179
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:11,440
 the gospel, and he was enabled by the Holy Spirit to bring about victory over him.

180
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:19,160
 The power of darkness reigns through superstition and sin, which results in moral corruption.

181
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,200
 But the transformation of individual lives and communities wherever the gospel is preached

182
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,560
 is an undeniable proof of the power of the Holy Spirit.

183
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,960
 Dr. J.H.

184
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,800
 Bavank of Holland has pointed out in his book The Science of Missions that the conviction

185
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:44,000
 of sin, which is necessary for salvation, cannot be brought about by a philosophical

186
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,840
 approach alone.

187
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:51,760
 Based on natural theology, using reason as a common premises for arguing against the

188
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:58,840
 falsity of heathen ways of life and faith, neither will the psychological or dialectical

189
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,600
 approach be sufficient.

190
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,320
 The Holy Spirit alone, says Dr. Bavank, can call to repentance, and we are only means

191
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,280
 in his hand.

192
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:18,920
 He goes on to say if elliptics, or the conviction of sin, were an human activity, the situation

193
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:21,360
 would be nearly hopeless.

194
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
 That is only too true.

195
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,800
 Fifth, the Holy Spirit and prayer power.

196
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:34,440
 The working of the Holy Spirit is so interwoven with prayer that sometimes the two things

197
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,080
 are taken as one thing.

198
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:40,160
 They are mutually causative.

199
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:47,440
 In the book of Acts, nothing else is so closely linked together with the power of the Holy

200
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,120
 Spirit as prayer.

201
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:58,280
 St. Patrick, known as the Apostle of Ireland, spent 40 days on top of Grove Patrick in meditation

202
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:05,160
 and prayer for the opening up of West Ireland to the gospel, and it did open.

203
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,440
 There is consensus among church historians that William Carey was the true herald of

204
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,400
 modern missions.

205
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:20,080
 The movement which he started was born of a special monthly prayer meeting for worldwide

206
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,620
 outpouring of power from on high, which Dr. Arthur T. Pearson calls a stated monthly season

207
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:34,920
 of such united, organized pleading with God for a lost world.

208
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:41,400
 Some historians have traced this prayer movement back to the trumpet call to prayer for a new

209
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,640
 and worldwide Pentecost, blown by Jonathan Edwards from New England and echoed in England

210
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,880
 across the ocean.

211
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,800
 Edwards himself led in a mighty revival in New England and had great impact on the preachers

212
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:03,140
 and churches of his own time, as well as of generations to follow.

213
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:10,740
 His ministry was marked by evident manifestations of the power of the Holy Spirit.

214
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:17,440
 When the pioneering messengers of the gospel began to labor on the island of Tahiti, the

215
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:24,720
 power of darkness so prevailed that the efforts of the first 14 years seemed to be wholly

216
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,440
 in vain.

217
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:35,180
 The tireless toil and unsparing self-denial of the early missionaries were not rewarded

218
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:38,040
 by a single convert.

219
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:45,080
 The directors of the London Missionary Society seriously proposed abandoning this fruitless

220
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:52,120
 field, but there were a few who felt that this was the very hour when God was about

221
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:55,600
 to rebuke unbelief and reward faith.

222
00:20:55,600 --> 00:21:04,280
 Finally, instead of abandoning the field, a special season of united prayer was appointed.

223
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,160
 Many confessed unbelief and prayed fervently.

224
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:13,000
 A miracle happened just at this crucial hour.

225
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:20,200
 Unknown to each other, two vessels started from two opposite ports, one from Tahiti bound

226
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:27,560
 for London, the other from the Thames bound for Tahiti, and they crossed each other's

227
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,040
 tracks at mid-ocean.

228
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:34,920
 The latter carried letters of encouragement to the missionaries.

229
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:41,140
 The former bore letters from the missionaries in Tahiti announcing such a mighty work of

230
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,160
 God that idolatry were entirely overthrown.

231
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:53,040
 What a wonderful and amazing coincidence between prayer and the power of the Holy Spirit.

232
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:58,360
 D, the Holy Spirit as strategist of missions.

233
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:05,120
 The book of Acts affords us with guidance in regard to the strategy of missions.

234
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:10,800
 It reveals to us principles of missionary work which have to do with the leading of

235
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,520
 the Holy Spirit.

236
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:16,120
 First, occupation of key cities.

237
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,400
 Philip was led to Samaria, Peter to Caesarea.

238
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,040
 Paul started work in many key cities in Asia Minor.

239
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:33,040
 Today, the metropolitan areas are the strategic centers for evangelism, since this is indeed

240
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:35,720
 a metropolitan age.

241
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:41,440
 Second, capture of key persons and classes for Christ.

242
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,120
 When Paul went to the Isle of Cyprus, he dealt with the deputy of the country in the power

243
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:53,480
 of the Holy Spirit, won him for the Lord, and thereby created a favorable influence

244
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,320
 on the island.

245
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,280
 At Athens, Paul engaged the intelligentsia of the city in disputation and aroused their

246
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:08,640
 interest in the Christian faith, which resulted in the conversion of some intellectuals, among

247
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:14,120
 whom was a man of position by the name of Dionysius.

248
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:20,960
 Then at Ephesus, he worked among scholars of the school of Tyrannus for two years.

249
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,000
 Paul never worked so long in one place among any other class of people.

250
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,940
 What was the result?

251
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:35,520
 So that all they which dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and

252
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,520
 Greeks.

253
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:44,680
 At 1910, Philip was led by the Holy Spirit to speak to the Ethiopian eunuch, who was

254
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:51,080
 a leader in his country, and it was the first step towards the Christianization of that

255
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,560
 land.

256
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:58,880
 Of course, this does not mean that the gospel is meant only for a certain class of people,

257
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:06,400
 but it does teach us that there is real wisdom in laboring patiently among intellectual people

258
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
 on the mission fields.

259
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,280
 We should never neglect them.

260
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:18,520
 Many missionaries or missionary societies skip over the educated class and leaders because

261
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:23,520
 work among them requires a greater price to be paid.

262
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,320
 Third, movement into new areas.

263
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:33,800
 Paul moved on to new areas every time after he had established a local church.

264
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:39,440
 If missionaries follow this principle, the strength of the great missionary army will

265
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:46,880
 not be taken up by working in churches already established, but will break out to new areas

266
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,120
 in every direction.

267
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:55,180
 This will start a mighty expansion in this generation.

268
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:01,760
 Every missionary should be trained to be willing to move on to new places and start all over

269
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,920
 again.

270
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:10,120
 It is hard, but by doing this, missionary work as a whole will be much more effective.

271
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:16,280
 Fourth, establishing and sustaining of indigenous churches.

272
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:22,440
 In the farewell exhortation to the elders of the Ephesian church on his mission field,

273
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:30,000
 Paul said, "The Holy Spirit hath made you overseers to feed the church of God."

274
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,800
 Acts 20, 28.

275
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:39,000
 Evidently, it is the will of the Holy Spirit that the churches on the mission fields should

276
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:44,760
 be self-governing, self-propagating, and self-supporting.

277
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:51,360
 If you do not go with the Holy Spirit, you will never raise up strong churches.

278
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,760
 When they had ordained them elders in every church and had prayed with fasting, they commended

279
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,520
 them to the Lord on whom they believed.

280
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,640
 Acts 14, 23.

281
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:10,960
 Having ordained leaders in his mission churches, Paul commended them to the Lord, for he was

282
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,520
 able to take care of them.

283
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,740
 So one of the most important jobs of missionaries is to train national leaders.

284
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:26,560
 Another point of supreme importance is that national churches must be trained to be missionary-minded.

285
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:33,840
 Paul could speak of the churches which he started as having fellowship with him in the

286
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:40,200
 gospel from the first day until now, and as sounding out the word of the Lord not only

287
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:46,120
 Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place.

288
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,280
 First Thessalonians 1.8.

289
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,520
 Fifth, love service in missions.

290
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,280
 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and he signified by the Spirit that there

291
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:03,320
 should be great dearth throughout all the world.

292
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,600
 Acts 11.28.

293
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:13,120
 Evidently, the purpose of the Holy Spirit in announcing the coming famine through Agabus

294
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:20,280
 was that Christians should manifest their love to one another by action at such a time.

295
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:28,040
 The Christians at Antioch understood the significance of this prophecy and sent relief to the brethren

296
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,600
 in Judea.

297
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:34,980
 It was a beautiful expression of brotherhood in the love of Christ.

298
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:41,520
 It is true that the primary task of the church is to evangelize the world, but the Holy Spirit

299
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:48,440
 reveals to us here that love services have their own place in missions.

300
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:55,880
 Do schools, hospitals, and other welfare services come under this category?

301
00:27:55,880 --> 00:28:04,400
 Certainly they do serve a twofold purpose, means of evangelism and channels of love.

302
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:09,240
 Sixth, mass evangelism in missions.

303
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:16,360
 As soon as the curtain is drawn on the Pentecostal spectacle, we have a scene of mass evangelism

304
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,400
 presented to us.

305
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:25,240
 Peter, with the apostolic team full of the Holy Spirit, preaching to thousands of amazed

306
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:28,040
 people with wonderful result.

307
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:35,360
 A short time later, at the gate called Beautiful, Peter again testified to gospel truths before

308
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:39,720
 a crowd of 5,000, counting only the men.

309
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:45,160
 Even the hostile rulers were overwhelmed by this huge crowd.

310
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:52,680
 Because that evangelistic meetings are nothing new, but as an organized means of evangelism,

311
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:58,480
 mass campaigns are an upsurging power in this generation.

312
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:05,760
 They have sound scriptural basis if they have the Holy Spirit as their main power source.

313
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,520
 We will do well to remember that ours is an age of mass actions.

314
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:18,600
 United campaigns run on a spiritual line are greatly needed on the mission fields today.

315
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,320
 Seventh, unity as power for missions.

316
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:28,040
 The Spirit-filled church at Jerusalem showed a wonderful spirit of unity.

317
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,280
 Paul speaks of unity of the Spirit.

318
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:38,120
 Our Lord said in his prayer for his disciples, "And now I am no more in the world, but these

319
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,480
 are in the world.

320
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,920
 I come to thee, Holy Father, keep through thine own name those whom thou hast given

321
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:53,560
 me, that they may be one as we are, that the world may believe that thou hast sent me."

322
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:58,000
 Our Lord teaches us here a very important truth.

323
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,760
 The unity of believers produces a power which convinces the world of the reality of the

324
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:06,200
 gospel.

325
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,840
 The Lord laid repeated emphasis on the oneness of believers in this great prayer.

326
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,680
 The words that they may be one are used four times in this chapter, and every time they

327
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,680
 take on a new meaning.

328
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:25,840
 In verse 11, oneness of believers has to do with the name of God.

329
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,240
 In verse 21, it is spoken of as a power to draw people to Christ.

330
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:35,440
 In verse 22, it is related to the glory of God.

331
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:42,560
 In verse 23, it has the added significance of the manifestation of the love of God.

332
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:48,920
 In view of these words of our Lord, we can never speak too much of the importance of

333
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,400
 the unity of believers.

334
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:58,000
 While there are lines and methods of uniting the Church of God which are not scriptural

335
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:07,440
 and therefore unacceptable by biblically oriented Christians, we evangelical churches must unreservedly

336
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:14,040
 start a decisive movement for unity based on biblical terms.

337
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:21,440
 There must be combined action on the mission fields if we really want more effective evangelism.

338
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:29,720
 We should set up committees to study the best ways for unity, with as many evangelical groups

339
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,320
 as possible taking part.

340
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,640
 There is only one path for us to tread, and that is to unite and evangelize the world

341
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,000
 before the Lord comes back.

342
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:50,880
 We must not only speak negatively of an unbiblical unification, but we must also act positively

343
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,360
 for a biblical one.

344
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:58,920
 (e) The Holy Spirit as Supplier for Missions.

345
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:04,840
 First, the Holy Spirit and the Supplier of Recruits for Missions.

346
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:10,880
 The Holy Spirit said, "Separate me, Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto I have called

347
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,880
 them."

348
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:19,200
 (Acts 13:3) The Holy Spirit called Barnabas and Paul for missionary service, and they

349
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,200
 went.

350
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:24,480
 He calls and recruits volunteers for mission fields.

351
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,040
 Please note four things in this verse.

352
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:31,320
 First, it is the Holy Spirit who does the calling.

353
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:35,920
 Second, he calls workers for a definite service.

354
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:40,040
 Third, he calls the best, Barnabas and Paul.

355
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:43,120
 Fourth, they obey.

356
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,760
 Let me enlarge a little bit on these four points.

357
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,720
 First, it is the Holy Spirit who does the calling.

358
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:56,640
 None of us should be discouraged about missionary work, since the Holy Spirit is the promoter

359
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:59,080
 and recruiter.

360
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,120
 The Holy Spirit moved in the latter part of the 19th century, and the student world of

361
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,440
 America and England was roused to join in missionary action.

362
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,160
 Through the instrumentality of men like D.L.

363
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:21,960
 Moody, the student volunteer movement was formed, and in 25 years' time, over 9,000

364
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,040
 volunteered for the mission field.

365
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:31,160
 Second, the Holy Spirit calls workers for a definite service.

366
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:35,080
 The history of missions teaches us a very important lesson.

367
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:41,240
 The greatest majority of successful and great missionaries have been those who go toward

368
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,520
 a definite goal which the Lord has prepared for them.

369
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,960
 Third, the Holy Spirit calls the best.

370
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,480
 The Antioch Church had every reason to keep Barnabas and Paul at home.

371
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:00,740
 They were needed more than anybody else, yet the Holy Spirit sent them away.

372
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:06,480
 Many gifted Christian workers have disobeyed the Holy Spirit because they are persuaded

373
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,280
 to believe that their gifts are meant for the churches at home.

374
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:17,320
 No workers who have failed in the homeland could be expected to be successful on the

375
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:19,400
 mission field.

376
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:24,680
 Facts have proved beyond doubt that missionaries who have done great things on the mission

377
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,240
 fields can be as greatly used of God at home.

378
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:35,360
 Yes, the mission fields demand and deserve our best men and women.

379
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,640
 Fourth, they obeyed.

380
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:44,880
 I think I am justified in saying that a good measure of the weakness of missionary work

381
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:52,640
 today is attributable to the unwillingness of gifted workers to obey the call of the

382
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:56,260
 Holy Spirit to go to the mission field.

383
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:59,000
 They prefer to stay at home.

384
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,560
 The inner call of the Holy Spirit can be drowned by the tide of general opinion.

385
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:11,340
 The general public at home should encourage their best men and women whom they think they

386
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:14,960
 cannot bear to go to the mission field.

387
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,360
 Second, the Holy Spirit and sacrificial giving for missions.

388
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:26,600
 Immediately following the record of Pentecost, we read of sacrificial giving in the Apostolic

389
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:30,760
 Church, Acts 2.44.

390
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:37,360
 And Ananias and Sapphira sold a possession and kept back part of the price.

391
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,760
 Peter referred to it as lying to the Holy Spirit.

392
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,600
 Two things are clear in this verse.

393
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,560
 First, the Holy Spirit moved Christians to give sacrificially.

394
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:58,200
 Second, many followed the prompting of the Holy Spirit, but some tried to cheat with

395
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,540
 clever designs.

396
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:07,840
 The Macedonian churches showed abundance of joy in great trial of affliction, as well

397
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:12,480
 as riches of liberality in deep poverty.

398
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,560
 What precious contrast between outward conditions and inward grace.

399
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,920
 The church at Thessalonica is a good example of the Macedonian churches, and Paul speaks

400
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:31,200
 of it as a church in which the Holy Spirit has moved in power.

401
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:38,800
 For our gospel came unto you in not word only, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit.

402
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,880
 Again, this proves that a Spirit-filled church is a giving one.

403
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:52,560
 The Macedonian giving is not only giving of money, but is basically giving of oneself.

404
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:58,400
 They first gave their own selves to the Lord, and then they gave money.

405
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:04,720
 The giving of money and the giving of lives have constituted the great missionary giving,

406
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:08,200
 all prompted by the Holy Spirit.

407
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:14,740
 The Pietist movement rose in the 17th century and gave birth to a missionary thrust of which

408
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,320
 the Moravian mission was a part.

409
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:24,000
 The Holy Spirit moved so clearly at Hern Hut that the tide of the spirit of giving rose

410
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:36,160
 high and consequently, out of a small congregation of 600, grew a mission which sent out 2,170

411
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:43,520
 missionaries in 120 years' time to many of the most difficult places in the world.

412
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,600
 In 1930, after 200 years of work, the ratio of missionaries to the total membership of

413
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:59,680
 this group was, according to Dr. Robert Glover, 1 to 92, which is probably an unsurpassed

414
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,680
 record.

415
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:08,720
 In conclusion, let us remind ourselves of Paul's words to the Galatians, "Are ye so

416
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,440
 foolish?

417
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:15,760
 Having begun in the Holy Spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?"

418
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,040
 Galatians 3.3.

419
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:24,360
 Since it was by the power of the Holy Spirit that missions were started, are we to finish

420
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:27,160
 it by human efforts?

421
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:33,760
 Even as the Galatian Christians fell prey to legalism, so the church of this age has

422
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:41,360
 fallen prey to techniquism, which has been allowed to take the place of the Holy Spirit,

423
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,820
 who is the real source of power for missions.

424
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:51,720
 When missionary effort has become devoid of the Holy Spirit, it has rendered a human affair,

425
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:55,480
 and as such, it is a hopeless situation.

426
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:00,760
 But if it keeps in the control of the Holy Spirit, he will be the author and finisher

427
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,640
 of missions.

428
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,680
 The task will be accomplished.

429
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:13,120
 There should be a renewed call to a revival of utter dependence on the Holy Spirit and

430
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:19,480
 a diligent seeking after the fullness of the Holy Spirit in our individual lives as well

431
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:22,800
 in the lives of missionary societies.

432
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,920
 Then a true missionary revival will be realized.
