00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:04,540
 Hello brothers and sisters

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:05,500
 I am Fr. Cuan Shui-min

4
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,100
 teaching at the Church of St. George's

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,440
 Today I am introducing a book

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,280
 written by a French theologian

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,080
 Jean-Luc Nantz

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,120
 The book is called

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,780
 "Disenclosure, the Deconstruction of Christianity"

10
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:23,360
 The author is a prominent European theologian

11
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:27,220
 Although this book is about Christianity

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,000
 it is not a book on the theology of Christ

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,900
 and it is not a book to defend Christianity

14
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,240
 or to oppose Christianity

15
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,240
 Nantz's main purpose

16
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:42,580
 is to put Christianity

17
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:44,180
 in the context of Western history

18
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,580
 Western culture and civilization

19
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,680
 to explore and examine

20
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,060
 the characteristics of Christianity

21
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,160
 Through these characteristics

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,020
 we can see that

23
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:00,220
 when Western civilization and modernity

24
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,760
 are in a state of closure and disintegration

25
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:05,300
 how can Christianity

26
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,200
 open up a new way of thinking?

27
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,480
 What does a normal person believe?

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,740
 A normal person believes that

29
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:17,940
 Christianity is a God

30
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,840
 whom we believe to be high above

31
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:23,880
 a God who is extremely high

32
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,960
 and worthy of worship

33
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:31,620
 Therefore, I think that for many people

34
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,660
 Christianity is a relationship with God

35
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,800
 or we follow His words

36
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,200
 read the Bible

37
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,000
 or follow the Bible

38
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,540
 Nantz felt that this kind of understanding of Christianity

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,380
 was not without reason

40
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,220
 but was rather shallow

41
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:56,360
 and could not grasp the very important essence of Christianity

42
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:59,560
 He mentioned that what is faith?

43
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,860
 Faith is a relationship

44
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,600
 between life and nothingness

45
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:11,100
 and nothingness is not a negative meaning

46
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,540
 not a negative meaning

47
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,140
 but a meaning of

48
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:21,280
 "infinite openness"

49
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,520
 To use an analogy

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,020
 this "infinite openness" is like

51
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:31,720
 when Abraham left his family

52
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,660
 to enter a very open but unknown land

53
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:41,600
 Therefore, faith is not about beliefs

54
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
 nor about beliefs

55
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,440
 but about the journey we can embark on

56
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:53,240
 What does the book "This Enclosure" mean?

57
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,680
 I have seen a good translation of this in Chinese

58
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,180
 It is translated as "解圍"

59
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,420
 "解" means to open, to loosen, to surround

60
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:08,060
 or to seal

61
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,560
 So what does "解圍" mean?

62
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,940
 What does "this enclosure" mean?

63
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,700
 It means to seal up

64
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,740
 to surround and loosen

65
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,620
 Specifically, it means to seal up

66
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,820
 or to seal up the world view

67
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,120
 How can we loosen it up?

68
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,120
 Nazi thought that the essence of Christianity

69
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,700
 was the so-called "this enclosure"

70
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:41,660
 which is the essence of the unsealing of the world

71
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,500
 The title of this book is

72
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,440
 "The Construction of Christianity"

73
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,380
 in Chinese, it means "the deconstruction of Christianity"

74
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:56,080
 The meaning of "this enclosure" is not to destroy Christianity

75
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,960
 nor to overthrow Christianity

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,860
 What does "this enclosure" mean?

77
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:08,120
 It means that Nazi used his analysis

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,800
 and his discovery of the Christian tradition and faith

79
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:18,440
 to rediscover the internal tension and the chastity

80
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:24,080
 and thereby to rediscover the internal tension and chastity

81
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,080
 and thereby to rediscover the internal tension and the chastity

82
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,480
 and thereby to rediscover the internal tension and the chastity

83
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,820
 The deconstruction of Christianity

84
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:39,020
 was simply to rediscover the internal tension and chastity

85
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,500
 was simply to rediscover the internal tension and chastity

86
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,200
 and thereby to rediscover the world sense

87
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,440
 The term "world sense" is in hyphen

88
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,580
 This hyphen is very important

89
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,780
 When you read the book

90
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,440
 you may want to understand what the hyphen means

91
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,080
 and thereby to rediscover the world sense

92
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,760
 and thereby to revitalize our times

93
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:08,520
 Most importantly, he believed that

94
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,820
 the world sense was not a rational

95
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:17,900
 or a belief or a Bible

96
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:21,540
 Nazi believed that this deconstruction

97
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:23,600
 could be a very powerful framework

98
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,900
 to face the current time

99
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:36,120
 and to use a new perspective to understand the world

100
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,260
 and to rediscover the world sense

101
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,660
 in this uncertain but prosperous world

102
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,160
 However, Nazi was not so one-sided

103
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,400
 In this book, he found that

104
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,900
 Christianity has two sides

105
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,980
 On the one hand, we know that

106
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:02,380
 in the history of Christianity

107
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:05,880
 Christianity has often been very rigid

108
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,880
 On the other hand, Nazi found that

109
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,920
 Christianity has a tradition and history

110
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,320
 that are indeed open-minded

111
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,560
 and often strive for the future

112
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,360
 at the critical moments of history

113
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,560
 and to make a difference in the present

114
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,560
 so that we can go back to the way we were

115
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,140
 and have the courage to leave our own family

116
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,940
 We can say that

117
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:35,480
 Nazi's attitude towards Christianity

118
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,140
 is actually quite complicated

119
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:40,140
 It is both positive and negative

120
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:46,780
 This shows the exquisite point of view of Nazi

121
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:52,920
 Let's take a look at the logic of this book

122
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,400
 First, we find that

123
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,100
 Nazi was analyzing Western culture

124
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,260
 When he analyzed Western culture

125
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,040
 or when he started the Enlightenment movement

126
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,340
 he thought that reason was the only way to solve human problems

127
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,340
 However, when he came to this day

128
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,780
 he found that this method

129
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,080
 had reached the end of his life

130
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,980
 Although reason is very important

131
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,820
 he found that reason could not cover

132
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,020
 many complex aspects of life

133
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,360
 Therefore, if we see reason as the only way to solve problems

134
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,700
 our life will be left with many blank spaces

135
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,800
 which are easily filled with dangerous ideologies

136
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,640
 which have led to many crises in history

137
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,640
 or even disasters

138
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,980
 For example, violence

139
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,520
 or the hard to allow differences

140
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,480
 or the rejection of others

141
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:57,220
 or the Marxism-Leninism

142
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,720
 or the authoritarianism

143
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,200
 or the opportunism of the market

144
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,600
 There are many difficulties in human history

145
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,400
 including the origin of the rich

146
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:11,940
 and the growing gap between power

147
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:15,940
 Nazi thought that if we want to face these challenges

148
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:21,740
 we must face and embrace the mystery and the mystery

149
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,720
 Of course, in this so-called

150
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,220
 "pure rationality" and "respectful" area

151
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,620
 Nazi never advocated the return of religion

152
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:34,720
 and did not advocate the so-called "return of the religious"

153
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,800
 because he thought that the return of religion

154
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,300
 would only bring trouble to humanity

155
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,240
 like throwing a stone at your own feet

156
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,780
 So, Nazi urged us to face and embrace the mystery

157
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:53,480
 in the Western Christianity

158
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,620
 and the Christian "disenclosure"

159
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:01,460
 which has existed inside

160
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:07,160
 This book has been a great source of inspiration

161
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,960
 for us to read

162
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,600
 The author suggested that we start with two chapters

163
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,100
 One is called "Atheism and Monotheism"

164
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:27,680
 and the other is called "The Construction of Monotheism"

165
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,480
 The two chapters can roughly explain

166
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,880
 the basic concept of the book

167
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,760
 What does this mean?

168
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,620
 It means that the modern atheism

169
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:42,760
 is basically born from the Christian monotheism

170
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,460
 But if there is no so-called

171
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,800
 "monotheism" in the ancient Greek philosophy

172
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,400
 then the Christian monotheism

173
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,600
 may not have appeared in history

174
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,340
 So, simply put, the analysis found that

175
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:03,180
 atheism and monotheism are not opposites

176
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:08,020
 but are in fact a complex relationship

177
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:14,360
 Both emphasize the principle of "uniqueness and supreme"

178
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,060
 but the two are different in how to face

179
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:22,460
 and respond to the so-called "uniqueness and supreme"

180
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:26,340
 The Christian monotheism calls this "uniqueness"

181
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:29,940
 and "supreme" as God

182
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,480
 At the same time, we find that

183
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,580
 this kind of God, which is seen as

184
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:40,980
 "uniqueness, supreme" and "superior"

185
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:44,020
 seems to be a stronger God

186
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,560
 but at the same time, it also

187
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:50,560
 can be colorful and unifying

188
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,560
 to experience the divine

189
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,400
 with the experience of "limitedness"

190
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,140
 in this world

191
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,940
 until the whole world slowly becomes "unique"

192
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:06,040
 and loses its "uniqueness"

193
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,380
 and finally the two worlds are closed

194
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,580
 Of course, God's "superiority"

195
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:16,760
 also opens up the ability to "unify"

196
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:20,320
 and thus the two worlds cannot be completely closed

197
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,100
 On the other hand, according to the so-called "monotheism"

198
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,440
 it is actually a product of the so-called "divine"

199
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,940
 emptying the divine

200
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,300
 What does the so-called "monotheism" like to do?

201
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:37,180
 It likes to seal the principle of "supreme"

202
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:43,320
 with reason, science, power, etc.

203
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,620
 But in the end, it is also in the whole history

204
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,860
 to experience the so-called "meaning"

205
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:56,160
 or the wasteland of "sense" and "truth"

206
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,900
 Nancy believes that if we want to get rid of

207
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,160
 this civilized confinement

208
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,340
 we must deconstruct the "one-god" theory

209
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:07,740
 God is understood as a complete "duality"

210
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:10,780
 and it is a permanent escape

211
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:14,080
 from our definition or limitation

212
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,020
 In this sense

213
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,880
 God is not the "one-god" theory

214
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,380
 that is worshiped

215
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,020
 nor is it the "superiority" theory

216
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,520
 that is vigorously pursued

217
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,560
 and is to be understood

218
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,460
 What is the so-called "God"?

219
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,040
 God is "absence"

220
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,740
 God is "absence"

221
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,900
 But don't get me wrong

222
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,380
 I don't mean

223
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,880
 God ignores the world

224
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,480
 God is missing

225
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:47,580
 or God is free to go around the world

226
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:50,380
 I don't mean that

227
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:54,460
 I mean that God's presence is absence itself

228
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,620
 God's presence is absence itself

229
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,060
 This kind of absence is not empty

230
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,200
 but rather full of power

231
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,140
 full of openness

232
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:10,100
 and full of possibility

233
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,240
 This openness can be a space for growth

234
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,980
 and a new experience for the meaning, relationship

235
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,780
 and the existence of God

236
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,420
 Interestingly

237
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,180
 Nancy used the "absence theism"

238
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:27,160
 which we can translate as "absence theism"

239
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,920
 to deconstruct the "one-god" theory

240
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,020
 and the "one-god" theory

241
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:34,900
 God basically

242
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:39,500
 breaks the confinement of the main character

243
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,740
 God is neither the main character

244
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,300
 nor a subject

245
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:48,680
 but a spread of openness

246
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,180
 mystery and a convention

247
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,920
 We will see a few chapters

248
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,020
 about faith

249
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:01,560
 These chapters basically

250
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,660
 explore a large number of theologians

251
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,700
 including the reformist master Derrida

252
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:11,000
 This process shows the complexity of Christianity

253
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,060
 and its internal structure

254
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,940
 One of the chapters deals directly with the Gospels

255
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,400
 If you are interested in the Bible

256
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,340
 I am sure you will be very interested in this chapter

257
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:25,580
 because it clearly shows the activity

258
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,480
 and embodiment of the faith

259
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:32,720
 and the activity and embodiment of the faith

260
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,820
 The other chapter deals with the "disclosure of the gospel"

261
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,420
 It is interesting that

262
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,520
 it not only explores the "one-god" theory

263
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,800
 but also the Christian experience

264
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,840
 The title of the chapter is "Disclosure"

265
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:54,340
 which provides a very conclusive point of view

266
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:57,340
 In general, this book invites us

267
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,240
 to rethink our faith

268
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,240
 and allows us to discover

269
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,980
 that Christianity has the ability to disclose

270
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:09,780
 In short, "Disclosure"

271
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,420
 clearly illustrates the fact that

272
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:14,760
 the "one-god" is a kind of openness

273
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:20,020
 God is both presence and absence

274
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:22,360
 He is far and close

275
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,900
 He is both within our grasp

276
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,260
 and beyond our grasp

277
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,900
 This book is a philosophical book

278
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,000
 but I believe that for those who love faith

279
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,600
 and reflect on the Gospels

280
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,500
 you will find that this book

281
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:39,980
 is surprising and insightful

282
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:43,320
 at the same time, it is challenging

283
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,020
 but also very hopeful

284
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:49,280
 I hope you will like this book

285
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:55,020
