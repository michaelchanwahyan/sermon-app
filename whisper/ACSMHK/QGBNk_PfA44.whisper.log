[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640]   [Music]
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.640]   Hello, I am Wong Kwok Wai
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.040]   Director of the Chinese Academy of Psychiatry
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.840]   and a pastor of the Catholic Church
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.640]   Today I would like to introduce a book
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.200]   called "Alone Together"
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.960]   It is translated from Chinese to Japanese
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.400]   and is called "在一起孤獨"
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.360]   The author is Sherry Turco
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.320]   She studied psychology and psychology
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.200]   in the United States in the 1970s
[00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.720]   She started her research in the US
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.200]   in the 70s
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200]   She studied the relationship between people
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.640]   and the internet and computers
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.040]   that were developed over time
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.040]   In the early 70s and 80s
[00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.760]   when the internet and computers were popular
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.000]   she was very excited
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.360]   She thought that people could communicate
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.480]   with each other in a large number of ways
[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.520]   and that it would help human relations
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.200]   But when she continued to do research
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.320]   she found that it was not necessarily the case
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.960]   She found that today
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.480]   especially when it is convenient to communicate by mobile phone
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.920]   or by short message
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.280]   it may be a negative influence on us
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.320]   In fact, we often think that technology is a tool
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.200]   like I use it, it won't affect us
[00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.720]   But it is not
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.680]   Let's see
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.600]   If we have a tool
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.560]   we use it a lot
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.280]   our hands will get numb
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.960]   And we will find that technology
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.240]   is also a potential impact on our culture
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.680]   For example
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.200]   before the bell
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.600]   when was the time to go to class
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.560]   when was the time to finish the teacher's speech
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.040]   When he finished his speech
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.080]   when he finished what he wanted to say
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.920]   But how do we decide today
[00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.240]   when the worship is over
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.920]   We just look at the bell
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.440]   So we find that the emergence of technology
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.480]   is affecting our culture
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.600]   So this author's research
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.120]   especially in the field of communication
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.160]   tells us
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.880]   how our human relations
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.720]   are affected by mobile phones and short messages
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.480]   Simply put, she found that
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.640]   these short messages and communications
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.880]   let us put people around us
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.760]   or the objects we communicate with
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.400]   in a very safe place
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.280]   What does it mean?
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.040]   I can touch it
[00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.120]   But it won't get close to a place
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.240]   that is affecting me
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.000]   Maybe everyone will do this in a short message
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.880]   I can touch it
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.440]   But it may be very simple
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.360]   Do I need to see it
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.600]   to see its eyebrows?
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:36.720]   It's not very useful
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:37.920]   So we are very comfortable
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.160]   We can put it in a place where we can touch it
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.240]   The author's point is to connect it
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.520]   But he said
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   As time goes by
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.840]   especially the younger generation
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.640]   have less chance to meet people and talk to them
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.520]   They don't know how to look at people's eyebrows
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.560]   or respond to them
[00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.880]   They don't know how to communicate with people
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.720]   He said
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.760]   We know how to connect with people
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.160]   but we don't know how to communicate with people
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.680]   But he also observed one thing
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.040]   It turns out that people
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.800]   have a deep relationship with others
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.240]   It's very important
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.240]   So he said
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.160]   What phenomenon will technology bring?
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.360]   We are looking forward to having a deep communication with people
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.480]   But we are not very good at doing things
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.400]   because of the influence of technology
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.640]   It brings such an impact
[00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.080]   I especially like
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.200]   This author is not a Christian
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.240]   But the results of his research
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.440]   are very consistent with what the Bible says
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.680]   The Bible says
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.960]   Loneliness is a bad thing
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.040]   Lonely
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.520]   So God wants to solve loneliness
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:44.160]   Maybe he uses a lot of animals in the beginning
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.720]   to see if he can be his companion
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.040]   But it doesn't work
[00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.880]   God eventually has to be a man
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.120]   And we immediately find that
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.040]   it is a very troublesome thing
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.880]   Maybe God requires a lot from us
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:00.640]   Maybe God has a lot of restrictions
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.240]   It is very difficult for us to love each other
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.800]   But according to this author
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.200]   if we only put our relationship with others
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.600]   in a state of "I am comfortable"
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:13.920]   and "It's for my own good"
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.000]   it is not a very satisfactory relationship
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.480]   Let's go back to the Bible
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.800]   God bestowed the cross to Adam
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.760]   But in the end, everyone committed a crime
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.640]   and it was very troublesome
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.640]   The interesting thing is
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.000]   our interpersonal relationship
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.080]   may teach us that
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.480]   yes, love each other
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.480]   It may be very troublesome to
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.720]   hold on to someone I don't like
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.240]   But the richness of our life
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.560]   our love for each other
[00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:41.880]   can be obtained in these relationships
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:44.920]   So I think this book is very open
[00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:46.960]   If you have time to read it
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.960]   I hope you will like it
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.960]   [music]
