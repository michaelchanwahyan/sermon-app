[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   [Music]
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.200]   Hello, everyone
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.160]   My name is Lee Tien-kwan
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.960]   I am a teacher at the Catholic Academy of the Holy See
[00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.840]   I teach systematic theology
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.400]   Today I would like to introduce a book
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.200]   about the study of the Five Elements
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.800]   Many people have asked me
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.280]   what books to introduce
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.040]   when I teach or share this topic
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:22.640]   So today I would like to introduce a book
[00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.680]   that is often referred to as "church"
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.640]   in the Chinese language
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.320]   or "theology"
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.000]   Today I would like to introduce a book
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   that is based on the study of the Five Elements
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.600]   or even a broader study
[00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.240]   of the Five Elements, called "Pentecostalism"
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.640]   It is a broader study
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.840]   and is not often mentioned in the Chinese language
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.480]   This book is called "Global Pentecostalism"
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.600]   The title is
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.040]   "The New Phase of Christian Social Engagement"
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.440]   It is written by two scholars
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.240]   They are not members of the Five Elements
[00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.680]   One is Donald E. Mueller
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.360]   He studies religious and social science
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.920]   The other is Ted Yamamori
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.760]   He is an NGO that deals with poverty
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.440]   When the two of them work together
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.120]   they want to conduct research
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.040]   on developing countries
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.440]   especially on Christian churches
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.880]   that are developing rapidly
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.080]   and have no police support
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.080]   but are active in serving society
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.640]   and even bringing about social transformation
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.280]   in the church
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.120]   In their research
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.640]   they found that 85% of the churches
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.680]   were the Five Elements and the Holy Spirit
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.200]   So they changed the title of the book
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.200]   to "Pentecostalism"
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.200]   The book is based on
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.320]   the study of the Five Elements
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.640]   in a global way
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.600]   Because when we study the Five Elements
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.880]   or the Pentecostalism
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.000]   especially in the Chinese language
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.520]   we use the "three-wave theory"
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   We say that the United States is the center
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.920]   and the "made in USA" is the direction
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.000]   But today many people
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.600]   are looking at it from a global perspective
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.040]   They found that
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.440]   the Pentecostalism
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.120]   is not only the development of the United States
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.480]   the development of the "one, two, three waves"
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.640]   but also the development of different revival movements
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.520]   in the world
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.760]   So they divided the groups
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.560]   into five major groups
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.840]   The first group is the classical Pentecostalism
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.920]   which is the five-fold tradition
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.800]   The second group is the individualistic
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.200]   but five-fold-style
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.840]   or the local-style
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.080]   or the local-style
[00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.240]   or the local-style
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.800]   The third group is the spiritual movement
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.440]   or the third-wave-influenced
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.000]   or the third-wave-influenced
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.360]   The fourth group is the individualistic
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.240]   but the five-fold-style
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:05.040]   or the local-style
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.120]   The fifth group is very special
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.400]   It is very rare to see
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.600]   It is a group of individual believers
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.960]   who participated in a special meeting
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.520]   and had spiritual experience
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.600]   Because of this experience
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.400]   they also had many faith-filled activities
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.480]   From a global perspective
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.360]   it is a rich study of the three-wave theory
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:32.720]   of the Pentecostalism
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.960]   Especially the local churches
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.600]   which are not influenced by the West
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.160]   This is a great criticism of the three-wave theory
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.400]   The second feature is that
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.640]   this book is studied by non-Pentecostalists
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.400]   or the people of the Bible
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.760]   They mainly use cross-scientific research
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.440]   especially religious psychology
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.600]   The study of the three-wave theory
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.080]   shows us a broader direction of the Pentecostalism
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.800]   especially in the university
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.400]   not limited to the diocese or church
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.440]   There are also many scientific integrations
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.680]   They use social theories
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.320]   such as Marx, Jurgen, Sigmund Freud
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.640]   to study the three-wave theory
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.040]   Of course, the authors
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.800]   or the two authors
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.560]   emphasize that
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.320]   these social theories
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.960]   often weaken religious phenomena
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.880]   But from their perspective
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.280]   I think they have a breakthrough
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.920]   In addition to social theories
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.760]   they also use the email theorem
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.280]   to study worship
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.360]   and how to integrate the whole community
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.200]   into a single theory
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.800]   They are also careful
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.040]   to avoid neglecting
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.680]   or denying some supernatural works
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.320]   This is a key point or breakthrough
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.720]   in their research
[00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.160]   This book emphasizes
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.800]   the Christian social engagement
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:05.680]   As I said
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.240]   85% of the church
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.360]   is Pentecostal and spiritual
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.520]   In fact, it means
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.520]   that many of our understanding of the Pentecostalism
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.360]   is based on the doctrine of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.520]   or they emphasize the aspect of the Holy Spirit
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.480]   But today, from a global perspective
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.760]   when we look at this data
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.440]   they are not conservative
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.560]   Christian believers
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.760]   They are very involved in society
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.520]   and participate in the transformation of society
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.880]   So in this book
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.120]   they call these Christian believers
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:42.880]   or Pentecostal believers
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.960]   "progressive Pentecostalism"
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.560]   which means they are progressive
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.120]   or they are believers who are in favor of Pentecostalism
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.880]   This is a new perspective
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:57.040]   of the Pentecostalism research
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.600]   and the Pentecostalism church
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   It is very interesting
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.760]   It compares the Pentecostalism
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:06.080]   with the Pentecostalism in Latin America
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.680]   There is a quote
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.360]   that I think is worth reading
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.880]   It says
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.680]   "Liberation theology opted for the poor
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:17.760]   at the same time that the poor were opting for Pentecostalism"
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.600]   In fact, it says
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.360]   that in Latin America
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.400]   the reformation of society was the doctrine of the Holy Spirit
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.080]   But in the public sphere
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:27.200]   many people's needs
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.240]   whether they are sick
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.240]   or in economic need
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.400]   are not satisfied by the doctrine of the Holy Spirit
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.240]   but by the Five-Day Feast
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.400]   or the Church of the Holy Spirit
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.400]   Their social programs
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.400]   such as orphanages, medical care
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.400]   social support
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.240]   and even job hunting
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.800]   have been extended to
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.280]   Protestant ethics
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.720]   Pentecostal ethics
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.600]   and many other economic topics
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.160]   which are also very important
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.400]   in the Five-Day Feast
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.480]   Here you can see
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:04.800]   the uniqueness of this book
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.360]   At the end, there are two bullet points
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.400]   The first bullet point is that
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.000]   this book is very special
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.080]   It introduces Hong Kong
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.560]   Of course, when these two authors
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.360]   visited Hong Kong and Singapore
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.560]   they were a bit skeptical
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.360]   whether they were developing countries
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:24.240]   But they did research on these churches
[00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:27.600]   They studied the Church of the Holy Spirit
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.960]   the Pentecostal Church
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:32.000]   At first, they were a bit skeptical
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:33.760]   But gradually they found that
[00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.000]   they did not want to establish an organization
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.760]   but to lead by the Holy Spirit
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.920]   So they did not need to raise funds
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.600]   They did not want to establish a church
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.080]   but to build a group of people
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:47.040]   who love each other because of God's love
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:49.120]   This made them very optimistic
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.520]   Of course, they also visited a pastor
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.520]   in Hong Kong to explain the doctrine
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:56.800]   The pastor was a PhD student
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:00.720]   in an important Canadian school
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.640]   Of course, he was not a pastor of the Five-Day Feast
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.280]   But he saw that there were many new ideas
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.400]   about the Five-Day Feast
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.640]   This is also a very important point
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.480]   in this book
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.600]   Of course, they also visited the Holy See
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.880]   the Holy See in the Central Park
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:21.200]   So this is worth mentioning
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.040]   The second bullet point is that
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.120]   if you are interested in the Five-Day Feast
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.360]   you can read two more extended translations
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:33.040]   The first is the "Pentecostalism" published in 1997
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:41.600]   This is a global study of the Five-Day Feast
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:43.440]   It has already broken the "Three-Wheel Theory"
[00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.600]   It was published in 1997
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.800]   The other one is a new one
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.480]   It is a handbook on Pentecostal theology
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:53.840]   This book is very good
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.960]   because it covers almost all the topics
[00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.080]   of the Five-Day Feast
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.680]   Each chapter is written by a research expert
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.960]   or a book expert
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.240]   It is only about ten pages
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:10.320]   You can understand the whole topic
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.600]   It is very worth reading
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:15.520]   I hope that when you are interested in Pentecostalism
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:19.440]   you can read the above book
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:20.480]   Thank you
