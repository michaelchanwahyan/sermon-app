[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [Pause]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Hello. Okay. Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   I'm very excited. I'm very happy to be here.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Also, my wife and my son, they are very happy to be here among you.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   This morning, when I came to the church, this church, also when I entered the door,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   I felt like I'm in my family.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   I think this is very important because we are far away from our country, our home,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   maybe 10,000 kilometers, but still we are feeling like in the same family.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   [Pause]
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Yes, thank you.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Yeah. Sorry. Which?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   [Pause]
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   Okay. Okay. Yeah, I am Ozan.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   My family and my wife, Esen, my son is Yalan.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   We are coming from Turkey. Also, we are coming from Muslim background.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I came to faith 17 years ago.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Also, my wife and I, we are joining the same church for 17 years.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Our church is the local church, the biggest and also the first local church in Turkey.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   We are serving in our church. Also, I am serving one Christian organization as a full-time worker, as a staff.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   We are trying to reach people to share the gospel and share the God's love to people,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   especially young people in Turkey.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   It's not easy, I know, because Turkey population is 85 million people.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   But just 20,000 Christians, 20,000 believers in Turkey.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   That's why we have a lot of work. We have a lot of work to reach people, to share the gospel, to make a discipleship in Turkey.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   As I said, I feel very happy to be here, to be among you, because you know thousands of churches in the world,
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   but at the same time, there is one church in the world.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   We are members of that church, that one church.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Also, we worship the same God. Also, we say as father, the same God, as the same father.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   That's why, thank you so much. You make us feel we are in the same family.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   This is my third time in Hong Kong. I always told my wife and my son, I love Hong Kong, I love Hong Kong brothers and sisters.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Their faith are very strong, they are powerful in the faith.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   They always say, "Oh, okay, okay, why Ozan said like this, why Ozan said that?"
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   But that time, we came as a family to Hong Kong, and they felt like me, the same thing, same feelings.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   For example, today, it was maybe 10 minutes, but this 10 minutes is very important for us,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   because they felt like we are in family, same family, even my son.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah, the Turkey is 85 million people live in Turkey, 99% Muslim people.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   25%?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   99%.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   99%, oh, 99% are Muslim.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   You can, yes, you can see.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Yeah, but there were many Christians in this land, in Turkey.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Many Christians, you know, from the screen, 19, 20, 27, no, 19, 14, 25% Christians in Turkey before.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   But now, it's too less, too few, just 20,000 people.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   But we want to revival in Turkey, in our country.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   We want to revival come to Turkey again.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Also, we want to rebuild destroyed walls in Turkey.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   We want to rebuild destroyed walls Church of Turkey again.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   As you know from the Nehemiah.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Nehemiah wanted to rebuild destroyed walls of Jerusalem.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Also, we want this same thing in Turkey, Church of Turkey.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We want to rebuild destroyed walls Church of Turkey.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   You know, this one?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Okay, as you know from the Bible, Turkey has a very important place for history of the Christianity.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Also, you know from Abraham, city of Haran, can you see?
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Haran, Antioch, Cappadocia.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   We know from Bible, this place. Also, Abraham and his family lived in Haran.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Also, mountain Ararat is very important place in the Bible. Noah's Ark landed in mountain Ararat.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Also, Hittite civilization, they are very dominant civilization in Turkey in this land before.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Also, you know from the New Testament, most of Jesus disciples spent their gospel journey in Turkey, in this land.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   When we look at the Acts in the Bible, many Christian communities planted this place, this area.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   Also Ephesus, Colossae and Galatia are towns and regions in Turkey.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   You know Apostle Paul, he was born in Tarsus.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Most of his ministry was in Tarsus, in this land.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Also, the seven churches is very important in the Revelation.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   You can see from the map, Pergamon, Smyrna, Ephesus, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Lots of place from the Bible.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   That's why we want to come to revival in Turkey again, like before.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Also, the other important place is Cappadocia. You know Cappadocia from the Bible? This is very, very important place.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   After persecution, the Christian people went to escape to Cappadocia place, this place you can see.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   If you go to Cappadocia, you can see, you can visit many underground cities in Cappadocia.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   These cities built by the first believers, first Christians.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   Also, you can see many Bible motifs on the walls in cave.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Also, Antioch. Antioch is very important in Christianity, for Christianity. Also, Turkey, maybe you heard before, there was an earthquake, very big earthquake in Antioch, in Turkey.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   Modern name is Antakya.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Ancient church destroyed, but spiritual church will be stronger than before. Kingdom of God will come again to Antioch.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Many buildings collapsed, destroyed, many people escaped from Antioch.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   But we want to rebuild again in Antioch, but not just building, we want to rebuild spiritually.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   As I said, we are coming from Izmir, Smyrna.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   The Bible says about Smyrna church in the Revelation book called Faithful Church. Smyrna is Faithful Church.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   I can say this, Smyrna Church is still Faithful.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Smyrna Church is reflecting God's love to people in Turkey, in Izmir.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   You know from the Revelation 2, 8, 11.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   Brothers and sisters, we want to raise the church up with your prayers.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   I want to encourage you to pray for Turkey, pray for Middle East.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Because it's hurt my heart because there were many Christians in my country, in my land.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   But now, just 20,000 people.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   God's unique love must reach again in Turkey.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   May the seven churches arise again in Turkey.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   May the seven churches rise again in order to Kingdom of God come to Turkey again.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   And may the church in this land be stronger and greater than before.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Maybe I can read Psalms 24, 7, 10.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   This time I can read, English?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   I don't know Cantonese.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   I will translate to Chinese.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   Lift up your heads, you gates, be lift up, you ancient doors, that the King of Glory may come in.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Who is this King of Glory?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   The Lord is strong and mighty.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   The Lord is mighty in battle.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Lift up your heads, you gates, lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of Glory may come in.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Who is He?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   This King of Glory.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   The Lord Almighty, He is the King of Glory.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   In Turkey, to be Christian, it's not easy. It's difficult.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   There are social pressure from your families, from relatives, from job, friends, from everywhere.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   You have to pay many costs from your life.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   If you come to Jesus in Turkey, you may lost everything in your life.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   Sometimes it's very difficult to walk with God.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Even you may lost your identity.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Because if you say to people, I was Muslim before, but now I am a Christian, they are looking you very weird, very strange.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   As I said, I am coming from a Muslim background. My whole family, my whole relatives are Muslim. Just I am a Christian in my family.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   I came to Jesus through two dreams.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   The dreams are too long, but long story of short, I can say, maybe you heard before, in the Middle East, God speak people through dreams.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Like me.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   My first dream, God touch my back and I got healed and I asked to sky, who is this hand?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Sorry.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Who is this hand?
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   And the majestic voice said, this hand coming from David's descendant.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   David's descendant.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   But,
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   But when I woke up, I was shocked because I didn't know who is David.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I didn't know Jesus descended. Who is Jesus, where is coming from Jesus?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   In my second dream, that time we were just friend, my wife in university and we were walking on the flat area.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   When we were walking, the big mountain appeared in front of us.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   The big mountain.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   And she said, we have to climb this mountain. I said, no we cannot do that because no one has been able to climb this mountain.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   When we were discussing, the man who is coming from the sky, he said, Ozan and Esen, I will suffer for you and I will reach top of the mountain for you.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   And after that, Jesus climbed the mountain. There were many details but I am passing details.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:35.000]   When Jesus reached top of the mountain, the mountain suddenly disappeared.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   In my dream, I was shocked because no one has been able to climb this mountain but Jesus did. And I said, how could Jesus do that?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   And after that, I woke up, three days later, middle of night, I said, okay Jesus, I accept you, I believe you, you are my savior.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And then I came to Jesus, 20 years old and I graduated. But that time, I thought that, oh, my life will be very nice, very good, I will be a powerful Christian.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   I graduated university, I went back to my parents' house.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But every Sunday, I tried to go to church.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And one day, I went to church and come back to home and my father asked me, where did you go today?
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   I said, I went to, I met with my friends, just friends.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   But he asked again. Normally, my father never asks two times. But that time, he asked me, where did you go today?
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   And this time, I said, I went to church.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   He said, asked me, why did you go to church?
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   I said, church is very beautiful place, I love Christian people, they are very friendly, they love me.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   And after that, he started to say bad things to Christian people, and church, and Christianity.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   I said, why do you say bad things to Christian? Because I know them, I know church, I know Christianity, I know brothers and sisters, I felt love from them.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   But my father was getting very angry.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And I realized that, when my father said bad things to Christianity, I realized that I defend my brothers and sisters, also church.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   But I was just six months believer, I didn't know many things about Christianity, many things about Jesus, but I know Jesus changed my life.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   In my first dream, Jesus touched me, God touched me, and I got healed physically, but I know Jesus changed my life, and Jesus gave me spiritual healing.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   We were discussing, it's very, very strong, my father was getting angry, and my mother, my sister, they were crying, they were saying bad things.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   And after three hours, my father, he came to my, near my knee, and he said like this, "You have to choose right now, me or Jesus."
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   It was very difficult, because as I said, I didn't know many things, but also, I had a very nice childhood, I felt love from my family, I love them so much.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   But that time, it was very difficult, when I remember this time, I also feel like very sad. But in this time, I said to my father,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   "I don't want to choose right now, because I love you, and I know you love me."
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   But he said, "You have to choose right now."
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   And I said, "Okay, father, okay, I choose Jesus."
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   The most difficult decision for me.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   Because I love, you love family, right?
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Family, your family loves you, you know, you feel.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   But that time, I believed that I have to choose Jesus.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   And my father looked my eyes and he said, "Okay, you are not my son, you have to go from my home, this is my home."
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   I was crying and said, "How can I go? Where can I go? I had no money, zero, I had no job."
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   But he said, "You have to go from my home, because this is my home, you cannot stay here."
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   My mom and my sister were crying, and I took my bag and I went out from the home.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   I was crying, I had no money because the time is 11pm, 11-12pm.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   I was very angry to God because I said, "I choose Jesus you, but I lost my family."
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   I saw many miracles in my life from God.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Some miracles I cannot remember, but there is one miracle I cannot forget.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   First miracle from God in my life, first miracle.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   I took my bag and I went out from home, I was crying because I had no money, nothing.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   When I was praying and also when I was crying, I opened my eyes and I found very, very small Turkish tailor on the ground.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   This detail is very important for me, also for God I know.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   Just this small tailor, just was enough to use one-way train.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Not for return ticket, just one way.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   I put my card and I went to my Christian brother's house.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   I stayed with them three months.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   Also I joined the church, I joined youth group, my brothers and sisters take care of me.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   My parents didn't talk with me five years, they didn't connect with me, also they didn't come to our wedding.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   I tried to speak with them but they don't want to do connection with me.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   But when I started to speak, I said to you, if you come to Jesus, you may lose many things from your life.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   But at the same time, when you come to Jesus in Turkey, God gives to you new brothers and new sisters, also new family.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   Like you, even you are far away from your country, thousands of kilometers, you may feel like in same family, your brothers and sisters like you.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   That's why I said you, I'm feeling like in my family with you, among you.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   Also Jesus gives to you new identity.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Also this identity cannot be changed, cannot be lost because this is coming from the heaven, coming from the God.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   As I said you, as I told you, we are coming from Muslim background, but also Esen and I, my wife and I are attending same church for 17 years.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   Our church has 250 members, local Turkish.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   I encourage you, if you come to Turkey, if you come to our church, when you speak people, when you talk with people, you can hear lots of miracles from God.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.000]   I'm just one of them, just me.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   But if you talk with other members of church, you will find more miracles happening to you.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   God is doing many, many miracles in Turkey, in Izmir.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Our church planted more than 40 years ago.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Old building was under the apartment.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Has been subjected to many pressures from, in the past, from the government, from the different faith groups.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Even from my father.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   After my family reject me, my father came to church.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   And middle of the sermon, he stopped the sermon, and he said bad things.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   And he said, you steal my son, I will complain you to government, complain to police.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Despite all things, our church stay faithful.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   It was closed many times in the past, many times oppressed by the police, and slandered by the people.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   Like in the revolution, still is faithful.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   25 years, our church met in this building, under the apartment.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   25 years, but it's not too big, it was not too big.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   But our numbers, the people's come to faith, and one time we couldn't fit this church.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And we pray for new place.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   10 years later, God provides new place for us, for our church.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   [Cantonese]
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   And we moved new church, and now our church is growing.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   When you come to Turkey, when you join our church, you can see our church is growing because people coming to faith.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   [Cantonese]
