1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,700
 Have a seat.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:05,780
 Well, I wanna continue our conversation today on intimacy,

3
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:08,440
 this theme that we've been having over us

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,600
 as a church community for this past year.

5
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,100
 And I wanna talk about what I would consider

6
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:17,600
 perhaps one of the most critical things that is involved,

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,040
 not just in your intimacy with God,

8
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,100
 but in particular, your intimacy with one another.

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,980
 I wanna talk a little bit today

10
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:28,520
 about what that intimacy can look like with one another.

11
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,600
 And the topic that I'm talking about,

12
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,160
 I think has probably the greatest power

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,180
 to impact a church community

14
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,060
 with the community in which it's planted in.

15
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,320
 So what we're talking about today

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,640
 has a significant impact into what it is to serve

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,320
 and to bless Hong Kong and the society around it.

18
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,320
 And not only that,

19
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,220
 but when you do what I'm talking about today well,

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,020
 when you do it well in your own life,

21
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,960
 it also has the power to bring you

22
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,480
 into deeper moments of freedom and joy

23
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,480
 that you perhaps can't experience in anything else.

24
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,780
 This topic is really important.

25
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,360
 The topic is what I would call

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,420
 the subversive act of generosity.

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:15,300
 Now I call generosity a subversive act

28
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,720
 because I think that's exactly what generosity does.

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
 When we're generous,

30
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,200
 whether that's with our resources like our time,

31
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,320
 with the resources like our emotions,

32
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,600
 resources like our possessions, our material goods,

33
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
 our resources like our finances,

34
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,040
 whatever those resources might be,

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,480
 when we're generous with them,

36
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:39,480
 that has the power to basically subvert, uproot, overturn,

37
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:44,200
 what I think is our natural human tendency

38
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:46,480
 to hold on to what we have

39
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,920
 at the expense of what others do not have.

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,240
 Are you following this?

41
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,800
 That generosity has this characteristic to it

42
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,840
 where it has the power to subvert this tendency

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,100
 that I think all of us humans struggle with

44
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,960
 to hold on to the things that we have

45
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,240
 at the expense of what others do not have.

46
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,860
 And when we move in the spirit

47
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:11,200
 and in the movement of generosity,

48
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,960
 what we're doing is we're subverting

49
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,440
 that tendency in our lives

50
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,640
 and we're then opening ourselves and those around us

51
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,040
 to some of the most profound and beautiful encounters

52
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,320
 and moments with the character of God

53
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:26,360
 that they can experience

54
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,880
 'cause God's character is to be generous.

55
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,480
 So when his people are generous,

56
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,040
 they're revealing something of the nature

57
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,320
 and the character of God to the world.

58
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,200
 And that can happen

59
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,960
 through some of the smallest acts of generosity

60
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,760
 as well as some of the largest.

61
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,600
 Give me an example.

62
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,220
 About 30 years ago, I became a Christian.

63
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,640
 So about 30 years ago, I gave my life to Jesus.

64
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,000
 And then shortly after that,

65
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,320
 about a year into being a Christian,

66
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,200
 I was mentored by somebody

67
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,080
 who was a part of our youth ministry at that time.

68
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,680
 The youth ministry was called Saturday Night Alive.

69
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,960
 And I was being mentored by a guy called Doggan.

70
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,080
 And Doggan, for me in those days, and he still is today,

71
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,200
 he's like one of the most radical Christians

72
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,640
 I have ever met, okay?

73
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,000
 Doggan like lives, eats, sleeps, drinks, and breathes Jesus.

74
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,960
 There's Jesus and there's Doggan.

75
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,140
 And Andrew in those days was like way down the list, okay?

76
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:22,340
 I was a new Christian, didn't really know too much.

77
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,340
 One day he reached out to me.

78
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,420
 He said, "Hey, let's hang out.

79
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,580
 "Let's get together and hang out."

80
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,740
 And I thought that'd be great.

81
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,860
 I met him in one chai, MTR.

82
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:29,700
 And as I met him, he said,

83
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:32,220
 "Okay, we're gonna go into Southern Playground

84
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,860
 "and we're going to actually minister

85
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,540
 "to the drug addicts and the street sleepers

86
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,700
 "that hang out in Southern Playground.

87
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,780
 "I'm a new Christian, I'm freaking out.

88
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,260
 "I don't know how to do that.

89
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:43,420
 "I've never gone out and done something like that."

90
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,820
 He's like, "Don't worry, it's fine.

91
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,260
 "Everybody will speak Cantonese.

92
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,640
 "So I will speak to everybody in Cantonese."

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,480
 He's Chinese.

94
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,640
 He's like, "I'm gonna speak to everybody in Cantonese.

95
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:54,520
 "Andrew, your role is just to pray."

96
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,600
 I'm like, "Cool, I can pray."

97
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,480
 He's like, "Pray in tongues, pray in the spirit, whatever.

98
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,760
 "Just pray whilst I share in Cantonese."

99
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,140
 So we go out to Southern Playground just along here.

100
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,440
 And sure enough, we meet a couple of these guys.

101
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,000
 And it's quite obvious that they're either street sleepers

102
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,960
 or they're drug addicts just by the way they looked

103
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,920
 and the way they were dressed and their face and everything.

104
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,380
 It was quite a sad situation.

105
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,520
 Doggan begins to share in Cantonese

106
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:19,820
 the good hope of Jesus with these people.

107
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,420
 And I'm there, I'm praying.

108
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,940
 And as soon as I start to pray,

109
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,580
 I hear God say something very specifically to me.

110
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,380
 He said, "Andrew, I want you to take off the cross

111
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,580
 "that you're wearing,

112
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,260
 "and I want you to give it to this man."

113
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,580
 Now this is way before I had any idea

114
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,940
 that he knows anything about Jesus,

115
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,440
 is a Christian or anything like that.

116
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,280
 I feel like God is saying,

117
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,220
 "Take off your cross and give it to this man."

118
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,660
 Now that might sound like a small thing,

119
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,920
 but this cross had been given to me by Chris.

120
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,260
 We weren't even married at the time.

121
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,980
 I think we were engaged at the time.

122
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:50,660
 And she'd given me this cross

123
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:52,780
 as like a gift of our engagement.

124
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,020
 I had given her a ring.

125
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:54,900
 She'd given me a cross.

126
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,540
 This was a very, very beautiful thing.

127
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:59,500
 It was a very precious, personal thing for me.

128
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,000
 And I was feeling like God was saying,

129
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,680
 "Give this to this man, this random man,

130
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,960
 "who I don't even think knows

131
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,620
 "or has accepted Jesus into his life."

132
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:09,940
 And I'm like, I don't know if I can give up

133
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:14,140
 something that is so sentimental and so precious to me

134
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,820
 to some random drug addict.

135
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,240
 I don't think that's what I'm gonna do.

136
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,080
 But as I'm praying,

137
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:22,220
 God is compressing this on my heart over and over again.

138
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,500
 And so eventually I'm kinda like,

139
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:24,960
 "Okay, well, I'm a new Christian.

140
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,780
 "I guess I better be obedient to God."

141
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,700
 And I said, "Okay, I'll do this."

142
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,420
 So now Dorgan's been speaking to this guy over this time

143
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,440
 for about five minutes.

144
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,020
 And after about five minutes, he turns to me and he says,

145
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,860
 "Have you been sensing anything in prayer?"

146
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,460
 And so I said to him, "Well, actually, funnily enough, yes.

147
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:43,060
 "I feel like God wants me to give this man my cross."

148
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:46,980
 Now, as soon as I said that, Dorgan's face goes white.

149
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,340
 And he's like, "Oh, dude," he goes,

150
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,580
 "you'll never guess what's happened.

151
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,000
 "I'm speaking to this guy in Cantonese.

152
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
 "I'm preaching the gospel.

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,140
 "I'm sharing Jesus with him.

154
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,180
 "But the whole time, God's been speaking to me

155
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:57,940
 "about giving my cross to him."

156
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,380
 And he said, "You don't understand, Andrew,

157
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,860
 "but my wife gave me this cross.

158
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,380
 "And this cross means a lot to me."

159
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:06,460
 And he's like, "I said to God,

160
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,820
 "no, I'm not gonna give him my cross.

161
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,780
 "And now you're telling me

162
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,200
 "that God told you to give your cross.

163
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,300
 "You should give your cross to this man."

164
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,340
 (audience laughing)

165
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,060
 I'm like, "That's so generous of you, Dorgan.

166
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:19,680
 "What a giver."

167
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,700
 So I figured I better be obedient.

168
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,300
 So I took off my cross, my precious cross

169
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,420
 that my wife had given me, or fiance.

170
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,180
 And as I held it out to this man,

171
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,780
 Dorgan's explaining what this is.

172
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,540
 The man unbuttons his shirt and he's wearing this,

173
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:37,180
 one of those kind of jade and gold Buddha,

174
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:39,780
 a big Buddha around his neck.

175
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:44,960
 And as the man decides to take off the Buddha from his neck,

176
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,140
 as he gets literally over his head like this,

177
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,340
 he starts to shake.

178
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,700
 And this was the first time

179
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,900
 that I'd ever seen anyone do a demonic manifestation.

180
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,700
 And he starts to shake and he starts to shout in Cantonese.

181
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,940
 And Dorgan begins to gently talk back with him.

182
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,300
 And then Dorgan takes my cross

183
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,700
 and puts it over this guy's neck.

184
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,780
 And honestly, as it went over his neck,

185
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:11,460
 almost at the same place that the medallion came off,

186
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,580
 as the cross went over, peace came over him.

187
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,020
 It was one of the most profoundly beautiful things

188
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,020
 I had ever witnessed.

189
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,780
 And Dorgan begins to pray for this man.

190
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:23,900
 And the man's in tears, I'm in tears, Dorgan's in tears.

191
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,180
 Dorgan's feeling slightly guilty

192
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,300
 'cause he didn't give up his cross,

193
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,340
 but I was the good Christian in that moment.

194
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:32,880
 So I was in tears.

195
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:36,820
 And I learned that day that there's a subversive act

196
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,140
 that happens when we're generous.

197
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:42,300
 That there's something that gets dislodged in us

198
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,740
 when we do it.

199
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,100
 And I think it's this tendency of moving against idolatry.

200
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,740
 It's this tendency of, I think we all have,

201
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,260
 with the things that we have in our lives,

202
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,340
 the resources we have, we wanna hold onto those things

203
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,900
 and we wanna grasp a hold of them really tightly.

204
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,140
 And when we release them,

205
00:07:57,140 --> 00:08:00,300
 we release the grasp that those things have over us.

206
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,540
 Sometimes we don't realise that when we grasp a hold

207
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:04,460
 of our possessions really tightly,

208
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:06,500
 what's really grasping is not us with them,

209
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,100
 it's them with us.

210
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:11,500
 That's the idolatrous nature of these things on our lives.

211
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,860
 And our act of generosity is a way of doing two things.

212
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,740
 It releases that idolatry from us.

213
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,900
 It releases that grip that those things can have on us,

214
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,340
 but it also releases the gospel outwards into the world.

215
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,460
 Does that make sense?

216
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,540
 So I wanna talk to you about generosity a little bit today

217
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:31,860
 and link that a bit to our intimacy with God.

218
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,860
 And I wanna start by telling you that there's no surprise

219
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,180
 that I'm doing this after Chinese New Year last week.

220
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:41,380
 Chinese New Year, where Ellison so eloquently told us

221
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,580
 that the main thing that we say at Chinese New Year,

222
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:47,180
 Gong Hei Fa Chui, is actually hope you get rich.

223
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,780
 Are you with me, church?

224
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,620
 It's not a surprise, therefore, that God would say,

225
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,660
 "Let's talk about generosity the next Sunday.

226
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,340
 "I hope you get rich if it means you'll be more generous."

227
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,500
 Amen?

228
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,540
 Here's something I've noticed, though.

229
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,820
 Oftentimes when we get richer, we get less generous.

230
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,260
 And I wanna talk a little bit about that

231
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:05,700
 with you here today as well.

232
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,420
 Let me give you some thoughts, biblically,

233
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:09,940
 a theology of generosity to start with.

234
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,340
 The Bible's very, very clear

235
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:15,100
 that every single resource in this world

236
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:18,860
 comes and flows from the same source, and that is God.

237
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:21,420
 In other words, everything that we have ever received,

238
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,700
 creation itself, all the way down to every dollar

239
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,980
 that is in your bank account,

240
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,100
 every time that you have the emotions that you have,

241
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,740
 everything that you have in your life,

242
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:30,740
 the Bible's very clear,

243
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:32,500
 that all comes from the same source.

244
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,700
 It all comes from God.

245
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:36,340
 Now, I want you to think about that this way.

246
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,340
 If God, if everything that you have,

247
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,820
 all the resources in your life have come from God,

248
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,980
 then God is the most generous being there has ever been.

249
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,580
 If all of our resources are from God,

250
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,780
 then God, in his very nature, is generous, right?

251
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,060
 His heart is to give.

252
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:53,940
 This is a really important thing.

253
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,340
 His heart is not to consume and hoard.

254
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:59,260
 His heart is to release and give.

255
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,220
 That's the very nature of who God is.

256
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,100
 If everything comes from him and we have received,

257
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,540
 that means God has released and he has given.

258
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,460
 His generosity means that we have something

259
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,220
 that we can therefore be generous with.

260
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:16,220
 This is really important because a lot of Christians think

261
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:20,140
 that generosity is a moral imperative.

262
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:22,100
 What I mean by that is moral imperative means

263
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,700
 it's an ethically good thing to do.

264
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,300
 We think as Christians, we should be generous,

265
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,380
 whether that's to a charity, whether that's to our church,

266
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:30,860
 with our tithes and our giving.

267
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,460
 We think generosity is linked

268
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:35,060
 to some morally good thing to do.

269
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:38,660
 It's morally right or ethically right to give stuff

270
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:40,180
 to the people who are in need.

271
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:43,220
 The Bible never says that that is at the heart

272
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,060
 of what generosity is.

273
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,300
 The Bible talks about that,

274
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,860
 but it's not the heart of generosity.

275
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:49,100
 The heart of generosity doesn't flow

276
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,820
 from some moral imperative.

277
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,900
 It flows from the nature and the character of God.

278
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:58,900
 In other words, we are generous because God is generous,

279
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,140
 not because it's some ethically right thing to do.

280
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,020
 We are generous because as Christians,

281
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,460
 we want to be and live and reveal the nature

282
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,340
 and character of Jesus to the world.

283
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,740
 Our generosity is part of our revealing

284
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,740
 and understanding the character and the nature of God.

285
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:21,700
 Therefore, generosity is not an act, it is a response.

286
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:24,300
 Think of it this way, generosity is worship.

287
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,980
 'Cause worship is a response out of what God has done for us.

288
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,140
 So when we are generous,

289
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,620
 we're not just fulfilling some moral imperative

290
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:34,900
 in the world, although of course,

291
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:37,060
 it's good to give to those in need.

292
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:42,060
 We are actually worshiping in a response to who God is.

293
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,540
 In this way, generosity is never an act.

294
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,420
 It is always a response.

295
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:53,660
 Therefore, generosity is a lifestyle.

296
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:57,580
 It should be something that flows out of us all the time.

297
00:11:57,580 --> 00:12:00,060
 But again, what happens so often for us Christians

298
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,900
 is that we think about generosity as an act,

299
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,260
 a one-off moment.

300
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,020
 We think that generosity is a mission,

301
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,220
 one thing we should do,

302
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,060
 rather than a mindset, something of who we are.

303
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,660
 And if you keep generosity as a mission,

304
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,560
 a one-off moment, an act,

305
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,500
 there's always gonna be a beginning and an end

306
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,660
 to your generosity.

307
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,940
 But if we flip that and think that generosity

308
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,500
 instead is a mindset out of the response of the character

309
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,900
 and the mindset of God,

310
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,780
 then generosity can begin to flow

311
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,420
 in every aspect of our lives.

312
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:35,300
 We're not thinking, oh, I haven't given my tithe this month.

313
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:38,100
 We're thinking, how do I give of everything that I have

314
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,140
 to flourish what God has given around me?

315
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,660
 Whether that's my time, my energy, my resources,

316
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,020
 my talent, my possessions,

317
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,820
 and yes, of course, my tithe to the church,

318
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:47,860
 whatever it is, I want to give

319
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,980
 out of an overflow of a mindset

320
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,900
 that is committed to revealing the nature

321
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,300
 and the character of God in this world.

322
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,300
 In this way, God calls us to be a generous people,

323
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:02,100
 not a people who are generous.

324
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,940
 There's a big difference between those two things.

325
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,780
 The call is to be a generous people,

326
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,500
 not a people who are occasionally, sometimes generous.

327
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,860
 There are too many Christians in this world

328
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,140
 who are occasionally generous.

329
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:19,940
 When the kind of church that I think Christ died for

330
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,420
 is a generous church, a generous people,

331
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,140
 a people who have made that part of their lifestyle

332
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,460
 and part of their mindset

333
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,380
 and are living out of the overflow of everything being,

334
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:33,020
 how can I be generous in this moment?

335
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,980
 Whatever that moment might be, are you tracking with this?

336
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
 Now, if this is all true,

337
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,100
 if that's a theology of generosity,

338
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,300
 what is the thing that enables us to do this?

339
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,820
 Or perhaps a better way of saying that is,

340
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,660
 what is the thing that stops us

341
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,380
 from actually being generous?

342
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:53,060
 Well, I think to understand

343
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:55,860
 how we live out a lifestyle of generosity

344
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:58,220
 rather than just moments of generosity,

345
00:13:58,220 --> 00:13:59,980
 we have to understand the role that we have

346
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,100
 in the resources God has given us.

347
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,140
 I've already said, haven't I,

348
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,900
 that God has everything in His hands

349
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,500
 and God is the one who gives.

350
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:10,100
 Everything is flowing from the source of God.

351
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,500
 Therefore, God's role is ownership.

352
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,900
 That is not our role.

353
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,660
 But here's the number one mistake Christians make.

354
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,460
 We think we're owners of the things that God has given us.

355
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,140
 You are not an owner of it.

356
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,820
 I'm gonna say that one more time.

357
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:27,060
 You are not an owner of what God has given you.

358
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,340
 Your role is not ownership.

359
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,180
 That's God's role.

360
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,980
 And as soon as you take ownership

361
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,380
 of the things that God has given you, you're playing God.

362
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,420
 That's a very dangerous thing.

363
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,940
 What will happen is you will end up controlling

364
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,220
 what you have 'cause you think you're an owner of it.

365
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:42,100
 You're not an owner.

366
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,180
 God is very clear.

367
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,700
 The very first thing He says to humanity

368
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,820
 after He creates them, I talked about this two weeks ago

369
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,860
 when we talked about sex.

370
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,780
 In Genesis 1 and 2, He creates humanity

371
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,340
 and He gives them His creation.

372
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,620
 And He says, "Go and do what?

373
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,980
 "Go and steward what I have given you."

374
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,060
 So our role is not owner of all the things

375
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:02,180
 that God has created, all the resources at His disposal.

376
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:04,060
 Our role is steward.

377
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:08,420
 You are to be a steward of God's resources.

378
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,460
 That's your role.

379
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,460
 That's what you've been called to.

380
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:15,500
 And stewardship is really, really important.

381
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,300
 Stewardship, it's funny, we think ownership is important

382
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,740
 and stewardship is, stewardship is actually

383
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:22,300
 a huge responsibility.

384
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,620
 Think about this.

385
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:26,180
 If you are a steward of all of God's resources,

386
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,560
 here's the crazy thing.

387
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,860
 Your stewardship will either release more generosity

388
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:35,260
 into this world, the overabundant flow of God's resources,

389
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:38,300
 or it'll release more poverty in this world,

390
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,320
 the inequitable distribution of God's resources.

391
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,080
 - Yeah.

392
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,200
 - I'm gonna say that one more time

393
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,800
 'cause I don't think anybody's getting it in this room.

394
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,400
 It's really important.

395
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:51,160
 Your stewardship, how you think about yourself as a steward,

396
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,640
 will either release more generosity into this world,

397
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,200
 i.e. the flow of God's resources,

398
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,480
 or you will create more poverty in this world

399
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,840
 because there will be more inequitable distribution

400
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,440
 of God's resources.

401
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,880
 So that stewardship is an incredibly important thing.

402
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:08,240
 How we steward will release or withhold.

403
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,320
 How we steward will mean that people

404
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,160
 have an equitable distribution or not.

405
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,120
 How we steward will mean that things flourish around us

406
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,960
 or they won't.

407
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,080
 That's all around us,

408
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,460
 and so stewardship is the gateway to generosity.

409
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:24,240
 And if you think that your role as owner,

410
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,760
 you're gonna be way more frugal

411
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,160
 because here's what you'll think if you're an owner.

412
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:30,640
 If you're an owner, you'll think,

413
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:32,640
 what should I do with this?

414
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,920
 If you're a steward, you'll say,

415
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,580
 what would God do with this?

416
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,400
 Come on, church.

417
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,720
 If you're an owner, you're like,

418
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,080
 okay, what do I do with this?

419
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:46,840
 'Cause this is my resource to do what I want to do with it.

420
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,300
 If you're a steward, you're like,

421
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,760
 everything I have is not mine, it's God's.

422
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:51,800
 What is God's heart?

423
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:52,880
 What is God's character?

424
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:53,840
 What is his nature?

425
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,000
 How should I spend?

426
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,080
 How should I save?

427
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,660
 How should I provide for my family?

428
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,500
 That's a good thing.

429
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,400
 God wants me to do that.

430
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,120
 How do I provide for my family?

431
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,800
 How do I put money away for savings?

432
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,160
 How do I have nice holidays?

433
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,040
 That's all fine.

434
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,160
 There's no problems with that.

435
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,820
 But then equally, what does God say about those things?

436
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,240
 What does God say about my possession?

437
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,740
 What does God say about my spending habits?

438
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,200
 'Cause everything I'm doing here is on behalf of him.

439
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,380
 This is the parable of the talents.

440
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,720
 This is God, Jesus, describing this thing.

441
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,280
 Oh, there's this wealthy landowner,

442
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,680
 and he gives talent to his individual servants,

443
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,320
 and those that know him well take those talents

444
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,880
 and put them to good use and produce an abundance.

445
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,300
 Those that don't know him well and are afraid of him,

446
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,320
 they bury it.

447
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,160
 Are you with me?

448
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:34,980
 And he comes and he says,

449
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,520
 you who stewarded well 'cause you knew me well,

450
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:39,120
 you get to enjoy my kingdom.

451
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,700
 You who stewarded poorly 'cause you don't know me very well,

452
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,560
 you bury it.

453
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,760
 And this is the connection between intimacy and generosity.

454
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,500
 The more intimate we are with God,

455
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,000
 the better stewards of his resources you'll become.

456
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,420
 When we understand his nature and his character

457
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,980
 and who he is, the better it is

458
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:01,820
 that we are to release those things into the world.

459
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:04,320
 We begin to understand how God would treat

460
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,260
 the money in my bank account,

461
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:09,380
 how God would treat the time that I have each week,

462
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:11,840
 how God would treat the talents

463
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,400
 and the gifts God's given me,

464
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,960
 how God would treat my emotional capacity

465
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,540
 that I have towards those around me.

466
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:21,980
 When I understand that I'm a steward,

467
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,800
 God resources can flow,

468
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,060
 and my relationship with him, my intimacy with him

469
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:31,660
 is the gateway to whether that's gonna flow well

470
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,980
 or whether it's not.

471
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:36,800
 Intimacy and generosity are linked.

472
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,820
 Helpful so far?

473
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:40,840
 All right, I've got about five minutes left,

474
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,440
 which is really bad,

475
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,860
 'cause I have about 15 minutes more.

476
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,700
 Is that okay?

477
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,220
 Can you hang with me for a few more minutes?

478
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,620
 'Cause I want you to wanna go to scripture

479
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,460
 'cause you're probably thinking like,

480
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,380
 is Andrew ever gonna talk about scripture ever?

481
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,480
 So let me open up the word of God,

482
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,980
 and this will just take about 15 minutes,

483
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:58,340
 but I want you to see here from Ecclesiastes

484
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,580
 something that is really important about stewardship.

485
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,700
 It says here in Ecclesiastes 4, verses five and six,

486
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:09,080
 "The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.

487
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,320
 "But a one-handful with tranquility,

488
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,740
 "than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind."

489
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,340
 Ecclesiastes is this beautiful writing.

490
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,660
 It's a wisdom literature in the Hebrew scriptures,

491
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,260
 and it's a wisdom tradition

492
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,620
 where it provides provocative imagery

493
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,140
 and very extreme ways of talking

494
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:28,700
 to be able to explain or to understand

495
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,340
 the character and the nature of God.

496
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,380
 Let me read this to you again.

497
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:35,140
 "The fool folds his hands and ruins himself.

498
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,440
 "But a one-handful with tranquility,

499
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,880
 "than two handfuls with toil and chasing after the wind."

500
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,380
 When we read this in the English,

501
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,380
 we see that there are three mentions

502
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,100
 of the word hand in this passage.

503
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,700
 There is the fool who folds their hands,

504
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,380
 there is the one handful with tranquility,

505
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,120
 there are the two handfuls with toil

506
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,280
 and chasing after the wind.

507
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,500
 In the English, we only have one word for hand,

508
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,300
 and that's hand, and so the translators translate it

509
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,940
 as, funnily enough, hand, okay?

510
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,500
 In the Hebrew, though, what's going on here

511
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,780
 is really powerful, because in the Hebrew,

512
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,740
 there's about five different words

513
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,740
 for the word hand in English.

514
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,260
 In the Hebrew, three of those words

515
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,580
 are being used in this passage,

516
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,300
 and each of them is trying to communicate

517
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,500
 something really important about stewardship.

518
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,860
 So let me show you this in the Hebrew,

519
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,540
 and I want you, I've highlighted the three words there

520
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,700
 in the Hebrew that are used here

521
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,900
 and translated in the English hands,

522
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,860
 but each of those words, as you can just tell

523
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,380
 by looking at them, are very different words,

524
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:35,100
 they have very different meanings,

525
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,380
 and they help us to unpack

526
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,820
 what is being said here about stewardship.

527
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,660
 So let me unpack each of these really quickly.

528
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:42,980
 The first thing, oh, and by the way,

529
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:44,140
 to help you illustrate this,

530
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:47,060
 I've got this little box full of rice here,

531
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:49,260
 but I want you to assume that this box

532
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,940
 is like a picture of all the generous resources

533
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:55,340
 and all of the things that God has at His disposal.

534
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:59,380
 They're all the resources that are exposed for us at life,

535
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,740
 all the things that we could have in this life

536
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,020
 out of the generosity of God.

537
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,460
 That's what this represents.

538
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,020
 Now, the wisdom writer says this,

539
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:10,360
 first of all, "The fool folds his hands."

540
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:13,340
 The word there for hand is the word yad,

541
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:16,460
 and the word yad is used throughout the Old Testament

542
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:20,040
 as the word that means the mighty right hand.

543
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,200
 The word yad means might or power or energy.

544
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,820
 It's the word used throughout the Old Testament

545
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:29,100
 to talk about God's right hand at work for His people,

546
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,980
 His mighty right hand to save us.

547
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,580
 So the wisdom writer takes that idea of might and power,

548
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,020
 and he says, "If you have might and power and resource

549
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,860
 "and energy and gifts and talents,

550
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,340
 "and you fold yourself and don't do anything with it,

551
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,520
 "you're a fool," he says.

552
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,780
 So the fool takes the yad that they have.

553
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,900
 Let's say this is all of their resources,

554
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,900
 all of your talent, all of your gifts,

555
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,220
 all the things that God has given you,

556
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,020
 the great stuff, the energy that God has put inside of you,

557
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,780
 and you just decide to check out of life,

558
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:07,300
 that is a fool, the Bible says.

559
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,380
 You've been given so much,

560
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:10,740
 and yet your posture is to fold your hands,

561
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,420
 and he says here, "You will ruin yourself."

562
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,060
 And I think, although it doesn't say it here,

563
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:15,900
 I think what he's also saying is

564
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:18,340
 you will ruin those around you as well,

565
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,860
 'cause you're not flowing any of that equitable distribution

566
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,740
 of God's resource.

567
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,580
 You have yad your hands.

568
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,100
 You've folded them and given up on being generous,

569
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,460
 given up on anything.

570
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,100
 Maybe the modern term for this is the idea of lying flat.

571
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,980
 Have you heard about that recently?

572
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,240
 It's like, "I got this great education,

573
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,860
 "I've got all this stuff going on, blah, blah, blah,

574
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:39,920
 "but I'm just not gonna bother.

575
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,500
 "I'm just gonna kinda check out of life.

576
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,060
 "I'm gonna fold my yad."

577
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,560
 Now, you might be sitting there thinking,

578
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,420
 "I never do that.

579
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,880
 "I work really hard, I'm exhausted all the time.

580
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,720
 "I'm working really hard.

581
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,020
 "I'm using my talents and my gifts,"

582
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,460
 and you're thinking, "I don't really do this very often.

583
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,180
 "I tell you what, every single one of us,

584
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:58,360
 "at some point, we will do this

585
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:01,940
 "to the opportunities that are around us to be generous."

586
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,020
 And I think there's a couple of reasons

587
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:05,100
 why we fold our yad.

588
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:09,460
 The first is that I think maybe we've taken a step out

589
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,740
 in faith in the past with our yad,

590
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:15,220
 with our power or our talent or our gift

591
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,040
 or the energy God has given us.

592
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,340
 We've taken a step out in faith with it

593
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:23,500
 and it's not worked out, or maybe people laughed at us.

594
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,100
 Maybe we tried that talent

595
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,980
 or we tried to be generous with a gift

596
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,180
 and people didn't accept it.

597
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:31,140
 Maybe they laughed at it, maybe they turned away from it,

598
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,180
 maybe they didn't embrace it

599
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,420
 how we thought they were gonna embrace it,

600
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,340
 and we felt shame for that, we felt some embarrassment.

601
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:39,180
 Or maybe we gifted somebody with something

602
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:42,940
 and they just treated it like anything and that hurt us.

603
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,460
 Don't you know how much I prepared that gift?

604
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,380
 Don't you know how much I slaved for that gift

605
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,920
 and I gave that to you and you didn't want it

606
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:48,860
 or you just didn't treat it

607
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,040
 how I thought you were gonna treat it?

608
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,900
 I'm hurt by that, are you with me?

609
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,140
 Hurt, pain, disillusionment,

610
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,700
 that's gonna cause you to fold your yard.

611
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,940
 It's like, well, I tried that before,

612
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,860
 I'm not trying that again.

613
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:02,020
 Well, I gave to that person, but they didn't say thank you,

614
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:05,220
 so I'm never giving to them again, are you with me?

615
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:07,860
 So hurt and disappointment and failure

616
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,180
 will cause us to fold our yard.

617
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,260
 I think here's the other thing that we'll often do it,

618
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:13,100
 and I struggle with this one.

619
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,180
 We think that what we have is not worth giving.

620
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:18,580
 We think like, well, I mean,

621
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,940
 if you compare me to these other people,

622
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:22,580
 if you looked at my bank compared to their bank,

623
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,580
 I mean, they're the ones that should be giving.

624
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:27,740
 God knows how much I've got,

625
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,820
 and God knows I can't give.

626
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,020
 They should give, but not me.

627
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,700
 Or we maybe think, you know,

628
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,540
 like their talent is way better than my talent.

629
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,900
 I'm not gonna sign up to worship,

630
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:39,400
 have you heard Emma sing?

631
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,600
 I can't sing like Emma.

632
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:45,980
 I'm just gonna fold my arms and sit in the chairs.

633
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,580
 By the way, I'm now recruiting for the worship team.

634
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,420
 Just saying, I'm just gonna sit in the pew

635
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,980
 and fold my arms because have you heard her?

636
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:54,300
 Are you with me?

637
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,980
 So not only do we fold our hands

638
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,060
 because of pain and disillusionment and hurt,

639
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:00,300
 we fold our hands because we compare ourselves to others

640
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,140
 and we have insecurity

641
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,460
 and we think we have nothing to offer,

642
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,020
 and we fold our yard.

643
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,380
 Following this?

644
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,900
 Then the Bible says this.

645
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,940
 It says, "Better to have one handful with tranquility

646
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,300
 than two handfuls with toil and chasing after wind."

647
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,420
 Two handfuls here is the word kofen,

648
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:22,420
 and kofen basically means to grasp as to a fist.

649
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,900
 The idea would be like,

650
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,300
 this is all of God's resources that God has,

651
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:30,060
 and we as his people in the stewardship of kofen,

652
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:33,660
 we grab a hold of what God has given us.

653
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:38,020
 Now, on the surface, kofen looks great

654
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,300
 because we've taken responsibility.

655
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,620
 God has, we've not laid flat and crossed our arms

656
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,980
 and gone, "Who cares?"

657
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,180
 We've taken as much as we could,

658
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,460
 and we're holding on for dear life.

659
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,140
 I mean, we've got God's resources in our hands,

660
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,340
 and occasionally those resources come out

661
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,980
 through those moments of generosity,

662
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,140
 but we've got a lot still in our hands.

663
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,100
 And we've got a lot in our hands

664
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,260
 because we wanna make sure that we keep it in our hands,

665
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,580
 'cause we think that it's a good steward

666
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:07,220
 to grasp a hold of what God's given us,

667
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,100
 and we think that this is the right way to go.

668
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
 Let me tell you this.

669
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:13,380
 We think that this is an abundance mentality, kofen,

670
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,460
 but kofen is actually a poverty mentality.

671
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,700
 It's a poverty mentality

672
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:19,180
 because although we think we've got a lot,

673
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,740
 and theoretically we do have a lot,

674
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,020
 we've got two fistfuls of all of those resources.

675
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,660
 The problem is we don't want to let go

676
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,140
 of those resources very much.

677
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:33,180
 And second of all, we can't really put more resources in.

678
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,740
 If you keep your hands fisted,

679
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:38,460
 it's really hard to get more rice in the hand.

680
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:39,780
 Are you with me?

681
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,460
 And we think that this is actually the right thing.

682
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,860
 God's blessed me, and I need to take responsibility

683
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,420
 for the things that God's blessed me with.

684
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:47,580
 Absolutely we should.

685
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,020
 But when we're kofen, when our stewardship posture

686
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,020
 is this gripping and this grasping,

687
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,020
 all it really does is cause us

688
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,580
 to become owners and not stewards.

689
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,660
 It causes us to control the things.

690
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,940
 And every once in a while, we go to that event and we give,

691
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,780
 or every once in a while, we put something in the offering,

692
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,300
 and there's a little bit of generosity that comes out,

693
00:27:05,300 --> 00:27:08,820
 but we've still got most of it for us.

694
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,740
 The wisdom writer says,

695
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:15,260
 "This is toil and chasing after the wind.

696
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:18,580
 "This is exhausting," the wisdom writer is saying.

697
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,820
 He said, "This is what 21st century life is like.

698
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,420
 "This is like the grasping and the getting hold of more

699
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:26,860
 "and trying to achieve more and getting more,

700
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:30,380
 "because we're actually afraid that we won't have enough.

701
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:33,860
 "And our fear of poverty drives us to grasp holder

702
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,580
 "and tighter and more upon the resources that we've got."

703
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,820
 And the Bible says,

704
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,660
 "That's just gonna cause stress and anxiety.

705
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,060
 "You're gonna be even more stressed than you ever were."

706
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:46,380
 And I tell you, this is interesting.

707
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:49,380
 My experience is the more money I've gotten in my life,

708
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:50,880
 the more stressed I've become.

709
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,020
 And we often think that if we had more,

710
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:55,260
 we'd be less stressed.

711
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,340
 And the Bible says,

712
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,220
 "Two handfuls is toil and chasing after wind.

713
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,020
 "If your posture and your attitude is kofen,

714
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,380
 "to grasp a hold."

715
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:06,220
 You with me?

716
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:10,140
 So if it's foolish,

717
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,540
 if it's foolish to fold your yard

718
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,700
 when you've been given all this great opportunity,

719
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:19,980
 but it's also foolish to grab a hold of it

720
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,220
 as tightly as possible,

721
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,740
 and that's just stress and anxiety.

722
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,140
 Is there a better way?

723
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,820
 Well, the Bible says this.

724
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,740
 It says,

725
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:31,020
 that's like one of those miracles,

726
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,660
 mercy is coming out of the Bible.

727
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:35,740
 It says here,

728
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:38,820
 "Better one handful with tranquility."

729
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,640
 I love this.

730
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,460
 "Better one rather than two.

731
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:44,220
 "Better less than more and have tranquility,"

732
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,540
 the Bible says.

733
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:49,060
 Now, the one handful here is the word kof.

734
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,460
 And kof is the picture of a hand open

735
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,820
 and palm facing upwards.

736
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,700
 The idea is this.

737
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,040
 The idea is that you have the resource of God in your hands,

738
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,340
 but that resource,

739
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,340
 because it's in an open palm like this,

740
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,420
 can flow out really, really, really easily.

741
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:08,320
 Now, if you're anything like me,

742
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:09,180
 if that's your posture,

743
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,980
 you're worried because if it keeps flowing,

744
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,700
 I'm not gonna be able to have much left to flow with.

745
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,780
 But here's the amazing thing.

746
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,180
 When you're postured like this,

747
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,900
 God can come along and add more.

748
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:20,300
 And look at this.

749
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,760
 There's the flow that happens.

750
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,900
 We're gonna have to vacuum between services.

751
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,180
 There's a flow that happens.

752
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,500
 Are you with me?

753
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,680
 The Bible says this is peace and tranquility.

754
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,920
 This is what it's like to have inner peace

755
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,620
 when you are kof with the resources God has given you.

756
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,820
 Your palm is open,

757
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,660
 and God will keep blessing you.

758
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,060
 And as God pours into you

759
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,260
 and your hand posture remains open,

760
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,460
 you will continue to pour out.

761
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,360
 This is a river.

762
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,700
 This is a lake.

763
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,100
 This becomes stagnant and doesn't flow.

764
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,260
 But the Bible says this is what generosity looks like

765
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:00,580
 through the stewardship of kof.

766
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,820
 Better to have one hand open than two

767
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:06,380
 with toil and grasping after the wind.

768
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,580
 So as I bring it all to a close,

769
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:11,420
 here's the question for you.

770
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,720
 Which of those postures is you?

771
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:16,900
 And if you're anything like me,

772
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,540
 you're saying all three.

773
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,380
 That there are moments where you know you've just given up.

774
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:27,940
 And you've just folded your hands and said,

775
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,240
 can't be bothered anymore.

776
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,900
 And there are moments where you have grasped tightly

777
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,380
 and you're holding on

778
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:37,300
 and you feel that stress and that anxiety.

779
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,900
 And there are moments perhaps where you are open-handed

780
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,140
 and you feel the inner peace and the beauty

781
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:44,060
 and the wonder of God when you're doing so.

782
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,820
 And yet you find yourself just going back and forth

783
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,660
 between the two.

784
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:49,980
 Are you folded?

785
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,460
 Are you fist?

786
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,500
 Or are you free?

787
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:55,380
 If you find yourself folded,

788
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,900
 here's what I wanna encourage you to think about.

789
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:02,180
 What areas of pain or hurt or insecurities

790
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,580
 are there for you that would cause you

791
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,420
 to fold your hands so often?

792
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:10,260
 If you're fist, the question you should ask yourself is,

793
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:13,300
 why don't I trust God enough?

794
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,540
 That I feel like I need to hold onto all these resources

795
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,420
 as tightly as possible

796
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:18,620
 'cause I don't think I'm going to get again.

797
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:21,620
 Why is trust an issue for me?

798
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,460
 And if you're open-handed and beautiful before Him

799
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,420
 and you're seeing the flow of resources,

800
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:30,420
 perhaps for you it's just to be grateful and thankful

801
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,700
 that God is using you and can use you

802
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:36,500
 and continue to use you to bless those around you.

803
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:40,380
 Are you Yad, Kofen, or Kof?

804
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:43,380
 'Cause either or any of those

805
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:45,500
 will be whether you're a generous person

806
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,180
 or just simply a person who is occasionally generous.

807
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,540
 Helpful?

808
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,780
 Can I pray for you?

809
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:53,980
 Let's pray.

810
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,540
 Father, I'm so grateful for each person here

811
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:59,820
 and Lord for what you're doing in their lives

812
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:03,980
 and for the generosity that is flowing from them.

813
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:06,180
 Lord, I just really wanna honor the vine

814
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,420
 'cause as the senior pastor here over the last 10 years

815
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,780
 and been on staff for 15,

816
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:12,780
 I've seen the generosity of this church.

817
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,660
 I've seen this church be generous people

818
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,580
 time and time again.

819
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,940
 And Lord, it is an incredible thing to see.

820
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,860
 And so Lord, I just honor each person here

821
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:27,980
 who has faithfully given to this church over so many years.

822
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,700
 Maybe those who are faithfully giving in this season.

823
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,300
 Lord, we are grateful for that.

824
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,340
 And Lord, we recognize that generosity

825
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,780
 that is already flowing here.

826
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:42,820
 Father, we also recognize that in our own lives,

827
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,340
 we have a tendency to move

828
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,420
 between different forms of stewardship.

829
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:52,740
 Lord, I know that I have the tendency to fold my hand,

830
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,940
 I have the tendency to clench, hold tightly.

831
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,180
 And so Father, I wanna pray that as we reflect

832
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:03,420
 around generosity in our lives,

833
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:05,660
 we would first remember, as I've spoken about earlier,

834
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,380
 that it starts with you, that intimacy with you

835
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:11,820
 has a direct impact on our work of stewardship and generosity

836
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,740
 and that as the wisdom writer in Ecclesiastes shows us

837
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:20,700
 that it's better to have less but be open

838
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,180
 than to have more and be closed.

839
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:27,820
 That the path of peace is found in being open and generous.

840
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,980
 The path of stress is when we shift

841
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,380
 from a steward to an owner.

842
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:36,860
 And Father, I wanna pray for people here

843
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,420
 where that resonates with them.

844
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:41,660
 Perhaps there are some people here this morning

845
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:44,100
 where their posture has largely been one of folding

846
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,980
 in this season.

847
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:48,580
 Maybe there's been some hurt there.

848
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,820
 Maybe they've given and not been thanked.

849
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:53,900
 Maybe they've done something generous

850
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,300
 and it hasn't produced the fruit

851
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:57,860
 that they were hoping it would produce.

852
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,580
 Maybe they've even given to the church

853
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,100
 because they thought that that would mean

854
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,100
 that you would answer their prayer and you didn't do that

855
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,100
 and they've folded their hands.

856
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,620
 Father, would you just come for any of us

857
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,740
 where that's the case?

858
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:13,060
 Would you comfort us and speak to us and heal us?

859
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:16,860
 For those of us that have compared our gifts

860
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,740
 or our bank accounts or what we have to others

861
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:22,260
 and thought that's their responsibility, not mine.

862
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:26,460
 Father, I pray you would shake us out of our complacency.

863
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,900
 Father, for those that are clenching tightly

864
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,100
 and you of course want us to be sensible

865
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,860
 and sensible with our money,

866
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,580
 sensible with our spending, of course,

867
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,980
 but Father, for those that are perhaps clenching too tightly

868
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,860
 and there's stress.

869
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,420
 Lord, I wanna pray that your inner peace would flow,

870
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:50,060
 the tranquility that the writer speaks about here would flow.

871
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:54,420
 Father, I pray that you would give us the strength

872
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,620
 to be able to be more open to the Lord.

873
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,540
 I pray that you would give us the strength

874
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,980
 to be able to be more open to the Lord.

875
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,300
 Father, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency

876
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,540
 and comfort us.

877
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,940
 Lord, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency

878
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,780
 and comfort us.

879
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,140
 Father, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency

880
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,980
 and comfort us.

881
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,140
 Lord, I pray that you would shake us out of our complacency

882
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,980
 and comfort us.
