[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   A couple of weeks ago, I was at a cocktail party, and despite being an extrovert, I don't
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.280]   actually love cocktail parties.
[00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.960]   And one of the reasons is because, you know what it's like when you're at a cocktail party,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.520]   you get a little glass of wine, and you're kind of walking around, you're mingling, and
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.560]   inevitably you're going to come up and meet somebody that you don't know, a complete stranger.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.960]   And you know in Hong Kong, if you meet a stranger at a cocktail party, and you're doing a little
[00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.920]   kind of small talk to begin with, you know within about 60 seconds, the inevitable Hong
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.120]   Kong question will be asked.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.080]   Do you know what that question is?
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.520]   So what do you do?
[00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.840]   Yes, that is the inevitable Hong Kong question.
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.040]   And I think there are two reasons why I do not like this question.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.700]   Here's the first reason, because normally when this question is asked by somebody to
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.840]   somebody else, it's because they're trying to construct a social hierarchy and trying
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.440]   to understand, are you more important or am I more important than you?
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.720]   So are you a lawyer, a banker, or something like that?
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.360]   Or are you just something else?
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.560]   I want to know, where are we in the social hierarchy of things?
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.900]   So people ask that question to find out exactly where they are.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.800]   So what do you do is essentially a question to find out if they're better than you.
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.920]   Here's the thing I've discovered.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.900]   The people that ask that question the fastest are the ones who are most proud about their
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.320]   answer.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.280]   Here's the second reason why I don't like this question, because I don't like my answer.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.000]   Now don't get me wrong, I love being a pastor, okay?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.620]   I love this job, it is my life, I am proud, not ashamed of being a pastor.
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.400]   But there's something uncomfortable about a cocktail party and pastors.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.920]   Nobody expects to meet a pastor at a cocktail party.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.000]   They're like, "If I go to a church, I could expect to meet a pastor, right?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.600]   But I don't want to go to a cocktail party and meet a pastor."
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.260]   It's awkward because people immediately think I'm going to do one of two things.
[00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:08.260]   They think either one, I'm like a Jedi master who immediately knows everything bad they
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:10.440]   have ever done, right?
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.720]   And they're like totally kind of freaking out that I'm reading all of the past mistakes
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.960]   that they've made, right?
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.400]   The second thing is they think I'm going to be some like used car salesman and I'm going
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.840]   to try to sell them religion for the next five minutes of which they want nothing to
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.840]   do with.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.880]   So more often than not, if they ask me what I do and I say I'm a pastor, that's a very
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.320]   quick way to shut down the conversation.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:39.800]   It's literally like me saying, "I'm a cannibal, would you like to come over for lunch?"
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.780]   So I've devised a new question that I ask at cocktail parties.
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.320]   So there I am with my glass of wine mingling in a cocktail party and there are some strangers
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.320]   coming up to me and we're about to embrace in a conversation.
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.600]   And before they can ask me, "So what do you do?"
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.020]   I ask them now a different question.
[00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.040]   So I was at this cocktail party a couple of weeks ago.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.360]   This very businessy looking guy comes up to me, we start chatting.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.040]   Before he can even begin to get there, I say this to him.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.920]   I say, "So in your business here in Hong Kong, what's the number one goal that you have for
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.400]   your business?"
[00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.140]   I don't want to know what you do.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.060]   He replied, he was taken aback, he was like, "Oh, good question."
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:25.380]   He was like, "I guess it's to make profit for my shareholders."
[00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.540]   So then I follow up with another question.
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.500]   I say, "Well, for the people that you have, what's the number one thing they can do to
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.540]   contribute to that goal?"
[00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.620]   And he said, "I guess that would be to take calculated risk."
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.620]   Interesting.
[00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.420]   Now, I did all that because I knew that he was going to ask me the question back, right?
[00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.620]   And sure enough, within about a minute, he's like, "So tell me in your business in Hong
[00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.580]   Kong, what is the number one goal that you have for your business?"
[00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.160]   And I'm like, "Funny that you ask."
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.500]   I said, "Well, in my business here in Hong Kong, we want people in Hong Kong to flourish.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.740]   We want them to have the best life that they can have."
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.140]   And he's like, "What's the number one thing that your people can do to ensure that that
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.140]   happens for them?"
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.260]   You want to know what I said?
[00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.460]   Take courage.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.540]   Have courage.
[00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.140]   You need to know, every single one of you in this room, that I'm a pastor because of
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:22.140]   you.
[00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.700]   What I do is on your behalf.
[00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.980]   I love every single one of you.
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.500]   The ones that I know really well in this room, the ones that I don't even know well, the
[00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.180]   strangers who have just shown up today, I still love you too.
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:40.300]   And my 100% heart is that I want you to live the life that you have been created for.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.820]   And if you are going to live the life that God has created you for, that is going to
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.540]   demand courage.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:54.420]   If your life doesn't scare you, you should get a new life.
[00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:00.080]   Because you have been created to live a life that brings glory to Christ.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:05.240]   You have been created to live a life that actually shows the world what human flourishing
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.420]   is all about.
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:11.620]   You have been called to be in Hong Kong in this time as somebody who can be a purveyor
[00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.440]   of the hope and the justice and the love and the mercy and the power and the glory of Jesus.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.060]   And that will take courage for you to stand up in your workplace and say, "This is what
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:24.060]   I believe in."
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.220]   For some of us, it'll take courage to take an ethical stance when everybody else around
[00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.180]   us is going in the other direction.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:34.780]   Some of us, it'll take courage to not be ashamed for the gospel when we're in an environment
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.540]   that doesn't embrace that gospel.
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:42.060]   The life you've been called to live is not a passive, boring life.
[00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:49.300]   You've been created for a life that demands courage.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.760]   I think our greatest danger for Christians in Hong Kong in this hour that we're in is
[00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:04.820]   to see the kind of radical gospel-centered life that we want and yet fail to embrace
[00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:11.660]   it because we lack the one ingredient that is needed for every decision to get us to
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.260]   that life.
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:17.100]   And that is the ingredients of courage.
[00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:21.860]   I want to talk to you today about the kind of life that I think God has for you.
[00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.900]   And I want to inspire you to rise up in courage.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:32.980]   The good news is that the Bible has a whole lot to say about this idea of courage.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.500]   In fact, in Scripture, courage is connected into three things.
[00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.260]   If you look through the breadth of Scripture in this topic of courage, you'll find that
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.940]   it connects in three primary areas, in fear, in failure, and in faith.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:51.060]   These are the three things that connect to the topic of courage in Scripture.
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:55.580]   I want to start with the first one, fear, because I think it's the most critical.
[00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:01.220]   Now I want you to think about if there was this kind of line or this spectrum, and if
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:08.540]   you have courage on this side of the spectrum, what do you think sits on the other end of
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:09.540]   it?
[00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:11.820]   In other words, what is the opposite of courage?
[00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:16.060]   The majority of us think that the opposite of courage is fear.
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:19.420]   We think fear is on the other end of courage.
[00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:24.940]   And in order for us to have courage to flourish in life, we have to first of all kind of get
[00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:26.420]   rid of fear.
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.180]   Once we can get rid of fear, then we can be courageous.
[00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:34.260]   But the Bible is very clear that the opposite of courage is not fear.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:37.580]   Fear is actually not your enemy.
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:43.420]   Fear is an emotion created by God, which actually has some great benefits for your life.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.420]   Fear is not your enemy.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.900]   The opposite of courage is not fear.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:52.220]   The opposite of courage, according to Scripture, is this idea of cowardice.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.480]   That's the opposite of courage, cowardice.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:00.940]   If courage is making positive choices and decisions so you can live the life that God
[00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:07.940]   has created you to live, cowardice is making poor decisions, making weak decisions that
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.660]   take you away from the kind of life that Christ has called you to.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.180]   Fear is not the opposite of courage.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.060]   Fear actually sits between courage and cowardice.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:26.180]   Fear is the vehicle that will take you in one direction or another.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:27.720]   Let me say it this way.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:34.060]   No one has ever been courageous without first facing fear.
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:40.620]   Likewise, fear has the power to drive you towards cowardice.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:46.940]   In fact, fear in its nature can always be so overwhelming to us that if we let it dictate
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.260]   our thinking, if we let it dictate how we think about the world, how we think about
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.460]   God, how we think about ourselves, it's more often than not going to take us towards cowardice
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.660]   rather than in the other direction.
[00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:03.820]   But actually, courage created by God as this kind of emotion at work in us can be a reminder
[00:09:03.820 --> 00:09:06.700]   to us that it's time for us to step up.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.860]   Fear can be a reminder to us that actually we do face difficulties in life, but we have
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.180]   a God who overcomes those difficulties.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.940]   Fear in other words can be a great catalyst towards courage.
[00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.260]   Fear is not the enemy of courage.
[00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.660]   Fear is the way in which you either become more of a coward or more courageous.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.940]   Are you with me?
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.300]   I love the way that Nelson Mandela put it as he was writing about courage.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:35.300]   He said this, "I learned that courage is not the absence of fear, but the triumph over
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:36.300]   it.
[00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:42.140]   And it is not he who does not feel afraid, but he who has conquered that fear."
[00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:44.580]   In fact, I would put it in a slightly different way for you.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:52.900]   I would say this, "Your greatest moments of courage will happen when you're feeling fear."
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:57.700]   Your greatest moments, your greatest actions of courage in your life will always happen
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:02.780]   when you're still wrestling with the reality of fear in your life.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:08.340]   May fear propel us to those moments of great courage.
[00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.980]   The Bible also talks about failure.
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:15.180]   Now failure is a big thing because failure has the power of course to lead us towards
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:16.780]   cowardice every time.
[00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:22.580]   Your brokenness in your past, the mistakes you have made can so easily shape our thinking
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:28.540]   towards the actions in our lives and push us towards cowardice, making weaker decisions
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.220]   about our future based on the mistakes or the failures that we've had in our past.
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:38.380]   Some of you in this room, you're making decisions about your future primarily through the lens
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.060]   of a failure of your past.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:45.260]   Failure will push you towards cowardice.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:50.820]   But equally, failure can move you towards even greater moments of courage.
[00:10:50.820 --> 00:10:55.060]   Because when you realize that that had happened in your past, but your past doesn't define
[00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:58.460]   you, when you come to understand that God or God alone defines you, when you come to
[00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:03.060]   realize that your future is good because Christ is involved in your yesterday, today, and
[00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.380]   forever, then you can take the failures of your past and you can release them and process
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:12.300]   them and give them to the Spirit of God and it can actually propel you to greater moments
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:13.420]   in your future.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:15.380]   The same with faith.
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.940]   Or if the opposite of faith, maybe the opposite of faith would be something like self-doubt.
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.220]   How we doubt ourselves and the ways in which, oops, I write in tongues, you need to pray
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.660]   for an interpretation, everybody.
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:31.780]   That is the reality that when we don't think enough of ourselves, we don't think of ourselves
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.180]   in the way that God thinks about us, and because of things that have happened in our past,
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.340]   we don't have that faith to believe that we can do anything good in the future, of course,
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:41.060]   that's going to take us to cowardice.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:46.700]   And yet also, once we realize that actually in our doubting of ourselves, Christ has redefined
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:51.300]   us with a new name, redefined us as a person who can move in the power of His Spirit, then
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:53.540]   we can begin to head towards courage.
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:12:00.020]   So fear, failure, faith and self-doubt are all actually helpful.
[00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:04.340]   They're realities in our life that will take us in one direction or another.
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:10.900]   And let me say this, the greatest moments of your courage will come in the presence
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:15.140]   of fear, in the pain of your failure and in the process of faith.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:17.540]   I'm going to say that one more time.
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:21.820]   Your greatest moments of courage are going to come in the presence of fear, in the pain
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:26.620]   of your failure and in the processing of your faith and self-doubt.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:32.140]   Those will be the things that will bring you alive.
[00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.560]   I want to be honest with you guys today.
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:36.580]   I am a recovering coward.
[00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:43.900]   In fact, I would tell you in my 20s, in particularly my 20s and into my 30s, fear defined a lot
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:44.900]   of my life.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:45.900]   I struggled with anxiety.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.340]   I'm going to talk a little bit more about this in a couple of weeks' time when we do
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:50.820]   a series on mental health.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:55.020]   And I really struggled with that anxiety in my 20s and that caused me to make weak decisions
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.660]   about my future.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.780]   I've been honest with you guys as a church about my failures and the issues that I have
[00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:05.740]   in my own sort of insecurities that I have around the mistakes that I've made in my life
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.300]   and how those can also make me a coward.
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.100]   I've been pretty honest with you guys about some of the ways in which I've struggled with
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.100]   faith over the years.
[00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:16.820]   When my father passed away four years ago, I was wracked with this horrible feeling of
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:22.700]   not trusting God anymore, being angry at God and wrestling with the self-doubt about even
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:25.260]   my faith as a pastor and what that meant.
[00:13:25.260 --> 00:13:27.180]   I've struggled deeply with these things.
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:29.660]   I would say I'm a recovering coward.
[00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:33.620]   And I wonder whether some of you also in this room would resonate with that.
[00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:38.340]   I wonder if we'd all recognize that there are moments of cowardice in us all.
[00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:40.540]   And if you're feeling like that, guess what?
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:43.100]   You're in a really good place.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.420]   Why?
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.780]   Because the Bible is a story of cowards.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.140]   It's funny.
[00:13:50.140 --> 00:13:53.820]   When we read the Bible, we often think that the Bible actually is a story about incredibly
[00:13:53.820 --> 00:13:56.020]   naturally brave men and women.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.840]   We read the stories of some of the biblical characters and we sort of convince ourselves
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.820]   that they were just naturally amazing people, just amazing peoples in history who rose up
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:06.820]   and did great things.
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:11.220]   The reality, if you look between the lines of scripture, is that pretty much every single
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:15.780]   person that God chooses, every single person that God speaks to, every single person that
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:18.660]   God is working with is a recovering coward.
[00:14:18.660 --> 00:14:22.820]   Everybody is struggling with fear, struggling with anxiety, and it's pushing them towards
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:27.220]   cowardice and God comes along and says, "I'm going to use you anyway."
[00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:28.740]   Here's the amazing thing about God.
[00:14:28.740 --> 00:14:34.700]   God chooses those who would never choose themselves.
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:38.820]   And God does this because He's revealing something about His glory and something about who He
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:39.820]   is.
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.660]   So if you, like me, are a recovering coward, guess what?
[00:14:42.660 --> 00:14:46.260]   You're not disqualified from being used by God.
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:49.980]   Your greatest moments are just ahead of you.
[00:14:49.980 --> 00:14:53.940]   Be courageous.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.540]   I want to unpack this a little bit deeper today by taking you into the scriptures and
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:00.260]   a story of one such recovering coward.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:01.260]   His name's Joshua.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:05.940]   And we're going to go to the most important segment of his story when God speaks those
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:09.020]   famous words for him to be strong and courageous.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:14.340]   I want to unpack a little bit about the journey of Joshua to help you somewhat in your understanding
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:15.660]   and journey as well.
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:17.940]   Is this helpful for some people already?
[00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:18.940]   Yeah?
[00:15:18.940 --> 00:15:19.940]   All right.
[00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.500]   Joshua 1, starting in verse 1.
[00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:27.700]   After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua, son of Nun,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.940]   Moses' aide, "Moses, my servant, is dead.
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:35.340]   Now then, you and all these people get ready to cross the Jordan River into the land that
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.100]   I am about to give them, to the Israelites.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:42.460]   I will give you every place where you set your foot, as I promised Moses.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:46.620]   Your territory will extend from the desert to Lebanon and from the great river to the
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:51.420]   Euphrates, all the Hittite country as well, to the great sea on the west.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:54.700]   No one will be able to stand up against you all the days of your life.
[00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:57.820]   As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:00.980]   I will never leave you, nor will I forsake you."
[00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:01.980]   Here it is.
[00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:06.980]   "Be strong and courageous, because you will lead these people to inherit the land that
[00:16:06.980 --> 00:16:09.140]   I swore to their forefathers to give them."
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:11.300]   Be strong and very courageous.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:14.300]   Be careful to obey all the law that my servant gave you.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:18.060]   Do not turn from it from the right to the left, that you may be successful wherever
[00:16:18.060 --> 00:16:19.060]   you go.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:22.660]   Do not let this book of the law depart from your mouth.
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:27.220]   Meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to do everything that is written
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:28.220]   in it.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:30.520]   Then you will be prosperous and successful.
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:32.460]   Have I not commanded you?
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.780]   Be strong and courageous.
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:36.260]   Do not be terrified.
[00:16:36.260 --> 00:16:42.100]   Do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go."
[00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:45.060]   This is a critical time in Israel's history.
[00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:48.900]   Moses has led Israel out of the slavery in Egypt and brought them all the way to the
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:50.860]   corner to the edge of the promised land.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.660]   They're standing on one side of the river Jordan, and they can see the promised land
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.200]   just on the other side.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:00.580]   But Moses knows he's not the one who's going to lead God's people into the promised land.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:05.620]   It's a new leader, this young guy, Joshua, who will now take up that mantle of leadership
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.260]   and move them across the water.
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.300]   And this is the moment where it happens, and Joshua is a coward.
[00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.740]   He's terrified.
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:17.780]   He's so terrified that God needs to show up and say some very important things to him
[00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:22.220]   to get him the courage that he needs to be able to step forward in the thing that is
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:23.860]   his destiny.
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:28.480]   Now you've got to remember that it is Joshua himself who is writing these words.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.740]   So as we read this, remember this is Joshua describing the events himself.
[00:17:33.740 --> 00:17:36.100]   Notice in verse one, he tells us so much about himself.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:41.380]   He says, "After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua, 'Son
[00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:42.980]   of Nun, Moses' aid."
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:47.180]   The first thing he says is there's this death of Moses, and I want you to see how Joshua
[00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:48.700]   describes Moses.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.500]   He says, "Servant of the Lord."
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:58.060]   Joshua could not have given Moses a more glorifying title than that.
[00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:02.140]   In the Old Testament, if you're going to speak powerfully of someone, honour them, look up
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:03.960]   to them, speak highly of them.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:07.540]   If you were to say they are a servant of the Lord, that said everything.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:11.060]   You're saying that basically God and this person are partners together.
[00:18:11.060 --> 00:18:14.900]   But by Joshua saying this, he's like saying Moses was the one.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.100]   Moses led God's people.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.100]   He was in intimate relationship with God.
[00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:19.220]   He saw face to face.
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.780]   He was the servant of the Lord.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:24.040]   This guy was amazing.
[00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:30.420]   This is Joshua fanning in the flame how much he honours and glorifies and looks up to Moses
[00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:35.860]   as someone who had such a powerful relationship with God that he could change everything.
[00:18:35.860 --> 00:18:41.340]   And Joshua does not feel the same about himself.
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:47.020]   Here's the servant of the Lord, Moses, but Moses is now dead and the pressure is now
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.020]   on me.
[00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:54.980]   And you can sense that Joshua is overwhelmed with that pressure because transition is hard.
[00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.860]   I know that from personal experience because our previous senior pastors, John and Tony,
[00:18:59.860 --> 00:19:03.420]   who led this church incredibly handed over the church to me 10 years ago.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:06.740]   And it came onto my shoulders to lead the church forward.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:08.980]   Now thankfully they didn't die like Moses did.
[00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:09.980]   That's a really good thing.
[00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:12.820]   In fact, Tony's sitting right here right now.
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:15.140]   He's alive.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:19.540]   So you didn't have to die for me to take over.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.540]   That's a good thing.
[00:19:20.540 --> 00:19:26.380]   But, but in the same way that Joshua saw Moses said servant of the Lord, without being too
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:29.320]   much hyperbole, I looked at John and Tony as servants of the Lord.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.780]   They were men that God had called to take a very small church of 20 people and grow
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:36.260]   it to the size that it was when I took it over.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.980]   They'd done such phenomenal things.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.860]   They'd led this church so faithfully.
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:41.580]   I looked up to them so deeply.
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:43.340]   They were my spiritual fathers.
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.140]   They still are my spiritual fathers.
[00:19:46.140 --> 00:19:47.620]   And they're like the servant of the Lord.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:50.300]   And when I took on the vine, I felt just like Joshua.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:52.220]   Who am I?
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:54.020]   I haven't done the things that they've done.
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:55.700]   I haven't achieved what they've achieved.
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:57.780]   I'm not even the same age that they are.
[00:19:57.780 --> 00:19:59.560]   I'm younger by like 20 years.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:00.560]   What does it mean?
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:04.040]   Joshua, younger than Moses, having seen Moses do all this great stuff.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:10.360]   And now he's standing in a place and he's like, who am I compared to this?
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:13.120]   Joshua's like, can I do it?
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.100]   I want you to notice something really important.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:16.920]   Notice how Joshua labels himself.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.900]   He says, Moses, the servant of the Lord.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:24.740]   He said to me, Joshua, son of none, Moses is aid.
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:28.320]   He just said, Moses is the servant of the Lord.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.680]   You wanna know who I am?
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.040]   I'm the servant of Moses.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:33.900]   I'm his aid.
[00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:35.900]   I've been his assistant.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:37.960]   When he's been doing all this great stuff with God
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.040]   and leading these people really well,
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:44.140]   man, I'm just the son of none and none did nothing.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:49.980]   And I'm the assistant to the one who did it all.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:53.060]   I'm just an aid.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:58.580]   This is a powerful thing because Joshua doesn't see in himself
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:01.600]   what God is currently seeing in him.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:05.340]   Joshua is in a place where the thing that he's gonna need courage for
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.220]   is to redefine who he actually is.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:09.620]   And I want you to know this,
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:13.660]   the thing that you're always going to need courage for first in your life
[00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.560]   before you do anything else is the courage to redefine yourself
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.260]   in the way that God sees you.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.500]   That is gonna take great courage in you.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.620]   To really believe that you are the person that God says you are.
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:29.100]   To really embrace the idea that as a Christian holding the name of Christ,
[00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:32.580]   you are somebody who actually has something to say in this world.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.780]   That despite your brokenness and your failures and your pains
[00:21:35.780 --> 00:21:37.180]   and the bad mistakes you've made
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.740]   and the sin that even still continues in your life,
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:43.540]   God looks down on you and says, "My son, my daughter,
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:46.240]   I see you, I love you, I'm for you.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.860]   And through my son, Jesus,
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:51.480]   you can achieve all the things that I have designed and planned for you.
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:55.460]   And yet so often we're not defined by what God says,
[00:21:55.460 --> 00:21:57.620]   we're defined by what the world says.
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:21:59.820]   Or we're defined by what our fears say,
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:01.620]   we're defined by our failures,
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.140]   we're defined by our self-doubts.
[00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:09.740]   And here's Joshua having to go on a journey from saying,
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:12.620]   "Moses, a servant of the Lord,
[00:22:12.620 --> 00:22:16.080]   me the aid to Moses,
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:20.340]   to know me a servant of the Lord."
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:21.900]   Some of you in this room,
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.420]   the thing you need courage for right now in this time of your life
[00:22:25.420 --> 00:22:27.900]   is to make that journey as well.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.260]   To make the journey from like, "Whoa, that person over there, man,
[00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:34.140]   they're awesome."
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:38.340]   To actually going, "No, I actually, we're the priesthood of all believers.
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:40.780]   Actually, I have the same authority Andrew has.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:42.260]   Actually, I have the same gifting.
[00:22:42.260 --> 00:22:44.020]   I have the same spirit in me,
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:45.620]   that the spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[00:22:45.620 --> 00:22:47.620]   is not just in a pastor, not just in a leader,
[00:22:47.620 --> 00:22:49.380]   not just in my small group community leader,
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.380]   it's actually in me as well."
[00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:57.260]   I need the courage to redefine myself in the way that God sees me.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:58.820]   Some of you need to go on that journey
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.060]   because right now, here's how you're defining yourself.
[00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:03.860]   I'm fear's assistant.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:07.580]   I'm the aid of self-doubt.
[00:23:07.580 --> 00:23:11.580]   Some of you are so caught in that space
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:12.420]   that it's not a wonder
[00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:15.220]   that you're not finding this courage rising up inside of you.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:18.180]   Notice what God says in verse five here to Joshua,
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:19.780]   as he's trying to redefine himself.
[00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.460]   He says in verse five, he says,
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:23.060]   "No one will be able to stand against you
[00:23:23.060 --> 00:23:23.980]   all of the days of your life.
[00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.180]   As I was with Moses, so I will be with you."
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:30.780]   In other words, God has already redefined Joshua.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:33.740]   He's already said, "Joshua, you're not Moses' aid anymore.
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:35.300]   You're not Moses' assistant.
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:37.860]   I look down on you and you are my servant.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:39.300]   You are now the servant of the Lord.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:41.460]   As I was with Moses, I'm gonna be with you.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.700]   I'm gonna do the same things.
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:44.140]   I'm gonna give you the same authority.
[00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:46.940]   I'm gonna show you my glory, just like I showed him.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.620]   There's a job ahead of you,
[00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:52.540]   which is even harder than the job that Moses was called to do
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:53.500]   but I'm with you.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.420]   I'll be with you every step of the way.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:56.820]   I've redefined you."
[00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.220]   Joshua now needed to redefine himself.
[00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:04.220]   The courage to redefine yourself
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:07.420]   is the greatest courage you will ever need.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.060]   Well, let me ask you it this way.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:13.540]   Who do you have the courage to become?
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:16.420]   Think about that.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:20.460]   Who do you actually have the courage to become?
[00:24:20.460 --> 00:24:23.300]   And some of you in this room,
[00:24:23.300 --> 00:24:25.740]   the courage you have right now
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:30.540]   is limiting the person that you are to be.
[00:24:30.540 --> 00:24:31.940]   And there is no more important time
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:33.180]   in Hong Kong's history right now
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:36.380]   for us to rise up in the courage to become
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:38.380]   the church that this city needs,
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:41.100]   the courage to become the people our businesses need,
[00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:43.820]   the courage to become the teachers that our schools need,
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:46.620]   the courage to become the husbands that our wives need.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:47.900]   Are you with me, church?
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.300]   The courage to begin to live in the way
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:52.180]   that we've been always called to live.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.660]   So the great question is,
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.260]   where does this courage come from?
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.300]   How do I get it?
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.860]   Well, let me show you some things out of verse two and three.
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:01.340]   Moses, my servant is now dead.
[00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:02.740]   This is God speaking to Joshua.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.220]   Now then, you and all these people
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:06.060]   get ready to cross the Jordan River
[00:25:06.060 --> 00:25:09.100]   into the land that I'm about to give them, the Israelites.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:12.420]   I will give you every place where you set your foot
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:13.660]   as I promised Moses.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.700]   I want you to see something really important here.
[00:25:15.700 --> 00:25:17.380]   See, God starts out by saying,
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:19.540]   okay, you wanna know where this courage comes from?
[00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.140]   He first of all talks to Joshua about his conditions.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.220]   He says, you have some conditions
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:29.900]   and these conditions are pretty scary.
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.540]   So there's a reason why you're feeling fear.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:35.380]   There's a reason why you're a bit of a coward right now
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:37.300]   because yeah, Moses is dead.
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:40.320]   See, God is not hiding the conditions
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.700]   that actually Joshua is facing.
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:42.860]   Moses is dead.
[00:25:42.860 --> 00:25:45.220]   I'm now asking you to carry this nation forward.
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:46.220]   And guess what?
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.260]   There's a lot of tough stuff ahead of you.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.260]   There's Jericho right ahead of you,
[00:25:50.260 --> 00:25:52.060]   one of those most fortified cities.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:54.500]   There are armies that are bigger than your army.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.860]   What is ahead is really tough.
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:00.860]   So God is not hiding the reality of conditions,
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:03.220]   but here's what God is trying to teach Joshua.
[00:26:03.220 --> 00:26:04.540]   He's trying to say to Joshua,
[00:26:04.540 --> 00:26:06.540]   if in order for you to have courage,
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:10.020]   you have to separate courage from your conditions.
[00:26:10.020 --> 00:26:13.140]   You have to learn to separate those two things
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:14.380]   'cause here's the reality.
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:19.380]   If your courage is actually based on your conditions,
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:24.560]   more likely than not, you will be suffering with fear.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:26.460]   You will be embracing your failures
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:28.340]   and you'll be filled with self-doubt
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:31.220]   and that's gonna take you towards cowardice
[00:26:31.220 --> 00:26:35.020]   because our conditions are tough.
[00:26:35.020 --> 00:26:38.220]   I mean, there's a tough future ahead for all of us.
[00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:39.460]   I mean, there are so many changes
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:40.740]   have happened in our city here.
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:41.940]   We are all still wondering
[00:26:41.940 --> 00:26:43.700]   what is the future gonna look like?
[00:26:43.700 --> 00:26:45.460]   There are challenges in all of our lives
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:47.300]   and if you're not facing any challenges right now,
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.480]   you will be facing challenges in the future.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:53.260]   Life is tough and if our courage
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:55.780]   is connected to our conditions,
[00:26:55.780 --> 00:26:58.680]   we are more likely than not to make choices
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:01.060]   that will head us towards cowardice.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.500]   If your trust is in your bank account
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:05.020]   and your bank account goes down,
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.860]   then you're gonna feel fear.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:10.420]   If your courage is found in your relationships
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.060]   in your lives and those relationships begin to break down,
[00:27:13.060 --> 00:27:14.380]   you're probably gonna doubt yourself,
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.500]   you're gonna feel a failure,
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.060]   you're gonna make future decisions more towards cowardice.
[00:27:18.060 --> 00:27:18.900]   God is saying,
[00:27:18.900 --> 00:27:23.500]   "Stop connecting your courage with your conditions."
[00:27:23.500 --> 00:27:26.220]   Some of you in this room, that's a word in season for you
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:29.100]   because that's how you try to think of courage.
[00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:30.340]   You're connecting courage
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.060]   to what you think about your present and your future.
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:35.740]   When you do that, you will always be overwhelmed
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:37.300]   and God is saying to Joshua,
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:40.860]   "There's another way to live."
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:43.420]   I wanna show you what actually God says to Joshua
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:44.500]   over the nine verses.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.820]   He says a bunch of different things,
[00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:48.260]   but let me give you a summary of it on a slide here.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:49.740]   He says, "I will be with you.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.020]   I'm gonna lead you.
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:52.380]   Know my word.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.300]   I will do the same things for you I did Moses.
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.260]   Do not be afraid.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:56.780]   I'm here with you, present with you.
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:58.500]   Don't turn from my law."
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:28:01.580]   Basically what God does is he unpacks all of the ways
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:03.780]   in which God is present with him
[00:28:03.780 --> 00:28:06.580]   and he says, "Don't look at your conditions.
[00:28:06.580 --> 00:28:07.780]   Look at me.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:08.980]   Know my word.
[00:28:08.980 --> 00:28:10.140]   Know my presence.
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:11.260]   Know I'm with you.
[00:28:11.260 --> 00:28:12.660]   Know that my power is with you.
[00:28:12.660 --> 00:28:14.980]   I'm gonna treat you the same as I did Joshua."
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.100]   In other words, what God's doing to Joshua
[00:28:17.100 --> 00:28:20.300]   is trying to shift him from thinking about his conditions
[00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:23.780]   to actually beginning to think about convictions.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.820]   And he's saying, "Are you convicted that I'm with you?
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:29.900]   Do you really believe that I'm here?
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:32.380]   Do you believe that I'm fighting battles for you?
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.100]   Do you truly believe that I'm gonna be present with you
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:35.940]   like Moses?
[00:28:35.940 --> 00:28:37.780]   'Cause if your courage,"
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.420]   I'm gonna use another pen colour here,
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:44.340]   "If your courage is actually linked to your convictions,
[00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:46.740]   then fear is not gonna overwhelm you.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.020]   Your failures will not come to define you
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:50.980]   and your self-doubt will move to faith
[00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:54.900]   which will propel you to acts of courage.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.740]   Our courage has to be founded not in conditions
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:59.060]   which lead us to cowardice,
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.780]   but in convictions which release us into better decisions
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.620]   which bring us into a courageous life."
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.340]   And God is saying over Joshua, "Be strong and courageous."
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:12.180]   I love this.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.500]   He repeats it three times.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:16.660]   And one time he says, "I command you."
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.820]   I don't know if you've ever thought about it that way.
[00:29:18.820 --> 00:29:21.780]   God commands Joshua to be courageous,
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:23.380]   which is really fascinating to me
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:26.180]   'cause what he doesn't say to Joshua
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:28.620]   is pray and ask for courage.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:32.300]   He doesn't say, "Ask me for courage."
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:34.740]   He doesn't say, "Sit there and wait under a tree
[00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:37.580]   until one day I magically drop courage in you
[00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:39.460]   enough for you to live the life that I want you to live."
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.980]   He says, "I demand, I command you to find courage."
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:45.740]   And the question is, where do we find it?
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.380]   Well, we don't find it in our conditions
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:48.980]   which is what Joshua was doing.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:50.660]   We find it in our convictions.
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.660]   And when we do so,
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:56.420]   we realise we already have everything we need for courage.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:58.260]   Courage is not a spiritual gift.
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.300]   Never mentioned that way in Scripture.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:03.220]   Courage is not one of the nine fruits of the Spirit.
[00:30:03.220 --> 00:30:05.060]   You know what courage is?
[00:30:05.060 --> 00:30:06.540]   Courage is within you already.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.540]   That's why God can command it out of you.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:11.500]   Be courageous.
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:15.300]   In other words, we don't ask God to give us courage.
[00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:18.420]   We realise that God has already done everything possible
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.420]   for us to have courage.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.300]   You have Jesus and his life and his death
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:24.460]   and his resurrection.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.420]   You have the one who has overcome death.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:28.780]   You have the one who has now positioned himself
[00:30:28.780 --> 00:30:29.780]   over your life.
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.020]   You are now called his son and his daughter.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.260]   You have everything inside of you already.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.500]   The same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:38.260]   is also now in you.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:40.940]   You don't need to ask God for some additional power
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:43.620]   or miracle or a flow of his courage.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:45.180]   And then I'll act courageous.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:47.260]   God's saying, "Be strong and courageous
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:50.700]   'cause your convictions will drive you to a courageous life."
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:51.860]   If you wanna step up,
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:53.380]   if you wanna begin to act in the way
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:54.380]   that I've called you to be,
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:55.740]   I want it to come out of you.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.180]   Believe Jesus really said what he said.
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:30:59.740]   Believe that he did what he did.
[00:30:59.740 --> 00:31:02.260]   Believe that he's in this world working right now.
[00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:04.260]   And when you align yourself to the conviction
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:06.020]   that Jesus is actually alive,
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.020]   that the Bible actually tells us the truth
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.260]   and we find courage rising up inside of us.
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.700]   And although our conditions might be difficult,
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.540]   they will not drive us to cowardice.
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.860]   We will propel ourselves to more courageous acts.
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:23.780]   So let me define courage for you
[00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.340]   in the way that I think God is speaking to it.
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:28.860]   Joshua, let me define it this way for you.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:35.060]   Courage is a fervent and resolute strength within us
[00:31:35.060 --> 00:31:37.420]   that leads to positive action and change
[00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:41.180]   as a result of focusing on internal convictions
[00:31:41.180 --> 00:31:43.940]   over and above external conditions.
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:47.900]   That's where courage comes from.
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:51.260]   That's why God can command it into his people
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:54.220]   and command it out of his people.
[00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:55.740]   Have courage.
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:57.340]   And as I close, I'm gonna give you
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:58.500]   three practical ways this week
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.540]   you can put courage into practise.
[00:31:59.540 --> 00:32:00.580]   Is that good?
[00:32:00.580 --> 00:32:02.860]   Three practical things really fast.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:03.900]   Here's the first one.
[00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:05.340]   Be prepared to be scared.
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:09.740]   I said it earlier, if your life doesn't scare you,
[00:32:09.740 --> 00:32:11.580]   get a new life.
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.180]   Be prepared to be scared.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.020]   You're gonna have to face fear
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:17.060]   if you wanna live the life that Christ has called you to.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:19.140]   I want you to live a life that demands courage.
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:20.980]   That means that there is gonna be fear.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.660]   That you're gonna have to face some difficulties.
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:23.620]   It's gonna be difficult.
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:25.660]   If you're prepared to be scared,
[00:32:25.660 --> 00:32:27.380]   what it means is that when fear comes,
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:29.500]   it doesn't surprise you.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.220]   It doesn't bowl you over.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.660]   It might still be overwhelming.
[00:32:32.660 --> 00:32:34.060]   It might still be huge.
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:36.260]   But you're able to actually separate yourself
[00:32:36.260 --> 00:32:37.540]   a little bit from the fear,
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.700]   realising that the fear is not your identity.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:43.060]   A fear is just a feeling often about certain conditions
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:44.300]   that are happening in your life.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.900]   And you can somewhat put that to one side of you,
[00:32:46.900 --> 00:32:50.060]   look at it and say, I'm not defined by that fear,
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:53.620]   but that fear is a reminder to me to rise up in courage.
[00:32:53.620 --> 00:32:58.860]   So when we expect fear, we expose it,
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:00.900]   and then we can exit from it.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.980]   Okay?
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:03.820]   Very easy, very simple.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.340]   Be prepared to be scared.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:07.620]   Here's the second thing, change your focus.
[00:33:07.620 --> 00:33:09.980]   Some of us in this room,
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:12.140]   our focus is predominantly on our conditions.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:14.980]   And we're wondering why we don't live a life of courage.
[00:33:14.980 --> 00:33:16.940]   Some of you need to change your focus
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.060]   away from your conditions to your convictions.
[00:33:19.060 --> 00:33:21.260]   It doesn't mean we ignore our conditions.
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:24.260]   If there's a bill to pay, we need to pay our bills.
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.100]   Okay?
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.220]   I don't want you to go away and say,
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:30.020]   Andrew told me I could just forget all my conditions
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:33.220]   and just believe that God will provide.
[00:33:33.220 --> 00:33:34.500]   Okay, it doesn't quite work like that.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.580]   Okay, conditions are important in life, right?
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:39.340]   What the teaching here, what God is saying to Joshua is,
[00:33:39.340 --> 00:33:42.740]   don't have your life founded on what your conditions
[00:33:42.740 --> 00:33:43.580]   are telling you.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.900]   You need to focus more on your convictions.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.660]   And when you do that, when you change your focus,
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:50.740]   you'll find courage coming.
[00:33:50.740 --> 00:33:52.980]   Some of you this week, just simply it is
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:55.620]   to recognize your conditions, not ignore them,
[00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:56.540]   be honest about them,
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.820]   just like God was honest about them with Joshua.
[00:33:58.820 --> 00:34:02.260]   But it is then to say, but God, I live by faith.
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.820]   And I choose to find my courage in who you are,
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.060]   not in what all of this is saying about who I am.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:12.820]   Here's the final one, shift your what ifs.
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:13.660]   It's really interesting.
[00:34:13.660 --> 00:34:16.420]   When your courage is based on your conditions,
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:17.580]   you have lots of what ifs.
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:18.740]   Here are your what ifs.
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.820]   What if I fail?
[00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:23.940]   What if it doesn't work out?
[00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:26.660]   What if the person gives up on me?
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:28.780]   What if I don't get that promotion?
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.620]   What if I don't get that raise?
[00:34:31.620 --> 00:34:33.660]   What if I have that argument with that person?
[00:34:33.660 --> 00:34:35.580]   And we have all these negative what ifs
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:37.500]   when we focus on our conditions,
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.700]   but when we begin to think about our convictions,
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:41.260]   your what ifs change.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:44.900]   And suddenly you're saying, what if God came through?
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:46.820]   What if the miracle did happen?
[00:34:46.820 --> 00:34:48.820]   What if the Bible was actually true?
[00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:51.060]   What if the same spirit that raised Christ in the jail
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.300]   was actually in me?
[00:34:52.300 --> 00:34:54.420]   And if that was really true, and I really believe that,
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:57.620]   what if I made decisions based on that?
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.740]   See, when we shift to convictions, our what ifs change,
[00:35:00.740 --> 00:35:02.980]   and we begin to speak more positive what ifs
[00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.180]   around our life, not what if I fail,
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:08.020]   but what if actually I succeed?
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.780]   On Sunday, the 3rd of November, 2013,
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.500]   it was the first Sunday I was senior pastor here at the Vine.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.740]   The Sunday before, John and Tony had handed over to me
[00:35:17.740 --> 00:35:19.340]   in a lavish ceremony here at the Vine.
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:20.660]   It was very lovely.
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:24.380]   But the next Sunday, here I was, and I was terrified.
[00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:27.180]   My first Sunday as the senior leader here,
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:29.180]   standing right here at the front of my wife, Christine,
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:31.980]   during worship time, and everybody, "Worship!"
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:35.380]   Me going, (mimics drumming)
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:38.700]   because I hadn't redefined myself as a servant of the Lord.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.540]   I was still just the assistant to John and Tony.
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:43.980]   And right there in the worship time,
[00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:45.500]   one of our elders, Blair Donaldson,
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:47.620]   no one was looking, no one was watching.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:50.260]   He came over, he put his hands on my shoulders,
[00:35:50.260 --> 00:35:51.420]   and he looked me in the eyes,
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:54.820]   and he said, "Be strong and courageous."
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:59.260]   And so I stand before you today as a recovering coward,
[00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.340]   way more courageous today than I was back then.
[00:36:02.340 --> 00:36:05.900]   And I stand over you, and I put my hands on your shoulders,
[00:36:05.900 --> 00:36:08.300]   and I say, "Be strong and courageous,"
[00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:11.500]   because your city needs it, you need it,
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.300]   your families need it, your workplaces need it.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:17.460]   Do not live a life of cowardice.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.780]   Embrace the convictions of your faith,
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.300]   and rise up in courage.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:26.460]   Be strong and courageous.
[00:36:26.460 --> 00:36:28.420]   Can I pray for you guys?
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:29.260]   Let's pray.
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:31.540]   (congregation applauding)
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.420]   I want you to stand with me, and we're gonna pray.
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:36.920]   We're gonna pray.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:44.060]   Father, I am deeply privileged
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:46.420]   to be in a room with these people,
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:48.660]   and those that are watching online right now.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:51.180]   Lord, what a privilege it is for us
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.100]   to stand in this moment before you.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:58.060]   And Lord, every single person here has a different story.
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:02.140]   Every person has a different thing going on in their lives,
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.780]   a different thing that they're gonna need courage for.
[00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:06.820]   Father, I thank you that here at The Vine,
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.340]   we're committed to living the best life possible,
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.700]   a life of flourishing.
[00:37:10.700 --> 00:37:14.220]   But Lord, I think the honest confession
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.380]   of many of our hearts today would be,
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.180]   more often than not,
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:23.660]   or maybe another way to say it, too often, Lord,
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:25.580]   I know that I make weak decisions,
[00:37:25.580 --> 00:37:28.700]   weak decisions based on my fears,
[00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.380]   based on my failures,
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:35.660]   weak decisions that are based on my self-doubt,
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:39.260]   that are all founded in the conditions around me
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:43.740]   that lead me to being a coward for you
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:46.460]   in a time when I need to be courageous.
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:53.260]   The Lord has already poured out
[00:37:53.260 --> 00:37:55.700]   absolutely everything you'll ever need
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:57.460]   for the courage that you need to live the life
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:58.900]   that He's called you to live.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.700]   So as you stand before Him today,
[00:38:03.700 --> 00:38:11.420]   know that He is here for you in whatever area you need.
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:15.580]   Some of you in this room, it's in fear.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.700]   You know that fear is largely defining
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:21.180]   a lot of the decisions you're making right now.
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:22.940]   I think that's particularly for some of you here
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:24.100]   about your future.
[00:38:24.100 --> 00:38:27.020]   You're allowing fear to define the decisions
[00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:28.340]   you're making about your future,
[00:38:28.340 --> 00:38:31.220]   and you're making weak decisions about your future
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:32.140]   based on fear.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.740]   The Lord wants to release that from you today
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:39.260]   and give you the courage to make better decisions.
[00:38:39.260 --> 00:38:45.260]   Some of you here, you've been so wracked by guilt
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.540]   because of past mistakes you've made.
[00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.700]   You know, it's interesting, God calls Moses
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:54.740]   to go back to Egypt because God wanted Moses
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:56.820]   to face his fears and his mistakes
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:39:00.220]   before he could truly lead God's people to the promised land.
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:05.060]   Some of you need to go back and face some of the mistakes.
[00:39:05.060 --> 00:39:06.860]   And the greatest amount of courage you're gonna need
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.100]   is to do that.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:10.380]   And I believe that the Holy Spirit
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:12.080]   wants to release you today.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:20.420]   Courage is not having all the right answers.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:25.340]   Courage is being willing to ask the questions
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:28.060]   that you've been putting off for a long time.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.260]   Some of you in this room need to ask
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.660]   and face some of those questions
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:37.380]   that you've been putting off a long time.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.860]   And I believe that the Lord is gonna give you courage
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.760]   to do that as you find yourself in his convictions.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:48.140]   Some of you in this room need to redefine yourself.
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:54.460]   You still see yourself as this person's aid
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.540]   or this person's assistant.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:58.260]   Maybe you're in an environment in your office
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.700]   where there's people better than you.
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.460]   And that's a reality for all of us.
[00:40:01.460 --> 00:40:04.900]   Somebody once told me that if I'm the smartest in the room,
[00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:06.140]   I should find a new room.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:08.620]   We're always gonna be surrounded hopefully
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:10.740]   by people who are better, smarter,
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.220]   maybe more accomplished than we are.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:17.520]   Do not allow their accomplishments to define yours.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:21.380]   Some of you in this room need to realize
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.420]   that actually you're far more gifted than you thought.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.520]   That actually God's got a role for you.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.480]   That God's got something that he wants to say to you.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:34.720]   And he wants you to rise up to make courageous decisions,
[00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:36.160]   not decisions out of cowardice
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.960]   because you're comparing yourself to someone else,
[00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:40.720]   but decisions out of your convictions
[00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:44.560]   that will propel you forward into the future
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.320]   that God has prepared for you.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.280]   Father, whatever it might be for whoever it is in this room,
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:51.760]   church, this is an important moment.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.800]   Take the time right now.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:57.000]   Just invite the Holy Spirit to whatever area it is
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:58.200]   that you're looking for.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.560]   And like I said before,
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   this is not about God coming and anointing you with courage.
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.720]   This is about you doing your work led by the Spirit
[00:41:09.720 --> 00:41:13.800]   to find that courage within you.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.880]   Courage is a decision.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.920]   It's a choice.
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:22.160]   May you, based on the convictions of your faith,
[00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:24.920]   make better choices.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.760]   Allow the Holy Spirit to speak to you
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:33.560]   as we now minister together in worship.
[00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:36.480]   (thunder rumbling)
