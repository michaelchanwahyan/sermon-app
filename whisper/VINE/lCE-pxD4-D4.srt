1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,440
 the last number of weeks as well.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,520
 Can we give another round of applause

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,960
 to our youth and all that they've done?

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,080
 (audience applauding)

5
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,400
 So great, welcome to the Vine.

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
 If you're relatively new to the Vine, my name's Andrew.

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,560
 I'm one of the pastors here, and it's just so great,

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,560
 oh, sorry, it's just so great to be with you.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,400
 Oh.

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,160
 (audience gasping)

11
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,000
 Sorry.

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,280
 Sorry, yeah, thanks.

13
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,680
 Thank you, yeah, just, that's fine, thank you.

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,520
 (audience laughing)

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,080
 Things don't always work out

16
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,840
 how we plan them in life, do they?

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,800
 I think if we're honest with ourselves,

18
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,800
 actually, so much of our lives is a little bit of a mess.

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,800
 And no matter how perfect we might try to make stuff appear,

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,280
 the reality is we can often struggle, can't we,

21
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:54,040
 with keeping things perfect in our lives.

22
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,120
 That's so often, if we're honest with ourselves,

23
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:00,080
 we would have to admit that we're pretty messy,

24
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:02,440
 and at times, we can be pretty messed up.

25
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,240
 And I think us humans have become really good

26
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,280
 at actually projecting a version of ourselves

27
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,500
 into the world that looks perfect to everybody around us,

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,320
 to kind of mask or hide the reality

29
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:16,760
 that there's still some messiness

30
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,840
 and some messed upness in us.

31
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,200
 Or maybe I'm the only one who does that.

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,360
 Anyone else here maybe do that?

33
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,520
 You don't have to put your hand up.

34
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,760
 Okay, put your hand up if you do that.

35
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:25,960
 Yes, I wanna see those hands.

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,440
 Boldly proclaiming that we can do this, can't we, in life?

37
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:32,800
 That we know that there's some stuff in us

38
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,680
 that we're not proud of, that we don't love,

39
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,080
 and so we project into the world something

40
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,800
 because what we ultimately wanna do

41
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:42,480
 is kind of distract people

42
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:45,720
 from seeing the true person that we are.

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,320
 Magicians call this misdirection.

44
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,000
 In fact, if I, let me just show you this.

45
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,720
 If I was, for example, going to make this coin disappear,

46
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,360
 what I would do is I would show you this coin

47
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,400
 and I would tell you that this is a Hong Kong $5 coin,

48
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,280
 that it's a real coin,

49
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,360
 and then I would put it on my thing like this

50
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,600
 and I would do this,

51
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,040
 pretending that I'm gonna make it disappear,

52
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,880
 but then I'd accidentally drop it on the table

53
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,440
 and then I would put it back in my hand

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,000
 and I would start doing this again

55
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,800
 and then suddenly it would disappear.

56
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,640
 (audience laughing)

57
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,480
 Wow!

58
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,920
 You're welcome, I'm here all week.

59
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,060
 (audience laughing)

60
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,360
 What you may not realize, though,

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:28,240
 is that the coin is actually up here.

62
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,200
 There.

63
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,080
 Misdirection.

64
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,560
 Distracting people over here

65
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:41,440
 so they don't realize what's truly going on over here.

66
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,960
 Are you with me?

67
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,560
 Here's why I share all that with you.

68
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,840
 I think in the world's modern day celebration of Christmas,

69
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,720
 we have one of the most subversive misdirections

70
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,380
 that there has ever been created.

71
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,820
 I don't know if you've realized this,

72
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,240
 but the world has secularized Christmas

73
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,540
 over the last number of years.

74
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,940
 That what we have in the world is,

75
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,340
 "Hey, look at this thing over here

76
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,640
 "that we now define and call Christmas

77
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,500
 "and it has nothing actually to do often

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,900
 "with the reality of the true, original Christmas."

79
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,060
 Are you with me?

80
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,620
 It's kinda like this sort of thing of like,

81
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,400
 "Hey, let's even try and get all of Jesus out of Christmas."

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,640
 Have you seen X-mas written around the place?

83
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,800
 Let's just get rid of Christ from Christmas

84
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,640
 'cause that story's just a little bit uncomfortable

85
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,420
 and not everybody believes in Jesus,

86
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,640
 so we can't talk about Jesus at Christmas,

87
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,640
 even though the holiday is actually about Jesus.

88
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,640
 And so we'll call it seasons greetings, happy holidays.

89
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,600
 And we'll try to make it look as benign and as nice

90
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,320
 and really all of this about family and celebration.

91
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,200
 And we'll try to project this image

92
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,360
 of what Christmas should be to distract the world

93
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,240
 from the reality of what Christmas truly is

94
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,000
 about somebody who was born into this life

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,880
 to give people great hope, who on the cross died,

96
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,080
 gave up his life so that we may have grace and forgiveness

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
 and we could know the fullness of life.

98
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
 But we don't want anyone to know that story,

99
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,360
 so happy holidays to you all.

100
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,320
 Are you with me?

101
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,040
 Now, even when Jesus is included in the Christmas story

102
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,200
 in the modern day celebration of it,

103
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,240
 it's normally a saccharine version of Jesus.

104
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,480
 It's normally the perfect Jesus that you've ever seen,

105
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,960
 or maybe the Hallmark card that you buy for someone

106
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:29,440
 to give to them on Christmas day presents the nativity scene

107
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,200
 in the most perfect and beautiful way you've ever noticed.

108
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,360
 Let me give you an example of it.

109
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,160
 I found this one online this week.

110
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,440
 Ah, isn't that just the perfect nativity scene?

111
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,400
 You got the beautiful star in the background.

112
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,920
 It looks like a wonderful oasis

113
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,480
 that you might wanna go to holiday for.

114
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,320
 Look at that sheep, the perfect sheep ever.

115
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,320
 The sheep is staring gazily into Jesus's eyes.

116
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,960
 There's Jesus lying down in a halo of sunbeams,

117
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,240
 even though he's just been born.

118
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,960
 Are you with me, people?

119
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,080
 So we turn the Christmas story into this kind of perception

120
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,640
 that we're comfortable with, that we think, you know,

121
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,160
 makes us feel good, when the reality is

122
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,000
 that's as far away from the reality

123
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,120
 of that first Christmas as possible.

124
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,800
 And then we do this in movies and we do this in stuff

125
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,760
 like whatever Christmas movie you're gonna watch

126
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,840
 over the Christmas period other than "Die Hard,"

127
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,480
 it presents a version of the Christmas family

128
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,880
 a lot like this one, right?

129
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,960
 Like the perfect Christmas family.

130
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,960
 There they are, they can't get whiter than that.

131
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,640
 They're surrounding by the tree behind them.

132
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,720
 There's beautiful lights everywhere.

133
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,760
 I mean, it is a beautiful scene.

134
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,480
 This is Christmas.

135
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:40,080
 And that makes us all, here's the ironic thing,

136
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,680
 that makes us all want to have

137
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,800
 the perfect Christmas ourselves, don't we?

138
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,680
 Like we want Christmas to be perfect.

139
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,520
 We want it to look just like that.

140
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,960
 And so we decorate our homes and we call our friends over

141
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,880
 and we cook the food and we make it perfect.

142
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,160
 And we want it to arrive on time.

143
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,840
 And if it doesn't, we get really angry and upset

144
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,840
 and it's super stressful to make everything super perfect.

145
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,360
 But we think we need a perfect Christmas

146
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,640
 because the world is telling us

147
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,880
 that Christmas has to be perfect.

148
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:09,160
 The funny thing is we, even as Christians,

149
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,560
 spiritualize the perfectness of Christmas.

150
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,440
 Oh, if I could just pull off the perfect Christmas

151
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,440
 for my family this year, Jesus, we'd be glorified.

152
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,120
 Like if the food is perfect, the turkey's nice and moist,

153
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,160
 if all the presents are brought

154
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,720
 and put under the tree at the right time,

155
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,800
 if my kids are happy with what I brought them,

156
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,040
 Jesus will be glorified in our midst.

157
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:37,160
 I wonder, in our desire to try to create

158
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,360
 the perfect Christmas, that we're actually in danger

159
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:44,480
 of missing out on what Christmas truly is.

160
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:47,400
 Or to put it another way, is our striving

161
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,320
 for the perfect Christmas simply Christmas misdirection?

162
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,040
 Think about it for a moment.

163
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,040
 Because the first Christmas was an absolute mess.

164
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,520
 Nothing went right with that first Christmas.

165
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,080
 I mean, if you want a perfect Christmas,

166
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,200
 do not open the pages of the Gospels.

167
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,560
 I mean, just stop for a moment and think about

168
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,720
 what you see in that first Christmas.

169
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,760
 Number one, a crisis teenage pregnancy, awkward.

170
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,480
 Number two, an unexplained and unexpected road trip

171
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,200
 at the last minute.

172
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:27,200
 An arrival and the accommodation is messed up.

173
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:31,160
 A not very ideal birthing environment for a child.

174
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,800
 And then, to top it off,

175
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,120
 three weird old astrolobers from the East

176
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,440
 come over and visit you.

177
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,960
 And then, just to add more to that,

178
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,840
 there's a genocide that happens in the very place

179
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,440
 where the child is born.

180
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,720
 That's a messed up Christmas.

181
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,680
 That should make you feel better

182
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,640
 about some of your messed up Christmases over the years.

183
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:54,880
 But that's the reality of the first Christmas.

184
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:57,520
 It's so messed up and so chaotic

185
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,000
 and the people involved in it are so confused

186
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,120
 about what's happening that they have no idea

187
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,440
 that they're getting swept up

188
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,640
 in this redemptive moment of history.

189
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,880
 The first Christmas is so messed up

190
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,520
 and it's just as God wanted it.

191
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,920
 It was quite literally Christmas.

192
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,560
 See what I did there?

193
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,280
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.

194
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,880
 Thank you, thank you, thank you.

195
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:24,240
 This Advent, we want to take you

196
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:28,600
 into the messiness of Christmas.

197
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,120
 Because it's actually in the messiness

198
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,560
 where the message of Christmas sits.

199
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,320
 And if you try to do some misdirection,

200
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,800
 try to ignore the reality

201
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,640
 that the first Christmas was a little bit messy,

202
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,400
 you actually kind of miss what the hope

203
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:46,800
 of the first Christmas is all about for you and for me.

204
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,680
 I mean, think about the incarnation for a start.

205
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,080
 God decides to send His perfect representation of Himself,

206
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,120
 the perfect manifestation of Himself

207
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,440
 in the incarnation of Jesus, fully God and fully human,

208
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,720
 born into that smelly, horrible,

209
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,080
 not like the Christmas card,

210
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,520
 that smelly, horrible, dark, damp cave

211
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,720
 that He was born into.

212
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:12,400
 And He was there in the messiness to tell us something,

213
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,560
 that no matter how messy the world is,

214
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,000
 no matter how broken and chaotic this place can be,

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,520
 and you could probably think that the world today

216
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:25,280
 is just as messed up and chaotic and broken as it ever was,

217
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,840
 that Jesus is happy to be born in that place.

218
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,560
 That He's happy to be born in a place that isn't all right,

219
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,840
 that He's not interested in some misdirection,

220
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,960
 that He actually wants to meet you, yourself,

221
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:42,680
 in your personal brokenness, in your messiness.

222
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,040
 That the beauty of the incarnation

223
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,800
 is that Jesus did not come for a perfect world

224
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,880
 filled with perfect people.

225
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,200
 If that was the case, He wouldn't have come at all.

226
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,080
 He's come to an imperfect world filled with imperfect people

227
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,600
 because in meeting the imperfect people,

228
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:01,480
 He might bring us into the righteousness,

229
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:05,200
 not the perfection, the righteousness of Christ,

230
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,440
 so that we might know a saving relationship with Him.

231
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,320
 And when He comes again, Advent,

232
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
 when He comes again at the end of all things,

233
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,440
 we are presented to Him holy and pure,

234
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,080
 presented to Him without blemish as a bride before Him

235
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:22,560
 because of the work He's done inside of us.

236
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,480
 That's why Christmas is messy,

237
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:31,160
 'cause it says something to us about our messiness.

238
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:34,520
 And so over Advent, we're gonna unpack

239
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:37,120
 the messy moments of Christmas together.

240
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,680
 Next week, we're gonna look at that really messy time

241
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,440
 with Zachariah and the angel in the temple and his silence,

242
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,960
 and then the messiness of Mary having her pregnancy

243
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:50,520
 and everybody thinking that she had sex before marriage.

244
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:52,960
 The week after that, we're gonna look at the family,

245
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,640
 Mary and Joseph arriving in Bethlehem,

246
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,200
 and nobody in their family welcomed them in,

247
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,320
 not because, as the carols sometimes tell us,

248
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,400
 that the whole place was filled,

249
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,400
 but because nobody in their family wanted anything to do

250
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,720
 with a pregnant, unmarried teenager.

251
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,720
 And then the week after that,

252
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:12,440
 we're gonna look at Jesus when He's just eight days old

253
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,880
 in the temple, and the prophets turn up and speak to Him

254
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,960
 and say some pretty messy stuff to Mary and to Jesus,

255
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,520
 stuff that would come to define the things

256
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:25,440
 that would happen in their lives in the years ahead.

257
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,360
 And in this, our hope for you and for us

258
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:34,920
 is that we would strip the misdirection of Christmas from us

259
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,560
 so that we would see Christmas

260
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,880
 as it was truly meant to be seen.

261
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,940
 It might surprise you, but the gospel writers were intent

262
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,400
 in stripping the misdirection out of the story

263
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,160
 of the life of Jesus.

264
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,840
 In fact, Matthew and Luke, who are the ones

265
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,240
 that tell us the birth story of Jesus,

266
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,880
 they do everything in that birth story

267
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,440
 to try to communicate to you

268
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,520
 that this was not a perfect time,

269
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,960
 that this was not just as everybody else

270
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,840
 thought it should be,

271
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,080
 although it was exactly as God had planned it to be.

272
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:09,800
 And I think no more powerfully do they show us this

273
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,080
 than in what both of them do

274
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,000
 in presenting to us the genealogy of Jesus,

275
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,000
 genealogy, that's a fancy word to talk about the bloodline,

276
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,600
 the family before Him that came to make who Jesus is

277
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,800
 and was.

278
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,120
 Now, that genealogy is presented to us

279
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,520
 in both Matthew and in Luke,

280
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:27,660
 Matthew chapter one, Luke chapter three.

281
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,680
 I'm not gonna read you in detail those genealogies today.

282
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,280
 You can do that during the week.

283
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,600
 I encourage you to do that.

284
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,480
 What I want to do today is tell you the stories

285
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,440
 about the people who are in the genealogies.

286
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,900
 'Cause I think in understanding their story,

287
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,200
 you might understand Jesus's story better,

288
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,080
 and therefore you might understand your story better.

289
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,520
 You see some incredible people in the genealogies

290
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,920
 in Matthew and Luke.

291
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,640
 You see people like Abraham, the father of the faith,

292
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,560
 the one who began Israel itself,

293
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,400
 the one who was faithful to God

294
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,640
 and did so many things as an act of love and grace to Him.

295
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,080
 You see characters like Isaac,

296
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,180
 Isaac who was incredibly obedient.

297
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:10,240
 In fact, one of the best examples we have in scripture

298
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,520
 of somebody who's obedient to God's call on their life.

299
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,880
 We see the prophets like there's Hezekiah and Amos

300
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,040
 in the genealogies,

301
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:20,280
 great prophets who held God's word

302
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,120
 and had the courage and the boldness

303
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,960
 to speak that word into the world.

304
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,880
 And it was a beautiful thing.

305
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,200
 We see great moral leaders in those genealogies.

306
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,120
 People like Boaz and Jesse, people like Elam,

307
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,800
 ones who walked out this idea

308
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,380
 of what it meant to live for God,

309
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,680
 the kingdom of God in the world today.

310
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,760
 And of course you see kings.

311
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,160
 You see kings in the genealogy,

312
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,120
 David, his son Solomon, Rehoboam,

313
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:48,800
 all kings that led Israel at different periods of time.

314
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,680
 And when you see the genealogy like that,

315
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,400
 you can begin to understand why Matthew and Luke

316
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:57,640
 include such amazing figures in their genealogy.

317
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,760
 See, genealogies in the first century

318
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,320
 were designed to tell you something about the individual.

319
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,680
 If you wanted to say to someone,

320
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,520
 "Hey, this individual is worth your time."

321
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,920
 You would tell them the family that they've come from.

322
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,400
 We don't do this in Hong Kong society at all, do we?

323
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,520
 Oh, okay, sorry, too close.

324
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:16,360
 All right, so, but you know what I'm saying?

325
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,280
 Like who you've come from,

326
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,840
 the people who've gone before you

327
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,840
 say something about who you are.

328
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,080
 And so when Matthew and Luke are trying to present Jesus

329
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:27,760
 as the Messiah, they're trying to fill the genealogy

330
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,360
 with people that speak of the glory

331
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,840
 and the goodness of this person.

332
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,680
 Matthew, who's writing predominantly to a Jewish audience,

333
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,160
 starts from the place of Abraham, which makes sense,

334
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,280
 'cause he's trying to convince Jewish people

335
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,160
 that Jesus is their long-awaited for Messiah.

336
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,360
 Luke, though, Luke's writing to a Gentile audience,

337
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,640
 mostly a Gentile audience.

338
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,000
 So he doesn't start with Abraham.

339
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,640
 He goes all the way back to Adam.

340
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,280
 Why does he go back to Adam?

341
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,320
 'Cause Adam's the father of all people,

342
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,520
 regardless of background or race or culture.

343
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:58,720
 And so Luke takes us all the way back there to say,

344
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,800
 "This Jesus is for everybody."

345
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:04,080
 And in their presentations, they're basically saying,

346
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,120
 "Here's Abraham, here's the kings,

347
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,160
 "here's the miracle workers, here's the prophets,

348
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,880
 "here's all these people that make Jesus."

349
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,160
 And we do the same, don't we?

350
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,280
 When we tell people stories about our families,

351
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,760
 we tell them the good stuff, right?

352
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,480
 We tell them, I've already received

353
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,800
 a number of Christmas cards so far this year.

354
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
 I love getting Christmas cards.

355
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,360
 Christmas cards tell you all the great stuff

356
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,720
 that's happening with families.

357
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,000
 Here's all the things that have happened.

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,000
 And we do this, don't we?

359
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,360
 We talk to people like this, like,

360
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,680
 "Hey, let me tell you about little Bobby

361
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,480
 "and what he got in his latest test."

362
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,840
 If little Bobby didn't do good in the latest test,

363
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,000
 you don't talk about that, right?

364
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,120
 Or whatever it might be, whatever achievement and stuff,

365
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,840
 we don't talk about the messy stuff, do we?

366
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:47,240
 We don't present the failures or anything like that.

367
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,400
 Like, we don't tell people,

368
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,960
 "Oh, let me tell you about Uncle Bob who's in jail."

369
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,160
 Let me tell you about Ted who cheated on his wife.

370
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,000
 He's part of my family, a little awkward,

371
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,120
 but let's talk about that one.

372
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,600
 You come over to my house and you'll see photos of my house.

373
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,560
 Those photos are from good times that my family has.

374
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,040
 I don't splash the photos of the arguments

375
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,960
 and the breakdowns and the discussions

376
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,280
 and the things that Chris and I disagree on.

377
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,440
 I don't present that sort of stuff to the world.

378
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,840
 We love to present to the world

379
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,440
 who we think the world should think us to be.

380
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:21,360
 And you would think that Matthew and Luke,

381
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,200
 in presenting Jesus as the Messiah,

382
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,400
 would do exactly the same thing.

383
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
 Here's the thing.

384
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:27,720
 While they do include a few people

385
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,420
 like I've already mentioned who are amazing people,

386
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:33,720
 the majority of the genealogy, guess what?

387
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:37,560
 The people are really messed up.

388
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,280
 That should shock you.

389
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:43,260
 That's what Matthew and Luke should not have done.

390
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:49,200
 But they don't shy away from the messy background to Jesus.

391
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,480
 In fact, they want you to see it.

392
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,320
 They shine a light on it

393
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,880
 so that you can begin to wrestle

394
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,600
 with the incredible reality

395
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,680
 that some really screwed up people went into the bloodline

396
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,480
 that formed and brought Jesus Christ.

397
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,760
 So I wanna tell you some of the stories

398
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,680
 of some of the people that you'll find

399
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,560
 in Matthew and Luke's presentation

400
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,980
 of the genealogy of Jesus.

401
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:20,920
 You'll find characters like this,

402
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,360
 like Jacob and Jeconiah,

403
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,360
 who were basically serial liars and manipulative deceivers.

404
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:33,960
 There's people like David and Jehoram,

405
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,740
 who were murderers, adulterers, and rapists.

406
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,700
 You'll find Judah.

407
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,940
 Judah's an interesting one.

408
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,220
 Judah is a human trafficker and sexual abuser.

409
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:49,220
 You'll find Abijah and Manasseh,

410
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:51,420
 both who are idol worshipers, by the way.

411
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:54,420
 Down the list a little bit further in Matthews,

412
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,780
 there is Rahab.

413
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,780
 She's a brothel owner and a prostitute.

414
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,980
 Tamar's always a fascinating one for me.

415
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,900
 Tamar slept with her father-in-law,

416
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,020
 so basically entered into incest.

417
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,620
 You've got Solomon, who was essentially a sex addict.

418
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,740
 He had 300 sex slaves.

419
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:16,660
 You have Ahaziah,

420
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,620
 and this one might be the most disgusting of all,

421
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:23,340
 Ahaziah, who actually was involved in child sacrifice.

422
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,780
 All of these people, Matthew and Luke,

423
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,740
 don't shy away from,

424
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:33,500
 despite the difficulties of their stories.

425
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,740
 But it's not just those that have abused

426
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,140
 that are in the bloodline.

427
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,460
 There's also examples of those

428
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,100
 that have been abused in the bloodline.

429
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,620
 So in here as well, it's Bathsheba.

430
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,980
 Bathsheba, who was exploited by King David for her body.

431
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,940
 There's Ruth, who was a Moabitess.

432
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,980
 The Jewish people hated the Moabites.

433
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,620
 She's included in the line.

434
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,300
 And she was someone who was actually discriminated against

435
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:57,300
 time and time again.

436
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,540
 You then got Mary in the list, of course.

437
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,780
 Mary comes towards the end.

438
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,220
 She was someone who was falsely accused.

439
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,140
 People accused her of having sex before marriage

440
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:07,300
 when that wasn't the case.

441
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:08,140
 So you've got those

442
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,100
 that have also been mistreated in the list.

443
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,020
 Add to that then a whole bunch of names.

444
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,260
 Let me read these to you.

445
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:20,340
 People like Azor, there's Zadok, Achim, Eliud.

446
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:23,060
 The reason why I read you these names

447
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:25,500
 is because we know nothing about them.

448
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,340
 There's no story about them at all.

449
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,460
 They're not mentioned anywhere else in the Bible.

450
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,180
 They're completely forgotten to history.

451
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,660
 You could actually argue that these are forgotten,

452
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:37,580
 unknown, and insignificant people.

453
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:39,980
 They're also on the list.

454
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:45,620
 So just take a second and look at Jesus's family tree.

455
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:50,540
 These are the stories that go to feed

456
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:51,940
 into the person of Jesus.

457
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,820
 And Matthew and Luke are like, look at this.

458
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,260
 And some of us in this room,

459
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:59,340
 we have some pretty broken families that we're from,

460
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,860
 but maybe this is a comfort to you

461
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,820
 that your family's not quite like this.

462
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:05,020
 This is pretty full on.

463
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:09,580
 And Matthew and Luke, what they're doing is,

464
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:12,380
 they're like, no more misdirection here.

465
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,460
 We're not gonna try and convince you

466
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,740
 that the Messiah is this perfect God,

467
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,940
 this perfect person for a perfect world.

468
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,140
 He's a perfect God and a perfect person

469
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,780
 for a really broken, screwed up world.

470
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:24,620
 And guess what?

471
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,180
 All that brokenness, all that screwed upness,

472
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,300
 it's all come up to form who he is.

473
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,980
 His bloodline is not great.

474
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:35,740
 His bloodline actually is a reflection of us,

475
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,500
 of humanity.

476
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,540
 And this, my friends, is what Christmas is all about.

477
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,380
 Matthew and Luke are trying to shine a spotlight

478
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:43,580
 right at the start and say,

479
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,660
 here's the purest message of Christmas

480
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,060
 that Jesus is willing to step into the muck

481
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,780
 and the brokenness and all the stuff that there is in life,

482
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,700
 all of the stuff that we would rather sweep under the carpet,

483
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,540
 we'd rather do some misdirection

484
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,140
 so people don't know that about us.

485
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:00,820
 All of that stuff is why Jesus came.

486
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:03,540
 This is the gospel at its purest form.

487
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,700
 He didn't come for you when you got yourself cleaned up.

488
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:11,660
 He didn't come for you when you were all so perfect and nice.

489
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,020
 So many of us think that Jesus would come to us

490
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,500
 if we just stopped sinning.

491
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,500
 The reality is he came to you

492
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,860
 whilst you were still a sinner.

493
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:25,460
 He steps into the muckiest of our mucks and says,

494
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:26,420
 I am here.

495
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,100
 I'm here with you.

496
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,540
 That's the beauty of Christmas.

497
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:35,420
 And anytime we try to turn it into something else,

498
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:38,020
 we're actually stripping Christmas from the gospel

499
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:41,060
 for which it was founded in the first place.

500
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:46,460
 See, here's what Jesus' genealogy teaches us,

501
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:51,460
 that no one is so bad, so sinful, so mistreated,

502
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:57,020
 so forgotten, so cast out of the circle of faith

503
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:01,100
 that they are outside the story of Jesus.

504
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,940
 No one.

505
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,580
 And if that doesn't encourage you today,

506
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,740
 I don't know what will.

507
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:11,540
 That no one is disqualified

508
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,060
 from the grace and the mercy of a God

509
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:17,900
 who was born in a damp, dark cave

510
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:22,220
 to give us the message that no matter how damp, dark,

511
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:25,140
 and cave-like our hearts might be,

512
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,900
 Jesus can be born in there too.

513
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:32,140
 His life can come alive in us.

514
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:36,260
 That in fact, I think actually Jesus likes to search out

515
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,940
 those that seem more messed up than others

516
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,860
 and say, you're my child.

517
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:44,860
 You.

518
00:22:44,860 --> 00:22:46,540
 I love you.

519
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,860
 And I am here for you.

520
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:52,740
 And the beauty of the genealogy of Jesus,

521
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:54,580
 in fact, the beauty of every genealogy,

522
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:58,060
 is that it tells you the people that come to form someone.

523
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,340
 But then you can flip it because that person then

524
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,260
 becomes the starting point of more

525
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,260
 that would come from them.

526
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,220
 Do you follow that?

527
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:07,420
 So genealogy goes up towards the person,

528
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,940
 but then the genealogy goes beyond the person,

529
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,700
 outwards from them.

530
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,540
 And every single person who's in this room right now

531
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:16,540
 who's a Christian, you're a part of now the family line,

532
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:19,220
 the bloodline, if you will, of Jesus.

533
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,780
 Not the literal bloodline,

534
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,540
 but the blood that was shed on the cross

535
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,940
 to pay the price for your sin.

536
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,260
 And as we come into saving recognition of that,

537
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:28,500
 and we ask God to forgive us of our sins,

538
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,500
 and we grow in that, then we are a part of his family.

539
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,260
 He says, you are not the same person that you were before.

540
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,340
 You're a new creation.

541
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:36,180
 You're my son.

542
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,020
 You're my daughter.

543
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:37,860
 You're my child.

544
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,180
 You're a child of God.

545
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,260
 You are in this story now.

546
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,940
 Isn't that beautiful?

547
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:45,580
 So the reason why Matthew and Luke start with this story

548
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,140
 of a broken, messy background to Jesus

549
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,260
 is 'cause they're trying to say something.

550
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,940
 That the family that Jesus was from

551
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,940
 anticipates the family he's come for.

552
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:02,220
 You follow that?

553
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,500
 The family that Jesus is from anticipates the family

554
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,460
 that he's come for.

555
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:13,900
 You and I, who are equally as messed up and as broken

556
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,340
 as some of those people in the list right there,

557
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:21,260
 and yet who are not disqualified,

558
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,620
 and who are ones that God now turns to and says,

559
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,540
 I choose you,

560
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:28,620
 that you are gonna be a part of this thing

561
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,340
 called the church,

562
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:33,860
 this thing filled with kind of messy people

563
00:24:33,860 --> 00:24:35,620
 who know that they have a God who has saved them

564
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:38,140
 and redeemed them and have hope now.

565
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:41,540
 See, as Christians, we don't worship the mess.

566
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,380
 We don't go, oh, look at all my brokenness.

567
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,740
 Look at all my sin.

568
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,020
 Paul says, in recognition of the grace of God,

569
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,220
 do I continue to just go on sinning?

570
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,580
 No.

571
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,980
 We don't worship the mess,

572
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:55,540
 but we realize that we are part of the mess,

573
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:58,620
 and that Jesus comes and redeems us out of that mess,

574
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,900
 and as he pulls us out of it,

575
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,820
 we then have a story to tell.

576
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,820
 Christmas should be the most powerful,

577
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:08,740
 gospel, evangelistic story that could ever be told

578
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,500
 to a broken and desperate world,

579
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:13,740
 but we've allowed the world to strip Jesus from it.

580
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:17,100
 Happy holidays.

581
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:19,420
 When actually Christmas should be the time

582
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,260
 where the church rises up and says,

583
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,900
 there's a better story to be told.

584
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:26,660
 There's a story about the mess of the world

585
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:28,340
 and the mess of humanity

586
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,540
 and the God who is not afraid of that mess,

587
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,300
 a God who steps into that mess, does something about it,

588
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:42,460
 who invites us to experience his love even in the mess.

589
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:47,300
 I love how the scholar Raymond Brown puts it.

590
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,460
 He wrote this.

591
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,740
 He said, "The God who wrote the beginnings

592
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,100
 "with crooked lines also writes the sequence

593
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:53,540
 "with crooked lines,

594
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:57,060
 "and some of those lines are our own lives in witness,

595
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,460
 "a God who did not hesitate to use the scheming

596
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,740
 "as well as the noble, the impure as well as the pure,

597
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:04,540
 "men to whom the world hearkened

598
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:07,060
 "and women upon whom the world frowned.

599
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:09,260
 "This God continues to work

600
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:13,700
 "through the same glorious mess of people."

601
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,020
 Isn't that beautiful?

602
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,860
 This God continues to work

603
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:21,380
 through the same glorious mess of people,

604
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,940
 the Vine Church in Hong Kong.

605
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,900
 That fills me with joy.

606
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,420
 That's the gospel that actually is Christmas.

607
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,340
 And on your way out in a moment,

608
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,940
 I wanna encourage you to go down the main stairs

609
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:37,820
 of the building,

610
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,980
 particularly if you didn't have time

611
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,900
 to look at them on the way up.

612
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,220
 If you're in the upper house,

613
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:44,220
 I might wanna encourage you guys to come and do that

614
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:46,260
 even though you might escape through the lift

615
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,460
 or some other way at the end.

616
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,740
 Not escape, that was the wrong word.

617
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:50,820
 You go in the lift.

618
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,820
 You're more than welcome to use the lift anytime.

619
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,060
 I will not think you're escaping.

620
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,100
 The lift is good.

621
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,540
 But you might wanna come down the stairs

622
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,740
 and come down the main thing

623
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,820
 because what we've done

624
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,860
 is we've wanted to visually represent

625
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,260
 everything I've been talking about today

626
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:05,020
 and what this series is all about

627
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:08,260
 through what we call cabinets of curiosity

628
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,860
 or rooms of wonder.

629
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,900
 They're famous in the 16th century

630
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:15,180
 to help people to experience the wonder of the world.

631
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,740
 And we, our creative team,

632
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:20,500
 have made four of these that are down there on the stairs.

633
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,820
 You can look at them on the way out.

634
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,740
 And we've put specific things inside of them

635
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,380
 'cause they represent what I'm talking about.

636
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,420
 They represent the reality that on the outside,

637
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,300
 we're structured and we have a certain way

638
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,780
 and we project a certain image.

639
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:37,060
 But on the inside is all the stuff.

640
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:39,140
 Some of it, which we're happy for people to see.

641
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:41,860
 Some of it, we're not happy for people to see.

642
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:45,820
 But in that, we have a gateway

643
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,860
 to the need for the gospel of Jesus

644
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
 and the need for the hope that he brings us

645
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,620
 by his love and in his power.

646
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:55,900
 And so as we come to look at these

647
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:59,460
 little cabinets of curiosity,

648
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,180
 I wonder you might reflect a little bit

649
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:04,300
 on the curiousness of your mess in you.

650
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:08,380
 And it's an invitation for you to bring that mess to him.

651
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,500
 And what we're gonna do every step of this series

652
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
 is give you an opportunity to bring a certain type

653
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,620
 or kind of mess to God.

654
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,300
 And I believe that as we get to the end of the series

655
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,020
 and as we get to Christmas Day,

656
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,820
 you will find yourself living out the Christmas story

657
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,740
 so much better than ever before.

658
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,700
 It is not a misdirection.

659
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:30,260
 Instead, what Matthew and Luke do is they're like,

660
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,300
 I'm not gonna do this, by the way,

661
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:33,700
 but if they took this and went, wha, like that,

662
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,820
 they basically rip it all off and they say,

663
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,260
 this is how it really is

664
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:41,220
 because in this, there is hope.

665
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,540
 For you in this room online right now,

666
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,860
 everybody in the overflow,

667
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:47,060
 no matter how sinful you are, there is hope.

668
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:50,340
 No matter how broken you are, there is hope.

669
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,460
 No matter how forgotten you are, there is hope.

670
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:56,540
 No matter how mistreated you have been in your life,

671
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,660
 there is hope.

672
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,700
 That's the gospel message of Jesus.

673
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,740
 That's what Christmas is all about.

674
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:06,460
 So may we enjoy the mess this year.

675
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:08,900
 One of the greatest messes you'll ever encounter

676
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,380
 is the mess of Christmas Day.

677
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:13,580
 Do not be too quick to clean it up.

678
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,420
 Can I pray for you?

679
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,260
 Let's pray.

680
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:25,420
 Father, I am so grateful for the people in this room.

681
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,900
 I'm so grateful for every person

682
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,300
 who holds a different story.

683
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:36,180
 I'm grateful, Lord, that you have provided for us

684
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,060
 all a gateway, an entry point to you.

685
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:44,100
 That your birth in Bethlehem some 2000 years ago

686
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:49,540
 in a sequence of messy events

687
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:52,820
 is really our opportunity

688
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,500
 to experience your welcome in our lives.

689
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:59,980
 And so I wanna pray for a few kinds of people in this room

690
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:02,540
 as our eyes are closed and our heads are bowed.

691
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:07,820
 Some of you in this room, you don't know Jesus.

692
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,700
 And maybe when you came in here this morning,

693
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,020
 you wouldn't have said that you were a Christian.

694
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,180
 Maybe someone's invited you here,

695
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:18,260
 or maybe you feel like you had a relationship

696
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:21,180
 with God in the past, but that's gone

697
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:24,140
 and you're wondering how to get it back.

698
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:28,860
 The message that I brought today

699
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,300
 is a message of hope for you.

700
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,100
 You don't need to get yourself cleaned up

701
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,540
 before you can meet Jesus.

702
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,580
 And some of you, that's a real message for you today.

703
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:43,540
 Some of you are thinking,

704
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:46,300
 well, once I get through that divorce

705
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,860
 or I stop doing that thing there,

706
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,780
 or once I just become a little bit of a better person,

707
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,020
 then I can be a Christian and come to church.

708
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:57,700
 The message today, the message of Christmas is

709
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,380
 no matter how messed up you are right now,

710
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:01,420
 you are welcome here.

711
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,100
 You're a part of our community.

712
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:08,060
 But more importantly, Jesus loves you.

713
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,820
 He's for you and He can help you.

714
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:17,580
 And so maybe some of you in this room right now or online,

715
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,580
 you wanna give your life to Jesus for the very first time.

716
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:23,820
 You've never done that before, but this is a moment for you.

717
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,740
 So whilst our eyes are closed and our heads are bowed,

718
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,580
 I wanna give you an opportunity to respond today.

719
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,140
 Perhaps right now your heart is just beating

720
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:33,380
 a little bit faster 'cause you know

721
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,980
 that God is with you in this,

722
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,180
 that He's inviting you to a relationship with Him.

723
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:39,540
 And you may not have all the answers.

724
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:42,180
 You may not know all the things,

725
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,700
 but you do know in this moment

726
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:47,060
 that you want to meet a God

727
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:50,420
 who can meet you right where you are.

728
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,980
 So if you've never given your life to Jesus before,

729
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,540
 I wanna give you an opportunity to do that.

730
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,700
 And I'm gonna pray for you in a moment.

731
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:01,300
 Whilst our eyes are closed, heads are bowed,

732
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,780
 you have an opportunity to start this new Advent series

733
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:06,900
 and season in the right place.

734
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,740
 And so if that's you,

735
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,980
 I wanna just encourage you just really quickly,

736
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,420
 just put your hand up so I can see you,

737
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,060
 so I can pray for you personally.

738
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:16,940
 Anybody here in the lower house?

739
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,580
 In the upper house as well,

740
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,500
 just put your hand up so I can see it.

741
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,580
 Great, see that hand, thank you.

742
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:29,580
 Anyone else wanna join my sister?

743
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:33,300
 Yeah, I see that as well, thank you.

744
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:36,700
 I can't really see the upper house,

745
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,380
 but we have pastors up there who can see you

746
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:41,100
 if you have raised your hand.

747
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:45,620
 All right, I wanna pray for those two people

748
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,940
 that I've seen and maybe some people

749
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,300
 in the upper house as well.

750
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:53,340
 Father, I thank you so much for these two, Lord,

751
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,660
 who Lord have brought themselves to a place today

752
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,500
 to meet you.

753
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:00,020
 And we're all gonna pray as one church together now,

754
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:03,060
 but those two in the upper house, if it's you as well,

755
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,380
 I want you just to pray after me.

756
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,420
 We're all gonna do it out loud,

757
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,060
 so you guys are a part of it,

758
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,260
 but it's particularly for you guys.

759
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,300
 So we're all gonna pray this together, let's pray.

760
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:16,300
 Lord Jesus, I wanna thank you for coming to earth,

761
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:20,620
 for being born 2000 years ago,

762
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,420
 so I could know you.

763
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:30,820
 Thank you for being born into the mess,

764
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,300
 into my mess, thank you.

765
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:40,260
 I ask that you would come now and meet me,

766
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:44,220
 forgive me and help me.

767
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:50,540
 I ask for your Holy Spirit to be in me and with me

768
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,740
 and helping me.

769
00:33:53,740 --> 00:34:00,540
 And I thank you that my new life starts today

770
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:06,060
 in Jesus' name, amen, amen.

771
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,860
 Well, if you've prayed that prayer here in the room

772
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,580
 and in the upper house, do come and talk to me afterwards

773
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,620
 at one of our passes, we'd love to pray with you.

774
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,300
 Everybody else, I want you to bow your heads

775
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:17,300
 and close your eyes again, sorry, 'cause we're not done yet.

776
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:20,740
 And so this is now for everybody else here

777
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,040
 who's already a Christian.

778
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,120
 And I know some of you are from really broken homes.

779
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,640
 I know that because I'm your pastor

780
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,360
 and our pastoral team spends time with you guys.

781
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,640
 And some of you are from really difficult,

782
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,040
 challenging family backgrounds.

783
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:40,360
 Some of you have been deeply hurt by those in your family.

784
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:46,040
 And some of you, you've been really impacted

785
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,240
 and affected over the years

786
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:48,880
 by the brokenness in your family.

787
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,640
 And I pray today as we've taken a bit of a look

788
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,440
 at the brokenness of Jesus' family,

789
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,440
 that you would find hope renewed in you today,

790
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,640
 that you would know that there is a God

791
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,000
 who knows what it is that you're going through,

792
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,520
 who knows how hard that it has been for you,

793
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:12,720
 and a God who wants to come and walk with you.

794
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,640
 He's not a God who always necessarily

795
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,640
 suddenly makes everything better,

796
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,800
 doesn't always suddenly change

797
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,760
 our circumstances or situations.

798
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,240
 But He does guarantee His presence with you

799
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,200
 in whatever it is that you are facing right now

800
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,040
 and will need to face.

801
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,720
 And so if you're from a broken home

802
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,080
 or challenging family backgrounds,

803
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:33,480
 know that the love of God

804
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,080
 and the presence of God is with you.

805
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:38,280
 And Lord, I wanna pray for my family here,

806
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:40,520
 whether that's their reality.

807
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,000
 Father, I pray that they would feel hope renewed in them,

808
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,080
 that they are now swept up in a family

809
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,600
 that you're a part of, that you started,

810
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:50,200
 that as we carry the name of Christ,

811
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,440
 we do so as part of your family,

812
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,720
 your sons and daughters, your children.

813
00:35:54,720 --> 00:36:00,600
 And Father, I wanna pray lastly

814
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,680
 for anyone here who's hurt people.

815
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:06,360
 In the list of Jesus' genealogy

816
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,680
 are those that have been mistreated.

817
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,520
 And we know, Lord,

818
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,480
 that sometimes we have done that ourselves.

819
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,640
 Maybe some of our family issues are at our doorstep.

820
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:18,760
 We were the perpetrators

821
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:21,880
 of some of the broken relationships in our families

822
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,600
 and some of the things that we're not proud of.

823
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:30,920
 Maybe we're the reason why there's been some brokenness

824
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,720
 amongst the people we love the most.

825
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,320
 And I wanna pray for you, if that's you in this room,

826
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:39,480
 that you would know the grace and the forgiveness of a God

827
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,520
 who forgives you so that you might be able

828
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,000
 to have the strength to move forward

829
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,440
 and invite and ask for forgiveness

830
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,880
 for those that you have hurt.

831
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,480
 The Lord's Prayer, forgive us our sins

832
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,760
 as we forgive those who have sinned against us.

833
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,520
 And I think the Gospels would further add

834
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,760
 as we invite and ask for forgiveness

835
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:01,640
 for those that we've hurt.

836
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:03,400
 And so I wanna pray for anyone here

837
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:05,680
 who recognizes that they've played

838
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,080
 that kind of role in their family.

839
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,120
 That Lord, I just ask that you would give them

840
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,120
 the strength, Lord.

841
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:17,240
 The humility, Lord, to seek reconciliation

842
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,600
 where it's possible, Lord.

843
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:21,080
 May not be possible in every circumstance,

844
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,680
 but where it's possible, Lord,

845
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,320
 give them the courage to do that.

846
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:30,200
 And Father, as we stand with this thought today,

847
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,640
 we're thankful that you ministered to us

848
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:33,440
 in multiple different ways.

849
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,000
 And it's all for your glory and for your grace.

850
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,840
 In Jesus' name.

851
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:42,120
 Can we stand together and we're gonna finish our time

852
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,240
 just allowing the Spirit of God

853
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,440
 to continue to minister to us.

854
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,720
 We're gonna sing some worship together.

855
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,920
 And I wanna encourage you that you may wanna seek prayer

856
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,840
 after the service.

857
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,960
 In a moment, Justin will close the service.

858
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,040
 And when he does so, we're gonna invite you

859
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,360
 to come forward for prayer.

860
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,680
 And some of the things that I've been sharing about today

861
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,720
 touch a nerve for you, touch your heart.

862
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,000
 We've got a team that would love to pray for you.

863
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,680
 And so we'll lead you in that in just a moment.

864
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,000
 But let's worship for now.

865
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,000
 for now.
