[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120]   Well, thank you so much, Andrew, worship team and Jess.
[00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.000]   And it's just such an honor to be with you, wherever you're tuning in from with us right now.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.280]   Thank you for that. And I'm glad to be with you.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.640]   But if you are tuning in from somewhere, whatever you're doing, I need you to do me a favor right now.
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.560]   All right. So stop what you're doing and just focus on me for a second.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.040]   Maybe not just for a second, but for the rest of this message, but especially right now, I need your attention.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.080]   All right. I'm going to give you a list of instructions for you to follow. All right.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.000]   They're going to be tasks and things you can do with your body.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.240]   What I want you to do is just follow my instructions. I'm going to go through the list one by one.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.120]   You don't have to finish each one before you move on to the next one.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.400]   You don't have to do them simultaneously. Simply move on to the next thing as I read it out.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.000]   Does that good? All right. Understood. OK. Are you ready? Let's go.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.160]   First thing, clap your hands. OK. Clap your hands. That's good. All right.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.520]   OK. Make arms like a chicken. You can do a chicken wing thing. OK. Make arms like a chicken.
[00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.800]   Right. Slap your knees. Slap your knees. All right. And click your fingers. Click, click, click, click. Good.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:13.280]   OK. Tap your feet. All right. Now start reciting the alphabet. A, B, C, D, E. OK. I think that's right.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:20.200]   OK. Do the jazz hands. Jazz hands. All right. OK. And then pull on your ears.
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.960]   OK. Now stop. OK. Now think back with me for a second.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.720]   What was the fifth thing that I asked you to do just now? The fifth thing that I asked you to do?
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.360]   It was a really short list. There's only eight things. So the fifth thing I asked you to do, can you remember?
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:44.800]   For some, it might be easier than others. Actually, it was tap your feet. Oh, right.
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:51.720]   Sometimes, following and remembering instructions is not the easiest thing to do.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.160]   Personally, I am terrible at this. I am really bad. Let me give you a quick example.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.760]   My friends, Renny and Kerry, who used to be here at The Vine, they're back in the States now.
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   So if you're watching, Renny and Kerry, hello. We love you. They used to live on Mui Wo.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:11.240]   And we loved going to visit them. Their Mui Wo was great. And we would visit them with that very often.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   And so one day, I was on one particular visit. I was visiting them. We were visiting in Mui Wo.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:22.040]   And Renny needed me to take her bicycle and go and grab something from the other side of town.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.200]   I didn't know how to get there. So she needed to give me directions.
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.000]   But for some reason, the moment she started talking, the moment she started giving me directions,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.840]   my mind goes completely blank. Actually, as a confession, this happens quite often when people give me directions,
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:46.080]   so give me instructions. So Renny starts saying, "Okay, Alison, ride to the meat shop. You know where that is, right?"
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.880]   I said, "Yes, I know where the meat shop is." "Okay, now, when you get to the meat shop, take a left."
[00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:55.640]   And then afterwards, and you know how in those movies where the screen starts going all wavy
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.480]   and it cuts to like the beach or like you're eating a cheeseburger or something like that, right?
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.040]   That's exactly what happens in my mind. I just completely blank.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:13.280]   I begin to drift off and Renny's still talking to me, okay, and I'm hitting her back with the occasional, "Mm-hmm, yep, okay, gotcha, right."
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.240]   But I am totally checked out. I'm not listening to a single word she's saying whatsoever.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:24.480]   Okay, then the conversation ends. Renny says, "Okay, you've got to hurry up and get there because he's waiting for you, all right?"
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.280]   I was like, "Uh-oh." But being the idiot that I am, I just said, "Okay, fine."
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.480]   I was just about to ride off into the island without the faintest clue about where I was going
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.480]   or what I was going for, who I was going to meet.
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.080]   Thankfully, Brittany had been standing next to me the whole time.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.680]   And I think she recognized like the glaze that went over my eyes as Renny started speaking.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.880]   And so she said to her, "Hey, Renny, watch this.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.480]   Ellison, can you just quickly repeat to Renny the instructions she just gave you?"
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.280]   I was in trouble now, right? I had no idea. I said, "Oh, yeah, sure.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.280]   I'm going to the meat shop and then I'm taking a left and then, you know, just going to that place, right?
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   It's going to be fine. I'll find him eventually somewhere."
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.280]   Like I said, seeking and following directions for our life can be challenging.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.280]   But as followers of Jesus, we need to get good at this church because Jesus wants to guide our lives.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.680]   And Scripture time and time again tells us and reminds us that we are to live obedient lives to our Father in heaven.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.480]   So today we're going to be looking at Matthew chapter 2 to help us figure this out.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:43.080]   Now, I know we just got done with Christmas. In fact, there's only another 340 days to go till next Christmas.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.680]   Woohoo! Yeah, 342 days, all right?
[00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.080]   And Matthew 2, I know, is traditionally a Christmas passage.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:57.280]   So it might sound a little familiar, but the approach we'll take today, as we've been talking about, as Andrew's been saying,
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.680]   we're going to be looking at it as a guide to see how God leads us in different times of our life.
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.880]   Because I know many of us, myself included, have often asked ourselves these questions, right?
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.280]   Where, how does God guide us? Does God even want to guide me?
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.480]   What is God's will for my life? What does He want me to do?
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.480]   Where does He want me to go?
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:27.080]   And as we've been saying, church, you know, it's time to dream again.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:33.680]   It's time to hear God's direction again for our lives and follow Him with everything that we have.
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.080]   So let's read this passage. You can follow along on the screen or if you have a real Bible,
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.080]   if you're one of the super spiritual ones, open up your Bible or you can follow along on the screen.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.880]   And we're going to read Matthew 2 together.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.380]   It says this, "After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea,
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.980]   during the time of King Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem and asked,
[00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:59.480]   'Where is the one who has been born King of the Jews?
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.280]   We saw his star when it rose and we have come to worship him.'"
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   The first thing I want to notice is that we have a God who wants to lead us.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:15.880]   The Magi, these wise men, are some of the most mysterious characters in the whole Christmas story, right?
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.980]   In this passage. Who were they? Where did they come from? What did they do?
[00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.980]   Now, the general idea is that these were a group of men, probably more than three,
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.480]   despite the lovely Christmas carol that we sing around that time of the year,
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:35.480]   more than three, a group of men who were wealthy and influential in the area they were from.
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.980]   Somewhere in the east, people say maybe either Persia, Babylonia, something like that.
[00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:44.780]   They would have been like magicians and astrologers, intellectuals,
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:51.480]   people who studied the skies and the movements of the stars and the planets and all those kind of things.
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.880]   Well-educated, powerful people.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:02.380]   And so, as they were studying the skies, they noticed this supernatural phenomenon of a moving star.
[00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.280]   And for some reason, they felt compelled to follow this star.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.880]   And they were following it because they knew exactly where it was leading.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:16.180]   God was using the star to guide the Magi towards Jesus.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.480]   And in their obedience, Magi followed with a very clear purpose.
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:28.180]   It tells us very clearly in Scripture, "To worship the one who had been born King of the Jews."
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:31.280]   Now, we have to pause here a minute because this is pretty exciting.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.880]   It's really phenomenal what's happening here.
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.580]   Because here we have a group of pagan Gentiles.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.680]   They didn't worship God before this.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:47.280]   They trek hundreds of miles following a mysterious star with the sole purpose of going to meet Jesus,
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:53.580]   worshipping Him and blessing Him with these really awesome, expensive, amazing gifts.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:58.080]   God's sovereign guidance is evident in this picture.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:01.180]   And so, one of the first principles we learn here, church, is this.
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:06.280]   God is always, always trying to guide people towards Him.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   And the other thing is this.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:14.580]   In fact, there isn't anyone that God cannot reach with His love, with His guidance.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.980]   Or in other words, you might say it this way.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:22.180]   Everyone is capable of having God impact their lives and reveal Himself to them
[00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:27.080]   to direct them into a relationship with Him.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:31.880]   Maybe today you're in a place where you felt like, "You know, it's been so tough the past few years.
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.880]   I don't know if I can follow or trust God anymore."
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:40.480]   Maybe, like Andrew was saying just now, you've been wrestling with some sin and some hidden things in your life
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.980]   and you feel like, "I'm too far gone. Jesus can't guide me anymore."
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.580]   Or maybe you've been trying to reach someone with the gospel and you've been saying to yourself,
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.980]   "You know what? God, this isn't going to work.
[00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.280]   Those people or that person will never become a Christian.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.580]   They will never become followers of you."
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:04.580]   The beginning of this passage is a reminder for us that God's intention, like we've been saying,
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.380]   is to guide all people towards Him.
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:14.580]   Everyone, all nations, all kinds of people to believe in Him, to follow Him and to worship Him.
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.280]   So, have you ever thought that you're too far gone?
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:20.580]   Or you think those people are too far away from Jesus?
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:22.780]   Be encouraged, church.
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.780]   God's heart is to reach everybody.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.480]   And often He'll use the most amazing and creative ways to guide people towards Him.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:36.580]   And the most amazing thing is that in fact, sometimes we see the most reluctant people,
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.480]   the people we thought would never become a Christian,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.880]   become some of the most influential people of our faith.
[00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:48.780]   C.S. Lewis himself once said that he was the most reluctant convert in the whole of England.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:52.180]   The apostle Paul called himself the worst of all sinners.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:59.880]   And yet, these two men, we know the amazing impact they've had on his kingdom here on this earth,
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.180]   following Jesus.
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:06.280]   And anyone can reach a stage where they want to follow Jesus.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.480]   God can guide all people towards Him.
[00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:14.380]   But the reminder for us here is that we have to be obedient and follow that.
[00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:18.580]   It has to be a conscious choice and action that we take.
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:21.980]   These wise men, these magi weren't forced to follow God.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:26.180]   They made that decision himself to go and to worship Him.
[00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:30.180]   It took time. It took obedience. It took effort.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:36.980]   But when they got there, they were ready and excited to worship Jesus when they arrived in Bethlehem.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:43.080]   As we step into this new year church, a question that I've been asking myself and now I'm asking you is this.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.280]   Are you excited to worship Jesus?
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.980]   Are you excited to see all that He's got planned for you?
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.780]   All the dreams that He still has for you in this year?
[00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:56.280]   Does that bring you joy and excitement?
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.580]   Because if not, if our attitudes aren't like that,
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:04.880]   very quickly we might turn to be more like Herod in this story.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.580]   Let's look at Herod's reaction to Jesus' birth.
[00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:09.880]   Verse 3, it says this.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.080]   "When King Herod heard this," that is the birth of Jesus,
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.480]   "he was disturbed and all of Jerusalem with him.
[00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:20.080]   And he had called together all the people's chief priests and teachers of the law.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:23.880]   He asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:26.080]   'In Bethlehem, in Judea,' they replied.
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.480]   'For this is what the prophet has said.
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.480]   'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means the least among the rulers of Judah.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:38.880]   Out of you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.680]   Then Herod called the Magi secretly and found out from them the exact time the star had appeared.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:48.980]   He sent them to Bethlehem and said, 'Go and search carefully for the child.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:56.280]   As soon as you have found him, report to me so that I may too go and worship him.'"
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:00.080]   Do you know that feeling, guys, when you're having a conversation with someone
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:05.580]   and then they suddenly say something surprising or maybe even offensive to you, upsetting to you,
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:06.980]   but you don't want to let it show, right?
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.480]   So you just have to keep a poker face and you just keep nodding and smiling along,
[00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:13.280]   but inside you're thinking all these thoughts already.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.980]   This is kind of what's happening to Herod right now.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:22.780]   And Matthew is purposely highlighting the difference in attitude between the Magi and Herod himself.
[00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.580]   He's purposely highlighting that reaction.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:31.280]   As we've discovered, the Magi are happy and excited, joyful to go and worship Jesus.
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:35.480]   Herod, on the other hand, feels the opposite.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:39.780]   He is disturbed, particularly because this title,
[00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:44.980]   'the king of the Jews' that the Magi just casually threw out, he saw this as his title.
[00:12:44.980 --> 00:12:48.580]   This was the title that the Roman Empire had given to him.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:50.180]   He was supposed to be in charge.
[00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:52.080]   He was the king of this area.
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:57.180]   And he had a terrible reputation of being someone who was completely ruthless.
[00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:02.380]   He was a paranoid man, a brutal leader, desperate to protect his own power.
[00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:07.680]   So desperate, in fact, that he even had his wife and some of his sons killed at one point
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.180]   because he thought they were plotting against him.
[00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.380]   But didn't the angels proclaim, church?
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.080]   They proclaimed when they met the shepherds, right?
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.780]   Good news and great joy for all people.
[00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:22.280]   Herod doesn't see things this way.
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:28.380]   Instead, right away, he sees this as a threat to his power and he plots to kill Jesus.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:31.980]   He does some fact-checking with some of his chief priests and teachers of the law
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.080]   and they confirm what the wise man has said.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.980]   The prophecy has come true.
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:38.280]   The time of waiting is finished.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   A new ruler, a new leader has been born.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:44.080]   This was going to be the true king.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:50.980]   The best shepherd that Israel, the world has ever seen, was about to be born.
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:56.780]   So Herod's plan was then to trick the Magi into giving him the location of Jesus,
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:03.480]   not so he could worship him like they would, but his plan was to murder him.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.380]   But another interesting thing I want to see here for us as church is this.
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:11.780]   The religious leaders who were also anticipating, studying the Scriptures,
[00:14:11.780 --> 00:14:14.480]   anticipating the arrival of the Messiah,
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:19.280]   they too don't seem very excited about the birth of Jesus.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:22.880]   They knew all along this was happening, very clear that they knew what was happening,
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:27.480]   but yet they make no effort to go and seek him out.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.480]   Perhaps these people, these chief priests, these teachers of the law were also worried
[00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:35.980]   about the threat that Jesus would bring to their authority.
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.080]   They love being in control.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.680]   They love the power over the people.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:45.680]   And what would happen if people started following this true shepherd, this true king,
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:49.080]   instead of what they were teaching?
[00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:54.380]   How was he going to undermine their authority?
[00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:59.680]   The point is this, church, none of this contradicts what the angels had said.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.980]   Jesus' birth does bring good news, does bring great joy to all.
[00:15:04.980 --> 00:15:08.880]   However, you have to be in the posture to receive it.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.680]   You have to be in the posture to accept it.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:18.480]   And it has to be a posture of surrender, of obedience, of humility.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:21.480]   But maybe it's more straightforward, a bit more challenging,
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:24.380]   if you allow me, church, to say it this way.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:30.880]   Do you view Jesus as a threat to the direction you want to live your life?
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:36.580]   Because if you do, then his presence will never bring you joy.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.380]   I know that there's been times in my life when I wanted to follow Jesus,
[00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.280]   I just said it with my mouth.
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:45.580]   But in reality, I had already made up my mind.
[00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:47.280]   See, I didn't really want to follow God.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.180]   I didn't really want God's will for my life.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.480]   I just wanted him to go along with whatever I had already decided.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.280]   And when plans didn't work out, when things didn't work out,
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:04.380]   I ended up feeling angry and bitter and resentful.
[00:16:04.380 --> 00:16:07.080]   But let me encourage you with this.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:10.180]   Jesus isn't here to ruin your lifestyle.
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.980]   Jesus isn't here to rain on your parade.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:16.380]   He's not here to constrain the way you live your life.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:19.580]   Jesus is here so you can have life in the full.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:26.180]   Jesus is here so you can have freedom for who the Son sets free is free indeed.
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.780]   The question comes back to this.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.780]   Are you willing to follow Jesus' direction in your life?
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.680]   Are you willing to be obedient to where he's guiding you?
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.580]   Because when we do so, only when we do so,
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.280]   is when you'll find that Jesus' presence is good news
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:48.180]   and he brings you peace and he brings you joy.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:54.580]   So now, after having found the joy from finding Jesus and worshipping him,
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.980]   the Magi finished with their visit with Jesus
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:16:58.980]   and they're getting ready to go home.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.380]   Actually, before that, they promised Herod that they would go and tell him
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:04.680]   where Jesus is,
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.380]   not knowing that Herod had been plotting to kill Jesus all along.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:11.080]   But God had other plans.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:16.280]   You see, this is how God leads us in some miraculous and amazing ways.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.080]   And God speaks to them in a dream.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.080]   Having been born in a dream not to go back to Herod,
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.080]   they return to the country by another route.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:32.180]   The word "born" the Bible uses here emphasizes it's a supernatural intervention.
[00:17:32.180 --> 00:17:34.680]   This dream from God was totally unexpected
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   and it's just like God to work that way in our lives sometimes.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.980]   Maybe you've already experienced this.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:42.080]   God changes the direction, guides you somewhere,
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.480]   shows you something that you've never even imagined or thought before,
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.180]   but you know it was God guiding you.
[00:17:49.180 --> 00:17:51.480]   This wise man did not anticipate this.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.280]   And Herod certainly did not anticipate that some dream would challenge
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   and make ruin his plans to kill Jesus.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.780]   But in this dream of warning,
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:07.280]   God demonstrates who is truly in control over all things.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:10.080]   Like Andrew said last week, God was in that place,
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:11.580]   but they didn't even know it.
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.680]   God was stepping down to meet them.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:20.180]   And the Magi's response, we see, was again in obedience.
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:23.680]   And they leave that place without going back to Herod.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:27.080]   God had used a star to guide them to Bethlehem.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.980]   And now He was using a dream to guide them back home.
[00:18:31.980 --> 00:18:34.580]   And the thing for us today is this, church.
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.980]   God wants to continue to guide you.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:41.480]   And of course, I know God can speak to you in a dream,
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:42.880]   but this isn't the norm.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:46.680]   Or should we expect God to speak to us in dreams all the time?
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:49.880]   Or else we'd be asleep all the time and we wouldn't get anything done, right?
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.280]   These dreams, and later we see wise men,
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:19:00.780]   the dreams of Magi and Joseph are seen to serve a particular purpose at a particular time.
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:04.780]   But God does continue to guide us in lots of different ways.
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:09.280]   One of the ways He does this, of course, is through our own intellect and common sense.
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:11.180]   God has given you a great mind.
[00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:14.180]   All of us, definitely all of us, He's given you a great mind.
[00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:15.580]   So use it.
[00:19:15.580 --> 00:19:17.680]   Think through things some of the times.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.780]   Use your mind and analyse.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:25.780]   God's given you this gift of mind to reason, to see what's right and what's wrong.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:30.680]   But sometimes that is difficult to do, which is why we can turn to others.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.980]   Community plays a huge part here.
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.880]   This is why it's essential to surround yourself, church, with Christ-minded community.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:43.180]   In times of uncertainty, we can go for them and ask for their advice.
[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:49.580]   We also have the fullness of God's Word, the Bible, to help us, to inspire us, to lead us.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:53.780]   When you seek direction, are you also studying God's Word diligently
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:20:02.080]   and seeking His will through the written Word of God, allowing Him to speak to you in that way?
[00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:06.080]   Of course, oftentimes also He speaks to us through our prayers.
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.780]   And this is why this period of praying and fasting,
[00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:15.180]   it could be such a significant time for your life and for the life of this church and this community.
[00:20:15.180 --> 00:20:20.480]   At the beginning of the year, fasting and praying can be one of the most critical ways
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:26.280]   God wants to speak to us, to lead us, to guide us.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:34.380]   But again, once He does speak, we have to be willing to respond in obedience.
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.180]   The wise men obeyed this dream instead of returning to Herod.
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:42.780]   Perhaps if they had gone back to Herod, they would have received blessings and gifts,
[00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:48.180]   but God told them to go in a different direction and that's what they decided to do.
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:52.380]   Even though Herod was the one in that person in that area with the authority,
[00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:59.680]   going against his request could have been tricky and might have had actually some bad consequences for them.
[00:20:59.680 --> 00:21:03.880]   Maybe this is the point you can relate to too, church.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:08.080]   Sometimes in life, have you ever felt like you're bound to certain paths,
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:15.080]   bound to certain directions and maybe even specific voices of authority that have spoken into your life?
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:20.080]   This might be even more prevalent for us in our Hong Kong Chinese context.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.280]   Traditionally, we follow what our elders say and that's what expected, right?
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.580]   Total obedience because anything else would be disrespectful to them.
[00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.280]   Now, please don't get me wrong. Hear me here, church.
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:38.780]   I'm not saying that every single voice of authority in your life is evil and wrong.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:45.380]   In fact, Scripture also reminds us of respecting our elders, of honoring, even obeying our father and our mother.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:51.180]   This is a big important thing we have to embrace in our relationship with Jesus too.
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:56.180]   However, at the same time, we are also to discern.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:02.780]   And when God gives us guidance and direction, He becomes our ultimate source of authority.
[00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:10.680]   One of the most critical reasons that connecting with Christian community in this time is that these decisions are often hard to make.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:15.780]   When God leads us in this way, it's always wise to check it with those around us.
[00:22:15.780 --> 00:22:18.880]   You will see with the wise men, it wasn't a wise man.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.980]   It was wise men. It wasn't just one single Magi.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.580]   It was a group of these people traveling together.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.280]   They would have discussed, they would have studied,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.480]   they would have had discussions about what we're doing, how we're doing in our following.
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:42.080]   But ultimately, when God speaks and offers us a different path, our reaction again is to be obedient and to follow.
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:48.280]   Joseph in this passage is another person that displays excellent obedience to God's guidance.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:53.680]   With Herod now furious and on a murderous rampage, Jesus's life is in danger.
[00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:57.480]   And so the angel of the Lord, it says, appeared to Joseph in a dream.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:02.080]   "Get up," he said, "take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:08.280]   Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for and kill him."
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.680]   Now, of course, this isn't the first time that Joseph has received a dream.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:14.780]   Early in Matthew, in Matthew chapter 1,
[00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.380]   Joseph is about to quietly divorce Mary when he finds out she's pregnant.
[00:23:19.380 --> 00:23:25.280]   But in a dream, God speaks to Joseph and says, "This child is from the Lord.
[00:23:25.280 --> 00:23:28.680]   And so don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife."
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:31.580]   And Joseph obeys.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:35.280]   This moment, Joseph is facing another critical decision.
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.580]   He has to act in order to save his son's life, to save Jesus's life.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.180]   And once again, he receives a dream.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:48.080]   This time, it's to take the child and flee in to Egypt.
[00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:53.280]   I think what Matthew is doing here is reminding us of another story.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.880]   Maybe think back with me for a bit as well.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:03.380]   When was there another time that God led people into Egypt in order to save their lives?
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.180]   Well, the last time this happened, it also involved a man named Joseph,
[00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.180]   who was also known as a dreamer.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:15.380]   Joseph had these grand dreams that his brothers and his father would bow down to him.
[00:24:15.380 --> 00:24:17.080]   And his dreams got him into trouble, right?
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.780]   To the point that his brothers sell him into slavery.
[00:24:21.780 --> 00:24:25.580]   But in his story, Joseph too stays obedient to God.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:30.380]   And God guides him and God uses him in most spectacular, amazing ways.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:36.880]   And Joseph rises up in power, eventually somehow becomes second in charge of the whole of Egypt,
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.180]   the most powerful nation in the world at that time.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:48.980]   And then God uses Joseph's interpretation of dreams to manage the whole region through a severe famine.
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:54.780]   You see, for this Joseph, his dreams were so much more than the fanciful thinking of a young boy.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:59.980]   The bigger picture was that God was using these dreams to help save people from certain death,
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.780]   from starvation during a famine.
[00:25:02.780 --> 00:25:06.080]   And it's the same thing for this Joseph happening right now.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.180]   On one level, God is speaking to Joseph to rescue Jesus from certain death.
[00:25:11.180 --> 00:25:15.180]   But Matthew also wants us to know there's a bigger picture happening here.
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.480]   Because Joseph listened to the direction of the dream, it was fulfilled, it said,
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.580]   what the Lord had said, that through the prophet, what the prophet had said,
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:27.980]   "Out of Egypt, I had called my son."
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.080]   Let me make this a little bit clear.
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:33.180]   My point is this, when God speaks to us in dreams,
[00:25:33.180 --> 00:25:37.380]   there is often a more significant purpose behind it.
[00:25:37.380 --> 00:25:39.080]   When God guides us and leads us,
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:44.880]   there's probably a more significant and direction behind what he's calling you to do.
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.780]   Of course, there's also always the personal element to when God guides us.
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.980]   After all, you're the one receiving the dreams, you're the one receiving God's direction.
[00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:57.580]   But normally we think of these things, especially dreams, as quite personal, right?
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:26:03.080]   And so we usually ask, what does this dream mean for me?
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.180]   But like I've been saying, most of the time when God speaks to us this way,
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.980]   there is a bigger purpose behind it.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.980]   Joseph's dream gave his family safety,
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:17.480]   but he was also fulfilling Scripture and prophecy by going to Egypt
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.680]   and returning once he was safe later.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.980]   He was declaring that this child, Jesus, was like the new Moses.
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:28.780]   Moses was the one who led the Israelites out of slavery in Egypt,
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:36.180]   but this new Moses will lift the whole of humanity out of sin and death once and for all.
[00:26:36.180 --> 00:26:38.880]   And it's the same for us today.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:42.880]   For the dreams and the directions and the guidance that God gives us today,
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:46.180]   when God gives us dreams and directions,
[00:26:46.180 --> 00:26:49.480]   we shouldn't just ask what this means for me,
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:53.380]   but we should also be asking what is God's most significant plan
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.780]   and purposes through these dreams.
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:01.680]   And when you acted obedient to these dreams and direction that God is giving to you,
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   these dreams are not only for your own flourishing,
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.680]   but the benefit for God's larger unfolding plan
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.180]   to bring His kingdom on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:17.380]   You have no idea how God might want to bless someone else,
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:19.580]   even someone you might not know,
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:23.680]   through your obedience of God's leading in your life.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:27.280]   Let me give you an example from my own story.
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.980]   Some years ago now, Brittany and I were doing some outreach in Tsim Sha Tsui.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:36.280]   This was the Christmas outreach and we were partnering with sons and daughters that year.
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:40.380]   And so, you know, there came time for us to gather back again and we'd done outreach.
[00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.180]   We met a few people.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:45.280]   But as we were going back, we felt God's very strongly say,
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.680]   "Okay, hey guys, just walk down Ashley Road one more time.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.180]   Walk down Ashley Road one more time."
[00:27:52.180 --> 00:27:53.280]   And so we did.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:57.180]   We started walking down Ashley Road and that's when, out of the blue,
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:28:00.080]   we met a lady named Lisa.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:04.680]   Lisa was an asylum seeker who had come to Hong Kong from a West African nation
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.580]   and she had been trafficked to Hong Kong and trying to make ends meet,
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:11.580]   repaying a lot of debt, you know, all that kind of terrible things
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:14.980]   that many of our asylum seekers wrestle with in this city,
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.080]   which meant that she couldn't make ends meet.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   And so she was out on the streets actually resorting to sex work.
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:26.180]   And so we bumped into her and we invited her to the Christmas party that was happening the next day.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.380]   We dropped off a small gift.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:30.680]   We gave her an invitation saying, "Come to this location tomorrow.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.380]   There'll be a party for you."
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:34.680]   We didn't know whether she was going to show up.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:38.080]   But surely the next day came, she came to the party.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.380]   And after the party, she kept coming back.
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:42.080]   She stayed connected.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:46.880]   And over time, she learned new skills, how to bake, how to sew, how to do different things.
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:52.180]   And with the support of a new community and a lot of grace and love from Jesus,
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.480]   she never had to resort back to sex work again.
[00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:58.280]   And in fact, with these new skills she learned,
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.680]   she was able to go back to her home country,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.180]   first of all, she opened a bakery.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:06.180]   And the last we heard from her, she had opened a school.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:12.080]   And that had always been her dream, to open a school to teach the children in her village, in her area.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.180]   This was something she had dreamed of doing.
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.280]   You see what's happening, church?
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:20.580]   That day, we weren't just going to do an outreach just to fulfill,
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.380]   "Oh yeah, we tick that box for this Christmas."
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:29.380]   We were there for a bigger purpose, to connect with Lisa and what God had put onto her heart.
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.280]   Joseph wasn't just escaping from her evil ruler.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:37.780]   He was fulfilling the God's word, making prophecy come to life.
[00:29:37.780 --> 00:29:41.280]   And your dreams are the same, brothers and sisters.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:46.180]   The dream that God has given to you, there's a greater purpose behind that.
[00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:50.580]   But for you to see that happen, for you to see it come into fruition,
[00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:56.080]   you must be obedient to what God has asked you to do.
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:00.080]   So Joseph and his family, going back to the story now, and now in Egypt.
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.580]   They stay until Herod has died and the danger was over.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.280]   And we see God continuing to guide them.
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:08.480]   Once again, an angel appears in the dream and says,
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.680]   "Get up, take the child and his mother, go to the land of Israel.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.780]   For those who are trying to take the child life are dead."
[00:30:15.780 --> 00:30:20.580]   So he got up, took the child and his mother, and went back to the land of Israel.
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.780]   But when he heard Achelaus was reigning in Judea, in the place of his father Herod,
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:26.380]   he was afraid to go there.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:31.380]   And having again been warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district in Galilee.
[00:30:31.380 --> 00:30:34.080]   He went and lived in a town called Nazareth.
[00:30:34.080 --> 00:30:40.880]   So was fulfilled what had said to the prophets that he would be called a Nazarene.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.780]   God's continued guidance is evident in this passage.
[00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:48.580]   And this is the final thing I want us to grasp out of this today.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.680]   As God leads us, He doesn't just lead us to particular places,
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.180]   to a particular point and says, "Okay, oh well, I'm just going to leave you here.
[00:30:56.180 --> 00:30:58.780]   You figure it out from now on."
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:01.680]   God never leaves anything undone.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:04.480]   You know, in this story, as we read, it's just a few sentences.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:07.580]   In reality, there was a period of time, probably about a year,
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:14.280]   that Joseph and Jesus and Mary stayed in Egypt before going back home again.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:18.680]   But if we continue to trust in God, if we continue to guide us,
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.380]   He will fulfill His purposes.
[00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:24.680]   God never leaves anything halfway done.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:28.680]   Our purpose, our job is to keep listening, to keep obeying.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:33.880]   And this is a reminder for us, church, that obedience isn't just a one-time decision,
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:41.280]   but rather has to be a process or even better, a lifestyle of how we choose to live.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:45.080]   Living a life of obedience becomes essential.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:48.280]   We see this in the way Jesus lived his life.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.980]   We see that as Jesus was a young boy, He goes missing in this one story, right?
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:55.480]   But when His parents find Him, He says, "Why were you so worried?
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:31:59.080]   Didn't you know that I had to be in my Father's house?
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.680]   Didn't you know that I had to be listening to what my Father was saying to me?"
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:08.180]   In Jesus' ministry, every time He's challenged by leaders for healing people on the Sabbath
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:12.880]   or for doing something that supposedly broke the rules, His response is this.
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.180]   "Very truly, I tell you, I can do nothing by myself.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.880]   The Son can do nothing by Himself.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:27.280]   He can only do what He sees His Father doing, because whatever the Father does, the Son does also."
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.480]   And so as I was looking at this passage, the most fantastic thing, church,
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:34.880]   ultimately, the most mind-blowing thing to me was this,
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   that it's through living obedient lives that God fulfills His purpose on this earth,
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.580]   that God defeats evil.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.980]   We see this happening right here in this story.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:50.580]   Every man-made plan to harm Jesus throughout His life was thwarted
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:55.980]   because people acted in obedience to what God was telling them.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:32:58.680]   We see this happening at the end of Jesus' life.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:05.080]   Jesus was obedient even to death on the cross, Philippians 2.8.
[00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:09.880]   And it was on the cross, it was on that cross that Jesus gave up His life
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:17.380]   and finally defeated sin and death for us once and for all.
[00:33:17.380 --> 00:33:23.180]   Obedience, therefore, is key to us seeing God's work in this world.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:26.380]   We have all these dreams, we have all these hopes for our lives,
[00:33:26.380 --> 00:33:29.880]   for our families, for our church, for Hong Kong, for this world,
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:34.680]   and we want God, we pray for God to come and lead us and to guide us.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:37.180]   But if we really want to see God move,
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.580]   if we truly want to see injustice removed,
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.380]   if we truly want to see good triumph over evil,
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:52.580]   we must remain obedient to go, to do, and say as God has called us to do.
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.580]   And it's a challenge.
[00:33:54.580 --> 00:33:56.780]   It's not going to come easy.
[00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.380]   Continued obedience, making it a lifestyle,
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:03.280]   is one of those things we have to encourage each other in.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:06.980]   But if I could say just one thing that has helped me in this journey,
[00:34:06.980 --> 00:34:13.780]   one of the key things I try to remember as I stay close to God is confession.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.080]   By regularly coming before God,
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:20.980]   by acknowledging, yes, often we fall short of what He has us to do,
[00:34:20.980 --> 00:34:26.380]   by confessing my sin to Him, I am also declaring my need for Him.
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:28.680]   And each and every time God meets me where He is
[00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:32.080]   and covers me with His love and His forgiveness,
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.280]   and once again, I feel His closeness to me
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:41.480]   and I'm able to follow and do as He's called me to do.
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:47.880]   And we realize how beautiful it is to be close, to obey, to follow Jesus.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.680]   So church, as we're still at the beginning of 2022,
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:58.580]   as we step into this new year, yes, God wants to continue to guide us.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:02.180]   And I pray that God will give you these amazing dreams.
[00:35:02.180 --> 00:35:09.180]   I pray that He speaks to you, inspires you in the most surprising type of ways.
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:13.680]   But however God tries to speak to you, however God tries to guide you,
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:19.280]   my prayer, our prayer is that our posture will be one of obedience.
[00:35:19.280 --> 00:35:25.380]   Like the Magi, like Joseph, like many others we've seen in Scripture throughout history,
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:29.580]   may we always be ready to follow as God leads us.
[00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.980]   Pray with me, church.
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:41.780]   So Jesus, I thank you, Lord, that you never leave us lost or abandoned,
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.580]   that you are the true King, you are the good Shepherd,
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:48.680]   and you will even go out of your way to come find us when we're lost,
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:52.780]   to bring us close to you.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:58.180]   And so Father, speak to our hearts, speak to our minds this morning.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:04.480]   Transform us into people who are obedient to following you.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:10.080]   Show us the real joy there is when we give everything, when we surrender all before you,
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:16.180]   and when we truly are in step with your will and your purpose in our lives.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:18.880]   It's not always going to be easy, we know, Lord,
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:21.580]   but we know that is exactly where you want us to be.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:23.780]   That is exactly where you want your church to be.
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:30.780]   For this is exactly how you use your people to make known your love,
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:36.080]   to bring justice, to bring peace, to bring light, to bring love into this world.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:44.980]   So Father, lead us, guide us, shape our hearts to follow you and you alone, Lord.
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.980]   We thank you for your love for us.
