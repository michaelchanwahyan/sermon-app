1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
 I want to be just open your hands before the Lord now.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,040
 As we were worshipping,

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:08,320
 I saw a picture of a massive ball of string.

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,520
 And this ball of string was filled with all these knots.

5
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:14,320
 And there was somebody who was trying desperately

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,960
 to untie all the knots in this massive ball of string.

7
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,320
 And it was super stressful for that person.

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,240
 We've just been singing a song about release and freedom.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,000
 Been singing a song about how there's power

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
 in the name of Jesus.

11
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,960
 How that He is our living hope.

12
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:34,760
 And one of the great strongholds over the city of Hong Kong

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,500
 is the stronghold of anxiety.

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:41,040
 And I want to just take a moment to speak into anxiety.

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,040
 And if that is something that is impacting you

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,600
 in this season of your life,

17
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,400
 we want to just do a little bit of work

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,220
 with the Holy Spirit right now in that place.

19
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:51,720
 So whilst every eye is closed,

20
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,360
 I want you just to take a moment.

21
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,760
 And if anxiety is something that's a reality for you,

22
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,440
 whether it's something that you struggled with in the past

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,800
 or something that you're struggling with right now,

24
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,720
 and if you're online right now, this is for you too,

25
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,240
 just for you to close your eyes as well in this moment.

26
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,880
 I want to invite anybody here

27
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,960
 that recognises the stronghold of anxiety.

28
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:17,440
 When anxiety is at work in us, it's like a darkness.

29
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:20,720
 There's like this sense of wanting to flee.

30
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,840
 We're uncomfortable, we're overwhelmed.

31
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,000
 If you're experiencing those emotions recently,

32
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,160
 I want you just to open your hands where you are right now.

33
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,120
 By opening your hands, it's just a simple gesture

34
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:36,440
 before the Holy Spirit to say, that's somewhat of my life.

35
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:40,040
 I recognise anxiety is an issue for me in this moment.

36
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,160
 Father, when we think about that ball of string,

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,120
 we can't do anything.

38
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,600
 And that panic rises in us

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,920
 as we try to unravel the ball of string.

40
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,840
 And our anxiety sits in us

41
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,760
 when we try to sort out our problems

42
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:56,720
 and we try to get ourselves on top of everything.

43
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,400
 That just creates more anxiety in us.

44
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,760
 But Lord, we've just sung a song

45
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,320
 which declares that You are not in the grave.

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,960
 We've just sung a song that declares

47
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,600
 that You were raised again,

48
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,680
 that You come back for Your church,

49
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:12,920
 that You fight battles for us, that You're the Lion.

50
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,160
 And so Lord, I want to pray over anybody in this room

51
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,800
 or online right now whose hands are open.

52
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,440
 Father, I want to pray for a releasing

53
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,080
 by Your grace and Your mercy

54
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,960
 of the power of the Holy Spirit.

55
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:28,080
 Lord, we take anxiety and the stronghold

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,480
 that the enemy has over anxiety and fear in Hong Kong,

57
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,200
 and we take it captive in the Name of Jesus.

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,040
 Not in our strength, not in our power,

59
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,600
 but in the power that comes from the Name of Jesus.

60
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,360
 Some trust in horses, some trust in chariots,

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,720
 but we will trust in the Name of the Lord.

62
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,880
 And it is Jesus and Jesus alone that can free you.

63
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,440
 So Lord, I pray for every person with their hands open.

64
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,640
 I pray for the releasing of grace and peace

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,360
 and liberty and joy and love.

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,760
 I want to pray for the opposite,

67
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,080
 outworking of anxiety in the Name of Jesus.

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,880
 I want to pray, Lord, for faith to rise

69
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:07,800
 in the households that are overcome with anxiety.

70
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,680
 I want to pray for workplaces to be released

71
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,720
 from unnecessary stress in the Name of Jesus.

72
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,920
 I want to pray for the manipulation that takes place

73
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,440
 through the use of stress in the workplace.

74
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,780
 And Lord, I want to pray for shalom,

75
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,200
 the true peace that comes in knowing Christ Jesus,

76
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,240
 a peace that comes in knowing the presence of God

77
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,600
 in the midst of fear, the presence of God

78
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,080
 in the midst of our battle with anxiety.

79
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,760
 Father, You and You alone can unravel the ball of strength.

80
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,160
 And Father, I thank You for the liberty that is found,

81
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,440
 the freedom that is found in You.

82
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,680
 What a joy it is to gather together online

83
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,780
 in this room each week.

84
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:55,540
 May we never take it for granted the power that there is

85
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,100
 in the community of Christ, singing the praises of Jesus.

86
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,300
 Your Word says that You inhabit the praises.

87
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:05,820
 So thank You, Lord, for inhabiting every moment right now.

88
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:10,220
 Thank You that You inhabit and dwell in every life right now.

89
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:14,540
 And we pray for the testimony of freedom from anxiety

90
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:18,820
 in the Vine Church and in our city, in Jesus' Name.

91
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,740
 Everyone says, amen.

92
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,580
 Amen.

93
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,580
 Let's give the worship team a round of applause.

94
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,100
 I got one thing for you before you sit down.

95
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,060
 One thing, one thing, one thing.

96
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,820
 The person standing next to you right now

97
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,940
 is a unique, loved, beautiful creation of Jesus Christ.

98
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:39,140
 Would you go and turn to them and say hi,

99
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,980
 and say, wow, you are unique.

100
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,220
 You are amazing.

101
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,180
 I love you.

102
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,220
 You're awesome.

103
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,700
 Never seen you before.

104
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,540
 Wonderful.

105
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:48,400
 You can have a seat as well.

106
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,580
 Ah.

107
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,300
 Ah, there's no place I'd rather be

108
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,380
 than 11 a.m. on a Sunday with my people.

109
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,620
 Is everybody well?

110
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,460
 - Yes.

111
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,740
 - So good to see you guys.

112
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:03,380
 Welcome to everybody online once again.

113
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:05,060
 It's so great to have you joining us

114
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,100
 from across Hong Kong and across the world.

115
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,380
 It is such a privilege to gather in this season

116
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:13,100
 to worship Jesus together, and welcome to the Vine.

117
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,660
 If this is your first time, we're so glad that you're here.

118
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:16,740
 My name's Andrew.

119
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:18,120
 I'm one of the pastors here,

120
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,580
 and it's just great that we get to gather.

121
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,620
 If you are new, we just want to recognize you.

122
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,100
 We're not gonna ask you to do anything that's embarrassing.

123
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,940
 We just wanna ask you to put your hand in the air

124
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:27,780
 and wave it at me.

125
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,780
 That's just like say, hey, I'm new.

126
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,140
 This is my first time to the Vine.

127
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:32,300
 Anyone new here in the lower house, upper house?

128
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,420
 Give us a wave.

129
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,780
 Anyone?

130
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,620
 Yes.

131
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,520
 Yes.

132
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,740
 I didn't see any hands.

133
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:44,880
 Surely, surely somebody's new.

134
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,940
 Now you're like, you're like,

135
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,340
 you're like sinking down in your seat.

136
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,540
 It's like, oh my gosh.

137
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,420
 Well, anyway, welcome if you are new.

138
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:51,860
 We're glad you're here.

139
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,620
 We have three services on a Sunday, 9, 15, 11, and 2.

140
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:58,300
 And the Vine is way more than just 90 minutes on a Sunday.

141
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:01,140
 As amazing as this is, and I love it,

142
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,700
 it's not the totality of what church is about.

143
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,260
 Really, what church is about is community.

144
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:08,140
 And we experience something of that community

145
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,100
 when we gather like this,

146
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:11,940
 but actually community happens much more

147
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,320
 when you are known and are known by others

148
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,860
 and when you get to know others.

149
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:17,960
 And that takes place in a variety of different ways

150
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,580
 at the Vine, through small group communities

151
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,540
 and all of those sort of things that we do.

152
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,740
 So if you're new, after the service,

153
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,480
 we don't have our usual Connect Hub today

154
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,180
 because today's a special Sunday.

155
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,860
 And I'll tell you a bit more about that in a moment.

156
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:29,700
 But you can come and connect

157
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:32,320
 with any of our prayer ministers, any of our pastors,

158
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,380
 or you can come downstairs to the concierge downstairs

159
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:36,940
 and say hi to us, get connected.

160
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,580
 We'd love to welcome you to the Vine and walk with you.

161
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,620
 And we don't want you to be anonymous.

162
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,820
 And if you're online and this is your first time with us,

163
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,940
 welcome as well.

164
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,940
 We're so glad that you're here.

165
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,660
 We don't want you to be anonymous online.

166
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:51,300
 And we know that that's a very easy thing to do online.

167
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,180
 So be brave, put in the chat box,

168
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,900
 hey, I'm new, this is my name,

169
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,980
 this is where I'm tuning in.

170
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,780
 And our team that are online right now,

171
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,800
 we have a team of pastors

172
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,160
 that are specifically online with you.

173
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,180
 We want them to connect with you.

174
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,560
 So just jump on the chat box, say hi to us.

175
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,900
 We'll say hi back.

176
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:10,260
 We'll connect with you and we'd love to meet you as well.

177
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,180
 We are on a special Sunday today.

178
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,180
 This is Branches of Hope Sunday.

179
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,580
 We do this once a year.

180
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,860
 It's a chance for you to find out a little bit more

181
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,260
 about the work that we do

182
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:23,260
 for the most vulnerable and hurting in our society.

183
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,580
 If you've been coming to the Vine for any period of time,

184
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,660
 hopefully you'll know that we believe

185
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,460
 that God's heart for justice

186
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:32,060
 sits at the very centre of the gospel,

187
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,340
 that we're called to walk in justice,

188
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,920
 God's justice on earth as it is in heaven.

189
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:39,260
 And we do that throughout our ministries.

190
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,780
 And most importantly,

191
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,140
 we do that through the work of Branches of Hope.

192
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,420
 If you're new to our church,

193
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:46,740
 Branches of Hope is an NGO

194
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,940
 that was birthed from the Vine Church.

195
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,100
 It sits separately as an NGO,

196
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:54,540
 but in relationship with the Vine.

197
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,920
 And it's really the justice expression

198
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,120
 of who we are as a church.

199
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,780
 And we serve two groups,

200
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:04,040
 largely within the work of Branches of Hope,

201
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,820
 two marginalised groups in Hong Kong.

202
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,120
 That's asylum seekers and refugees,

203
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,920
 and those that are either victims

204
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,480
 or survivors of human trafficking.

205
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,160
 And it's our great privilege to serve those two communities.

206
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:17,160
 And we wanna tell you a little bit more about that.

207
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,680
 You're gonna be hearing their voices.

208
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,320
 Now, as well as today,

209
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,080
 we are also celebrating what we're calling

210
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,800
 Branches of Hope Awareness Month, or BOHAM for short.

211
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,440
 And BOHAM runs from World Refugee Day,

212
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,240
 which is on the 20th of June,

213
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,280
 all the way up to World Day Against the Trafficking

214
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:36,140
 of People, it's a bit of a mouthful,

215
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,240
 that is on July 30th.

216
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,880
 And in that time, we celebrate BOHAM.

217
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,680
 And we do that by stuff that we do here in the services,

218
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,020
 but also importantly, stuff we do in the community,

219
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:48,020
 in society around Hong Kong.

220
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,080
 Let me tell you about one of those things that's coming up.

221
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,160
 Starting next week on the 9th of July,

222
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,620
 and running to the 22nd of July,

223
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:58,760
 is an exhibition of photographs of the clients

224
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,760
 that we serve in Branches of Hope.

225
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,720
 It's a incredible exhibition of photographs,

226
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,820
 and it's gonna be shown at Orca Restaurant.

227
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,580
 Orca Restaurant is on Wyndham Street in Central.

228
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,820
 It's run by two incredible people

229
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,580
 that are part of the Vine Church,

230
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:18,460
 and they very graciously are willing to host the exhibition.

231
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:21,580
 So it'll be on their walls during that period.

232
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,620
 I wanna encourage you, go along to the restaurant,

233
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:26,160
 have a great lunch or a great dinner,

234
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,660
 check out the exhibition,

235
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,300
 and a portion of your food that night

236
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,260
 will be donated to the work of Branches of Hope.

237
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,400
 So that's a wonderful thing.

238
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,940
 That's happening from the 7th,

239
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:37,580
 sorry, from the 9th to the 22nd of July.

240
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,900
 We wanna really encourage you to check that out.

241
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,660
 Also, right after this service,

242
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,500
 we have a booth just outside here on the second floor.

243
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,420
 If you're in the upper house after the service,

244
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,660
 come down the stairs and you'll be on the second floor.

245
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,620
 If you're here in the lower house,

246
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,740
 just straight out the doors.

247
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,140
 There's a Branches of Hope booth

248
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,340
 that is going to be out there after the service.

249
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,780
 Branches of Hope team will be there.

250
00:09:57,780 --> 00:10:00,020
 They'd love to connect with you, get to know you,

251
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,420
 tell you a little bit more about the work they do.

252
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,080
 And so we wanna encourage you to do that.

253
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:07,860
 Today is all about you hearing the voices

254
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,400
 of those that are surviving

255
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,240
 some of the toughest conditions in Hong Kong.

256
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,600
 And that's one way to know a little bit more

257
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,000
 about those voices by engaging with our team afterwards.

258
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,340
 Well, every week you guys have been incredibly generous

259
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,960
 standing with us with your offering and your tithes

260
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,840
 and the support work that you do.

261
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,280
 And every time that you tithe into the divine church,

262
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,800
 we then tithe outwardly as well.

263
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,900
 We support organisations like Branches of Hope

264
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,380
 and many others in our cities and also around the world

265
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,580
 in the missions effort and justice effort that we do.

266
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,260
 And I am just so grateful for each one of you

267
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,580
 for the way that you stood with us in such difficult times.

268
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,620
 We're doing digital offering at this time.

269
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,700
 The QR codes are behind me or online in this moment

270
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,340
 so that you can actually give digitally.

271
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,540
 Or if you're here in the room,

272
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,600
 also there's an envelope on your chair.

273
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,620
 If you wanna give cash, credit card, check,

274
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:00,880
 however you might wanna do that,

275
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,740
 you can just fill out the envelope

276
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,340
 and drop that in the bucket on the way out of the service.

277
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,180
 Let me pray for us as we do our time of offering today.

278
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:12,300
 Lord, we're grateful that we get to stand

279
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,160
 in this place of doing an offering.

280
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,780
 That Lord, we recognise in doing so,

281
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,720
 it's a prophetic way for us to say

282
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,380
 that our material things do not control us.

283
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:23,340
 They don't define us.

284
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,240
 We give out of this gratitude that we recognise

285
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,820
 everything comes from you and we're stewards of it.

286
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:31,380
 And so we give cheerfully, open-handedly,

287
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:33,480
 knowing that you'll continue to provide for us

288
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,060
 as we continue to provide for others.

289
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,260
 Lord, we pray that you would take

290
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,180
 whatever is given to this church

291
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,580
 and that we would be generous outwardly as well,

292
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:44,780
 releasing your funds to those that need it the most.

293
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:46,580
 And we thank you for this cycle of giving

294
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,900
 that is seen in the kingdom of God.

295
00:11:47,900 --> 00:11:49,580
 What a beautiful thing it is.

296
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,560
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

297
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,900
 Everyone says, amen.

298
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:56,000
 Well, today what's really important for us

299
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,060
 is that you hear the stories

300
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,140
 of some of the people that are struggling

301
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:03,060
 and are on the margins of Hong Kong society,

302
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,100
 but you hear it directly from them.

303
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,140
 You hear their stories.

304
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,560
 And so there's a number of ways

305
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,900
 that we're gonna be doing that for you

306
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,340
 throughout our service today.

307
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,100
 But one of those ways is through film.

308
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,820
 So I wonder if you just turn your attention

309
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,980
 to the screens now.

310
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:19,220
 And I wanna introduce you to two of the clients

311
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:23,020
 that we serve in Branches of Hope, Namala and Maggie.

312
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,600
 (gentle music)

313
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:36,860
 - I had a good job back home.

314
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:40,900
 I have a hardworking husband and three amazing kids.

315
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,740
 But after an accident that left my husband disabled,

316
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,100
 I became the sole breadwinner of our family.

317
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,260
 The pressure was on me.

318
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,820
 I made the hard decision to leave home

319
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,380
 and I came to Hong Kong to work as a domestic worker

320
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,860
 in hope for a better future for my family.

321
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:03,980
 I am a single mother and have a strong passion

322
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,820
 to care for my children.

323
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,700
 When I was in my home country,

324
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,900
 I was abused and threatened by my family and close relatives.

325
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,580
 I tried to run away, but they have linkage with the police

326
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,140
 and would be able to trace me down.

327
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:20,540
 I was rejected from the community and had no place to stay.

328
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,020
 I decided to come to Hong Kong to find a stable

329
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,780
 and peaceful life.

330
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,980
 Later, I became pregnant.

331
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,700
 I am not able to return to my home country

332
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,380
 because if I return, I will face the same abuse

333
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,780
 from relatives who are still threatening me now.

334
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:40,340
 I arrived in Hong Kong in 2018

335
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:43,620
 after securing employment with the local family.

336
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:47,700
 In my first few days, my employee was friendly and kind.

337
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,500
 Unfortunately, her facade quickly faded

338
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,300
 and I realized she was abusive

339
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,300
 and I was being exploited for work.

340
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:59,340
 After a year and a half, I couldn't take it anymore

341
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,100
 and finally escaped.

342
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,300
 Being alone in the streets, I was scared.

343
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,780
 I didn't know where I was going to stay,

344
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,860
 get food or the medical help I needed,

345
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,260
 let alone find ways to support my family

346
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,620
 who was depending on me.

347
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,820
 I became a non-refoulement claimant in Hong Kong.

348
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:21,500
 When I became pregnant, I faced rejection.

349
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:23,820
 My relatives in my home country found out

350
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,380
 and sent threatening messages to me.

351
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:28,860
 My friends abandoned and insulted me.

352
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:31,060
 I want to fight for my daughter's status,

353
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:33,940
 but since I am unable to work, I felt helpless

354
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:37,140
 and I did not know if anybody would help me and my baby.

355
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:44,740
 - Those are not easy stories to listen to, are they?

356
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,260
 And I'd like to tell you that those two stories

357
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,900
 are unique to those two individuals,

358
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,940
 but that wouldn't be the case.

359
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:52,740
 There are many in our city that have similar stories

360
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:55,900
 of abuse, abandonment, rejection,

361
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,620
 and difficulty in Hong Kong society.

362
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:01,740
 You know, it's important for us to make space in our lives

363
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,540
 to listen to the voices of those who are on the margins.

364
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,740
 It's all too easy for us to insulate

365
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,620
 and isolate ourselves from those voices.

366
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,860
 But when we do hear those voices,

367
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:15,220
 yes, it's hard to hear the stories.

368
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,740
 Yes, it might stir emotions in us,

369
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,820
 but ultimately it is a way of honouring them

370
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:24,780
 as people who are made in the image of God.

371
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,020
 And what we want to do today

372
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,900
 is we want to create space for you

373
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,660
 to be able to hear the stories

374
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,780
 of those who are vulnerable in Hong Kong.

375
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,500
 That's why the theme that we have

376
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,180
 for Branches of Hope Sunday this year

377
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,260
 is our voices, our stories.

378
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,980
 And while you're going to hear a little bit from me now,

379
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,020
 and then you're going to hear a little bit

380
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,460
 from some of the staff at Branches of Hope,

381
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,060
 ultimately what we hope and pray you'll hear today

382
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,940
 is the voices of people like Namala and Maggie

383
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,220
 sharing their story so that you might be changed.

384
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,780
 And what we pray you hear when you listen to their stories

385
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:59,460
 is yes, we hear their challenges, hear their suffering,

386
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,380
 hear what it is that they're going through,

387
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,100
 but ultimately you would hear something else,

388
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:08,260
 that you would actually hear their unwavering hope

389
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:10,060
 that they have in Jesus Christ.

390
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,780
 This idea of listening to the stories of the vulnerable

391
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:16,180
 and the broken amongst us is important

392
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,300
 to the work of Branches of Hope and of the Vine

393
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,980
 because it is essentially first and foremost,

394
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,780
 the work of God.

395
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:27,420
 God listens to those who are broken and on the margins.

396
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,580
 And there are many examples in scripture

397
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:32,540
 of God reaching out and listening to the voices

398
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,580
 of those who are desperate.

399
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,900
 But today I wanted to take us

400
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,980
 to one particular passage in scripture

401
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:40,860
 to help frame everything that we wanna talk about today.

402
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,900
 It's the passage found in Genesis 19 to 21,

403
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:47,940
 and it's the story of two individuals, Ishmael and Hagar.

404
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,580
 And let me give you just a little bit of context

405
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,340
 before I open the passage.

406
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:54,060
 Hagar is an Egyptian slave

407
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,660
 who is working in the home of Abraham and Sarah.

408
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,500
 Now, Sarah, at this point in the story

409
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,380
 is incredibly frustrated and bitter at God.

410
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:04,660
 And she's frustrated at God

411
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,180
 because she believes that God is to blame

412
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,140
 for the fact that her and Abraham are barren.

413
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:12,460
 Some years before, God had come to Abraham

414
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,300
 and said to Abraham,

415
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,540
 "You're gonna be a father of many nations."

416
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,500
 But many years later, Abraham and Sarah

417
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,980
 are still not able to have their own children.

418
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:22,500
 And Sarah blames God for this reality.

419
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,700
 She knows that God has given a promise,

420
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,540
 but she hasn't seen God come through on that promise.

421
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,140
 So Sarah does what perhaps many of us might do

422
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,220
 in that circumstance, believe the promise,

423
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,100
 but then bring it and put it into our own hands.

424
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
 She decides her own human effort

425
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,980
 can bring about the promises of God.

426
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:43,260
 And trust me, that's always a dangerous thing to think.

427
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,580
 But what Sarah does is she comes up with a plan.

428
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,420
 She says to Abraham,

429
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:51,380
 "Hey, Abraham, why don't you take Hagar to be your wife?"

430
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,740
 In those days, it was legal to marry more than one woman.

431
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,900
 She says, "Take Hagar to be your wife.

432
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,660
 You can then sleep together, produce a child,

433
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:04,300
 and then that child will be our heir and the promise of God."

434
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,980
 Well, the story tells us that that's what happened.

435
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,220
 And Hagar had no choice in this matter.

436
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:13,140
 Not only is she a slave being forced to work in their home,

437
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,060
 she's now forced into the slavery of marriage

438
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:18,180
 with someone she doesn't love.

439
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,500
 Abraham and Hagar sleep together and produce a child.

440
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,540
 And when that child comes forth into the world,

441
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:26,540
 God speaks to Hagar over her son.

442
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:27,480
 And he says to Hagar,

443
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,580
 "I want you to name your son a specific name.

444
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,300
 You are to give him the name Ishmael."

445
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,740
 Ishmael in Hebrew means God hears.

446
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,380
 I want you just to stop with that for a second

447
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,340
 and remember that.

448
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,900
 Ishmael means God hears.

449
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,140
 And that will become the main story

450
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,660
 of the whole of Ishmael's life.

451
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:50,220
 Well, not surprisingly,

452
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:56,140
 Sarah finds herself jealous and bitter at Hagar and Abraham

453
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,620
 for the fact that they have this child

454
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,260
 in their life called Ishmael.

455
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:01,380
 And her plan that she thought was a good one

456
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,980
 turned out to be incredibly painful and bitter for her.

457
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,100
 So she comes with a new plan to Abraham.

458
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,940
 And she says to Abraham,

459
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,460
 "I want you to get rid of Hagar and Ishmael.

460
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,860
 I want you to send them out,

461
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,860
 banish them from the Israel nation,

462
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:16,020
 send them out into the deserts of Beersheba."

463
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,820
 Well, this greatly distressed Abraham

464
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,820
 because the scriptures tell us

465
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,500
 that Abraham loved his son, Ishmael, genuinely loved him.

466
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:27,260
 And it tore him apart that he would have to send Ishmael away.

467
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,300
 But God shows up to Abraham and says,

468
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,620
 "Hey, Abraham, just relax

469
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,020
 'cause my hand is upon Ishmael's life

470
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,140
 and I will protect him.

471
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,460
 I will look after him.

472
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,220
 And he will actually become the father of many nations.

473
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,700
 A great nation will come from him."

474
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:45,020
 So Abraham, off the back of his obedience to God,

475
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:46,940
 even though he didn't wanna do it,

476
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,580
 puts supplies together

477
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:52,220
 and begins to send Hagar and Ishmael on their way.

478
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:54,420
 Let's pick up the story from that very point.

479
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:57,380
 This is Genesis 21, starting in verse 14.

480
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,580
 "Early the next morning, Abraham took some food

481
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:03,620
 and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar.

482
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,980
 He set them on her shoulders

483
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,060
 and then sent her off with the boy.

484
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,420
 She went on her way and wandered in the desert of Beersheba.

485
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,140
 When the water in the skin was gone,

486
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:14,660
 she put the boy under one of the bushes.

487
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,940
 Then she went off and sat down nearby,

488
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:19,700
 about a bow shot away, for she thought to herself,

489
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:23,540
 'I cannot watch the boy die.'

490
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:27,300
 And as she sat there nearby, she began to sob."

491
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,660
 What an incredibly disastrous situation this is for Hagar.

492
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:33,780
 I mean, that's putting it mildly.

493
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,460
 Not only has she been enslaved,

494
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,420
 not only has she been forced into marriage,

495
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,680
 but now she's been sent out and banished from a community.

496
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,220
 She's sent out with minimal supplies

497
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,820
 and not surprisingly, those supplies ran out.

498
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,720
 And she realizes that she cannot,

499
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,580
 because she loves her child so much,

500
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:52,060
 she cannot bear the suffering of watching him die,

501
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,300
 of hearing him cry out.

502
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:57,740
 And so she places her son under a bush

503
00:20:57,740 --> 00:21:01,300
 and she goes about, the scriptures say, a bow shot away.

504
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,860
 A bow shot away is about 100 to 150 yards away.

505
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,500
 She's not so far away

506
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,880
 that she feels like she's abandoned her son,

507
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,620
 but she's far enough away that she cannot hear his cries.

508
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:14,240
 That's really important.

509
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,540
 She's far enough away

510
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,140
 so that she can't hear the sobbing of her child,

511
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,580
 so that doesn't bring distress upon her.

512
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,060
 And then as she's sitting this bow shot away,

513
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,020
 the scriptures say she does something.

514
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,220
 In the English translation,

515
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,580
 the English translation is not very good.

516
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:30,260
 The English translation says she sobbed.

517
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,880
 Sobbing for us sounds like.

518
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,200
 In the Hebrew, the word means to wail.

519
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,180
 It means to cry out.

520
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,980
 It means to scream.

521
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:43,900
 It's the same word that's translated gnashing of teeth

522
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,460
 in other parts of scripture.

523
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,020
 It's the word that's used to describe old Israelites

524
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:50,180
 as they mourned in the Old Testament,

525
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:54,380
 as they screamed and made noises before the Lord.

526
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,820
 The idea of this Hebrew word

527
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,300
 was actually to scream out against injustice.

528
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,300
 So the picture here is of Hagar,

529
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:04,180
 a bow shot away from the cries of her son,

530
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:05,940
 so she can't hear those cries,

531
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,300
 and she's making an awful noise before the Lord.

532
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,660
 She's screaming out.

533
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,820
 She's probably saying stuff like,

534
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,340
 "Why is this happening to me?

535
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,620
 Why has my whole life been like this?

536
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:17,900
 Why have you taken my only son from me?

537
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,620
 Why are we gonna die in this desert?"

538
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,060
 And she's screaming and wailing and crying

539
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:26,900
 and making the loudest noise she could ever make.

540
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,340
 And the question is, does God hear and respond?

541
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:34,340
 Have a look at verse 17.

542
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:37,060
 "God heard the boy crying,

543
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,220
 and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven

544
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,700
 and said to her, 'What is the matter, Hagar?

545
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,460
 Do not be afraid.

546
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,780
 Don't be anxious.

547
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,340
 Let's unravel the ball of string.'

548
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:50,900
 For God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.

549
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,740
 Lift the boy up and take him by the hand,

550
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,700
 for I will now make him into a great nation."

551
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,020
 I love what it says here.

552
00:22:59,020 --> 00:22:59,980
 Notice what it says here.

553
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:04,740
 It says, "God heard the boy crying."

554
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:07,220
 Do you catch it?

555
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,700
 Hagar is making an awful noise before the Lord.

556
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,380
 She's screaming and shouting and billowing

557
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,540
 in the middle of the desert.

558
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,900
 She's drowning out the cries of her son

559
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,620
 with the loudest cries she could ever have before God.

560
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,020
 And God shows up and he goes, "I've heard the boy crying."

561
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:26,980
 In other words, I hear the voice

562
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,500
 of the one who cannot fight for himself.

563
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,660
 The voice of the one who's in the bushes.

564
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,860
 The voice who has no ability to fight for himself.

565
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,460
 And it's not that God didn't hear Hagar's cries

566
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:39,220
 'cause he responds to Hagar.

567
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,940
 It's not that he didn't care for her.

568
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,500
 He's not ignoring her,

569
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,260
 but he's trying to teach Hagar something.

570
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:47,500
 And I think the global church, something for all of history

571
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,020
 that God hears and responds to the voices

572
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,940
 that so often everybody else ignores.

573
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,760
 That's the God that we have.

574
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:58,300
 That's the God that we serve.

575
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:01,140
 In the amount of noise that Hagar was making,

576
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:05,540
 God shows up and goes, "I haven't forgotten your son, Ishmael."

577
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:10,340
 In other words, God proves Ishmael's name.

578
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,180
 I hear him.

579
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,540
 I hear him.

580
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,860
 Even amongst all the other noise that is happening,

581
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:19,740
 I hear him.

582
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,900
 You need to know here in Hong Kong,

583
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,620
 there's a lot of noise happening all the time.

584
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:27,400
 There's a lot of sound that reverberates around our city.

585
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,500
 But the reason why we do the work that we do

586
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:34,180
 at Branches of Hope is because God hears.

587
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:39,100
 He hears the soft, subtle cry of the marginalized,

588
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,060
 the oppressed, the hurting, and the vulnerable.

589
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:45,380
 And when we and our ears are so blocked

590
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:50,020
 by the noise of materialism, the noise of politics,

591
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:53,620
 the noise of making money, the noise of career,

592
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,180
 the noise of really good things

593
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:57,540
 that can happen in our lives,

594
00:24:57,540 --> 00:25:01,780
 God doesn't stop hearing the poor.

595
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,220
 He doesn't stop hearing it.

596
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,300
 And the reality is that I think each one of us,

597
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:10,940
 myself included, can always end up living a bow shot away

598
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:13,180
 from the cries of the Ishmaels of our city.

599
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,660
 And I think we do this because it's not comfortable

600
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:18,100
 to hear those cries.

601
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,440
 It wasn't comfortable for us to watch that video.

602
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,140
 It's not always comfortable for us to sit

603
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:25,660
 in the reality of the pain and the brokenness of others.

604
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,820
 Perhaps we stay a bow shot away in Hong Kong

605
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:29,260
 because we don't know how to respond.

606
00:25:29,260 --> 00:25:31,580
 We don't know what it is that we can do to help.

607
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
 We think perhaps we're gonna make more trouble

608
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,060
 than actually help.

609
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,780
 Or maybe we stay a bow shot away because let's face it,

610
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,900
 the world is a pretty tough place right now.

611
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,300
 There's a lot of darkness in the world.

612
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,580
 There's a lot of bad news, Andrew.

613
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,540
 I don't wanna come to church

614
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,300
 and hear any more bad news, Andrew.

615
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:49,060
 There's a lot of reasons I think why we isolate ourselves

616
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:53,380
 and insulate ourselves, why we like Hagar stay a bow shot

617
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,220
 away from the cries of the vulnerable and hurting.

618
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,380
 And that's why today we wanna close that distance

619
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,740
 a little bit for you.

620
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:02,700
 That's why today we wanna make sure you hear some

621
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:05,180
 of the cries and the voices of those that we serve

622
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,500
 at Branches of Hope.

623
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,580
 And that's why we do what we do.

624
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,900
 'Cause we believe that there are many Ishmaels

625
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,200
 still in this city.

626
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:16,880
 That because God hears, we should also hear.

627
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,980
 And to help you close that distance a little bit

628
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:23,780
 and to help you understand a bit more about the stories

629
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,980
 of those that we serve through Branches of Hope.

630
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:28,980
 It's my great privilege today to introduce to you

631
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,620
 Alex Forte, who is the Executive Director

632
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,460
 of Branches of Hope.

633
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,660
 Can we give Alex a round of applause?

634
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,820
 (audience applauding)

635
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,220
 - Thank you, Andrew.

636
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,500
 Good morning.

637
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,060
 Hello, everybody.

638
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:45,820
 It's a privilege to stand out here in front of you all.

639
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,460
 You'll notice that I come with my little tablet

640
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:49,100
 because I'm not as gifted as Andrew.

641
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:51,260
 So I've got, I have something to hold on to

642
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:53,660
 and remind me what I actually wanna tell you all.

643
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:57,500
 So yeah, it's a huge blessing and privilege

644
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,740
 to be standing here in front of you all.

645
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,900
 My wife and I, we've been coming to the Divine Church

646
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,240
 for a number of years now.

647
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:07,200
 And I would never have foreseen a set of circumstances

648
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,860
 where I would get to stand in this very holy place

649
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:13,220
 in front of all of you and speak to you on a Sunday.

650
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,320
 But the Lord works in mysterious ways, so here I am.

651
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,220
 I joined Branches of Hope, as Andrew mentioned,

652
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,060
 as Executive Director not so long ago,

653
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,720
 just back in April.

654
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:28,740
 But I've known Branches of Hope for a couple of years now.

655
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,420
 In fact, I was aware of Branches of Hope

656
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,740
 even before it became Branches of Hope

657
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:36,740
 when it was still Vine Community Services.

658
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,220
 And so I was aware of that rebranding process

659
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,660
 and I've watched that organization grow

660
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:44,580
 from strength to strength over the years.

661
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:48,580
 So I'm incredibly honored and humbled

662
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,100
 to be trusted with the stewardship

663
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,140
 of this amazing organization.

664
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,900
 And I feel no pressure at all.

665
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:55,980
 (audience laughing)

666
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,740
 In fact, this is actually a bit of a perfect moment,

667
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,760
 I think, in God's perfect timing

668
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,580
 that I get to step into this role.

669
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,920
 I feel that from a sort of professional,

670
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,580
 from a professional view, from a personal view,

671
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:12,420
 from a spiritual view, all things have aligned

672
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,740
 to allow me to really step into this

673
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:17,900
 and do this work with full confidence.

674
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,520
 Professionally, I come after having spent

675
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,820
 the better part of the last decade

676
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:24,380
 working in humanitarian aid in countries

677
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:27,980
 like Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan.

678
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,440
 So I feel I have a bit of experience

679
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,420
 that I hope I can apply to Branches of Hope

680
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,820
 and continue this growth of the organization.

681
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,980
 On a spiritual level, I've been blessed

682
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:42,900
 to grow in faith, so I feel I'm equipped

683
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:45,340
 to maintain that special spiritual bond

684
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:48,540
 that connects the vine and Branches of Hope.

685
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:51,140
 And on a personal note, I recently became dad

686
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,660
 to the most adorable four-month-old,

687
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:58,100
 so I have no rush to be in any war zones anytime soon.

688
00:28:58,100 --> 00:29:00,580
 (audience laughing)

689
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,220
 So now you know a little bit more about me

690
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:06,020
 and why I'm representing Branches of Hope today,

691
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,460
 so we can turn our attention a little bit

692
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:10,700
 to why we're even talking about Branches of Hope today.

693
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:14,220
 Andrew already alluded to it a little bit.

694
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:17,380
 We are celebrating Branches of Hope Sunday today,

695
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,300
 which is part of our larger effort this month

696
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,180
 of Branches of Hope Awareness Month, BOHAM.

697
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,480
 We're very, very excited.

698
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,420
 There's a bunch of activities going on,

699
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,300
 and I encourage you to come talk

700
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,580
 to our colleagues outside at the booth

701
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,100
 to get the details on those.

702
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,700
 Fundamentally, though, apart from raising awareness

703
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,660
 for our organization and the work that we do,

704
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,940
 what we are trying to do this month

705
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,860
 is to really focus on the stories of our clients,

706
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,180
 and that's why the motto of BOHAM

707
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,020
 is Our Voices, Our Stories.

708
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:55,760
 Andrew introduced the story of Hagar and Ishmael

709
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,420
 from chapter 21 of Genesis,

710
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:02,280
 and demonstrated how God hears all,

711
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,580
 even the smallest muted voices in our society,

712
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:09,420
 and how that is a challenge to us

713
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,460
 to really come and become active,

714
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,380
 to do God's work, to do good.

715
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,580
 On reflecting on the passage,

716
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,240
 I was also reminded a little bit

717
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:24,740
 of how Hagar, in many ways, personifies the injustices

718
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,900
 faced by the clients that are served

719
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,420
 through branches of FOBE

720
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:31,700
 by both our STOP and ROAD programs.

721
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,740
 Like the clients who are served by STOP,

722
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,960
 Hagar is a slave,

723
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,860
 the most vile form of labor exploitation imaginable.

724
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,120
 And like the clients that are served by ROAD,

725
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,860
 she has been made a refugee.

726
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:47,880
 She's been kicked out of her community.

727
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,100
 She's been made to fled,

728
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,680
 not by her own choice, but by circumstance.

729
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:56,380
 I think the significance of what that means

730
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,260
 of the suffering that that entails,

731
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,660
 the challenges that comes with that

732
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,160
 was also demonstrated in the video that we saw earlier.

733
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:07,060
 And so, at Branches of Hope,

734
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,500
 when we see people like this on a daily basis,

735
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,240
 what we want to achieve for them,

736
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,900
 and it's captured in the slogan of our organization,

737
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,400
 is dignity, justice, and hope.

738
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,940
 We try to achieve this for our clients

739
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:24,700
 through three distinct service pillars,

740
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,900
 caring for them, empowering them,

741
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,820
 and driving social change

742
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:32,960
 for the better of not just the marginalized,

743
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,500
 but for society as a whole.

744
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,760
 And so we do our best every day.

745
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,380
 We do what we can to hear those voices

746
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,480
 and to empower them to tell their stories.

747
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,980
 Now, to help me tell the stories of Maggie Namala,

748
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,380
 who we briefly saw already at the beginning of,

749
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,420
 in the video, I'd like to welcome Michelle Wong,

750
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:54,260
 our program manager from STOP,

751
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:57,020
 and Roy Njoaba, the head of the ROAD program.

752
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,340
 Please give them a round of applause.

753
00:31:58,340 --> 00:32:01,500
 (audience applauding)

754
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:07,260
 Welcome, Michelle, and welcome, Roy.

755
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,460
 - Thank you, Alex.

756
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,020
 Hello, nice to be here.

757
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,860
 Hello, everyone.

758
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,020
 You guys doing good today?

759
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,060
 - Yeah.

760
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:14,900
 - I didn't hear that.

761
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,720
 You guys doing good?

762
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,560
 - Yeah.

763
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,220
 - All right, I love that.

764
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:20,660
 - Yeah, it's always a pleasure to be here.

765
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
 Hi, everyone.

766
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:26,700
 So Michelle and Roy obviously have been working with ROAD

767
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:31,460
 and STOP for much, much longer than I've come on board.

768
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:35,220
 In fact, Roy is the longest serving staff member

769
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,220
 at Branches of Hope.

770
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,060
 Isn't that right, Roy?

771
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:37,880
 - Yes, you're right.

772
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,140
 I've been in Branch of Hope for seven and a half years.

773
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,540
 Actually, tomorrow may be exactly seven and a half years.

774
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:45,100
 - Wow, that's amazing.

775
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,540
 Let's give him a round of applause.

776
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:49,700
 (audience applauding)

777
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:53,340
 So as we just said,

778
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:56,340
 we're kicking off this really exciting month,

779
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,980
 Bohem, Branches of Hope Awareness Month.

780
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,980
 And the motto of this whole month is our voices, our stories.

781
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,900
 We already saw a little bit about the kind of clients

782
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,620
 that we serve through STOP and through ROAD.

783
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:13,780
 But before we return to the stories of Maggie and Amala,

784
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,260
 maybe just for everybody's benefit,

785
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,260
 we could cover what exactly STOP and ROAD do.

786
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,620
 So Michelle, why don't you start with STOP?

787
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:25,020
 - Sure, so STOP means Stop Trafficking of People.

788
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:29,420
 So we launched a Branch of Support Program in 2014.

789
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:32,060
 Our mission is to end human trafficking

790
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:34,060
 in and through Hong Kong.

791
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,500
 So in order to do so,

792
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:39,540
 we provide protection for the survivors

793
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:40,940
 of human trafficking.

794
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,620
 We educate a vulnerable community

795
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,300
 to prevent human trafficking from happening.

796
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:49,680
 And we conduct research, collect evidence

797
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,180
 to build capacity for the society to respond to the issue.

798
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,380
 So you may wonder, what is human trafficking?

799
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:01,100
 Is that still happening in Hong Kong?

800
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:04,060
 Well, human trafficking is extreme form

801
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:08,260
 of human rights violation for the purpose of exploitation.

802
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:12,540
 So obviously, if someone is forced to work

803
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,100
 under violent circumstances, it is human trafficking.

804
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:20,480
 But human trafficking also involve different means

805
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,320
 in order to do so.

806
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:26,280
 For example, deception and coercion.

807
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:30,900
 For example, using that to coerce someone to work,

808
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:34,680
 that bondage is a form of human trafficking.

809
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,760
 Deceiving the condition of work is also a common tactics.

810
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:42,400
 So yes, human trafficking does still exist in Hong Kong,

811
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,000
 and our team is fighting for that every day.

812
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,660
 - Thank you for that, Michelle.

813
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:49,400
 I'm pretty sure that there might be a number of you

814
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,900
 who are actually quite shocked to hear

815
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,120
 that this form of labor exploitation

816
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:55,860
 and the various degrees actually happens every day

817
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,940
 right under our noses in our own society.

818
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,900
 But that is unfortunately the reality of the situation.

819
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:05,140
 Roy, let's jump over to ROAD.

820
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,500
 What is it that ROAD does exactly?

821
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,980
 - ROAD actually stands for

822
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:12,100
 Refugee Opportunity and Development.

823
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,620
 So if you hear the definition of ROAD,

824
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,380
 you know exactly what we are doing.

825
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,840
 To give opportunity and to develop refugees.

826
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,140
 And by doing that, we equip them with knowledge,

827
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:25,180
 we educate them, and we empower them for their future

828
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:29,700
 so that they can become contributors to our society.

829
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,940
 We serve refugees from all over the world,

830
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,660
 from Africa, Middle East, South Asia,

831
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:39,660
 some from Europe, and also from South America.

832
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:43,020
 And also, the ROAD program actually

833
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:46,140
 born out of the VINESH ministry.

834
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,020
 We call it the Refugee Ministry back in 2000,

835
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:52,020
 and I don't forget when, but many years ago.

836
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:55,100
 And so, really, from ROAD, from this Refugee Ministry,

837
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:58,020
 it grew up to be a branch of hope that we have today.

838
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:02,620
 - Okay, and so when we're talking about refugees,

839
00:36:02,620 --> 00:36:04,140
 who exactly is a refugee?

840
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,420
 What would be the definition there?

841
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,580
 - Great, refugees and asylum seekers,

842
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:11,740
 it's a common word that we use.

843
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:15,900
 But in Hong Kong, you hear a word like non-reformer claimant.

844
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,860
 And so I will break down these three definitions

845
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,020
 for you to understand these different categories

846
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:23,220
 of people who are seeking protection in Hong Kong.

847
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,220
 Refugees and asylum seekers are under the mandate of UNHCR

848
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:32,440
 because this falls under the 1951 Geneva Convention.

849
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,600
 Non-reformer claimants are under the CAT Convention,

850
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,380
 which is the 1984 Geneva Convention that protects people

851
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:41,580
 not to be returned to their home country.

852
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,860
 So reformer means return to their home country.

853
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,380
 Now, Hong Kong government is a signatory

854
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:50,180
 of the CAT Convention and not a signatory

855
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:52,980
 of the Geneva 1951 Convention.

856
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:56,700
 So in Hong Kong, we basically have non-reformer claimants

857
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,420
 and not asylum seekers and refugees.

858
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:04,260
 So actually in Hong Kong, we have about 250 refugees

859
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,400
 under the UNHCR Convention,

860
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:11,060
 and we have over 13,000 non-reformer claimants

861
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:14,300
 under the government of Hong Kong.

862
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,860
 So we noticed that many people often say

863
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,700
 refugee and asylum seekers by mixing them up

864
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,540
 with non-reformer claimant,

865
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,060
 but actually we mostly have non-reformer claimant

866
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,060
 in Hong Kong.

867
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,340
 Now, for non-reformer claimant,

868
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,780
 it doesn't matter how you come to Hong Kong.

869
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:29,140
 Anyone can be a non-reformer claimant

870
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,380
 if you cannot go back to your country.

871
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,620
 So non-reformer claimant stop the government

872
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,420
 not to send you back to a place

873
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,680
 that you will be in danger.

874
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,820
 But for refugee, it's defined that it's somebody

875
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,060
 who left his home country because of persecution.

876
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,340
 So the power is on the people to prove themselves

877
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,700
 that, look, I left my country because of war and violence.

878
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,940
 But for non-reformer claimant,

879
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:52,580
 it gives the government the power

880
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:57,340
 not to send anybody back to where they will face persecution.

881
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,980
 So that's how non-reformer claimant is.

882
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:01,020
 So you hear me use the word non-reformer claimant

883
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:01,860
 for the discussion,

884
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,340
 but know that I refer to refugees

885
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,100
 and asylum seekers as well.

886
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,180
 - I think that's a very important distinction to make.

887
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,580
 Ultimately, there's various levels of protection

888
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,780
 that a country can give to people

889
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,020
 fleeing any number of circumstances.

890
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,060
 And Hong Kong is the most basic one.

891
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,260
 Hong Kong basically says,

892
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,260
 we're not gonna send you back into danger,

893
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,020
 but you can't stay here either.

894
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:23,660
 So ultimately, that's where that distinction comes from.

895
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:27,180
 I think it's clear from what Michelle and Roy

896
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,780
 have just shared that both Stop and Road

897
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,300
 work with some of the most marginalized individuals

898
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,620
 in our community.

899
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,980
 In a sense, we work with many of the Ishmaels

900
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,380
 of our society.

901
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:43,300
 Now, before we come back to Maggie Nirmala,

902
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:45,980
 can you maybe please just explain

903
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:50,980
 how exactly do Road and Stop give a voice to our clients?

904
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:55,380
 Is there a unified philosophy between the two programs,

905
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,940
 a unified approach,

906
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,700
 or do you both do very different things?

907
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,700
 Roy?

908
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,380
 - Yes, as you noticed,

909
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,740
 Stop served victim of human trafficking

910
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,180
 and Road, we serve refugee and asylum seekers.

911
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:10,260
 These are two distinct group of people.

912
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:11,740
 But however, our approach,

913
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,260
 we have a unified approach

914
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,180
 in serving this marginalized group of people.

915
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:19,060
 And we place approach on the three pillars,

916
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:23,180
 which is care, empowerment, and social reform.

917
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,420
 You will hear in our discussion

918
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:27,820
 about these three pillars in a moment.

919
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,780
 - Yeah, exactly.

920
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:31,260
 I mean, this unified approach

921
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:36,260
 is also reflected in our organizational slogan,

922
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:39,060
 dignity, justice, and hope.

923
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:41,340
 And these are the crucial elements

924
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:44,300
 for us to restore our clients' voices.

925
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,140
 - Right.

926
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,780
 And I mentioned this before earlier, right?

927
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:49,140
 The slogan that we have at Branches of Hope

928
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:51,740
 is ultimately a reflection of the outcome

929
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,780
 that we hope to achieve

930
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:56,220
 through these three pillars of service.

931
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:59,140
 So maybe, Roy, can you explain how that slogan

932
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,220
 and those three pillars of service,

933
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,740
 how are they related?

934
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:02,580
 - Yes, correct.

935
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:07,860
 When you care for somebody, you restore hope.

936
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,580
 So care, restore hope.

937
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:11,980
 Now you put somebody in a community

938
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,740
 where they can have people around them to care for them,

939
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,460
 and that's how their hope is being restored.

940
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:21,460
 Secondly, empowerment, restore dignity.

941
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,580
 When you empower somebody, they become self-sufficient.

942
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:26,540
 They don't have to depend on handouts

943
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,460
 and charity donation.

944
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:28,820
 They can care for themselves.

945
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,380
 That is how dignity comes about.

946
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,380
 And thirdly, when you, social reform restored justice.

947
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,060
 The more you reform the society,

948
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,980
 reform people's mindset about what is happening in society,

949
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,100
 that is how they start to fight for justice,

950
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,100
 and that's how justice is being restored

951
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,380
 for the marginalized.

952
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,220
 - Thank you for that.

953
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,620
 I think that's a very powerful truth

954
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,220
 to kind of reflect on and soak in.

955
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,540
 Care restores hope.

956
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,500
 Empowerment restores dignity.

957
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:59,180
 And social reform restores justice.

958
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:01,940
 And that's not just for the clients that we serve,

959
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,020
 whether it's refugees or victims of trafficking.

960
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,540
 That applies to any number of marginalized

961
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,620
 and disenfranchised people in our society

962
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:11,540
 and societies around the world.

963
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:14,580
 Ultimately, it's that empowerment, that social reform,

964
00:41:14,580 --> 00:41:18,900
 that care that creates, again, dignity, justice, and hope.

965
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:22,060
 And dignity, justice, and hope are what, in turn,

966
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,300
 give people a voice to speak up

967
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,940
 and be able to tell their stories.

968
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,140
 I think it's also worth reflecting for a moment

969
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,660
 that it really is a reflection also of our Christian duties

970
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:36,500
 to care for others, to empower others,

971
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:40,140
 and ultimately also to work together to reduce,

972
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:44,620
 if not eliminate even, all forms of marginalization

973
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,780
 in our societies.

974
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:48,700
 I think the work that we do at Branches of Hope

975
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:53,700
 is also a reflection of our roots within the vine

976
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,660
 that we are trying very much to do those things,

977
00:41:56,660 --> 00:42:00,340
 albeit focused on refugees and victims of trafficking.

978
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:05,420
 So let's return now to the stories of Nimala and Maggie

979
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:09,220
 and see how those three pillars of service

980
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:11,980
 apply to their specific cases.

981
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,740
 Michelle, let's start with Nimala.

982
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:14,580
 - Sure.

983
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:16,700
 Our team is so proud of Nimala.

984
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:20,940
 I mean, it's so incredible to witness her transformation.

985
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:24,540
 One year ago, when we first met Nimala,

986
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:27,060
 she was anxious and scared.

987
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:31,180
 Usually people who experience trauma incidents,

988
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:36,180
 these are very common response to the situations.

989
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,580
 So all they want, all they need at that moment

990
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:44,260
 is to feel safe again without any doubts from others.

991
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,260
 So our team immediately admit Nimala to our care program.

992
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:53,100
 We are able to provide her with basic survival needs,

993
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:57,340
 such as food, medical support, and shelter.

994
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,780
 So these are not just tangible support,

995
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:05,780
 but as Nimala would said, our assistance and our presence

996
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:09,620
 help her to feel mentally calm again.

997
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,500
 I remember a few months ago

998
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:15,620
 when she tested COVID positive, like a lot of us did,

999
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:21,620
 the first one she called was not her husband,

1000
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,780
 not her children, but our caseworker.

1001
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:30,140
 So I can deeply feel that we have such a deep bond

1002
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,180
 with our clients that we are actually

1003
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:37,180
 the only support system in Hong Kong for our clients.

1004
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:41,540
 And we walk through a lot of difficulties together.

1005
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:43,580
 That's why we bond as a community.

1006
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:47,260
 Like other of our clients,

1007
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,500
 Nimala also seek remedy through legal system.

1008
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,740
 Through our empowerment program,

1009
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:58,500
 we make sure that our clients knows about their rights

1010
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,700
 and make informed decision

1011
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,620
 in the process of accessing justice.

1012
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,940
 So in the process, Nimala comes to realize

1013
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:11,940
 that her legal action is not just to fight for herself,

1014
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:15,260
 but it's for the sake of the community.

1015
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,380
 And most important is for the sake of justice.

1016
00:44:18,380 --> 00:44:23,380
 And she start to become, want to become an agent of change.

1017
00:44:23,380 --> 00:44:26,580
 She wants to become a helping hands for others

1018
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:30,860
 and she go outside and equip others with knowledge

1019
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:35,380
 of what to do and who to contact when abuse happens.

1020
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:38,900
 So right now on Sundays,

1021
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:42,780
 we have our team going out on the street,

1022
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:44,820
 talking to migrant workers,

1023
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:47,340
 equip them their knowledge of building friendship

1024
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:50,180
 in order to prevent human trafficking from happening.

1025
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:56,100
 Through her story of recovery, I see hope.

1026
00:44:56,100 --> 00:44:59,260
 And I see that social change is possible.

1027
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:04,060
 These stories of our clients ultimately

1028
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:09,060
 also inform our evidence-based advocacy.

1029
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:13,180
 So their story enable us to talk

1030
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,860
 to different stakeholders about the issue.

1031
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:20,860
 In fact, it's her bravery of sharing the story with us today

1032
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:24,540
 enable us to sit here together

1033
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:29,540
 and then share the cause here with you and you here.

1034
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:34,660
 And their story also help us to provide recommendation

1035
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,700
 for the government and achieve social change.

1036
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:40,380
 - Okay, thank you very much for that.

1037
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:43,220
 So it really, it's a longer process, right?

1038
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:45,380
 Like the care that's provided

1039
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,300
 leads ultimately to the empowerment

1040
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:51,220
 and the empowerment also altogether enforces

1041
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,460
 the good work that we do on a policy level as well.

1042
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,300
 Thank you for sharing that.

1043
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,060
 I think also our appreciation, of course, to Nimala

1044
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,700
 for her courage in sharing that story.

1045
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:02,660
 Roy, turning now to Maggie,

1046
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:06,340
 how exactly then did the three pillars of service

1047
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,140
 that we employ at Branches of Hope,

1048
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,460
 how did that help in her case?

1049
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:12,460
 - Right, when Maggie came to us,

1050
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:15,620
 Maggie was vulnerable with her daughter

1051
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:18,140
 and she was really confused and feel rejected

1052
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:21,780
 by the community that she was once into.

1053
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,740
 So when she came to us,

1054
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:25,380
 the first thing we did was to listen to her story,

1055
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,540
 listen to her carefully.

1056
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,620
 You know, at the road team,

1057
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:29,460
 they are very specialized in listening.

1058
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:32,020
 Those guys, they know how to listen very carefully.

1059
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:35,260
 You know, I got Cherry, Chris, you know, Green and Sherry.

1060
00:46:35,260 --> 00:46:38,100
 They are experts in listening to the refugee story.

1061
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,460
 They spend hours and time just listening

1062
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:42,220
 because that is very important to listen to

1063
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:43,780
 when you want to care for somebody.

1064
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,220
 The second thing is to provide basic assistance

1065
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,540
 because once you listen carefully,

1066
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:49,540
 you know exactly what they're looking for.

1067
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:52,020
 Like for example, in the story of Hagar and the son today,

1068
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,540
 God listened first and then he provide help

1069
00:46:56,540 --> 00:46:58,900
 and then he empowered the child by saying

1070
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:01,460
 that you will become valid tomorrow.

1071
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,980
 Now, when we listen to Maggie's story,

1072
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,340
 we next thing to do is to put her into a community.

1073
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:08,900
 The last thing you want to do

1074
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:12,020
 to somebody who is vulnerable is to isolate them.

1075
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,100
 So at the road program,

1076
00:47:13,100 --> 00:47:16,020
 we ensure that our refugees and asylum seekers

1077
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:19,180
 are in good community where they can care for one another

1078
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,660
 and they can love and care and support each other.

1079
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:24,820
 So we put Maggie into what we call our latest group.

1080
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,140
 So Maggie was so happy when she came.

1081
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,740
 After being rejected by the community,

1082
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:31,700
 he came to Branches of Hope and found a community.

1083
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,620
 And one day he said this to us,

1084
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:38,620
 "When I am with the ladies, I feel loved and cared."

1085
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:40,140
 That is what we want to hear

1086
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,500
 from our refugee and asylum seekers.

1087
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:44,820
 Then from there, we start to empower Maggie

1088
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,500
 to become a leader in her own community.

1089
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,700
 We send her into leadership training programs

1090
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,460
 and we ensure that Maggie is able to do something

1091
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:56,140
 for herself as she goes out to serve the local community.

1092
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:59,220
 Now we can also support people directly and indirectly.

1093
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:01,100
 A way to empower somebody indirectly

1094
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:03,180
 is to empower somebody next to them.

1095
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,980
 If you look in the story of Hager, right,

1096
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:07,540
 God said, "I hear the cry of your son."

1097
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:09,380
 He empowered the son by doing that,

1098
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,980
 he also empowered the mother.

1099
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:14,740
 So for us, this approach, we empowered Maggie's daughter

1100
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:16,700
 by sending her to kindergarten,

1101
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:18,620
 thanks to our kindergarten program.

1102
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:22,020
 And Maggie was so happy to see her child being empowered,

1103
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,980
 know that her child got a future.

1104
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:26,300
 By empowering her child and Maggie together,

1105
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:27,820
 both of them were so happy

1106
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:30,540
 that Maggie said this to us one day,

1107
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,860
 "Now I have peace of mind

1108
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:35,340
 "because my kids can go to school.

1109
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:38,460
 "This allows me to fight for her right."

1110
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:39,860
 Isn't that amazing?

1111
00:48:39,860 --> 00:48:43,100
 You empower the kids, but you give the mom power

1112
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:44,460
 to fight for her right.

1113
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:47,500
 And that is where social reforms comes in.

1114
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,820
 Social reform comes when we stand up

1115
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,540
 to fight for the right of the people,

1116
00:48:50,540 --> 00:48:51,900
 not just us fighting,

1117
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,180
 we have to fight together with the marginalized.

1118
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:57,340
 And then we change the whole society mindset

1119
00:48:57,340 --> 00:49:00,540
 about those who are marginalized in our city.

1120
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:01,940
 - Thank you for sharing that, Roy.

1121
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,300
 I think it's also really important

1122
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,780
 to come back to what you were just saying.

1123
00:49:05,780 --> 00:49:08,580
 Care is not only about material goods,

1124
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:10,780
 care is also about spiritual needs,

1125
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,940
 it's about emotional needs,

1126
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:14,580
 it's about being heard as a person.

1127
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,820
 So thank you for pointing that out as well.

1128
00:49:16,820 --> 00:49:19,500
 And also our appreciation to Maggie for her courage

1129
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:21,420
 in sharing that story today.

1130
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:23,780
 Let's have a round of applause for Maggie and Amala.

1131
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,940
 (audience applauding)

1132
00:49:29,820 --> 00:49:32,620
 Now, I'm sure there's many of you here today

1133
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:35,300
 who after listening to these stories

1134
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:38,860
 are probably inspired and feel a bit of passion

1135
00:49:38,860 --> 00:49:40,780
 to become involved yourselves.

1136
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,060
 And therefore might be asking yourself

1137
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:45,620
 what might be the best way to do that?

1138
00:49:45,620 --> 00:49:49,500
 How can I become a voice for the marginalized?

1139
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,260
 If you are the kind of person

1140
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:54,180
 who doesn't just want to say that bow shot away,

1141
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,700
 if you want to draw near, if you want to listen,

1142
00:49:57,580 --> 00:50:00,340
 I think my colleagues here can give you a couple pointers

1143
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,460
 on how to do that.

1144
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,540
 So, Michelle and Roy, how can people,

1145
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:07,300
 if they feel led by the spirit,

1146
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:11,220
 how can they become involved in telling those stories?

1147
00:50:11,220 --> 00:50:13,340
 Michelle, why don't we start with your pointers?

1148
00:50:13,340 --> 00:50:14,700
 - Sure.

1149
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:17,780
 I believe that everyone has a place in the society

1150
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:20,540
 to bring positive impact.

1151
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:23,700
 So the first thing that you can do

1152
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,860
 is that you can volunteer with us.

1153
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:29,620
 If you have any special talents that you would love to share

1154
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:32,700
 come to contact us, go to talk to our staff outside.

1155
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,620
 Having the power to control our life

1156
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,580
 is what dignity is all about.

1157
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:42,260
 So at Branches of Hope, we value the self-agency

1158
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:44,460
 for the marginalized community.

1159
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:48,980
 As Roy said, empowerment brings dignity.

1160
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:52,860
 So you can offer your talents to our clients.

1161
00:50:52,860 --> 00:50:54,500
 For the case in point,

1162
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,460
 the dress that I'm wearing today

1163
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:58,780
 is made by one of our clients.

1164
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:01,860
 So they are already talented enough,

1165
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,820
 but you can join us to tell them

1166
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:07,100
 that the better future is possible.

1167
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:10,980
 And secondly, you all have your own voice.

1168
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:14,380
 You all have your own voice and power to share.

1169
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:17,580
 So you can be our advocate,

1170
00:51:17,580 --> 00:51:20,660
 you can become the influencer for us.

1171
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:24,020
 So there is a very convenient opportunities here.

1172
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:29,020
 So if you tune into Branches of Hope's social media page,

1173
00:51:29,020 --> 00:51:32,340
 you will find that on 30th of July,

1174
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,620
 it would be a World Day Against Trafficking.

1175
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:38,580
 We launched a campaign called Give Survivors a Voice.

1176
00:51:38,580 --> 00:51:42,820
 You can join our campaign and become the influencer

1177
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,300
 to bring the positive change to the world.

1178
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:49,100
 And lastly, of course,

1179
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:54,100
 if you don't have the time to contribute or to give to us,

1180
00:51:54,100 --> 00:51:56,540
 then you can donate to us.

1181
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,660
 It's always welcome, right?

1182
00:51:58,660 --> 00:52:03,100
 And so you can organize a fundraiser,

1183
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:06,540
 you can donate to our program to support us

1184
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:10,500
 so that we are able to support the vulnerable.

1185
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,660
 - Thank you very much for that, Michelle.

1186
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,980
 So I think what you've touched upon are volunteering

1187
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:17,260
 and obviously using our own platforms

1188
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:19,060
 as a means for raising awareness

1189
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:21,420
 and spreading knowledge about these things,

1190
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,780
 and of course, fundraising.

1191
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:26,220
 Roy, do you have any points you'd like to add to that?

1192
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:28,820
 - Of course, one of the point is to donate, right?

1193
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:32,700
 You know, we need money to run our ministries and our work.

1194
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,140
 And I also want you to invite

1195
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:36,460
 to be an agent of inclusion,

1196
00:52:36,460 --> 00:52:38,660
 which means you have to try to open up your space

1197
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,060
 to include refugees into your circle.

1198
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:41,940
 And how does that happen?

1199
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:43,860
 Number one, pray.

1200
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:44,940
 You know, as Christians,

1201
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:46,940
 we have to pray before we take any step.

1202
00:52:46,940 --> 00:52:48,500
 So the more you pray for the refugees

1203
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,340
 and victim of human trafficking,

1204
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:52,260
 you come closer to them.

1205
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:55,260
 And secondly, is to invite them, is to get to know them.

1206
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:57,500
 Now, when you pray to them, you got to know them,

1207
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,260
 know their stories and their background.

1208
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:00,580
 And when you know them,

1209
00:53:00,580 --> 00:53:02,540
 you want to advocate on their behalf

1210
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:04,700
 by sharing this with other people around you.

1211
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:06,540
 Don't go to the street to fight for your right,

1212
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:08,180
 but you can share it with your neighbor,

1213
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,420
 your colleague in the office,

1214
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,020
 as well as somebody that you do business with.

1215
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:12,220
 After that business deal, you can go like,

1216
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,100
 "Hey, look, I want to tell something about refugees

1217
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,540
 and asylum seekers in Hong Kong."

1218
00:53:16,540 --> 00:53:17,780
 That would be very beautiful.

1219
00:53:17,780 --> 00:53:18,940
 And with that together,

1220
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:21,820
 we can make refugee voice heard in this city.

1221
00:53:21,820 --> 00:53:22,660
 - Perfect.

1222
00:53:22,660 --> 00:53:23,700
 Thank you very much, Roy.

1223
00:53:23,700 --> 00:53:27,100
 I think, you know, there's probably a deep impression

1224
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,940
 that what you've shared today has left on many of those

1225
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:31,620
 who have joined us today.

1226
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,860
 And I really like this idea

1227
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:35,180
 of becoming an agent of inclusion.

1228
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:37,740
 I hope this list that you guys see up on the slide,

1229
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,260
 that there's something there for everybody,

1230
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:42,180
 and that even the smallest bit of action

1231
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,580
 will certainly, you know,

1232
00:53:43,580 --> 00:53:47,420
 help us serve the greater good in this sense.

1233
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:49,020
 Please, let's have another round of applause

1234
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:51,140
 for our amazing colleagues, Roy and Michelle.

1235
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:54,860
 (audience applauding)

1236
00:53:54,860 --> 00:53:55,740
 And so with that,

1237
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:58,420
 we would love to return to the stories of Maggie and Amala

1238
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:00,140
 and see how they turned out.

1239
00:54:00,140 --> 00:54:06,180
 - Without a job and a home,

1240
00:54:06,180 --> 00:54:09,940
 I managed to receive basic support from organizations,

1241
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:12,340
 including Branches of Hope.

1242
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:14,940
 More importantly, the team assisted me

1243
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:16,860
 with my medical needs

1244
00:54:16,860 --> 00:54:20,340
 and was there when I needed somebody to talk to.

1245
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,780
 They also provided workshops and activities

1246
00:54:23,780 --> 00:54:26,700
 that helped equip me with the confidence

1247
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:28,180
 and knowledge for the future.

1248
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:33,700
 - There's so many expenses that come with raising a child,

1249
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:35,420
 and it's especially difficult

1250
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:37,300
 when you're a non-refoulement claimant

1251
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,300
 and not allowed to work.

1252
00:54:39,300 --> 00:54:41,180
 But with Branches of Hope's assistance,

1253
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,460
 my daughter's educational needs are met,

1254
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:47,100
 and we receive assistance with food and other necessities.

1255
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,780
 I was introduced to a ladies' group

1256
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:51,660
 and found a community where I feel like I belong to.

1257
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:53,940
 We share the same struggles

1258
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,100
 and care for each other like a big family.

1259
00:54:56,100 --> 00:55:01,660
 - Receiving help from STOP and Branches of Hope

1260
00:55:01,660 --> 00:55:04,460
 was important because their assistance

1261
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:09,460
 and their presence helped me feel more mentally calm.

1262
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:12,660
 It helped having somebody to talk to

1263
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:15,340
 so I can process my experiences

1264
00:55:15,340 --> 00:55:17,900
 and make me feel heard and understood.

1265
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:23,260
 Having a calm mind, along with the help and compassion

1266
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:26,820
 I have received, empowered me to help other people

1267
00:55:26,820 --> 00:55:28,900
 who are facing similar situations,

1268
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:32,940
 especially those who are experiencing physical abuse.

1269
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:36,260
 I can direct them to the authorities and organizations

1270
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:38,020
 who can assist them.

1271
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,500
 During the pandemic, I was able to help

1272
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,220
 contact organizations for supplies

1273
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,820
 and helping others find medical assistance.

1274
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:51,380
 - Because of the hardships that I've experienced,

1275
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:54,740
 the community I've developed, and my faith's teachings,

1276
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:58,140
 I've been very passionate about helping the less fortunate.

1277
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:00,420
 So for example, during the pandemic,

1278
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:02,540
 I went out into my neighborhood streets

1279
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,260
 and together with my daughter and community,

1280
00:56:05,260 --> 00:56:07,020
 we shared meals with the homeless people

1281
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,020
 and prayed with them.

1282
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:12,660
 - In the future, I want to become a helping hand

1283
00:56:12,660 --> 00:56:15,940
 for people in need, especially those who are applying

1284
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,300
 to be migrant domestic workers overseas.

1285
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:21,820
 I want to equip them with the necessary knowledge

1286
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:23,940
 of what to do and who to contact

1287
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,660
 in the event that abuse happens.

1288
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:32,300
 - My hope for the future is just to live a peaceful life.

1289
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:35,020
 But more importantly, I hope that my daughter

1290
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:37,300
 will be treated with dignity and respect

1291
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:40,540
 and receive the proper status in Hong Kong that she deserves.

1292
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:46,900
 (audience applauding)

1293
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:53,300
 - You know, even though I work for Branches of Hope,

1294
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:57,180
 the stories of our clients, you know,

1295
00:56:57,180 --> 00:57:01,020
 hearing their voices never ceases to amaze me.

1296
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,180
 And there are many stories like this one.

1297
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:07,100
 I truly hope that as we embark on this

1298
00:57:07,100 --> 00:57:08,460
 Branches of Hope Awareness Month,

1299
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:13,460
 that you too will be moved by the stories of those we serve.

1300
00:57:13,460 --> 00:57:17,820
 Not just today, not just this month, but always.

1301
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:21,420
 There are many thousands of Maggies and Imalas

1302
00:57:21,420 --> 00:57:26,420
 in our home Kong and many millions of Ishmaels worldwide.

1303
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:30,940
 So may I once again invite you all to be inspired

1304
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,220
 by Genesis chapter 21 and become agents of inclusion.

1305
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:37,660
 Let's not stay a bow shot away.

1306
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:41,180
 Instead, let's draw near, let's listen,

1307
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:43,660
 let's give that life-giving water.

1308
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:46,460
 Whether it is by donating or organizing fundraisers,

1309
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:48,940
 by spreading the word in your networks,

1310
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:51,860
 by volunteering your time and your expertise,

1311
00:57:51,860 --> 00:57:55,540
 by befriending those we serve and becoming their advocates,

1312
00:57:55,540 --> 00:57:59,540
 by being ferocious prayer warriors, or all of the above.

1313
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,100
 We value your contribution, but more importantly,

1314
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,700
 our clients value your contributions.

1315
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,780
 Please don't hesitate to come and talk to my colleagues

1316
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:10,060
 at our booth outside after the service,

1317
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:13,980
 and feel free to come seek us out with your questions,

1318
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,820
 with your ideas and your support.

1319
00:58:16,820 --> 00:58:17,660
 Thank you.

1320
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,740
 - Wonderful.

1321
00:58:20,740 --> 00:58:24,700
 One of the best ways that we could finish our service today

1322
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:27,540
 is by doing something that means so much

1323
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:29,100
 to us as a community.

1324
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:31,820
 When we get to celebrate one of our asylum seekers

1325
00:58:31,820 --> 00:58:35,140
 and refugees who are actually able to be welcomed

1326
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,780
 by a new country overseas.

1327
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,860
 And you know, this happens from time to time,

1328
00:58:39,860 --> 00:58:43,340
 and it's happened for one of our dear families recently.

1329
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:46,260
 They're leaving tomorrow to go to Canada,

1330
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:47,980
 to be resettled there.

1331
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,140
 And we thought the best way to finish our service

1332
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:54,060
 is to pray for them, and just to have their story heard

1333
00:58:54,060 --> 00:58:55,340
 as we close our time.

1334
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:58,580
 And I'm gonna invite Roy back to lead us in that time.

1335
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,940
 And I wonder whether we would all just stand together

1336
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:01,780
 as we do this.

1337
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:03,340
 - Let me invite Godan and your family,

1338
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,700
 please come forward, just join us on the stage.

1339
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:08,700
 Godan have really been with us for a very long time,

1340
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,220
 for almost seven years.

1341
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:12,500
 And during that time, she will serve as champions

1342
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,900
 in all Sunday services, she was in the Arise Fellowship,

1343
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:17,180
 attended our Bible school,

1344
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,340
 volunteered in Mawa Easter Egg Hunt,

1345
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:22,380
 and also joined a tribe, a group here at the Vine.

1346
00:59:22,380 --> 00:59:24,740
 Now they're about to leave, please come this way.

1347
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:27,060
 And Godan, I want to just ask Godan to share

1348
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:29,380
 one or two words with the congregation

1349
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:32,580
 of how God have guided her in Hong Kong.

1350
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:42,260
 - Good morning, everyone.

1351
00:59:42,260 --> 00:59:50,340
 I really thanks God this morning for this opportunity.

1352
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:55,500
 As the word today from our pastor,

1353
00:59:55,500 --> 01:00:00,500
 I'm always surprised with God.

1354
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:07,020
 Because the word of today really concern our life in Hong Kong.

1355
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:14,740
 I will not forget first time in this church, Vine Church,

1356
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:20,780
 in that corner, that corner you see there,

1357
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:23,060
 I always cry there.

1358
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:28,700
 When I, first time, and always,

1359
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:32,980
 when I'm in this church, I was just crying.

1360
01:00:32,980 --> 01:00:41,500
 God hear and respond.

1361
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:47,940
 Today I proclaim and I thanks God because He responded.

1362
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:52,300
 And He saw my tears.

1363
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:57,300
 And really, I feel just, I can cry again because of...

1364
01:00:57,300 --> 01:01:09,620
 I thanks everyone, I thanks the Vine Church was my home,

1365
01:01:09,620 --> 01:01:14,620
 I can say, because you really supported us,

1366
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:22,740
 spiritually, financially, and emotionally.

1367
01:01:22,740 --> 01:01:27,500
 Thank you so much.

1368
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:32,500
 Today I'm saying goodbye because tomorrow

1369
01:01:32,500 --> 01:01:35,740
 we need to leave the country.

1370
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:40,740
 And I will say, just keep this heart

1371
01:01:40,740 --> 01:01:44,540
 and this way to support

1372
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:50,300
 and be a part of God.

1373
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,100
 Thank you so much. - Yeah.

1374
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:54,420
 (audience applauding)

1375
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:55,940
 - That was beautiful, Gordance.

1376
01:01:55,940 --> 01:02:00,660
 So let us pray for this family as they go.

1377
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,860
 Gordance actually send a request prayer for us,

1378
01:02:02,860 --> 01:02:06,380
 is for a smooth transition into the new place.

1379
01:02:06,380 --> 01:02:09,700
 Pray for strength and wisdom to deal with cultural shock,

1380
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,820
 a good friends and community over in Canada,

1381
01:02:12,820 --> 01:02:14,740
 and also peace during this transition.

1382
01:02:14,740 --> 01:02:16,660
 That was her prayer request that she sent to us.

1383
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:19,100
 So all of you stretch your hands towards Gordance

1384
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:21,340
 and just pray into your heart for about a minute

1385
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,580
 and I will wrap it up with a round of prayer.

1386
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:27,700
 - Thank you, Jesus, come on, Jesus.

1387
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:30,100
 (soft music)

1388
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:38,580
 - Dear Lord, we join our voices with the angels in heaven

1389
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,620
 and lay our hands on this family of Gordance,

1390
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,260
 as they go and hear it.

1391
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:46,220
 We pray, Almighty God, that you will send your angels

1392
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:50,060
 concerning you to guide them on their ways.

1393
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,140
 We pray that God will cover you with his feather

1394
01:02:53,140 --> 01:02:56,100
 and under his wings you will find refuge.

1395
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:59,900
 We trust you in your shield, O God, and armor.

1396
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,660
 You do not need to fear terror of night

1397
01:03:02,660 --> 01:03:04,780
 or arrow that flay during the day,

1398
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:08,300
 for God is your hiding place.

1399
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,500
 He will protect you from trouble,

1400
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:13,460
 he will surround you with songs of victory.

1401
01:03:13,460 --> 01:03:15,660
 The Lord says, "I will guide you along

1402
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,860
 the best path of your life.

1403
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:21,060
 I will advise you and watch over you."

1404
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,500
 May the Lord keep you from all harm,

1405
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:26,660
 God, us and your family, and watch over your life.

1406
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:29,860
 May the Lord keep watching over you as you come

1407
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:33,580
 and as you go, both now and forever.

1408
01:03:33,580 --> 01:03:36,260
 We pray this in Jesus' mighty name, come, we all say.

1409
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:37,100
 - Amen. - Amen.

1410
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:37,940
 - Amen.

1411
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:41,860
 (congregation applauding)

1412
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,100
 - Bless you, A.

1413
01:03:43,100 --> 01:03:49,220
 Bless you, B.A., bless you guys, bless you guys.

1414
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,060
 All right, I know we've gone a little bit long,

1415
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:55,140
 but I wanna do one more thing for you.

1416
01:03:55,140 --> 01:03:55,980
 Is that okay?

1417
01:03:55,980 --> 01:03:59,420
 Oh, tough, we're gonna do it anyway.

1418
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:01,020
 It says at the end of the story,

1419
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:04,100
 when Hagar has had this amazing moment with God,

1420
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:06,500
 and God says, "I hear your son," verse 19,

1421
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,940
 it says, "God then opened her eyes."

1422
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,500
 Say that again, "God opened her eyes

1423
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,420
 so she could see a well of water.

1424
01:04:14,420 --> 01:04:16,740
 So she went there, filled her skim of water,

1425
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,380
 and gave the boy a drink."

1426
01:04:18,380 --> 01:04:21,620
 My prayer for you is that God would open your eyes.

1427
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,660
 I pray that He would open the ears of your hearts

1428
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:27,180
 so you would hear the vulnerable and the marginalised

1429
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,540
 that would not stay a bow shot away.

1430
01:04:29,540 --> 01:04:30,380
 Let me pray for us.

1431
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:31,740
 Father, we thank You so much

1432
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:33,580
 that we get to do this together.

1433
01:04:33,580 --> 01:04:35,940
 Thank You so much for the work of Branches of Hope,

1434
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,540
 but more importantly, the work of Your Spirit.

1435
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:39,500
 The work of Your Spirit,

1436
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,220
 that it's a work in every person here for Your glory.

1437
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:44,900
 We thank You for this.

1438
01:04:44,900 --> 01:04:45,740
 In Jesus' name.
