1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,680
 In Jesus name.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,040
 Everyone says, amen.

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,360
 Hey, can we thank our worship team

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,900
 and these guys, grateful for them.

5
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,320
 Have a seat, have a seat.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:13,200
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,800
 and it's so great to have you with us.

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,840
 If this is your first Sunday of 2024,

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,880
 your first service with us this year,

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:22,240
 we're so glad you are here.

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,400
 Last week, I shared with us all a dream

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,680
 that I sense God had given me at the end of last year

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,440
 or towards the end of last year,

14
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,440
 that was really a call to intimacy.

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:34,440
 All the things that I've just kind of been talking about

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,600
 in that prayer moment with us, this call to intimacy.

17
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:41,400
 And I said last week that we as a senior leadership

18
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:44,760
 here at the Vine, we've been wrestling with all the things

19
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,280
 that God has been saying to us as a church.

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:48,920
 And God at the beginning of this year

21
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,760
 is bringing both a correction and an invitation to us.

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:56,160
 And we talked about this a little bit in detail last week,

23
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,240
 that God is bringing a correction to us

24
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,360
 here at the Vine around our worship.

25
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:02,720
 And it's really important that when you're a church,

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,320
 that you keep your ears open and your heart open

27
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,640
 to all the things that God wants to say to you.

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:10,200
 And whilst we worship and we honor and we walk

29
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,360
 with a God of love and peace and mercy and glory and grace,

30
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,320
 He's also a God that sometimes has things to say to us

31
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,280
 that aren't always easy to hear.

32
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:21,280
 And we've heard here as a leadership

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,160
 that we have to reflect a bit deeper

34
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,400
 around our worship experiences with God.

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,800
 And one of the things that we've heard

36
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,800
 at the beginning of this year

37
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,000
 is something that needs a correction in us.

38
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,080
 And that is so often we can come here on a Sunday

39
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,680
 and experience what we experience.

40
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,800
 And we kind of exist, if you will,

41
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,680
 off the atmosphere of God, as great as that is,

42
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,800
 and what a privilege it is to have the presence of God

43
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,000
 here in the room with us.

44
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,880
 But we think that that's the all,

45
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,320
 that's the be all and end all.

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,600
 And we don't push beyond the atmosphere of God

47
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,000
 to the actual person of God,

48
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,360
 to the person of Christ with us.

49
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,880
 And that we kind of settle, if you will,

50
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,080
 for a feeling of God in the room,

51
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,800
 rather than a personal, active, and living relation

52
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,920
 with Him every single day.

53
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,560
 And so last week, we unpacked this idea

54
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,000
 of how so often we can find ourselves stopping short.

55
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,600
 That the Scriptures would say that it is our praise

56
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,360
 that is leading us through the gates.

57
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,960
 We go through the gates with thanksgiving on our hearts,

58
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,320
 but we go into a deeper relationship with Him.

59
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,000
 Our worship is not us camping at the gates,

60
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,080
 our worship leads us through the gates

61
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,560
 into a deeper reality with Him.

62
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,160
 Does that make sense to you?

63
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,640
 And I said last week that all of us have been created

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,400
 with this innate desire for intimacy with God.

65
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,080
 It's a wonderful, beautiful thing,

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
 that God has created you with a desire

67
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,720
 for intimacy with Him.

68
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,360
 And the reality is, is when we don't satisfy

69
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,520
 that innate desire for intimacy with God, with God,

70
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:52,120
 we'll look for lesser and other forms of intimacy

71
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,560
 to satisfy what actually can only be satisfied in God.

72
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,720
 And so often, we look for that intimacy

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,560
 in broken ways with one another.

74
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:05,840
 And in our brokenness and intimacy together,

75
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,520
 we think that will plug the intimacy desire

76
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,920
 that God has given in us.

77
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,120
 And we talked about last week how it's only in the fullness

78
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,000
 of that intimacy with Christ that we're then able to walk

79
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,800
 in healing and good intimacy with one another.

80
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,080
 It flows in that way.

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,000
 That was the word of correction last week,

82
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,320
 but there was also a word of invitation for us last week.

83
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,480
 And it was an invitation to orientate

84
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,000
 all of our lives towards God,

85
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,560
 to recognize that church, this moment that we have together,

86
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,840
 this incredible 90 minutes that we share on a Sunday

87
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,800
 is a wonderful, beautiful God gift,

88
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,320
 and we're so grateful for it,

89
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,360
 but it's a catalyst into a deeper and greater relationship

90
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,040
 with Jesus outside of those 90 minutes,

91
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,120
 and that our relationship with God,

92
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,120
 our intimacy with Jesus is not dependent on the church.

93
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,520
 The church catalyzes that relationship,

94
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,160
 but we're not dependent on the church

95
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,720
 for the fullness of that relationship.

96
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,400
 My heart for you is that you would come in here on a Sunday

97
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,240
 and you would encounter incredible intimacy with Jesus,

98
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,080
 but my greater heart for you is that you would find yourself

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,360
 more intimate with Jesus outside of these services

100
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,480
 than you are even here in these services,

101
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,520
 that it's in your workplaces and your relationships

102
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,680
 and your family and you yourself

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:26,960
 when you wake up on a Monday morning

104
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,160
 and you open God's word, that in those moments

105
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,400
 you find the richest of intimacy with Christ,

106
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,000
 and that you're not coming into church

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,560
 so drained and exhausted after a crazy week

108
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,600
 seeking an injection of Jesus

109
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:41,120
 to get you through the week ahead,

110
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,800
 but instead the whole week has been a living,

111
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,440
 embracing faith for you,

112
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,880
 and you come into service on a Sunday

113
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:50,680
 with this overflow of the intimacy of Christ

114
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,480
 throughout the week, and you can't wait

115
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:55,560
 to be with the people of God in the church of God

116
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,360
 experiencing intimacy together.

117
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,480
 It's a catalyst to your faith.

118
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,520
 Your faith should not be dependent on it.

119
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,720
 Are you with me, church?

120
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,800
 So there's a correction, but there's an invitation.

121
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,200
 And last week I spoke about a biblical definition

122
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,040
 of this kind of intimacy.

123
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:16,520
 I wanna start by reading this to you once again.

124
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,360
 An orientation of all of life

125
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,840
 that pushes beyond just a feeling of God

126
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:23,960
 to an actual real and deep relationship with him

127
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,720
 that produces in us the fruit of assurance,

128
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
 confidence, and joy.

129
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,040
 That's what I think God is welcoming

130
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,360
 and inviting the vine into this year,

131
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,760
 inviting you personally into this year,

132
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,520
 an orientation of all of your life

133
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,280
 where you're not just existing off of some feeling of him,

134
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,640
 but you have a tangible, real daily relationship with him

135
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,320
 that creates a fruit in you of confidence and assurance

136
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,360
 and joy that you feel the fullness of life.

137
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,000
 And I tell you what, Hong Kong right now,

138
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,840
 our world right now needs churches

139
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:59,120
 filled with individual Christians

140
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,280
 who have assurance in their faith,

141
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,840
 confidence in the gifts of the Holy Spirit,

142
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,640
 and a joy for life so that they could go

143
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,480
 into the workplaces, into the marketplace,

144
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,720
 into the corridors of power of that city,

145
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,080
 and speak of that assurance and that confidence

146
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,280
 and that hope and bring a new narrative to this world.

147
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,800
 Surely we need that.

148
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,400
 Our intimacy with God produces an overflow in us

149
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,360
 towards this world that God so deeply loves.

150
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,280
 What I wanna do this week and next week

151
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,640
 is share two critical traps

152
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:42,600
 that I think all of us Christians fall into

153
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,160
 that have the power to actually restrict our ability

154
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,520
 to be intimate with Jesus.

155
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,040
 I wanna share two critical things this week, next week,

156
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,640
 that are traps that I think we fall into

157
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,040
 that restrict our ability to move

158
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,480
 into deeper intimacy with him.

159
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,280
 And I think if you can open your heart

160
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,040
 to these two things that we're talking about

161
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:03,080
 this week and next,

162
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,080
 I think it could be a wonderful way

163
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,320
 for you to start your new year.

164
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,000
 If you can deal with some of this in your own life,

165
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,360
 and what I'm teaching you today has come out

166
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,800
 of a deep wrestling myself with this very issue.

167
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,280
 If we can wrestle with it,

168
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,080
 I think you'll set yourself up for a freedom in intimacy

169
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,640
 with Jesus in the year ahead

170
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,040
 like you've never experienced before.

171
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,240
 Two critical traps.

172
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,560
 To introduce you to the first one this afternoon,

173
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,680
 I wanna tell you a little bit about the story

174
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,040
 of Ruth in the Bible.

175
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,280
 The book of Ruth in the Old Testament,

176
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,560
 one of my favorite books in the Old Testament,

177
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,680
 one of my favorite books in the whole Bible.

178
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,680
 It's the shortest book actually in the Old Testament.

179
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,720
 So it's an easy one to read.

180
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:46,160
 I recommend it in the week ahead.

181
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,240
 It's a awesome story about a family.

182
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,840
 And I love stories about families

183
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,920
 because family is something that's really important to me.

184
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:58,600
 In this story, there is a father, his name is Elimelech,

185
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,720
 and he has a wife named Naomi, and they have two sons.

186
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,680
 They live in Bethlehem.

187
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,360
 Yes, the actual same Bethlehem as the Christmas story.

188
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,400
 The name Bethlehem means the house of bread

189
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,000
 because Bethlehem was famous for the fields around it

190
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,840
 that were filled with corn and they made bread in that land.

191
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,560
 But in this story, a famine happens

192
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:20,360
 right at the beginning of the story.

193
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,840
 And the famine is so hard that Elimelech decides

194
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,560
 to actually uproot his family and move to a new nation

195
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,000
 where they can live and survive.

196
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,160
 They move to a nation known as Moab.

197
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,280
 As they go into Moab, they settle as a family,

198
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:36,920
 and it so happens that his two sons marry Moabite women,

199
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,040
 Orpah and Ruth.

200
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,160
 Now, as the story goes, as they marry these women,

201
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:46,120
 and a short time after that,

202
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:48,560
 a tragedy happens to the family,

203
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,160
 and Elimelech and his two sons die.

204
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,840
 And suddenly, Naomi is left as a widow

205
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,440
 with two daughters-in-law, two daughters-in-law

206
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:01,120
 that are not from her own bloodline or from her own land.

207
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,400
 And around about this time,

208
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,400
 Naomi hears that the famine has lifted in Bethlehem

209
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,160
 and that she can now return home.

210
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,120
 And she says to her daughters-in-law,

211
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:13,320
 "Look, I release you from the family bond, if you will.

212
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,360
 "You're better off, your futures are better off

213
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,160
 "to remain here in Moab than to come back with me."

214
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,840
 And she tries to release her daughters-in-law.

215
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,040
 Orpah decides that for her and her journey,

216
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,480
 that's the best thing for her to remain in Moab.

217
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:30,160
 But Ruth replies in some of the most beautiful language

218
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,080
 and words that we have in the whole of the Bible.

219
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,440
 She says, "No."

220
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,280
 She's like, "Our family is more than just this bloodline.

221
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:39,580
 "We're connected together, and your land will be my land.

222
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,360
 "Your God will be my God."

223
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,580
 And so Ruth makes the decision to not leave Naomi,

224
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,480
 not only a widow, but on her own,

225
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,200
 but instead come back with Naomi and settle in her land,

226
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,340
 in the land of Bethlehem.

227
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,460
 As they get back to Bethlehem,

228
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:57,640
 the harvest is about to happen,

229
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,040
 which is a wonderful thing in that land.

230
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,880
 But Naomi and Ruth find themselves on really hard times.

231
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,600
 In the patriarchal culture of that day,

232
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,760
 without a husband for Naomi or a husband for Ruth,

233
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:16,760
 it meant that they were under an impoverished situation.

234
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,720
 In fact, they were so poor,

235
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:20,260
 they were struggling to make ends meet and survive.

236
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,640
 And Naomi, in the midst of that poverty,

237
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,960
 realizes that there is something that they can do.

238
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,820
 She says to Ruth, "I want you to go into the fields

239
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:30,040
 "during the harvest time."

240
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,200
 And she says, "I want you to glean in the harvest."

241
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,720
 Ruth decides to go and glean in the harvest,

242
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,320
 and their story changes at that point.

243
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,600
 But it's this idea of gleaning in the harvest

244
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,280
 that I actually wanna unpack and talk with you

245
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,840
 a little bit more about today.

246
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,340
 The concept of gleaning in that time,

247
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,720
 about a thousand years before Christ,

248
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,520
 it was almost like the Hebrew social welfare structure

249
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,800
 of the day, okay?

250
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:00,200
 It was something that was written in the law

251
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,000
 so that those who were poor or the impoverished

252
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,500
 or the vulnerable or the outcasts of society,

253
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,100
 they would be able to come alongside in the harvest

254
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:11,240
 and actually receive something from the harvest.

255
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,120
 You can imagine in a town like Bethlehem,

256
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,960
 the harvest was significant for that town,

257
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,560
 and the landowners were the wealthy people,

258
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,520
 and the harvesters were hired to come

259
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,200
 and harvest the crop of that land.

260
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,560
 Well, gleaning was something that was constructed

261
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:29,320
 to help the poor people also partake in the harvest.

262
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,220
 Let me explain how this works.

263
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:34,300
 So the harvesters would take a basket

264
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:37,320
 like this wick of basket I'm about to put on my back.

265
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,960
 They would put it on their back just like this.

266
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,520
 And what they would do is they would stand

267
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,800
 at the beginning of a massive grain field.

268
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,560
 Remember, they're harvesting corn.

269
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,700
 And they would stand in this massive grain field.

270
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,280
 There'd be a whole line of harvesters

271
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,680
 all with baskets on their backs.

272
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,120
 And what they would do right at the same time,

273
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,320
 all of them in one go, they would step forward.

274
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,240
 Now, remember, there's a massive field in front of them.

275
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,720
 There's a lot of grain to harvest,

276
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,600
 and they have a short period of time in daylight to do so.

277
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,440
 So this was a fast thing that they would do.

278
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,540
 They would step forward.

279
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,820
 They would grab the first stalk of grain in front of them.

280
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,180
 They would uproot it from the ground.

281
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,440
 They would sheaf off all of the leaves from it.

282
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,800
 They would manage to get the husk of the corn from it,

283
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,560
 and they would throw the husk of the corn into the basket,

284
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,800
 drop the stalk, and step forward once again.

285
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,000
 Pull up the next stalk, sheaf it all off,

286
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,480
 take that husk of corn,

287
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,640
 throw it into the back of the basket, move on to the next.

288
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,000
 Do you understand that?

289
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,860
 And the faster that they could do this, the better it was.

290
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,780
 So for those over here, they would be like,

291
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,360
 (imitates fast-forwarding)

292
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
 like this, right?

293
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,360
 They were like ninjas when it came to harvesting corn.

294
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
 It was awesome.

295
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,600
 Now, every once in a while, though,

296
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,080
 a harvester would sheaf off the corn husk

297
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,160
 and throw the corn husk into the basket.

298
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,640
 But because of the speed or maybe the movement,

299
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:56,140
 the corn husk would miss the basket and fall on the ground.

300
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:59,480
 Now, when the corn fell on the ground,

301
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,760
 by law, the harvester was not allowed

302
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:04,780
 to pick up that grain anymore.

303
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,140
 When the corn husk would fall onto the ground,

304
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,960
 you had behind the line of harvesters another line.

305
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,340
 This was the poor people.

306
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,840
 This was Ruth.

307
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,640
 And they were behind the harvesters,

308
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,200
 and they were desperately watching the harvesters

309
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,340
 to see which one is likely to drop some corn on the ground.

310
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:26,860
 Now, you can imagine when a harvester drops a corn

311
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:29,120
 on the ground by mistake and realizes it

312
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,640
 and realizes they can't pick it up,

313
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,580
 they move on, and suddenly,

314
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,480
 you can almost hear all of the gleaners go,

315
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,920
 (gasps)

316
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,840
 and there's like this fight for that one piece of corn

317
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,760
 that's fallen on the ground.

318
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,300
 And all the gleaners would run forward,

319
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:44,960
 and somebody would grab that precious bit of corn.

320
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,980
 And as soon as they grabbed that corn,

321
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,520
 that was their property now,

322
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,840
 and they could take that home,

323
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,960
 and they could make some bread for themselves

324
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,880
 and hopefully survive for another week.

325
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,720
 Gleaning was the process of taking the tidbits,

326
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,800
 the crumbs of the harvest,

327
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,560
 and making a meal out of it so you could actually survive.

328
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,800
 Are you following this?

329
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,800
 So if you think about it this way,

330
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,040
 gleaning was like living off of the leftovers

331
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,440
 of the others who were harvesting.

332
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,940
 Now, take this back off, put it back over here.

333
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:24,220
 What has this all got to do with us and intimacy?

334
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,820
 I wanna put it to you that I think for the majority of us,

335
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,660
 when it comes to our intimacy with Jesus

336
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,700
 and when it comes to our spiritual life with Him,

337
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:38,060
 our posture is primarily one of gleaning

338
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,340
 rather than harvesting.

339
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,220
 And what do I mean by that?

340
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,740
 What I mean is that I think so often

341
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,660
 in the Christian life,

342
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:49,260
 and this is the big trap that we fall into.

343
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:54,260
 We primarily base our intimacy off of the throwaways

344
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,060
 of somebody else's intimacy.

345
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:02,620
 I think we so often construct our faith,

346
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:05,740
 our knowledge of Jesus and who Jesus is

347
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:08,860
 off of somebody else who's done the work,

348
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:12,060
 the harvesting of understanding and knowing Jesus,

349
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,060
 and we glean from their insight,

350
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,620
 and we take the gleaning of their insight,

351
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:19,620
 and we build our own intimacy,

352
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,340
 not actually off of the person of Jesus Himself,

353
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,140
 but off of the gleaning that's come

354
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,840
 from somebody else's relationship with Jesus.

355
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,900
 Anyone tracking with this?

356
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:33,220
 This process happens in the spiritual life.

357
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,860
 I think it's so easy for us

358
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,000
 to glean other people's information.

359
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,980
 And we can find ourselves actually beginning to believe

360
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,180
 in a Jesus that other people have told us about

361
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:46,100
 rather than a Jesus that we personally

362
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,820
 encountered for ourselves.

363
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:51,820
 So in other words, our experience of Jesus

364
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,460
 becomes somebody else's experience of Jesus.

365
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:57,660
 Our belief of Jesus is really somebody else's belief

366
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,700
 of Jesus.

367
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:01,260
 Our relationship with Jesus has predominantly

368
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:04,220
 been somebody else's relationship with Jesus,

369
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,540
 and here's what happens.

370
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:08,620
 When your primary posture in your relationship with Jesus

371
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:12,740
 is to glean from other people's information about Jesus,

372
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,900
 here's what you will do.

373
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,980
 You will construct a version of Jesus

374
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,100
 that I like to call secondhand Jesus.

375
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,700
 You're gonna make a secondhand Jesus.

376
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,060
 And here's what you need to hear.

377
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,100
 The single greatest danger to intimacy with God

378
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,160
 is the worship of a secondhand Jesus.

379
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:38,060
 The single greatest danger to a church

380
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:41,500
 is the worship of a secondhand Jesus.

381
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,340
 The Jesus somebody else told me about

382
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:45,660
 rather than the one that I actually know.

383
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,580
 The Jesus of somebody else's information

384
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,800
 rather than the Jesus of my revelation.

385
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:54,300
 The Jesus that has been constructed by something else

386
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,620
 that I've managed to glean myself from

387
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:58,340
 and I've aligned myself to,

388
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,100
 and the reality is we all do this.

389
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:03,040
 Now, I want you to hear me really carefully.

390
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,940
 Can everybody lean in?

391
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:05,540
 Hear me really carefully.

392
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,580
 Gleaning is good.

393
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,500
 Gleaning is actually an important part

394
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,740
 of your relationship with Jesus.

395
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,020
 In fact, I tell you what,

396
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:17,220
 God has raised up some incredible men and women in the church

397
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,340
 through church history

398
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:23,180
 that have so much to say that you can learn from, grow from.

399
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,640
 There is absolutely nothing wrong

400
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,520
 with downloading a sermon from some preacher

401
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,540
 that you love overseas

402
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,160
 and get some insight into God from that.

403
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,740
 There is absolutely nothing wrong

404
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,060
 with reading devotionals every day this week.

405
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:35,180
 Hopefully if you're a part of the Vine,

406
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,620
 you've been reading a devotional

407
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,020
 that somebody else has read.

408
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,460
 That's the process of gleaning.

409
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,620
 I want you to hear my heart.

410
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,660
 There is nothing inherently wrong with gleaning.

411
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,260
 That's not what I'm saying here.

412
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,400
 Here is what I am saying.

413
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:52,180
 When the posture of your relationship with God

414
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:54,580
 is built primarily

415
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,920
 on what other people's information is about God,

416
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:01,300
 if your approach to your relationship with God

417
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,860
 is primarily structured

418
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:05,620
 by what other people have told you about God,

419
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:08,780
 you are essentially worshiping a secondhand Jesus

420
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:11,780
 and you have what I would call a borrowed faith.

421
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,960
 Does that make sense to you?

422
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,500
 Now again, gleaning is not bad.

423
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,460
 Here's the reality.

424
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:21,940
 I have made my whole life purpose to read the scriptures,

425
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,140
 learn the scriptures, to harvest

426
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:26,980
 so that other people in my church could receive and grow.

427
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,220
 Every single one of us in this room right now

428
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,820
 is gleaning right now.

429
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,840
 Yes, you are.

430
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:34,260
 You're listening to me.

431
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:35,620
 And my prayer and hope is that

432
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,640
 you'll glean something good today.

433
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,580
 I pray that you'll hear something that'll be helpful to you.

434
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,740
 I pray that there's some sort of impartation

435
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,620
 that will happen through what I'm sharing today

436
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,540
 into your life.

437
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:50,860
 But hear me, I would more and much more rather have me

438
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:53,220
 as a catalyst to your personal faith

439
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,780
 than you basing your faith out of everything I say.

440
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,480
 If you have structured your faith

441
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,940
 around what Andrew says at the Vine

442
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,960
 or any pastor at the Vine or any church

443
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,900
 or any sort of ministry,

444
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,420
 if that's the primary way

445
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,220
 that you're coming to understand your faith,

446
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,700
 you are worshiping a second-hand Jesus

447
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,620
 and you have a borrowed faith.

448
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,720
 And that is not intimacy.

449
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,660
 That's information that may or may not be helpful

450
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,240
 to catalyze you towards intimacy,

451
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,300
 but we can't make the mistake of thinking

452
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,900
 that that is intimacy itself.

453
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,980
 Are you following this?

454
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:30,540
 There are two things that will happen, I guarantee you,

455
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,340
 if you focus in on gleaning

456
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,540
 more than harvesting in your relationship with Jesus.

457
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,780
 Two things guarantee what happened.

458
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,740
 Here's the first one.

459
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,360
 Not only will you construct a second-hand Jesus,

460
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,220
 but you will construct a second-hand Jesus of your choosing.

461
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,200
 'Cause the whole process of gleaning

462
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,500
 is picking up stuff that we like.

463
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,220
 When our primary posture in building an intimacy with God

464
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,860
 is based off of what other people have said,

465
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,620
 what we do is we align ourselves

466
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,740
 to the things we like that other people have said.

467
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,460
 Oh, that was a good quote from social media.

468
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,260
 Oh, that was a bomb message there.

469
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,100
 Oh, that was good.

470
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,380
 And then we like those things

471
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,860
 because they sit well with our already confirmed worldview.

472
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:12,700
 They sit well with how we already think we know about Jesus.

473
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,860
 And when your life, your relationship,

474
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:18,580
 is primarily structured by gleaning rather than harvesting,

475
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:21,260
 what it means is that you will cherry-pick

476
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,860
 the things about Jesus that are comfortable for you to have.

477
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:27,340
 This is the sifting that I talked about

478
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,800
 in the picture I got during my worship.

479
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:30,780
 I want you to know this.

480
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:33,180
 If that happens, here's what's gonna happen.

481
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,300
 You will have a Jesus that you like,

482
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,080
 but not a Jesus that saves.

483
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:44,340
 You will have a Jesus that you're comfortable with,

484
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:47,220
 but not a Jesus necessarily of the Scriptures.

485
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,860
 And when your life gets tough,

486
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:51,620
 when things are hard and challenges come,

487
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,900
 you'll find yourself not being able to lean

488
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,920
 on your constructed version of second-hand Jesus.

489
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:02,540
 Here's the second thing that will happen, guarantee you.

490
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,140
 The second thing that will happen is this.

491
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,500
 You will begin to mistake rumor of God

492
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,920
 for revelation of God.

493
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:12,220
 This is really an important thing,

494
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,580
 and I want you to track with this.

495
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:16,320
 When our posture, again, is primarily gleaning

496
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,460
 rather than harvesting ourselves,

497
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:21,220
 what we're really doing is we're building our lives

498
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,940
 off of other people's opinions about God,

499
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,980
 other people's ideas about God,

500
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,660
 other people's maybe even experiences of God,

501
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:29,940
 and we're gleaning from that.

502
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:31,500
 What you need to realize is that

503
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,780
 when you glean from someone,

504
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,340
 the chances are what you're gleaning,

505
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:38,400
 they've gleaned from someone else.

506
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,140
 And the chances are that that other person

507
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,980
 that they gleaned from gleaned from someone else.

508
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,180
 And so on and so forth.

509
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,300
 Have you ever played that game where maybe if we started

510
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,480
 with a whisper here, and I whispered something in your ear

511
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,140
 and you pass it all the way down over here,

512
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,940
 when it got down to here, it would not be the same.

513
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:54,780
 Are you with me?

514
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,220
 Do you ever play that game?

515
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,360
 When your posture and your intimacy with God

516
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,100
 and relationship with Jesus is built primarily on gleaning

517
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,020
 rather than harvesting, you're gleaning something

518
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,420
 that's been passed down, passed down,

519
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,260
 and suddenly you're gonna have the mistake,

520
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,020
 there's the challenge, there's the temptation,

521
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,760
 to believe that the rumor of God

522
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,340
 is actually revelation of God.

523
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:16,200
 But actually that rumor of God much more likely

524
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:19,060
 is something that's been filtered over so many things.

525
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,240
 And the Bible's very clear,

526
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,820
 the truth that God is Jesus himself.

527
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,380
 Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life.

528
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:28,840
 At my Bible school in seminary,

529
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:31,800
 I went to Bible school and gleaned a lot, it was great.

530
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,280
 Over the top of the door of my Bible school,

531
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,840
 when you walk into it, for the first time it says this,

532
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,160
 it says, "God has spoken, the rest is commentary."

533
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,800
 And the commentary is helpful and good.

534
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,540
 The commentary can catalyze and strengthen our faith,

535
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:50,960
 absolutely, but we need to know that God speaks.

536
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,020
 The truth is alive.

537
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,920
 And the danger we have if we're posturing,

538
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,720
 mostly we're gleaning rather than harvesting,

539
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,800
 is that we'll end up turning rumor of God

540
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,520
 into revelation of God.

541
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:05,400
 If you want to truly deepen your intimacy with God in 2024,

542
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,320
 what you need to do is trade rumor of God

543
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,720
 for a firsthand faith.

544
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:14,000
 Come on church, everybody okay?

545
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:19,000
 You gotta start trading rumor of God for firsthand faith.

546
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:22,400
 You need to be serious

547
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,400
 and take your own spiritual basket

548
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,640
 and realize that because of Christ's life,

549
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,520
 death and resurrection on the cross,

550
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,360
 there is a harvest of his relationship with you

551
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,020
 that is right in front of you,

552
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,200
 that there's a harvest of goodness and life

553
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,840
 and glory in him.

554
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,200
 And you are to step forward

555
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,680
 and grab a hold of the spiritual stalks

556
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,000
 that he places in your life and sheath them off

557
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,880
 and grab the kernel of the word of God for you

558
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,400
 that changes and transforms you

559
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:50,840
 and place it in your spiritual basket

560
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,800
 and then step forward to the next thing

561
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,960
 that God has for you and unpack that

562
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,040
 and harvest the things that God has for you

563
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,040
 rather than stand back and wait for that person

564
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,520
 that you think hears more from God than you do

565
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,040
 to drop a little morsel of idea that you can suck up.

566
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,040
 Instead, you are designed and created for the harvest.

567
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,440
 You're a child of God.

568
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,480
 You've been given the ability and the privilege

569
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,200
 to strap a basket of spirit on your back

570
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,640
 and harvest in intimacy with him.

571
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:27,520
 Now,

572
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:33,160
 the thing that we have to sit in,

573
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,840
 thing that we have to wrestle with

574
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,800
 is that harvesting is work.

575
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:42,920
 One of the people that I've followed

576
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,560
 that has written a lot about this,

577
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,520
 his name's Glenn Packiam, he leads a church in California.

578
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,440
 He's written around this idea and this topic.

579
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,400
 I wanna read you something that he said.

580
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,520
 He said, "God didn't want me leaning completely

581
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,680
 "on someone else's knowledge of him.

582
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,240
 "He didn't want me coasting,

583
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,360
 "finding shortcuts for knowing him.

584
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,080
 "He wanted me to do the carrying, the heavy lifting,

585
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,040
 "the hard and delightfully glorious work of knowing him."

586
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,640
 I love how he puts that.

587
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,520
 The hard but delightfully glorious work of knowing him.

588
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,400
 In other words, there's work to be done.

589
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,920
 Hear it this way, gleaning is easy.

590
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,800
 Gleaning is simple.

591
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:24,400
 You don't need any special gifts to glean in God.

592
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,160
 You can just pick up what other people

593
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:29,440
 have done the hard work of uncovering for themselves.

594
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,720
 It's much easier for you to go on a run

595
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,000
 and listen to a spiritual podcast than it is to pray.

596
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,680
 It's much easier for you to listen to Nicki Gumbel

597
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,120
 with a Bible in a year

598
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:44,840
 than for you to actually open the Bible and read it.

599
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,800
 I love Nicki, by the way.

600
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,160
 Don't think I'm criticizing Nicki.

601
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,680
 I love my man, Nicki, okay?

602
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,680
 But I'm making a point.

603
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,120
 You get the point?

604
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,760
 See, here's the issue.

605
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,000
 We live in Hong Kong,

606
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,160
 and Hong Kong is one of the busiest places

607
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,320
 and cultures to live in.

608
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,560
 In other words, your time is the biggest resource

609
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,360
 that you have, the most important thing in your hand.

610
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:07,480
 And if your approach to intimacy with Jesus this year

611
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:09,760
 is gonna be based on whether you're busy or not,

612
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,960
 let me just tell you, you're gonna be busy this year.

613
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,160
 And when you're busy, you will naturally default

614
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,200
 to what is easiest in your spiritual life.

615
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
 And what is easiest in your spiritual life

616
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:22,800
 is gleaning rather than harvesting,

617
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,240
 'cause harvesting's gonna take some work.

618
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,480
 Harvesting's gonna require you to put some time aside

619
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,320
 and open the Bible.

620
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,320
 Harvesting's gonna require you to pray.

621
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,160
 Harvesting's gonna require you

622
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,080
 to roll up your sleeves a little bit

623
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,200
 and prioritize what it is

624
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,960
 to take the spiritual things in your life

625
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,360
 and wrestle with them and pray with them with God,

626
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,440
 share them with others, get their input and help.

627
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,640
 That's the gleaning part that can help within it.

628
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,640
 But the harvesting is work.

629
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,720
 If you don't wanna work, then just glean.

630
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,200
 But if you're gonna glean predominantly,

631
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,480
 you're gonna struggle in intimacy with Jesus.

632
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:59,880
 When we harvest, what we're doing

633
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,520
 is we're posturing ourselves for His revelation.

634
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,760
 And gleaning, although it's so easy,

635
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,400
 only ever leads us to a place

636
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,360
 where we'll fall shallow and empty.

637
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,000
 You were designed for the harvest.

638
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,400
 Jesus died for that for you.

639
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,080
 Don't let the enemy get you so busy

640
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,280
 that you find yourself constantly defaulting

641
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,240
 to somebody else's revelation rather than getting your own.

642
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,040
 Don't allow yourself to be so lazy

643
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:39,560
 that you're just surviving off the throwaways

644
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:43,040
 of your pastor rather than actually investing

645
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,480
 in the scriptures for yourself.

646
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:52,080
 You need to move from rumors of God to a firsthand faith.

647
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,920
 Here's something you need to know about rumors.

648
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,880
 In the absence of revelation, rumors grow.

649
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,920
 In the absence of revelation and truth, rumors grow.

650
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,840
 And when we keep God at an arm's length,

651
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:08,120
 when we keep Him at a distance to us,

652
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,440
 when we hold Him away from us

653
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,520
 and we just consume what other people

654
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,600
 are experiencing with Him

655
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,400
 and not walking into that for ourselves,

656
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,680
 we're much more vulnerable to rumors of God,

657
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,440
 much more vulnerable as people

658
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,640
 to what everybody else seems to have a perspective

659
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,840
 and opinion, and we end up shaping and making life decisions

660
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:30,480
 on somebody else's opinion of God.

661
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,680
 This was really important to Jesus.

662
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,400
 Jesus, throughout the Gospels,

663
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,400
 wrestled with this with His disciples.

664
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,680
 And there's this beautiful moment in Mark chapter eight.

665
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,120
 Is this helping someone?

666
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,640
 You guys okay?

667
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,840
 In Mark chapter eight,

668
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:49,480
 Jesus begins to shift the focus to His disciples

669
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,320
 because He wants them to move from rumor of God

670
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,400
 to revelation of who He is.

671
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,520
 And so let me pick this up from verse 27.

672
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,440
 Jesus and His disciples went on to the villages

673
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,480
 around Caesarea Philippi.

674
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,480
 On the way, He asked them, "Who do people say I am?"

675
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,480
 What a great question.

676
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,320
 He says to the disciples, "What are the rumors about me?

677
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,320
 "What does everybody else think?

678
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,640
 "What does everybody else think about me?

679
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,080
 "Those that are not like you,

680
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,680
 "who are walking day in, day out with me,

681
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:22,480
 "those that are in the crowds at a distance,

682
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,360
 "what do they think that I am?"

683
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,360
 And the disciples knew, they said this,

684
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,840
 "Well, some say you're John the Baptist.

685
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,960
 "Others say Elijah, and still others, one of the prophets.

686
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,720
 "They say, 'Here's what the rumors are about you.

687
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,240
 "'Here's what people are convinced that you are.

688
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,840
 "'I mean, they've heard things about you.'

689
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,680
 "And so they've just said,

690
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,280
 "'Well, that must be John the Baptist.'

691
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,840
 "Or they think you're Elijah,

692
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,120
 "or they just think you're one of the great prophets

693
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,840
 "because they've heard of what you did

694
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,520
 "and the healing that happened over here.

695
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,480
 "They just heard about it."

696
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
 They didn't witness it, by the way.

697
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,440
 "They just heard about it.

698
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,840
 "And so they defined you based on the rumor

699
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,720
 "of what they've heard.

700
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:59,000
 "So they say to Jesus, 'Here are all the rumors.'"

701
00:29:59,000 --> 00:29:59,840
 And guess what?

702
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,840
 All the rumors were wrong.

703
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,160
 And so then Jesus says what I think

704
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,600
 is one of the most critical things.

705
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,720
 He says, "But what about you?

706
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:11,520
 "Who do you say I am?"

707
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:15,000
 For some of you at the beginning of 2024,

708
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,760
 that is the most critical question

709
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,480
 that Jesus is asking you this year.

710
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,440
 In a year of intimacy,

711
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,200
 he's starting with saying, "Who do you think I am?"

712
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,820
 Forget what Andrew thinks.

713
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,160
 I mean, don't fully forget what I think.

714
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,440
 I hope you come here and learn some things, okay?

715
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,280
 But yeah, forget what Andrew thinks.

716
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,640
 Forget what the vine says.

717
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,320
 I'm more interested, Jesus says,

718
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,760
 about you and your heart.

719
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,840
 Who do you think I am?

720
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,320
 And here's Peter's response,

721
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,120
 perhaps one of the most profound things

722
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,960
 in the New Testament.

723
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,480
 Peter answered, "You are the Messiah.

724
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,840
 "You're not John the Baptist.

725
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:54,760
 "You're not some Elijah.

726
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,320
 "You're not just simply a prophet.

727
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,280
 "You're the son of God.

728
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,120
 "You're the Messiah.

729
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,880
 "You're the one that Israel has been longing for.

730
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:02,920
 "We have been with you day in and day out.

731
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,040
 "We're not existing off the fumes of some rumors

732
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,200
 "and trying to make some meal of faith

733
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,840
 "off of the tidbits and throwaways

734
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,520
 "and the leftovers of somebody else.

735
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:12,720
 "We've walked with you.

736
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,800
 "We've been with you.

737
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,080
 "We've seen the miracles.

738
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,280
 "We've heard your teaching.

739
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,940
 "We've not always been comfortable with it.

740
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:18,780
 "We've struggled with it.

741
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,040
 "We've been confused at times,

742
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,360
 "if I'm honest with you, Jesus.

743
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,320
 "But I cannot say, I cannot deny

744
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,560
 "that after all of that relationship with you,

745
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,000
 "you are not Elijah.

746
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,080
 "You're not John the Baptist.

747
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,280
 "You are the Messiah.

748
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,120
 "You're Jesus.

749
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:31,960
 "That's who I know.

750
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,820
 "And that doesn't come to me

751
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,780
 "because someone else has told me," Peter is saying,

752
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,440
 "that is my revelation from my intimacy with you.

753
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:41,160
 "You are the Messiah."

754
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:46,760
 Peter profoundly moves from rumor of God

755
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,400
 to firsthand revelation and declaration.

756
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,320
 And on the back of that revelation,

757
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,040
 Jesus changes everything in his ministry.

758
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:56,760
 He starts heading towards Jerusalem

759
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,280
 until the death on the cross

760
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,520
 because somebody now has got it.

761
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:02,240
 Somebody has connected with him.

762
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:05,320
 And you need to understand that when we exist on gleaning

763
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,720
 rather than harvesting,

764
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:10,040
 when we make our diet predominantly rumor

765
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:12,040
 rather than actually revelation with him,

766
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,400
 here's what rumor will do.

767
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,040
 Rumor will tell you the what of God,

768
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:18,680
 but it can never tell you the who of God.

769
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,360
 It'll tell you what about God,

770
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,040
 but it can't tell you the who of God.

771
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,840
 And here's the thing I really want you to understand.

772
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:29,800
 If you really base your relationship with God

773
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:33,800
 only on rumor of him, you will find yourself,

774
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:34,640
 this is really key,

775
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,720
 you will find yourself knowing what God is,

776
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,320
 but not who God is.

777
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,960
 You will find yourself with other people's information,

778
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,280
 but not your own revelation.

779
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:51,660
 You will find yourself with knowledge, but not intimacy.

780
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,080
 You will find yourself with knowledge,

781
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:59,640
 but not necessarily intimacy.

782
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:05,440
 The work of intimacy is moving from the what of God

783
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,440
 to the who of God.

784
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:11,440
 It's moving away from rumor of him and information of him

785
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,440
 to firsthand faith, firsthand encounter.

786
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,680
 And I wanna just say

787
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,560
 that one of the greatest fallacies in the church,

788
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,240
 and I think we struggle with this here in Hong Kong

789
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,720
 quite a bit, is that we have this misperception

790
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:28,440
 that those who are really knowledgeable of God

791
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,380
 are also really intimate with God.

792
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,820
 Let me preach on this one for a moment.

793
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,240
 We have this misperception, it's a fallacy actually,

794
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:40,120
 that those who appear really knowledgeable of God

795
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:42,720
 are therefore very intimate with God.

796
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,540
 And trust me, that is not always the case.

797
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,960
 But the problem that we have

798
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:51,000
 is that we see somebody who's super knowledgeable of God,

799
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,880
 and we know that they're knowledgeable,

800
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,640
 and we've seen them speak things

801
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:57,520
 that have really changed our lives.

802
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,360
 And we look at this person and we put them on a pedestal

803
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,440
 and we say, "This person really knows God.

804
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,840
 And if I can just follow this person,

805
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,320
 if I could just follow this pastor

806
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,400
 or this church or this ministry,

807
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,960
 if I could align myself to that,

808
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,040
 and if I could just pick up the scraps

809
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,580
 of their revelation with God, I tell you what,

810
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,560
 my gleaning of that person

811
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,760
 because of their knowledge of God

812
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,280
 is way better than the harvesting that I could ever have.

813
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:23,080
 So I would rather align myself to glean from them

814
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,080
 than harvest myself."

815
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:26,120
 We think this way in the church.

816
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,540
 And Jesus said, "Follow me."

817
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,080
 He didn't say, "Follow that pastor, follow that church."

818
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,120
 Now again, okay, it's good to follow churches,

819
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,720
 good to follow pastors, okay?

820
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,040
 Everybody with me?

821
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,600
 It's a preaching technique called taking you to the extreme

822
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,800
 to help bring you back to the middle, okay?

823
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,640
 (congregation laughing)

824
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,120
 Don't misinterpret what I'm saying,

825
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,480
 but I hope you hear what I'm saying, right?

826
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,760
 That Jesus says, "Follow me."

827
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:55,280
 And we follow Christ because we are in the harvest field

828
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,320
 as a harvester, not a gleaner.

829
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,400
 And some of you here,

830
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,360
 if you really want to move in intimacy with Jesus this year,

831
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:05,120
 it's gonna have to be a shift for you

832
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,520
 from a life that is predominantly building

833
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,480
 a relationship with Jesus

834
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,960
 off of somebody else's relationship with Jesus

835
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,440
 to a firsthand faith.

836
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,920
 We have this thing where we think this,

837
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,840
 we think the one with the most knowledge

838
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,560
 has the most access.

839
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:27,960
 But you need to understand that all of us have equal access

840
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,920
 when it comes to the person of Jesus.

841
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,000
 We think that the one with knowledge has more access.

842
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,400
 Well, that must be how they got all their knowledge

843
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,360
 because they got this great access to Jesus.

844
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:38,960
 And if only I had that access,

845
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,560
 the reality is every single one of us,

846
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,560
 whether you're a day old Christian

847
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,360
 or you've been a Christian for 50 years,

848
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,520
 has the same access to the person of Jesus Christ.

849
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,400
 There is this beautiful part in the book of Hebrews.

850
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,720
 Let me just read this to you quickly.

851
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,560
 In the book of Hebrews, it says this, the writer,

852
00:35:57,560 --> 00:35:59,520
 he says, "Therefore, brothers and sisters,

853
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,960
 "since we have confidence to enter the most holy place

854
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,720
 "by the blood of Jesus," notice this,

855
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,300
 "by the blood of Jesus," not by how much you know,

856
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,960
 "but simply by the blood of Jesus,

857
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,400
 "by a new and living way open to us through the curtain,"

858
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,840
 that is his body,

859
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,920
 "and since we have a great priest over the house of God,

860
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,400
 "let us draw near to God with a sincere heart

861
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,560
 "in full assurance of faith."

862
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,800
 Let every single one of us draw near to God

863
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:28,240
 out of full assurance of faith.

864
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:30,080
 Why? Because you're smart? No.

865
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,080
 Why? Because you know more than someone else? No.

866
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,920
 Why? Because you've got a better experience of God

867
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:35,040
 than someone else? No.

868
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,000
 Simply because the blood of Jesus

869
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,400
 has been shed on the cross,

870
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,080
 and you now, because of the life, death,

871
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:42,920
 and resurrection of Jesus, have your sins forgiven,

872
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,280
 which means you're redeemed and you're renewed,

873
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,040
 you now have Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father

874
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:52,560
 interceding on your behalf, you have access.

875
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,620
 You're not a gleaner.

876
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:58,200
 You haven't been, put it this way,

877
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,120
 Jesus did not go to the cross

878
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,520
 so that you would glean somebody else's intimacy.

879
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:07,960
 Jesus went to the cross to pay a very high price

880
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,480
 so that you would have the joy and the wonder

881
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,280
 of a relationship with him.

882
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,280
 Never forfeit the privilege of your relationship with God

883
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,600
 by outsourcing it to someone else.

884
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:26,040
 Never forfeit the privilege of your relationship with Jesus

885
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,760
 by outsourcing it to someone else.

886
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:31,600
 Can you learn from others? Absolutely.

887
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:34,680
 Is it good to glean? 100%.

888
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,440
 Are there amazing people in church history

889
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:38,040
 that have a lot to teach us?

890
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,760
 Yes, yes, yes.

891
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,880
 But intimacy comes from trading rumors of God

892
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,240
 to firsthand faith.

893
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:49,000
 There's a book in the Old Testament

894
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,320
 that preaches what I'm telling you today

895
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:53,620
 over the whole book, it's the book of Job.

896
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,160
 Job also, like Ruth, a story of a family,

897
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,840
 a story of a family that begins and ends,

898
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:02,760
 or begins and they go into immediate,

899
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,600
 complete travesty as a family.

900
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,760
 Job is left on his own.

901
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,240
 And interestingly, from chapters two

902
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,400
 all the way through to chapter 37,

903
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,120
 Job is surrounded by three friends

904
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,440
 that have a lot of rumors of God.

905
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,040
 Three friends that show up and say,

906
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,760
 "Maybe this is why this is happening.

907
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,040
 "Have you thought about this?

908
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,320
 "Did you know this about God?

909
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,540
 "Have you repented of this?

910
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,680
 "Has this happened to you?"

911
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,880
 Three really well-meaning friends

912
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,040
 with lots of ideas and opinions and thoughts of God.

913
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:32,200
 And every single step of the way through the chapters,

914
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,920
 Job is more and more confused about who God is,

915
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,120
 why this has happened, and the rumors are not helping him.

916
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:43,960
 He's starving despite an influx of rumors of God.

917
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:48,800
 But in chapter 38, God breaks through it all and speaks

918
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,380
 and pushes the three friends to one side

919
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:53,360
 and he speaks to Job.

920
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,580
 And he takes four chapters and he says,

921
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,420
 "You wanna know who I am?

922
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:57,680
 "This is who I am.

923
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,160
 "This is really who I am.

924
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,420
 "And this is how I operate.

925
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:01,920
 "And these are the things that I do.

926
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,080
 "And this is my glory.

927
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,000
 "And this is who you are in relation to me."

928
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,120
 And he lays it all out for four chapters.

929
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:12,120
 And in chapter 42, finally, Job now responds to God.

930
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,320
 I wanna read you how Job responds.

931
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:16,560
 I'm gonna read from Eugene Peterson's version

932
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,520
 of the message.

933
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:21,720
 It says this, "I admit I once lived by rumors of you,

934
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,320
 "but now I have it all firsthand

935
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,140
 "from my own eyes and ears.

936
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,580
 "I'm sorry, forgive me.

937
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,980
 "I'll never do that again.

938
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:32,900
 "I promise I'll never again live on crusts or hearsay,

939
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,640
 "crumbs or rumors."

940
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,540
 The NIV writes it this way in verse five.

941
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:42,540
 "My ears had heard of you, but now my eyes have seen you.

942
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:45,880
 "I had the rumor I could hear things about you,

943
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:48,200
 "but now I've encountered you for myself.

944
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,240
 "I am not a gleaner, I'm a harvester.

945
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:54,180
 "And that has changed everything in me."

946
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:59,320
 Intimacy is found when we shift from rumor to revelation.

947
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,560
 Intimacy is found when we use the gleaning in our life

948
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:08,100
 to catalyze a deeper, more effective harvesting of Him.

949
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,880
 That's what He's opened up for us.

950
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,880
 It's what He's opened up for you.

951
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,760
 And as you start this year with a call on you

952
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:18,160
 to intimacy with Him,

953
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,720
 it has to start with an honest reflection.

954
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,200
 Am I worshiping a secondhand Jesus?

955
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,420
 Do I have a borrowed faith?

956
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:33,080
 And while I'm not gonna get rid of all of that stuff,

957
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:34,760
 'cause it is all helpful,

958
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:39,640
 am I predominantly primarily building my relationship

959
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:44,080
 with Jesus off of my relationship with Jesus?

960
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:49,640
 Am I a harvester or am I a gleaner?

961
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:52,840
 My prayer for you is that you would hear Jesus say,

962
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:56,820
 "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."

963
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:01,080
 And I wonder whether we would grab a hold

964
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,100
 of the harvest this year in our intimacy with Him.

965
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,480
 Amen?

966
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,120
 Can I pray for you?

967
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:08,960
 Can we stand together?

968
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:09,780
 Let's pray.

969
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:13,480
 And as you stand, I want you just to

970
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,160
 quieten down your heart.

971
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,600
 Maybe let's just open our hands

972
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:20,760
 if you're comfortable to do that.

973
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,640
 Let's come into a posture of

974
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:25,800
 preparing ourselves to hear from Him.

975
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,840
 I've done a lot of talking.

976
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,300
 I'm gonna shut up in a moment

977
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:35,260
 because really I don't want any more gleaning here.

978
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,640
 I want some harvesting.

979
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,160
 And if this message has been helpful to you,

980
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:42,960
 there's been some good gleaning for you

981
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,720
 out of our time together this afternoon.

982
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,040
 Now's the time for you to move towards harvest with Him.

983
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,240
 And I wanna create some space for you to pray with Him,

984
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,620
 to spend time with Him,

985
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:57,080
 to listen to Him, to His voice for you.

986
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,780
 And some of you, it might be this idea

987
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,820
 of a secondhand Jesus,

988
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:06,300
 and realizing that it's been a while

989
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:11,300
 since you've actually spent just time with Him yourself.

990
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:14,400
 Put away the helpful things,

991
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,080
 but come just rawly in prayer.

992
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:21,980
 Open the scriptures for yourself to read

993
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,780
 and ask the Holy Spirit to give you revelation and word.

994
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:30,320
 For some of you, it might be that you've

995
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,100
 taken room for revelation.

996
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,460
 For some of you, it might be

997
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:40,980
 that you found yourself worshiping knowledge over intimacy,

998
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:47,220
 that you've been quite proud of what you know of God,

999
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:52,380
 and that maybe you've held onto that pride,

1000
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:55,840
 but you realize that you actually,

1001
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,860
 if you're honest with yourself,

1002
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:58,820
 you don't really know Him personally.

1003
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:02,660
 Maybe you've got some great theology,

1004
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:07,380
 but you don't know Jesus truly.

1005
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,500
 It'll be different for all of us.

1006
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:18,580
 Take a time, take some time to listen to His voice for you.

1007
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,400
 He loves you so much.

1008
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:24,540
 He draws near to you.
