1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,560
 And wow, good morning to the 11 o'clock service.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,560
 You guys can sing.

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,400
 That's great.

4
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,880
 And welcome also to those online who are with us today.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,480
 Normally we worship in the nine o'clock,

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,440
 so this is our neighborhood over here,

7
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,000
 but this is okay over here too,

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:16,880
 but this is where we sit.

9
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,320
 And it's just great to be celebrating here

10
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,440
 with the 11 o'clock service.

11
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,860
 And thank you, Carla, for those words.

12
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,100
 And also Emma for that word again, trust.

13
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,100
 You know, a little bit of homework

14
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:32,520
 just to get us started right away is,

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,300
 trust is a powerful word.

16
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,620
 And we're gonna talk about it a little bit

17
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,160
 in the sermon today,

18
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:40,300
 but you might just write that word down every morning,

19
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,360
 like on your journal or maybe by your computer or something,

20
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,480
 because it's a powerful word.

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:51,000
 And amen, we do not worship a God of scarcity.

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,880
 We worship a God of generosity, who's more than enough.

23
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,260
 And you are always more than enough too,

24
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:01,420
 with our character leadership, with our students.

25
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,780
 It's one of the things we send the message then,

26
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,840
 that you are enough,

27
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,060
 as much as the world tries to make us think otherwise.

28
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:09,900
 Amen?

29
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,720
 - Amen.

30
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,180
 - Okay, so we've heard some good words already.

31
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,520
 Also, dad's, happy Father's Day.

32
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:18,700
 It's dad's day.

33
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,940
 My daughter, our daughter, our middle daughter

34
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:23,940
 is living in New York,

35
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,140
 and she has a film production company.

36
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,940
 So I'm always telling her, tell good dad stories.

37
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,900
 The world needs more good dad stories, amen?

38
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,340
 So yeah, we need probably less dad jokes,

39
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,260
 but we need more good dad stories.

40
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:40,900
 Actually, you can never have enough dad jokes.

41
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,820
 Keep them going, dads.

42
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,660
 We'll keep going.

43
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:50,140
 So what I will do this morning is just share

44
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,580
 a little bit from the word of God.

45
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,900
 We're gonna look at a passage together,

46
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,180
 and also just share something of what I've been learning

47
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:02,700
 at the university, learning in life here in Hong Kong.

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,700
 And there's a professor at Harvard, Arthur Brooks,

49
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:13,780
 and he says that all research is really me-search.

50
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:17,060
 So all research is really me-search,

51
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,720
 because the researchers are actually trying

52
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,780
 to figure out a question or a problem

53
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,540
 that they're really interested in

54
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,380
 or that they're struggling with, right?

55
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,940
 So that's what he kind of says.

56
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,620
 And as a researcher, I would say it's pretty similar

57
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:34,140
 to sermons as well, that oftentimes sermons are ones

58
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,080
 that the pastor, the preacher is also working through

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,060
 in questions that affect all of us.

60
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,240
 And that is definitely the case today,

61
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,100
 because God is working on me in this sermon.

62
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,420
 And I want to share a little bit of what he's saying.

63
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:54,820
 Vision Sunday, Pastor Andrew gave us this word,

64
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,260
 uncharted, uncharted.

65
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,660
 What does it mean to be in uncharted territory,

66
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,660
 unfamiliar territory?

67
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,720
 And the passage that we're gonna look at today

68
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,140
 has a lot to do with how we can respond in uncharted times.

69
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,940
 And last week, as Carla said,

70
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:15,860
 we finished up the sermon series on the Holy Spirit,

71
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,940
 but today we'll hear again about the Holy Spirit,

72
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,020
 'cause the Holy Spirit is the one

73
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,540
 that guides us in uncharted times.

74
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,540
 But the primary way I believe he guides us

75
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,000
 is through the word of God.

76
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:32,940
 So don't let Sunday be the only day

77
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,520
 you open the word of God, amen?

78
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:41,740
 Open it up in the morning before you go out into our world

79
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,860
 and open yourself to it,

80
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:47,300
 and you will find something for you

81
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:51,620
 or and something for someone else.

82
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:57,020
 Few weeks ago, I had breakfast with a leader

83
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,100
 here in Hong Kong, and I've admired him for some time.

84
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,740
 We've had the honor of kind of working together

85
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,020
 in little places, and I've always admired him,

86
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,940
 but particularly I've admired him

87
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:09,500
 how in the toughest of times,

88
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,320
 in the meetings that seem to,

89
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,860
 or the situations that seem the most complicated,

90
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,100
 he's always calm and he has wisdom and he's kind,

91
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,200
 kind of kind, calm, and confident.

92
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,380
 So I thought, I think I'll have a breakfast with him

93
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,020
 and try to find out a little bit how he does that

94
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,940
 and just get to know him a little bit better,

95
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,260
 and also to ask for some of his prayers.

96
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:30,460
 And so we got together for breakfast

97
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:35,460
 and I found out that he has memorized over 1,000 verses.

98
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,900
 Wow, that's a high bar, right?

99
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:45,820
 And he's an accountant, so he's not exaggerating, right?

100
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,520
 Numbers are important to him.

101
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,020
 But he started young, and it's coming through his life.

102
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:57,940
 So we're gonna look at the word of God

103
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,360
 and say, what does it have to say to us this morning?

104
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:09,220
 When our family was young, we were living in Switzerland,

105
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,460
 and at that time, that's where I started

106
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,540
 my theological education, there at the University of Zurich.

107
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,020
 So at one point in the University of Zurich,

108
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,880
 which Zurich is German speaking,

109
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,700
 I was studying Greek in German, okay?

110
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,040
 So I was studying (speaking in foreign language)

111
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,620
 Now, here's the problem.

112
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,720
 My Greek was not that good, right?

113
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,300
 And my German was not that good either.

114
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,740
 So every day in my translations,

115
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,820
 there was a new heresy, right?

116
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,780
 But the main thing is it was taking me forever

117
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,940
 to kind of get through the courses, right?

118
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,700
 And so I thought, man, I'm not gonna finish this

119
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,780
 before Jesus comes back.

120
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:58,800
 And for some reason, that was important to me, right?

121
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,140
 So Marian and I talked, and what we decided is

122
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,180
 that I would transfer.

123
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,780
 So I transferred to Princeton Theological Seminary.

124
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
 We flew there with our family

125
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,980
 about two days after we landed there.

126
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:14,660
 Then I was on the playground with our daughter,

127
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,300
 young daughter, she was about three years old at the age.

128
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:19,620
 We're on the playground, we're doing the dad thing, right?

129
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,300
 We're pushing swings, we're doing duck under and all that,

130
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,820
 you know, and we're having fun there,

131
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:26,020
 but someone calls my name.

132
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,180
 And then I look across the playground

133
00:06:28,180 --> 00:06:30,300
 and this guy's running towards me.

134
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,540
 I recognize him, his name's Tomas.

135
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,780
 He was from the Czech Republic.

136
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,980
 And he came up to me and we started kind of joking

137
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,460
 and laughing, and Tomas has like long brown hair.

138
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:45,460
 He's a young PhD student, beard, kind of a rugged face.

139
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,060
 And so we're just laughing and joking.

140
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:50,500
 I'd met him, yeah, just like I said, a couple days before.

141
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,220
 And then, but I noticed that the whole time

142
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,760
 I'm talking with Tomas, our daughter, my daughter,

143
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,300
 cannot take her eyes off of him.

144
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:05,260
 And she's just got these big eyes looking at Tomas.

145
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:08,380
 And so we talk a little bit, someone else calls Tomas name,

146
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,980
 he goes running over there.

147
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,860
 And I turn back to my daughter and she says to me,

148
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,460
 where did Jesus go?

149
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:19,820
 [congregation laughing]

150
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,500
 And I thought, good, my daughter thinks I have

151
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,020
 such a great relationship with Jesus

152
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,500
 that we can laugh and joke and he knows my name

153
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:28,140
 and this is good, this is good, right?

154
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,260
 I was quite flattered.

155
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:35,260
 But that question, where did Jesus go, is a tough one.

156
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:45,420
 It's one probably we've all asked at some point

157
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,580
 if we've been following Jesus.

158
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,820
 It's also maybe one we're asking right now.

159
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:54,940
 It may be one that we will ask or someone we know

160
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:58,820
 and love is asking right now because it's a tough time.

161
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:02,500
 We can't see what Jesus is doing, where Jesus is,

162
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,340
 where is God in this situation?

163
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:09,580
 Maybe it's uncertain times, uncharted times.

164
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,100
 We just don't know the way we should go.

165
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:15,860
 Maybe we're overwhelmed at work with everything

166
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:19,220
 that's going on and put on us, the demands on us.

167
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:21,980
 Maybe it's in the family, maybe it's an illness,

168
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:25,980
 maybe even worse, it's the illness of someone we love.

169
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,060
 We don't know what it is but we go through these times

170
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,660
 where they're definitely uncharted

171
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:35,860
 and they're also the times where in the night often,

172
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,440
 we're lying there and we're saying, God, where are you?

173
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:45,380
 I was following you and then I've lost you.

174
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,460
 Where are you, Jesus?

175
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,300
 Amen?

176
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:53,580
 So the word of God has a word for that and some strategies

177
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,560
 that if we're finding ourselves in that situation,

178
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,180
 I've found to be helpful and I hope they can be helpful

179
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,460
 to you as well.

180
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:06,140
 So we're looking at Acts chapter 16

181
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,140
 and from 25, verse 25 to 34.

182
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:15,740
 And we'll just look through and then kind of allow ourselves

183
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:18,560
 to be open to what the scripture is saying.

184
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:23,260
 Now, the scripture starts with about midnight,

185
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,540
 Paul and Silas were praying.

186
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,020
 But let's stop there because we need to know

187
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:33,100
 what happened before about midnight.

188
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,960
 Because about midnight, something's going on.

189
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:37,260
 Midnight is the darkest part of the night.

190
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,420
 Metaphorically, it's the part where we cannot see.

191
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,780
 It is the part where we are only walking by faith

192
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,820
 and not by sight.

193
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,700
 It's a dark night, right?

194
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,340
 And so what happened before then?

195
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,660
 What happened before then is about earlier,

196
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:51,620
 I don't know how long, maybe a couple weeks earlier,

197
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,940
 Paul and Silas have arrived in Philippi

198
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,980
 where the letter of Philippians was going to.

199
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,160
 They've arrived in Philippi.

200
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,860
 They've met a businesswoman named Lydia.

201
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,420
 She's a trader of purple cloths,

202
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,180
 so she's doing quite well.

203
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,940
 They meet her.

204
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:10,820
 She opens her home to have the church in her home

205
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:14,300
 and they're out on the street worshiping publicly

206
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,740
 and preaching publicly and healing.

207
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,580
 And one of the individuals they heal is a slave girl.

208
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,180
 And this slave girl, because of possession,

209
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,900
 had the ability to foretell the future.

210
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,660
 And so her owners, her masters,

211
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:31,940
 were making a lot of money off her.

212
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,540
 And when they healed her, that left.

213
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,460
 And so you can kind of follow the money, right?

214
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,100
 So the owners are furious.

215
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,100
 And so what they do is they accuse Paul and Silas

216
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,500
 of public disorder and they call the magistrates

217
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,540
 and they create this huge ruckus.

218
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:56,260
 And what ends up happening is without any justice,

219
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,860
 without any trial, Paul and Silas are beaten

220
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,660
 and they're taken and they're thrown in jail.

221
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:06,580
 And the jailer is told, put them in the deepest,

222
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,420
 kind of the darkest, the dankest,

223
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:12,780
 the very middle of the prison and put them in stocks.

224
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:18,460
 That's what happened before about midnight.

225
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:22,500
 So now our verse starts, "About midnight,

226
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:27,500
 "Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God

227
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,100
 "and the prisoners were listening to them.

228
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,260
 "And suddenly there's a great earthquake

229
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,500
 "so that the foundation of the prison was shaken

230
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,660
 "and immediately all the doors were opened

231
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,900
 "and everyone's bonds were unfastened."

232
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,500
 Okay, let's stop there because I think there's already

233
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,580
 a couple of strategies of what you and I can do

234
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:52,980
 if we find ourselves in a time of uncertainty

235
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,940
 in uncharted times.

236
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:57,740
 The first thing, write the first three words.

237
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,460
 So we read there, Paul and Silas.

238
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:04,620
 If you had a marker, underline and 'cause that's the key word

239
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,540
 the first thing is when you're in a tough time,

240
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,940
 when you're in uncharted territory,

241
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,060
 when you don't know which way to go, find your and.

242
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:14,780
 We have Paul and Silas.

243
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,220
 Earlier we would have had Paul and Barnabas.

244
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:20,800
 Later we're gonna have Paul and Timothy.

245
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,980
 This is the way Paul lived and worked.

246
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:29,820
 For 41 years, Marian has been my and.

247
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:34,820
 And she's been my and through tough times in.

248
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:39,820
 She's in my and right now during uncharted times.

249
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:42,500
 I have reached the prestigious age

250
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:46,900
 of being the mandatory retirement age at HKU.

251
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,260
 So I'm about to step into uncharted territory.

252
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:54,460
 Do you remember what I said about me search?

253
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,020
 This is about this, we're dealing with this as well.

254
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:00,820
 And Marian and I will go through as an and.

255
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,500
 And you know I'm in pretty good hands there

256
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,600
 because if you met Marian, you know she is

257
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,480
 the significantly better half of the equation.

258
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:13,140
 But it's not about ands just in the personal life.

259
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:17,020
 It's about a way of life.

260
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,980
 Finding your and is a way of life.

261
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,900
 And it'll happen in different spheres.

262
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,660
 Because if you're like me, it's probably not just one area.

263
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:27,100
 There may be one area that you're most concerned at,

264
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,380
 but there's a lot of other areas that challenge us as well.

265
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,340
 And so like at the university where we were helping start

266
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:37,580
 the character leadership program for undergraduates,

267
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:39,740
 it was uncharted territory.

268
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,700
 So I had a co-leader and he and I co-led.

269
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,260
 And we've just handed over to two very gifted

270
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,880
 uprising scholars and they will co-lead.

271
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,020
 One of the things we tell our students is

272
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,940
 don't do life alone.

273
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:57,060
 Find your and.

274
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:01,840
 Marian and I have been here 16 years now in Hong Kong.

275
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,260
 And during that time, first month I was here,

276
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:09,500
 I met a pastor by God's kind of gift.

277
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,300
 He lived right next door to me.

278
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:14,180
 And so we started having a coffee one month.

279
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:15,300
 We had a coffee the next month.

280
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,180
 And for the next 16 years till now,

281
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:22,420
 we're trying to, we have a coffee or a lunch every month.

282
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,180
 And we're each other's and.

283
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,620
 Encouraging each other, building each other up,

284
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,740
 laughing together with each other.

285
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,780
 There's two theologians, Harawass and Pinchas.

286
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,460
 And I think they say this beautifully.

287
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:36,340
 So it's a long quote, but I wanna show you this quote

288
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,540
 and read you this quote.

289
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:43,600
 Starts with returning once again, they write,

290
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,080
 to our metaphor of the moral life as a journey.

291
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:49,440
 It's obvious, as Aristotle himself notes,

292
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,020
 that a journey is better undertaken

293
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:54,600
 with companions than alone.

294
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,580
 At the very least, we need others

295
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:59,020
 to sustain us along the way.

296
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,040
 But further, and this is important,

297
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,460
 and more strongly, traveling with others is crucial

298
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:08,300
 not only to relieve our boredom or supply a hand

299
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,620
 to hold in the dark and narrow places,

300
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,380
 but as well, the journey requires

301
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:15,820
 that we ourselves be transformed

302
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:18,120
 and we cannot do this without friends.

303
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,960
 Our and is not only just to help us,

304
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:25,600
 it's to help us become who we are.

305
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,780
 And we become who we are during the tough times.

306
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:33,720
 Crucible moments not only develop our character,

307
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,780
 they reveal our character.

308
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,900
 And we have that and working there with us.

309
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,820
 This is not new.

310
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:45,340
 Jesus sent his disciples out two by two.

311
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:48,160
 And he's still doing that.

312
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,440
 That's still a way of life for him.

313
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,960
 He sends you out.

314
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,160
 So we find our and.

315
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,320
 I mean, last weekend, I had a chance

316
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,400
 to kind of work with our CG leaders.

317
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,120
 We were just doing some leadership training,

318
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,240
 and it was great meeting them.

319
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,280
 They're wonderful people.

320
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,600
 They all lead their groups with two or three

321
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,120
 or at least two in the leadership.

322
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,960
 And here's the thing.

323
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,920
 There's 60 of those groups going on here at the Vine.

324
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,720
 So if you're thinking, who's my and,

325
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,360
 or who could be my and,

326
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,960
 you don't have to think about it anymore.

327
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,320
 You can just go right out here to the Connect Hub

328
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,360
 and find out, because they're all open

329
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,420
 to receive new people.

330
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:28,280
 Find your and, and why not today?

331
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,120
 Amen?

332
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:34,960
 Okay, so we've covered about five words right now.

333
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,240
 And so at this pace, I hope you guys brought a packed lunch,

334
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,440
 and we're going to all be together.

335
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,520
 Now, we're gonna have to pick it up.

336
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:45,360
 So first strategy, find your and.

337
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,680
 The second strategy as we go into untartered territories,

338
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,440
 or we find ourselves there, is choose to sing.

339
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,360
 Choose to sing.

340
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,760
 So let's go back to our passage.

341
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,280
 It says, "About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying

342
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:03,160
 "and singing hymns to God,

343
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:06,440
 "and the prisoners were listening to them."

344
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,680
 Okay, we'll stop there.

345
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,640
 Second strategy, choose to sing.

346
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:18,540
 Augustine is purported to have said,

347
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:21,920
 "He who sings, prays twice."

348
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,280
 He who sings, prays twice.

349
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:27,400
 It's in his writing about the power of hymns and worship,

350
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,380
 which we just experienced, right?

351
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,680
 Because we know that.

352
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,320
 Whether Augustine said it or not,

353
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,380
 we know it to be true

354
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,920
 because we've just experienced it, right?

355
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,920
 We're just holding our hands high a few minutes ago,

356
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,080
 and we're singing, but we're praying, aren't we?

357
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:44,800
 And there's that praying and singing.

358
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,320
 We're praying twice.

359
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,480
 It's kind of happening as we're singing.

360
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,640
 And we're calling out this,

361
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,240
 the one I can trust is this one.

362
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,120
 I sought the Lord, and he answered me with that trust.

363
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:00,640
 That's the praying and the singing going together.

364
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,040
 When you're in a hard time, it's a hard time to sing,

365
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,540
 but choose to sing.

366
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:10,060
 In the last, in the church, the community church,

367
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,920
 which I was leading here in Hong Kong for a while,

368
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,560
 we had a prison ministry, and I was part of that team.

369
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,960
 And once a month, we would go to Lai Chi Kok,

370
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,340
 and we would be in Lai Chi Kok,

371
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,640
 and we would basically just be with the brothers.

372
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,800
 We'd do some teaching, we'd do some singing,

373
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,240
 we'd do small groups together,

374
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,800
 basically just to encourage each other,

375
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,680
 be each other's and in that moment.

376
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,200
 And I always was encouraged by them,

377
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,160
 because it's not like we bring Christ into the prison, right?

378
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,200
 Jesus is already in the prison.

379
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,880
 He says, "You visited me in prison," right?

380
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,800
 So we just come and get to be with him there.

381
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:47,400
 But it was a tough time at Christmas,

382
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,560
 because our brothers, obviously, who are there right now,

383
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,740
 even as we're here, they're there and they can't leave.

384
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,640
 And so to Christmas time, that was tough.

385
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,500
 And so we would do songs,

386
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,840
 and we had some great worship people leading us.

387
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,840
 And one year, I remember it specially,

388
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,520
 because that year, we tend to happen,

389
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,560
 because we'd be about 30 or 40 people at that time,

390
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,280
 we tend to have quite a number from South America.

391
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,240
 So we were singing Feliz Navidad, right?

392
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,280
 Now, Feliz Navidad is good, I think, any time of the year,

393
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,760
 but Feliz Navidad, we're just belting it out.

394
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,680
 And that year, we were in the canteen at Lychee Cock,

395
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,120
 which is on the higher floors.

396
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,840
 The windows are open, if you imagine,

397
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,880
 like we're here, windows out there.

398
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:32,600
 And then down below are the basketball courts.

399
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,160
 And we're just singing at the top of our lungs,

400
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,560
 Feliz Navidad, you know?

401
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,080
 And most of it's in Spanish, I don't know what I'm singing,

402
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,440
 but we're just belting it out, right?

403
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,920
 And then later, the people tell us

404
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:48,480
 that the basketball players, they were listening.

405
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:53,280
 Did you hear what Paul, or what Acts says about Paul,

406
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,040
 and the other prisoners were listening?

407
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,040
 Never underestimate your ability

408
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:04,320
 to encourage others around you

409
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,840
 when in a tough time, by the grace of God

410
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,760
 and the power of the Holy Spirit, you choose to sing.

411
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:14,940
 Because we don't know what everyone's going through,

412
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:19,440
 but we know someone, everyone is going through something.

413
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,360
 Philo of Alexandria, he said this.

414
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,360
 He said, "Be kind, because everyone you meet

415
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,060
 "is facing a battle."

416
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,000
 Just look around this room.

417
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,120
 This room is full.

418
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,520
 How many battles do we have going on in here, right?

419
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,640
 So we be kind.

420
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,200
 That's another way of singing.

421
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,020
 When I say choose to sing, it could be literal singing,

422
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,400
 and that's important, and research has shown

423
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,480
 we can build our character.

424
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,460
 There's playlists for characters.

425
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,820
 I mean, there's songs that build up our courage, right?

426
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:57,880
 Like, this is my fight song, take back my life song.

427
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:59,960
 I mean, you know, this is like, right.

428
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,220
 And that's kind of, before I go in a meeting,

429
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,060
 I listen to that song.

430
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,160
 No, but we know the power of music,

431
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,980
 but there's other ways to choose to sing.

432
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,100
 One is being kind.

433
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,780
 Other is maybe giving thanks to God.

434
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:21,160
 When you don't feel like giving thanks to God,

435
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,260
 because there's power in that.

436
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:24,560
 We were in a meeting the other day,

437
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,040
 and one of the professors said,

438
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,580
 there's something kind of almost defiant

439
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:32,740
 by our saying thank you, God, in this situation.

440
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,580
 Why?

441
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,640
 Not thank you for the situation,

442
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,400
 but we thank him because as we sing,

443
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,560
 we can trust him, right?

444
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:42,120
 So maybe, here's some more homework.

445
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,380
 We've already got one homework, another homework coming.

446
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:47,160
 But maybe tomorrow, when you go into

447
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,140
 whatever your work situation is,

448
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:53,260
 maybe it's the dining room table.

449
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:54,420
 Maybe it's an office.

450
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,180
 Maybe it's a studio.

451
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,700
 Maybe you're in front of students.

452
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,360
 Maybe, I don't know where, but right before you start,

453
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,140
 maybe just write down, thank you, God,

454
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,060
 for this time and place.

455
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,540
 Because you can do that.

456
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:15,200
 I've done that sometimes when I wasn't really that thankful,

457
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,900
 but I was thankful when I thought about what it is

458
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,420
 and what God was doing.

459
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:22,260
 That's a choosing to sing.

460
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,900
 That gives courage to you, but also encourages others.

461
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,400
 But be very clear.

462
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,360
 It is a choice to sing.

463
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:37,300
 We do have a choice of how we respond,

464
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,300
 even to the worst of situations.

465
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:46,160
 Viktor Frankl, who has also found himself

466
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,820
 in the worst of the worst of the prisons,

467
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:54,220
 and that is in a concentration camp in Nazi Germany,

468
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,160
 and when most did not survive,

469
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,480
 but he said, as a psychologist, he said,

470
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:03,640
 "They can never take away your power of how you respond."

471
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:07,880
 You choose that.

472
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,580
 Is it a hard choice?

473
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,420
 Yes.

474
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:13,340
 Do you feel like, I think I'll sing right away?

475
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,660
 No, right?

476
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,580
 It's a hard choice.

477
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:18,200
 In fact, for some of us, it's harder than others.

478
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
 I'm not really that good at this,

479
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,800
 but some of my aunts are very good at this.

480
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,820
 Marian's quite good at this,

481
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:28,740
 in terms of facing things with joy.

482
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,200
 Choose to sing.

483
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,820
 That's the second strategy.

484
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,600
 Okay, so now we've finished one verse,

485
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,520
 and we've still got a ways to go,

486
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,040
 but here's this.

487
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,880
 Is this making sense?

488
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,520
 Is this helpful?

489
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,780
 Yeah, all good?

490
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:49,160
 Okay, I'll trust you.

491
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,920
 Let's go on then to the third,

492
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:57,380
 the third strategy, which our passage tells us,

493
00:23:57,380 --> 00:24:00,040
 and I think to understand the rest,

494
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,900
 and we'll take the rest of the verse,

495
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,060
 or the passages, all together,

496
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:06,180
 because it's like they're all connected,

497
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,500
 and when it starts to flow,

498
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,060
 it doesn't stop until the end,

499
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:11,320
 and so we'll take all of those together,

500
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,360
 but there might be two stories

501
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,920
 that would be helpful for you

502
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,160
 before we get right into that scripture.

503
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:21,520
 The first thought that might be helpful to you

504
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,020
 is that when we're on uncharted territory,

505
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,860
 and I have been in that uncharted territory.

506
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,220
 I'm about to be in it again,

507
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:35,820
 but five years ago, I was in that uncharted territory,

508
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,040
 because I went from being in a church

509
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:41,240
 where I had been for about 20 years,

510
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,400
 leading in some capacity,

511
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,060
 and so it was familiar, right?

512
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,800
 And then I went to the university,

513
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,780
 which was uncharted for me, uncharted for me, right?

514
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,000
 It was unfamiliar to me,

515
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,700
 and God, in his grace, gave me a verse,

516
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,960
 and this is the verse he gave me.

517
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:58,960
 He gave me Galatians 5, 25,

518
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,600
 and the verse is, "If we live by the Spirit,

519
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:05,720
 "let us stay in step with the Spirit.

520
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,620
 "If we live by the Spirit,

521
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:10,640
 "let us stay in step with the Spirit."

522
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,460
 That's a great verse if you don't know where you're going,

523
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:14,400
 which I didn't, right?

524
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,380
 My dad, who's a medical missionary for half his life,

525
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,780
 and then he's a microbiologist,

526
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:24,080
 and so, second half, he was as a dean of science

527
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,700
 in a university, but he liked to paraphrase

528
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:31,020
 this Galatians 5, 25, and he would say this.

529
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:34,360
 "If the Lord is the source of your life,

530
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:39,660
 "let him direct the course of your life," right?

531
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:43,820
 So, if the Lord, or the Spirit, is the source of your life,

532
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:48,140
 then let him direct the course of your life,

533
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,340
 and I think this is quite beautiful.

534
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:53,380
 So, I thought I'd put dad there on Father's Day.

535
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,300
 Thought he might like being with Augustine

536
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:58,880
 and Philo of Alexandria, dad of Austin, so.

537
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:04,460
 But he's right.

538
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:09,700
 Then, another little vignette that might be helpful for you

539
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,380
 in understanding the passage really comes

540
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:15,660
 from on HKU campus a few years ago.

541
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:18,700
 We were introducing the service aspect

542
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,420
 of the Character Leadership Program.

543
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,740
 So, we're trying to teach, there's about 600 students

544
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,060
 involved in the program now, all four years.

545
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,100
 It's going to a two-year program next year,

546
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,740
 or actually started this year,

547
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,500
 but we're trying to teach them character leadership.

548
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:34,260
 How do you develop your character?

549
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,460
 One of those ways that we were doing it at the beginning

550
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,900
 was really to have service projects,

551
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,460
 because obviously if you're serving someone else,

552
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,020
 then you're building your character.

553
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,060
 And we tell our students, "It's not about you.

554
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:45,900
 "If you think it's about you,

555
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,700
 "you're never gonna be happy."

556
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:48,860
 If you think it's about another,

557
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,740
 you have a chance of finding that happiness.

558
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,380
 But we thought, who can we ask to come and speak to us

559
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:59,940
 on service leadership?

560
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:04,060
 And so, we immediately thought of Jackie Pullinger.

561
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,380
 Now, what you may not know is that Jackie Pullinger

562
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,060
 has an honorary doctorate from HKU.

563
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,620
 So, that works really well.

564
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:13,540
 But she also, and most importantly,

565
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:18,140
 has dedicated her life and is continuing to serving others.

566
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,900
 And so, we invited her to come on.

567
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,300
 And so, we were interviewing her.

568
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,140
 So, there's a stage,

569
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,460
 and if you imagine you're all the students,

570
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,940
 and then there's up here,

571
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:28,100
 my co-leader was interviewing her, Francis Choi.

572
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:31,220
 So, Francis Choi starts the interview by talking to Jackie,

573
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:34,180
 and he says, "Jackie, you have done so much in your life,

574
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,220
 "and you are doing so much in your life.

575
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,780
 "You must be a very driven person."

576
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:43,180
 And then, Jackie says this.

577
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,300
 She says, "I'm not driven, I'm led."

578
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:51,180
 Now, if you know Jackie, you know how she said that, right?

579
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,820
 "I'm not driven, I'm led."

580
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:59,820
 And that makes all the difference, if you think about it.

581
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,020
 And for our students, it really struck home,

582
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,920
 because they feel driven.

583
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,900
 They feel driven to meet the expectations of others.

584
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,780
 They feel driven to get the best job.

585
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,180
 They feel driven.

586
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:13,420
 It ran home to me.

587
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:15,680
 I'm like taking notes in the back, right?

588
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,840
 Because sometimes I feel driven.

589
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:23,000
 And maybe it resonates with you.

590
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,860
 Maybe there's parts of you that feel more driven than led.

591
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:29,860
 But in Jesus Christ, we are not driven.

592
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,620
 We are led.

593
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:32,460
 Amen?

594
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,540
 Very simple.

595
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:37,300
 Jesus, as a good leader, condensed it down

596
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,620
 to two words of what we're supposed to do.

597
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:42,060
 Follow me.

598
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,080
 That's the plan.

599
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,100
 That was the plan then.

600
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,280
 That's the plan now, is that we follow him.

601
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:53,300
 We are not driven by him.

602
00:28:53,300 --> 00:28:55,940
 We are led by him.

603
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,940
 And Galatians 5.25 has this imagery of a dance, right?

604
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:05,300
 And it's like stay in step with the Holy Spirit.

605
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,100
 So the Holy Spirit's dancing, and we're staying in step.

606
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,700
 Some years ago, Marian and I thought

607
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:13,700
 we would do a couple dancing course.

608
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,580
 And it was fun.

609
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:17,180
 We had a fun time doing it.

610
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,220
 But we had a problem, because it was couples dancing,

611
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,860
 so someone has to lead, right?

612
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,300
 And we're both leaders.

613
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,840
 So this was a trouble, right?

614
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,100
 No one wanted to follow.

615
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:32,140
 But it's not a question in the Holy Spirit.

616
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:34,700
 We follow the Holy Spirit.

617
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:39,140
 And trust me, he has a better plan than I do or you do.

618
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,700
 So we follow the Holy Spirit.

619
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,460
 Now, think about those two things,

620
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:43,940
 following the Holy Spirit.

621
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,660
 Think about we're not driven, we're not led.

622
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,340
 And then let's read through the rest of this passage

623
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,500
 as we get into it.

624
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,460
 So we begin again, and we pick up with verse 27.

625
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:56,020
 "When the jailer woke and he saw

626
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,560
 "that the prison doors were open,

627
00:29:57,560 --> 00:30:00,700
 "he drew his sword and was about to kill himself,

628
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,620
 "supposing that the prisoners had escaped.

629
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,060
 "But Paul cried out with a loud voice,

630
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:08,780
 "'Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.'

631
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:11,020
 "And the jailer called for lights and rushed in,

632
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,860
 "and trembling with fear, the jailer fell down

633
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,580
 "before Paul and Silas."

634
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,980
 This is a turn of events.

635
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,180
 "And then he brought them out and said,

636
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,900
 "'Sirs, what must I do to be saved?'"

637
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,820
 And that word there, saved, literally means,

638
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,740
 it means rescued, it means wholeness,

639
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,000
 complete healing, well-being, it means life overflowing,

640
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,740
 as Carla was talking earlier.

641
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:36,200
 "What must I do to be saved?

642
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,780
 "And they said, 'Believe,'"

643
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,600
 and that word is literally trust,

644
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,400
 "in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,

645
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,320
 "you and your household.'

646
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,500
 "And they spoke the word of the Lord to him."

647
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:46,640
 Do you see how this and is working?

648
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,460
 It doesn't say Paul or Timothy,

649
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,660
 they're just working together.

650
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,380
 They spoke the word of the Lord to him.

651
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,020
 "And he took them the same hour of the night,

652
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,740
 "and he washed their wounds, and he was baptized."

653
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:59,780
 So now we're seeing a conversion experience

654
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,700
 of the jailer, right?

655
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:05,660
 He's making reparations, he's making right for his wrongs,

656
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:08,380
 he's washing them, there's the water of baptism,

657
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,880
 then it goes on, and he invites them into their home,

658
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:14,580
 there's hospitality, he sets food on the table for them,

659
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,780
 right, this is where we like it as Hong Kongers, right?

660
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:19,120
 There's food now, and of course, when food comes,

661
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,660
 then also joy comes, right?

662
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:24,740
 And then it says after that, then there's joy, joy,

663
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:29,020
 unbelievable joy, and I don't think we talk enough

664
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:33,580
 about joy and salvation together, but there's joy.

665
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:45,940
 When I came to the Lord in Northern Nigeria,

666
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:51,300
 it just was an experience that I knew this is right,

667
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,400
 and there was joy.

668
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:56,140
 So let me say this, if there's anyone here

669
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:59,300
 who has not yet said, "I wanna follow him,"

670
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:03,140
 like we've just heard, why not now?

671
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,940
 Why not even today if the Lord is speaking to you?

672
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:08,820
 Because there's always this invitation, follow me.

673
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:11,100
 And all we have to do is kinda crack the window

674
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,580
 a little bit of our hearts, and this joy and change

675
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:18,660
 and rightness comes sweeping in, but we do have to act.

676
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,900
 We do have to say yes, 'cause he's not someone

677
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:23,580
 who's gonna force himself on anyone.

678
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:26,340
 And so we say yes.

679
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,580
 It's the easiest thing in the world to do,

680
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:33,400
 'cause all you have to do is give everything to Jesus.

681
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:37,060
 It's the hardest thing in the world to do,

682
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:40,640
 'cause all you have to do is give everything to Jesus.

683
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,980
 But trust me, it's worth it.

684
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:49,420
 And if you're online, also you're invited.

685
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:56,260
 But most of us in this room probably have said yes,

686
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,340
 and we've been following.

687
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,660
 Sometimes it's been in the dark,

688
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,540
 sometimes we're not sure exactly where it's going.

689
00:33:00,540 --> 00:33:02,500
 Jesus is going, but we follow him.

690
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:06,980
 And so the dance for us is not the dance of salvation.

691
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:11,540
 The dance for us is the dance of staying in step

692
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:12,880
 on a daily basis.

693
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,060
 Now, if the dance metaphor is not working for you,

694
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,660
 that's fine, we can choose another one.

695
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:20,300
 You can say like music with, maybe it's a orchestra

696
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,260
 and the leader is guiding everybody

697
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:26,100
 from what could be cacophony to beautiful music and joy.

698
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,540
 Maybe it's basketball.

699
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,660
 Maybe you're imagining that you're part of the Pacers,

700
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,780
 you're part of the Thunder, and you're kind of tracking that

701
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,380
 and they're just moving so beautifully

702
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,940
 in step with each other.

703
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,260
 Maybe it's just you're taking a walk

704
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:41,540
 and you're with someone you love and you're just in step.

705
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:47,400
 Whatever, the call for all of us is to stay in step

706
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:50,120
 with the Holy Spirit.

707
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,120
 So how do we do that?

708
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:55,560
 So I'm just gonna tell you one way that I have found helpful

709
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,440
 and offer it to you.

710
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,240
 Here's one way we can do it.

711
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,600
 We go back to Galatians 5.25.

712
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,240
 Galatians 5.25.

713
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,520
 If we live by the Spirit,

714
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,240
 let us keep in step with the Spirit, okay?

715
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,740
 So here's how we work with it.

716
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:16,380
 So tomorrow, it's homework number three.

717
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,100
 Sorry, I've gotta get out of the university, right?

718
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,980
 But anyway, homework number three is tomorrow,

719
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,580
 when you go in, before you go in, so that would be today,

720
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,420
 if we live by the Spirit,

721
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,580
 let us keep in step with the Spirit, memorize it.

722
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,560
 Memorize it.

723
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,260
 It's easy to memorize.

724
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,900
 Actually, better learn it by heart

725
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,620
 because there's a difference.

726
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:42,580
 It's not just head knowledge, but learn it by heart.

727
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,180
 While you're memorizing it,

728
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,260
 thinking about how it applies in your life, right?

729
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,700
 That's step one.

730
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,460
 Step two, you go in, you sit down at wherever you are,

731
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,460
 or you stand up wherever you are at work,

732
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,380
 and you just say a prayer.

733
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:57,580
 Jesus, help me stay in step with you today.

734
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,900
 And then just keep your eyes open.

735
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:05,860
 You know, attentiveness is one of the highest forms of love.

736
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,300
 So be attentive to the movements of the Holy Spirit tomorrow

737
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,420
 as you love Jesus, right?

738
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:12,860
 And then just see what happens.

739
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,580
 Sometimes what I find is I just run into random people.

740
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,520
 They're not random at all,

741
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,380
 but they're people I did not expect to run into on campus,

742
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,340
 but I do.

743
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,540
 And then maybe a thought comes, or a call comes,

744
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,860
 or a text comes, or I feel prompted

745
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:27,340
 to send a text of encouragement to someone.

746
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,540
 That's part of the dance.

747
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:31,100
 That's part of staying in step with the Holy Spirit.

748
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:34,200
 So I found that helpful, and I offer it to you.

749
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:40,180
 Something that I think the Spirit can give us.

750
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:43,820
 Spirit is spiritual, but very practical.

751
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:51,840
 So where did Jesus go?

752
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,500
 That was the question.

753
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:58,340
 And sometimes the best questions come from children.

754
00:35:58,340 --> 00:36:00,500
 Out of the mouth of babes, we get this beautiful wisdom.

755
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:02,300
 It's a tough question.

756
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:06,100
 But I have found that if I,

757
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,580
 and going through those times,

758
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:13,360
 if I ask and find my and, seek and find my and,

759
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,700
 then it's better.

760
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,800
 Don't do life alone.

761
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,800
 And then I've also found that if I choose to sing,

762
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:26,460
 then it is a choice that I can make

763
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,940
 by the power of the Holy Spirit

764
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,860
 and the grace of the Holy Spirit.

765
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:33,680
 And then, stay in step.

766
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:37,940
 We are not driven in Jesus Christ.

767
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,420
 We are led.

768
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,420
 Let him lead you into this beautiful life that is life.

769
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:46,740
 Amen?

770
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,400
 Okay, will you pray with me?

771
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:02,780
 We're just gonna take some time of giving you time

772
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,460
 to pray if you want to pray.

773
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:09,660
 If you're not a follower, either online or here, that's okay.

774
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,220
 I mean, you can still pray if you want to,

775
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:14,720
 or you can just reflect on what we've been talking about.

776
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,060
 But if you're here and you're a follower of Jesus Christ,

777
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:23,100
 if there was something that spoke to you,

778
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,240
 maybe more than other, go there.

779
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,780
 And when you go there,

780
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:31,140
 begin to have a conversation with God.

781
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:35,540
 So let me pray for you as you start that conversation.

782
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:37,840
 Jesus, I pray for humility,

783
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:40,400
 that in whatever that there place is for us,

784
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,100
 we would be humble to receive

785
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:46,100
 and to know that we need to receive.

786
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,840
 And I pray for courage, courage that we would then receive

787
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,780
 and courage that we can know what to do.

788
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:56,420
 You tell us that blessed are those who don't hear,

789
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,160
 but blessed are those who do the word of God.

790
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:02,660
 We wanna be blessed, Jesus.
