[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.880]   No one likes waiting. I was in the MTR last week at Tsim Sha Tsui. I ran down the
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:23.040]   escalator to get my train to Central. I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw the
[00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:33.560]   platform sign. The train will arrive in four minutes.
[00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:54.760]   Aiyah! Four minutes! But what about the 400 silent years? The time between the last
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.060]   writings of the Old Testament and the appearance of Christ is known as the
[00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:10.080]   Intertestamental Period or Between the Testaments. It lasted from the Prophet
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:18.840]   Malachi about 400 BC to the ministry of John the Baptist whose birth we look
[00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:27.840]   forward today as we kick off our Advent series, Surprising Joy. Because there was
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:36.300]   no prophetic word from God during the period from Malachi to John, some refer
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:49.040]   to it as the 400 silent years. To set the scene I want to read a couple of verses
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.620]   from Luke chapter 1. Verse 13 "But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid
[00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:03.680]   Zechariah, your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:13.120]   and you are to call him John.'" Good name that one. Verse 63 "Zechariah asked for a
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.100]   writing tablet." No iPads in those days. "And to everyone's astonishment he wrote
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:30.640]   this, 'His name is John.'" His name is John. Now the story of Zechariah and
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:38.540]   Elizabeth is quite personal to me. My father was 51 years of old when I was
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:48.100]   born and I was actually his firstborn. My mom had been widowed. Could you imagine
[00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:56.340]   the excitement of having your first child at that age? My father's name was
[00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.620]   John Henry Snelgrove to be precise. But I was born on the 23rd of
[00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:15.660]   April which in the UK is known as St. George's Day, our patron saint. So my mom
[00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:30.980]   decided to call me George. But dad had other ideas and promptly went out to
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:36.820]   register me I guess after a celebration drink or three. You guessed it he said
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:45.940]   "His name is John." John Henry Snelgrove Jr. made his entry into the world. And by
[00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.880]   the way no calling me George after the service. Anyway let's get back to the
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.260]   sermon. I think sometimes in church in our sermons we are guilty of what I
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:07.300]   call verse picking. Reading only verses that suit our sermon story. But today in
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.500]   our Advent series and Chapman has already told us about the first coming and the
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:17.780]   second coming of Jesus we ask ourselves three questions. The first one's this
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:29.660]   what does Advent mean? And the answer is coming. Who is coming? Jesus. What are we
[00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:38.860]   to do? Get ready. So as part of getting ready I'm gonna read the whole passage
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:49.100]   21 verses in one go. I'm reading from Luke chapter 1 starting from verse 5.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:56.780]   In the time of Herod king of Judea there was a priest named Zechariah who belonged to
[00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:06.260]   the priestly division of Abijah. His wife Elizabeth was also a descendant of Aaron.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.580]   Both of them were righteous in the sight of God observing all the Lord's commands
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:21.580]   and decrees blamelessly. But they were childless because Elizabeth was not able
[00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:31.100]   to conceive and they were both very old. Once when Zechariah's division was on
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:36.780]   duty and he was serving as a priest before God he was chosen by lot
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:41.980]   according to the custom of the priesthood to go into the temple and to
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.460]   burn the incense. When the time for the burning of incense come all the assembled
[00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:58.460]   worshippers were praying outside. Then I love that word an angel of the Lord
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.860]   appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of incense. When
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:10.380]   Zechariah saw him he was startled and was gripped with fear. But the angel said
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:21.380]   to him do not be afraid Zechariah your prayer has been heard. Your wife
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:27.140]   Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are to call him George you are to call
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:37.820]   him John. He will be a joy and a delight to you and many will rejoice because of
[00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.740]   his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord. He is never to take
[00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:50.100]   wine or any other fermented drink and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:56.500]   before he is born. He will bring back many of the people of Israel to the Lord
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.820]   their God and he will go on before the Lord in the spirit and power of Elijah
[00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.500]   to turn the hearts of the parents to their children and the disobedient to
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:14.660]   the wisdom of the righteous and to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:25.740]   Zechariah asked the angel how can this be? I'm an old man and my wife well
[00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:33.900]   well she's well along in years. The angel said to him I am Gabriel I stand in the
[00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:38.260]   presence of God and I have been sent to speak to you and tell you this good news
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:47.620]   and now you will be silent and not able to speak until the day this happens
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:52.580]   because you do not believe my words which will come true at their appointed
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:58.660]   time. Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:06.860]   stayed so long in the temple. When he came out he could not speak to them. They
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:13.460]   realized he had seen a vision in the temple for he kept making signs but
[00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:20.260]   remained unable to speak. When his time of service was completed he went home.
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:26.580]   After this his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and for five months remained in
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:39.220]   seclusion. The Lord has done this for me she said. In these days he has shown
[00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:48.060]   his favor and taken away my disgrace amongst the people. So quite a long
[00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:55.100]   passage and there are three key themes in this passage. Firstly the first theme
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:03.340]   is Zechariah and Elizabeth's long years of barrenness. We can assume that
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:08.980]   Elizabeth and Zechariah are well past childbearing age we're not told their
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:15.140]   exact age or John's birth would not have been considered a miracle. We are told in
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:20.980]   verse 7 but they were childless because Elizabeth was not able to conceive and
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.100]   they were both very old. Anecdotally they would probably be in their 60s and if
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:31.440]   they were in Hong Kong they would qualify for a Joy U card and pay two
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:38.540]   dollars for travel. The second theme the key theme is the silence of God after
[00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:45.700]   centuries of prophetic absence. I've already described it the 400 silent
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:51.460]   years and thirdly the announcement of John's birth breaks the silence bringing
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:10:01.900]   unexpected joy not only for Elizabeth and Zechariah but also for Israel. This
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:12.100]   leads me to ask ourselves have you have you ever experienced a significant
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:24.300]   desert season in your life? Let me repeat it. Have you ever experienced a
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:31.300]   significant desert season in your life? I've chatted to a few people recently
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:39.980]   who have described to me a long season of doubt, confusion, spiritual dryness or
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:49.500]   a long season of waiting for something that they long for in their life. I mean
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:53.900]   using my MTR analogy most of us don't even like the experience of short waits.
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:11:00.460]   I mean have you ever been to McDonald's right you go into McDonald's and you go
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:04.100]   what's the shortest queue right? Did you do that? Yeah.
[00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:09.100]   Yes yeah can I get in the shortest queue and you feel so good that you've
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.820]   actually got in the shortest queue until the guy in front of you orders 14 Big
[00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:22.620]   Mac meals you know. I read that collectively people spend about 67
[00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:31.100]   billion hours a year waiting in lines and even this small task can be a test
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:41.700]   of our patience most days. Even in the short waits the feeling of uncertainty
[00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:47.500]   about their end and the feeling of it being unfair like the guy with the 14
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:55.100]   Big Mac meals makes a struggle but then there are experience in life that
[00:11:55.100 --> 00:12:01.500]   involves not just minutes but months and even years of waiting. It can feel like a
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:12.020]   desert or like barrenness. This kind of waiting doesn't just test our patience
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:21.340]   it tests our hope. As pastors Sandra and I have walked with countless couples
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:31.500]   wrestling with childlessness. It's so hard especially those who are
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:40.300]   desperate to have a family of their own but barrenness can take many forms. It
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:53.460]   can look like a dryness in your life, a loss, loneliness, rejection. It can be
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:59.740]   some relationship not yet reconciled or something you've been asking God to do
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:07.900]   in your marriage or in your singleness. It can look like a pain or injustice
[00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:18.220]   you've endured and are asking for healing and restoration or some and I
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:26.540]   know this is many of us struggle like depression. You keep asking God to do
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:37.140]   something. God do something new but the change hasn't come yet. For many of us
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:44.580]   the waiting changes us and yet somehow some of us are able to keep our
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:49.660]   hearts alive in the barren places.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:58.700]   Zechariah and Elizabeth were among a people who had experienced a lifetime
[00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:06.820]   waiting in desert circumstances. The nation of Israel was waiting for the
[00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:16.380]   promised Messiah and Zechariah and Elizabeth who were very old and barren
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:26.340]   were longing for a child. Their story shows us two ways of responding when God
[00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:39.180]   shows up in those dry hopeless places in our lives. One is skeptical. The other is
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:47.100]   full of wonder and we ask the question what is the difference between them? How
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.820]   can we keep our hearts soft and hopeful so we don't miss God when he shows up?
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:15:03.300]   I wonder for Zechariah if maybe the experience of God with him in his
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:10.900]   waiting wasn't personal for him anymore. I can't imagine what it was like for him
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:19.620]   all the years, all the years of asking for a child. The waiting, the possible
[00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:24.940]   stigma of unfaithfulness that others would have felt towards them. Oh God
[00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:29.940]   hasn't blessed you because you're not faithful enough. Even though they had
[00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:36.980]   lived incredibly faithful lives. My friends waiting without answers and
[00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:44.500]   without an end in sight can be excruciating. I think of some of our
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.860]   asylum seeker friends here at the Vine. I was speaking at the Arise Fellowship
[00:15:49.860 --> 00:15:57.740]   last week and I noticed some of them who've been with us for up to 15 years
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:03.660]   without their case getting settled and to be honest nowhere near their case
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:11.480]   being settled. In a foreign country no access to an ID card and limited
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:21.740]   benefits and even more limited prospects. Waiting is so difficult and often the
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:31.820]   waiting changes us. Maybe Zechariah had changed somehow in the waiting. He
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:36.780]   clearly kept going through the motions. He was faithful in his duty. He continued
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:40.700]   to pray for the redemption of Israel and to believe that God would send Messiah
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:55.460]   but maybe he'd lost hope that God would show up in his own personal desert. So
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:17:01.540]   when God shows up in it I have to say an incredibly theatrical encounter to get
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.500]   his attention and give this personal announcement that he would
[00:17:05.500 --> 00:17:14.740]   indeed have a son. At first Zechariah misses what God is doing. I don't know if you
[00:17:14.740 --> 00:17:20.460]   know but there were nearly 18,000 priests who were each on duty two
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:27.780]   weeks a year. They cast lots to see who would burn the incense and offer prayers.
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:35.020]   If you get chosen you can never do it again. It's a once-in-a-lifetime
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:41.860]   opportunity and some people would never get chosen. Let's read what happened as
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.300]   Zechariah gets chosen. Verse 8.
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:07.820]   What we're going to see is while he is there performing this holy ancient
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:13.660]   service for Israel an angel of the Lord shows up to tell him he's going to have a
[00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:14.620]   son.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.660]   Then the angel of the Lord appeared to him standing at the right side of the altar of
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:25.980]   incense. When Zechariah saw him he was startled and gripped with fear. But the
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:32.020]   angel said to him, "Do not be afraid Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard.
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:41.940]   Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son and you are called him John." God shows up
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:51.660]   and Zechariah, you can see it can't you, he's wondering, "How can I be sure?" He says this,
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:57.540]   "How can I be sure of this? I'm an old man. My wife is getting on a bit as well. Went
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:06.340]   along in years." We hear his skepticism. He has everything he needs to believe
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:12.820]   that God could do a great thing for him. Firstly he's a priest. He holds the
[00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:19.300]   stories of God's faithfulness to others like Abraham and Sarah. He has the
[00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:25.420]   stories of his own life and this supernatural encounter. It's pretty
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:31.220]   statistically reliable evidence that if an angel shows up and says that God is
[00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:39.700]   going to do a thing, God's going to do that thing. But what he experiences is
[00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:47.260]   skepticism. It's almost like he stopped believing that God will do anything like
[00:19:47.260 --> 00:20:00.460]   this for him. It's not personal anymore. Maybe under all of our struggling with
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:09.620]   the deserts of our lives is this fear, this loss of faith. "Oh we can believe
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:16.220]   that God's going to come through for other people but maybe not just for us
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:23.940]   anymore." On the other hand, Elizabeth responds differently. She hears the news
[00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:29.860]   in a very different way. Possibly just her old mute husband scribbling a note
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:37.580]   or making hand gestures. She probably also notices a few changes in her body
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.580]   but there were no sonograms or ultrasound. There was no way to be
[00:20:42.580 --> 00:20:50.540]   certain. She could have thought she was crazy or maybe just ill. But somehow she
[00:20:50.540 --> 00:20:59.700]   believed not only that God could do such a thing, she believed he would do such a
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:06.380]   thing for her. Can you see that? It's one thing to believe that God could do it.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:12.980]   Another thing that God will do it for me. And she said this, verse 25. I'll put it on
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:25.300]   the screen. "The Lord has done this for me." It's personal to her. It's not just about
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:32.620]   the redemption of Israel but it is also about God showing up in a very personal
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:38.460]   way for her and Zechariah. It has a feeling of intimate worship as we read
[00:21:38.460 --> 00:21:44.580]   how she stays in seclusion for five months and later when Mary visits her a
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:49.740]   song of worship pours out of her heart.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:22:03.020]   But it leads us to the question, what about us? What about us? The story of
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:09.460]   Elizabeth and Zechariah makes me wonder how can we, how can we keep our hearts
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:18.060]   soft and hopeful when we encounter deserts in our life? What are a few ways
[00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:24.740]   we can keep our life with God personal? I want to suggest a couple of things.
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:32.540]   Number one in this Thanksgiving week, remember and be thankful. It helps to
[00:22:32.540 --> 00:22:40.460]   remember ways he has shown up for us before and for those around us. Being
[00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:47.020]   thankful is a way of acknowledging his active work around us and reminds our
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:55.100]   hearts that he is not far away. Passively watching our lives involved. He is close and
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:03.140]   he's acting on behalf of those he loves. To be honest if I had unlimited time
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.020]   today I would go around the congregation and ask you all to say one thing that
[00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:12.220]   you were thankful for. Maybe just think about that now. What are you thankful for?
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:17.580]   Remember it and be thankful. That's number one. Number two, nurture an intimate
[00:23:17.580 --> 00:23:25.340]   friendship with God. Everyone does this differently but any relationship
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:31.980]   requires time and presence, listening and learning in order to grow. Reading or
[00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:38.460]   listening to Scripture, praying, learning to listen to the voice of God, finding
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:45.740]   ways to glimpse how good and just how faithful God is often leads to worship
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:51.740]   because it's our natural response to be in awe when we are reminded of God's
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:24:02.140]   greatness and his love. And the third one is be around spiritual family. When the
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:08.620]   desert is hard and testing our hope, we need people in our life who will remind
[00:24:08.620 --> 00:24:15.500]   us that God still knows our name. He still sees our life and that he will
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.620]   come through to us. And if you're not in a community group or a small group, get
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:30.020]   in one now. Be around spiritual family. We may not get to encounter with an angel
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:36.940]   but Jesus is always showing up in our lives. And if Jesus is always personal
[00:24:36.940 --> 00:24:45.660]   for us, we can find flourishing even in the desert. Let me finish with an
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:52.700]   illustration. There are parts of the Atacama Desert in Chile where no rain
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:59.420]   has ever been recorded. Scientists believe that portions of the region have
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:06.380]   been in extreme desert state for 40 million years, longer than any other
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:14.660]   place on earth. And yet more than 1 million people live in the Atacama
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:20.260]   currently. Farmers have found way to extract enough water from underground
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:26.860]   water supplies and snow melt streams to grow crops and raise llamas and alpacas.
[00:25:26.860 --> 00:25:39.020]   In 2015, a portion of the desert received a historic rainfall just under one inch
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:47.380]   of rain in one day. It may not seem very much, particularly those of us who come
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:56.740]   from England, but it was the equivalent of 14 years of rainfall for this region
[00:25:56.740 --> 00:26:04.700]   all in one day. And this desert that had already found a way to thrive and
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:12.660]   sustain more than 1 million people was now also covered in a beautiful layer of
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:21.100]   pink and purple bloom after the rain. Let's look at the picture.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:33.100]   My friends, this is a picture of your life. Yeah, take it. Share it. Post and tag.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:46.460]   Go on. This is in the driest place on the whole earth. What a picture. My friends,
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:54.260]   the message of this Advent is that Jesus has come to take away the barrenness of
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:27:02.580]   the world. He can make us flourish and bring beauty even in the deserted places
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:16.380]   of our lives. If you are in a season of waiting, how is the waiting changing you?
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:25.660]   Maybe today, yes today, Jesus wants to renew your hope that he is showing up in
[00:27:25.660 --> 00:27:33.820]   the barren places of your life. As I ask the band to come up, I'm going to ask you
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.940]   just to close your eyes for a moment.
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:28:00.460]   We're going to pray now as a church for anyone here who is waiting. I suspect it's
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:07.220]   many of us. Maybe you're like Zechariah and Elizabeth. You're a couple waiting for a
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:16.700]   baby, waiting to get pregnant. It hasn't happened. Maybe you're waiting for that
[00:28:16.700 --> 00:28:27.140]   relationship. When is God going to bring that person into my life that will allow
[00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:34.660]   me to walk through life with? Maybe you're waiting for a job or a job
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:41.220]   opportunity. Maybe you're waiting for a time just to get out of the depression
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:45.860]   you're in. You've got that sort of mood around you and it's around you
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:50.420]   the whole time. How long is this going to go on for Lord? When am I going to see
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:29:02.220]   joy again? Whatever it is, if you're waiting today, we're going to pray for you.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:09.980]   So keep your eyes closed for a moment. If you're waiting for something, whatever it
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:14.900]   is, just put your hands up and we're going to pray for you. If you're waiting for
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:22.180]   something.
[00:29:22.180 --> 00:29:26.460]   Alright, now just open your eyes everyone and keep your hands up. Can the people
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:33.380]   around these people just go and lay hands on them? It's not too late. People who have
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:37.460]   got their hands up, can you just go around? This is not me praying for
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:40.380]   everybody. This is not the way we do church. The church prays for the church.
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:44.860]   Find a person with their hands up. There are people all over the place. Please
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:50.620]   look and if you haven't got your hands up, go and pray for someone.
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:58.180]   Come on guys, I need you to be part of this.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:09.980]   If you're waiting, I'm not going to ask you what you're waiting for. It'll be different
[00:30:09.980 --> 00:30:13.620]   for each one of us. There's a lady at the back waiting. Some people at the back
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:17.100]   waiting. Can people go and pray for them?
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:23.340]   Come on, this is part of us growing as a church, growing as a family. When we see
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:27.700]   people in our family struggling with something, to go and reach out to them.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.580]   Just reach out your hands to them. You don't have to pray the most wonderful
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:39.340]   prayer, but just lay your hands. Just say, "I care. You're my family. The vine, you and
[00:30:39.340 --> 00:30:45.620]   long." We're building a family here. If you're waiting, we're waiting with you.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:50.140]   We believe that God is going to come through.
[00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:54.700]   Just continue to pray.
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:59.380]   I'm going to pray a prayer.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:06.460]   Thank you Lord. Thank you Lord. Let's just take a couple minutes on this. This is
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:13.020]   important. Don't miss anybody out. Thank you Lord.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:28.580]   There's a wonderful sense of the Spirit's presence with us now. Let's just not rush
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:35.100]   out of this. Let's not rush out down to lunch, down to Q and McDonald's, or
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:42.780]   everybody else. Let's take this time to ask God to come and meet us. Lord, just as
[00:31:42.780 --> 00:31:48.060]   you came and met Zechariah and Elizabeth, just as you came and met the nation of
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:56.300]   Israel and sent Jesus, just as you sent John the Baptist to this couple that
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:32:02.420]   were barren, Lord take the barren areas of our lives, the things we're waiting
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:07.300]   for, the relationships, the jobs.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:14.300]   Just that approval for that thing.
[00:32:14.300 --> 00:32:25.220]   When we pray Holy Spirit, You just come right now. You're already here. Yep. But Lord,
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:34.660]   we ask for more of Your presence, more of Your reassurance that You are in control
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:38.300]   even when we are not.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:51.180]   Take away the pain of waiting and replace it with the birth of a new
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:58.380]   season, a new opportunity, a new calling.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:08.260]   I believe there are people here who are wrestling with a new calling. God is
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:16.220]   calling you to do something. It may be here in the church just volunteering for
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:22.380]   something. It may be going into some full-time ministry. And you've been
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:30.820]   wrestling with it. God says, "I'm here." John the Baptist is here. Israel is here.
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:40.100]   Receive your calling. Walk into your calling. Use this season of Advent to
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:49.100]   move into what God has for you. John the Baptist changed Elizabeth and Zechariah's
[00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:57.700]   life forever. Jesus Christ changed Israel forever, the promised Messiah.
[00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:03.860]   There is a promise over you.
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:13.860]   I want all of you now to actually visualise the place where you work.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:21.060]   Right? I want you to visualise your workplace and your colleagues.
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:29.980]   My friends, that is your church. That is your calling. As you go into work
[00:34:29.980 --> 00:34:38.380]   tomorrow morning, you go as a representative of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:45.300]   You have authority. You have power. You have a calling. And I pray for every
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.820]   workplace that is represented here today.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:35:01.180]   I pray, Lord, for the opportunity we have. I'll be honest with you. I reached
[00:35:01.180 --> 00:35:04.660]   more people for Jesus when I was working in an insurance company than I do
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:10.340]   working at a church. Because I spend too much of my time with Christians now.
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:17.860]   Those people that you are going to see tomorrow at work, those people in your
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:22.580]   family, God is calling you to.
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:36.180]   The cast of Disney. It's a big mission field. I bless you.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:43.180]   Manage to go and just be Jesus to them.
[00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:58.180]   And we pray in this Advent season that you will use us to draw people to Christ.
[00:35:58.180 --> 00:36:05.140]   Yes, we have services on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. What an opportunity
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:11.540]   for you to ask people to come with you if you get there early.
[00:36:11.540 --> 00:36:23.100]   Church is not about coming here for an hour and a quarter on a Sunday morning
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:31.780]   to hear a sermon. You are being empowered. You are being commissioned.
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:40.220]   Why would God use me? God would use you. God used Zechariah and
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:47.460]   Elizabeth to bring about John the Baptist, who was the forerunner of Jesus.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:57.260]   Tim wants to share a word.
[00:36:57.260 --> 00:37:07.420]   Thank you. Actually John was there, it was a few weeks ago, there was a prophetic
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:15.180]   word in a pastor's prayer meeting. And the prophetic word was that, you know a
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:19.100]   lot of times with Christmas we just rush through the season, we look for the next
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:28.780]   year. But it was the story of Canaan, where Jesus, He at the end of the wedding,
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:34.020]   not at the beginning of the wedding, He turned water into wine. He took something
[00:37:34.020 --> 00:37:37.940]   ordinary and He did something extraordinary, something unexpected. It
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:42.740]   was the good wine, the best wine. It came at the end of the year. And there was a
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:50.060]   sense that God wants to pour out His good wine at the end of the year. That He
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:58.020]   wants that the best is to come right now. And not to miss Him, not to miss
[00:37:58.020 --> 00:38:05.580]   what He wants to do. He wants to turn that water into extraordinary, delicious
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:14.460]   wine. And so we can miss Him, we can rush through the season. But He wants
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.660]   to work in your life. And I felt as John was sharing, I felt this word was
[00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:23.500]   actually for now. You know God wants to pour out His goodness on you now.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:30.620]   Do you understand? As we prepare to sing our final song, I just want you to hold
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.260]   your hands open and offer Him your water.
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:43.580]   The wine's run out, but we know the best wine is yet to come.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:48.580]   I just want to confirm that word that Tim's just shared with us. That God wants
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:53.060]   to take your dirty, smelly water. That water was actually the ones that the
[00:38:53.060 --> 00:39:00.100]   servants used to bathe their feet in. And it became the best wine.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:10.420]   Holy Spirit come to us. Come to this church. Come to Yuen Long. Come to Hong Kong.
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:17.040]   Help us not go through the motions of Christmas. Help us not to talk about the
[00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:24.140]   decorations in Landmark and all the other things that we see. Good as they are.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:31.500]   Turn our water into wine. And I've just got a vision as this is, that wine is
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:37.260]   being turned out and poured down the stairs of this church. And poured onto
[00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:43.020]   the streets of Yuen Long and into Hong Kong. People need to hear this.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:49.740]   That's why I prayed for you earlier. The people in your office tomorrow are gonna hear this.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:54.420]   You might just say something, "Hey, do you know what we did in church yesterday?
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:59.700]   Seemed really odd, but we took the water because we believe. We believe that the
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:06.060]   best wine is yet to come. That this Advent season, you are pouring out new wine
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:13.900]   amongst us. Fill us Lord. Fill us afresh with the new wine. And Lord, we don't want a
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:22.660]   little taste. We want to be bathed. Bathed in the new wine of your Holy Spirit.
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:34.120]   Lord, send us out from this place in the power of your Holy Spirit to live and
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:37.500]   work to your praise and glory.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:46.220]   Let's go and be filled as we sing this song.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:56.220]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
