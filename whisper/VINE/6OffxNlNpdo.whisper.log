[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Amen. Hey, can we give a round of applause to our worship team, to one another. Have a seat. It is so good that you are with us today.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   If you're new to the Vine, my name is Andrew, one of the pastors here. We're so glad you're here.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   If you're joining us online for one of the first times, we're so glad you're here with us as well.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   We're in week three of our series on the book of Philippians called An Alternative Society, where we're looking at and reminding ourselves of Paul's vision for the church.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Particularly his vision for the church as it was found in a very important time of history.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   The early church, a church, particularly the church in Philippi, that was struggling under the persecution around it.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Their belief in Jesus was coming into conflict and tension with the cultures and the norms of their society.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   That Jesus and Caesar were finding themselves clashing.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And Paul writes this incredible letter, as we know it, Philippians, to a church of 30 or so people meeting in a house and saying to them,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   "You hold in your hands, gathered together, a fresh new vision for life."
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   And in this letter, he's passionate to help the church remind the church that they are the hands and feet, the character and the life of Christ in society.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   He doesn't want them to be buckled under the pressure of persecution.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   He doesn't want them to succumb to the growing pressures and divisions that were in reality happening amongst them within the church.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Instead, he wants them to recapture God's heart for the kingdom of God and for showing Jesus to society.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   And I can't think of a better book in a better time for us to look as we think about what it is to be church in Hong Kong in this hour.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   What does it mean for us to live in this time to hold forth the gospel, to shine like stars in the universe?
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   In Luke chapter 8, verse 1, we talked about the citizenship that Paul speaks of to the church in Philippi.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   There's citizenship in heaven.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And he says when it comes down to it, you are not citizens of Rome.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   You're not citizens of Italy.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   You're not citizens under ultimately the authority of Caesar.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   You're citizens of heaven.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And therefore, there is a character, a structure in which how we are to live.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   And Paul says as we looked in the first week that we are to administer our public affairs.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Administer how we live, the ways in which we live in a way that is worthy of our citizenship in heaven.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   That we are to operate together with that in mind.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   In week 2, we looked at prayer.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Because Paul's idea is if we're citizens of heaven, if ultimately we administer the values of the kingdom on earth,
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   prayer is such a central part to that.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And we saw last week that Paul wasn't calling them to be this alternative society to pray in their usual ways.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   No, there was a new way to pray.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   And Paul says it's not this laundry list of all the stuff that I need in my life where our prayers become so self-centered.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Instead, he says pray for one another.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Like make it your habit and your culture in this alternative society to believe the best for each other.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   To thank God for one another even when you don't like each other.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   To thank God for one another even when you're divided amongst each other.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   To believe God's blessings should come on all of you.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So that you can partner in the gospel because there's work to do.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   And what kind of world or what kind of thing are we saying about Jesus to the world if we're divided and disunified ourselves?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And he's saying here's how we can do that.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   We view each other not on the brokenness of our humanity in this moment.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   But we view each other with a broader and bigger scale of the future that will happen when Christ comes back.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And present each one of us pure and blameless before him.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   And if Christ has begun a good work in you, he will work through and carry it on all the way to completion.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So pray for that good work to happen in each other.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Are you okay?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Isn't that a great vision that Paul has for the church?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Today I want to turn to the topic of leadership.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   And I can't think of a more important time in history for us to be thinking about what it means for us to actually lead true and well.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   To lead as God would have us to lead.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Now I want to preface everything I'm saying here by the reality that some of you in this room,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   as soon as I mention the idea of leadership, immediately you've begun to think about somebody else.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   You've maybe begun to think of your boss in your workplace, or the person who on their business card it says leader,
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   the one that has the authority and power.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And you're immediately beginning to think of everybody else apart from yourself.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Here's the first thing you need to know.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   When scripture speaks about leadership within this church, this alternative society,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   it's talking about a picture where all of us are seen as ones who have been gifted to be able to show the world what Jesus looks like.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   In other words, in scripture leadership is never just defined to one or two people in corridors of power or with defined levels of leadership.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   No, the gospel is for all.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And if the gospel is for all, every single one of us has a unique way of bringing an expression of that gospel.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   You yourself are a leader.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   If you're in this room or watching online right now and you're a Christian, God has saved you.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   He's reconciled you with God.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   He's placed his spirit in you.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   He's given you gifts and talents and he's left you here on earth for a purpose, for a reason.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Because you get to, in the image of God, express something of the nature of Christ,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   of the character of Christ in your particular sphere of influence.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Remember that's a word we use a lot here at the Vine.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   If you've been coming to this church for a while, you would have heard me say so many times,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   "You have a sphere of influence. Go to your sphere of influence. We pray for your sphere of influence."
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Leadership is essentially influence.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   It is the ability to bring influence on another person or a group of people
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   in order that you might accomplish together a shared goal or vision.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   That's a simple, clear definition of leadership.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   That every single one of us has this sphere of influence in our lives.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Really, to be a Christian is to bring something of Christ and his influence into those spheres around us
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   where together we might believe that we can work forward, have influence,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   in order to show the world something of Christ Jesus.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Are you with me so far?
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So do not sit there thinking that this message is for the person sitting next to you
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   or it's for your boss at work or the person who has the business card or the resume.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   This is for you, for you are a leader in the kingdom of God.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Here's the second thing.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   We have an issue.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Because we have a crisis of leadership in the world right now.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   I mean the world right now is suffering under a crisis of leadership.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Now of course there are good examples of leaders and leadership in every culture and in every society.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   But I don't know about you, but I've been struggling myself to see great, dynamic, good models of leadership around us in this time.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   In fact, it seems like everywhere we look right now that there's a breakdown in leadership.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   The Pandora Papers that were released this week is just another reminder to us.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   12 million documents outlining some of the terrible ways in which key leaders in this world are leading with self-interest in mind.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And we seem to have this structure in our society where basically modern leadership is in a crisis of trust and of abuse of power and of integrity.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   These three things, trust of our leadership, the abuse of power within modern leadership, and integrity.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Not being able to trust the word of people.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Not believing that they're actually going to stand up and move forward in what they've actually said.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   These are areas that leadership is crumbling around us.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Forbes magazine recently did a survey of everybody that attended a world economic forum.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   And in this they asked them, "Is there a crisis of leadership in the world right now?"
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   85% of the people that attended this forum, which was a lot of people, all said yes.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   These are some of the key leaders in the world, some of the key economic leaders, some of the world's governing leaders.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   They all agreed, 85% of them, that there's a crisis in leadership.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And out of this survey, Forbes were able to produce an article where they outlined five key traits of what they call toxic leadership.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Five key traits. I want to highlight these for you.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Here's the first one. Ego, vanity, and arrogance.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   That toxic leaders are people that struggle with ego, vanity, and arrogance.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   These are people that put themselves up in leadership as the experts in everything that they do.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Therefore, they are not in a position to learn, not in a position to grow.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   In fact, they think that their leadership is protected by pretending, in most cases, to be the expert at everything.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   These kinds of toxic leaders have very low empathy, very low compassion,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   and instead are much more aggressive in their communication.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And mostly, it's critical to lower someone down in order to cover for what they lack.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Ego, vanity, and arrogance.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   The second trait was this, a deficiency of self-awareness.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   That these kinds of leaders have the inability to actually recognize the flaws that are in them,
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   or if they know those flaws, they don't want to deal with them.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   They're blind to them, they ignore them, even when those flaws are having a big impact on the people around them.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   The third thing is achievement at all costs.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   These kinds of leaders put achievement beyond everything else.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   And the irony is that so often with these leaders, the very people that have worked so hard,
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   voted them in, worked on their behalf to get them into a place of power,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   the people there then run those people over in order to achieve what it is that they need to achieve.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   They burn bridges all around them because the number one thing is not the people that got them there,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   the number one thing is them retaining power.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Are you with me?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Here's the fourth trait that they saw, power over competency.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   Power over competency. It doesn't matter whether I'm not actually good in my job.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   It doesn't matter whether I have the character to hold me in my platform.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   It doesn't matter if I actually have the skill set to administer this nation, this country, this business, this church well.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   What matters is my power and holding onto that power for as long as I can.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And so I will do whatever I want to be able to reestablish and reinforce my power,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   even if it means pulling you down, because that will hide the reality that I actually don't have the competency to lead in the way that I need to lead.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   The fifth and final one was self-interest beyond the idea of the greater good.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Self-interest instead of looking out for the greater good.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And what they found in this survey was that toxic leaders led this way most predominantly in times of pressure,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   in times of hardship and difficulty, they would actually look after themselves more than the greater good of those that they were supposed to be serving.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   These, my friends, are the five traits of the kind of crisis that I think leadership is in today.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   And if we're honest with ourselves, we would be open to say that we see this kind of leadership in the church
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   as much as we might see this kind of leadership in society, economics, and in the corridors of government.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   It may well be that perhaps even you as being a part of this church here have come under these kinds of leadership traits from time to time.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And before we think that this is a modern problem, we just need to open the pages a little bit of history
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   and realize that this is not just going to quickly and easily go away.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   That we could look at this kind of list and go like, "I don't want to be that kind of leader. I'm not really that kind of leader. Am I that kind of leader?"
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   You might be suffering with that self-awareness thing, but anyway.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   But like we look at this and we kind of think, "We're not going to be these kinds of leaders. Surely this is just a passing phase. We're all going to get through it."
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   When the reality is it's almost been 2,000 years of recorded history where this kind of leadership
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   has been the predominant type of leadership that's been seen in the world.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   You just need to ask Paul what he saw in leadership around him in the first century.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And he would look at this list and go, "Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm."
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Oh yeah, that one too.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   Because the Greco-Roman culture, Greco-Roman leadership was very similar to this.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   There was authoritarian dictatorship.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   There was this kind of sort of ego-driven centrality to holding on to power.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   So much so that the Caesars demanded and forced worship of themselves in order to retain that kind of power.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   There was a culture in the Greco-Roman culture where it was all about praising and boasting.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   And leaders would boast about themselves, what they were good at, all of the things that they were,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   in order to deflect the reality that they weren't actually good at some things.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   There was a culture here of the powerful gaining more power at the suppression of the poor and the minorities around them.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   This was Greco-Roman cultural leadership.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And Paul is looking at this, he's looking at his church,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   and he's realizing that everybody in that church has been saved out of that kind of culture.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And he's noticing in the divisions that are amongst them that that culture is alive too in the church.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And Paul believes that there has to be another way.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   Because if we're going to be an alternative society, there has to be another way to lead.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   Paul himself encountered this new way.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   In chapter 3 of Philippians, Paul writes of all of the things that he, if he wanted to boast, could boast about.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Oh, if anybody had confidence in the flesh, oh, it's me.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   I mean, I was born like this. I was part of this tribe. I was raised under this teacher.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   I went to Harvard. I went to Cambridge. I went to Oxford. I got my PhD. I'm awesome.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   Like if anybody had power and privilege, a leader amongst his own people,
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   one that was feared by many people, a Pharisee of the Pharisee, it was Paul.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   And that was his thinking. That was his leadership style.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   And then he's on his way to Damascus. Jesus shows up and everything changes.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   And he suddenly realizes that there's a new way to lead.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   That power is immediately redefined.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   That the power that he thought he had, the power that he thought he needed for leadership is completely removed.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   That power is redefined in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   And Paul begins to understand that power is not about exerting influence from outside.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Power is all about what God's doing from within.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   Like power is the thing that God is doing by His Spirit to change and transform us from the inside.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Because if you want to change a culture and a society and a world, you change its people.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And Paul begins to look at Jesus and talks to the apostles about the life of Jesus.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And he realizes that Jesus came to model a new way of leadership.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   Paul hears crazy ideas like this from Jesus.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   That the last will be first and the first will be last.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   That the greatest amongst you needs to be the servant of all.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   That it is the meek that will inherit the earth.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   That there is no more male or female or Gentile or Jew, but we're all one in Christ Jesus.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Paul begins to pull the threads together of this kind of leadership.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   And he's beginning to say there is a new way.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   And he's looking at the church in Philippi.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   And he's saying if you're truly going to be an alternative society, it's time for you to begin to lead differently.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   So I want to turn to this vision that Paul has for leadership this morning.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And open this up for us as a challenge to us to think differently ourselves about leadership in our own lives.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   Everybody okay? You alright online? I can see the cameras nodding. Great.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Let me read this to you from Philippians 1 starting in verse 12.
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   "Now I want you to know, brothers and sisters, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   As a result, it's become clear throughout the whole palace guard and to everyone else that I am in chains for Christ.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord have been encouraged to speak the word of God more courageously and fearlessly.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry, but others out of goodwill.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   The latter do so in love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I am in my chains.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   But what does it matter? The important thing is this, that whether from false motives or true, Christ is preached.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   And because of this, you know what? I rejoice. Yes, I'm going to continue to rejoice.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   For I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   what has happened to me will turn out for my salvation, my deliverance.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   I eagerly expect and hope that I will in no way be put to shame, but will have sufficient courage so that now as always,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Christ will be exalted in my body, whether by life or by death.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   For me to live is Christ, but to die is gain.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   If I go on living in the body, this will mean fruitful labor for me.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Yet I don't know what to choose. I just don't know.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I'm torn between the two. You know, I desire on the one side to depart and be with Christ, which is better by far,
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   but it is more necessary for me to remain in the body for you.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   Convinced of this, I will therefore remain.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And I will continue with all of you for your progress and for your joy in the faith,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   so that through my being with you again, your joy in Christ Jesus will overflow on account of me.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Paul tells them in this passage, he reminds them of where he's at.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   He starts out in verse 12. He says, "There's a palace guard around me. I'm in chains for Christ Jesus."
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   He's really clear that his situation is tough.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   Now, a couple of things you need to understand about being in prison in the first century.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   Prison in the first century wasn't where you went to after you had been judged and the sentence had been given to you.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   Prison was where you went whilst you were waiting for the judgment and waiting for the sentencing.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   And no one would ever get sentenced to time in prison.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   They would either get sentenced to execution, or they would get sentenced to a fine and to be set free.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   Those were the extremes. No one ever went to jail for their sentence.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   They went to jail to wait for the sentence. Does that make sense to you?
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   So here's Paul, and he's in a difficult situation.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   He's waiting to find out if he's going to actually be sentenced to death.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   He's finding out. This is why later on in verses 22 and 23, he's writing these words.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   He's saying, "I might die." He has this reflection around life and death.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   "Is this where I'm at? Am I going to die in the future? Am I going to live?
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   There's benefits of both. If I go to Christ, I'll get to have joy with Him.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   If I don't die, I'll get to come back."
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And so he's struggling with the reality that the sentence may come that will force him to either into life or death.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   This is a tough situation for him.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   And I want you to see something that's really important here.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   In the middle of this tough situation, look at the language that he uses.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Encouraged, courageously and fearlessly. Goodwill, love.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Christ is preached. I rejoice. I'll continue to rejoice.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   My deliverance, fruitful labor, joy in the faith, overflow.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Look at these words. These are not words of a panicked leader.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   These are not words of someone who thinks that he's suffering under the oppression of a system.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   And he's trying to fight that system.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   He's trying to get kind of condolences from all the people around him.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   No, this is Paul writing and saying, "It's not actually about my situation that truly matters.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   What actually matters here is what's happening with the gospel."
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   Paul never writes to the church and says, "Man, the food sucks in prison."
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Like somebody cry with me for a moment.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   He never writes to the church and says, "Send me some blankets, Philippi, because it's really cold at night."
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   Nowhere in the letter. Instead he writes to them.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   He tells them he's in prison. And he has such joy in his heart
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   because he points beyond what is happening just around him
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   to the reality of what is happening kind of in his ministry.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   He starts to say, "This is what's happening with the gospel."
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   Notice what he says in verse 12.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   He says, "Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   has really served to advance the gospel."
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   In other words, he's saying, "It's not about me.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   It's not about what's actually happening to me.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   What's more important is what is taking place for the gospel."
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Paul is subverting worldly leadership here and walking in the opposite spirit.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   This is his attitude for leadership. It's this.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   That what happens in us and through us is way more important than what happens to us.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Come on, church.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   What happens in us and through us is way more important than what actually is happening to us.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   Paul is like, "Look at what's happening to me. I'm in chains. I'm in prison.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   I don't know whether I'm going to live or die.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   They may pass a sentence where I'm executed. It doesn't matter.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   Do you want to know what really matters?
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   Jesus is being preached. Do you want to know what really matters?
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   People are coming to Christ. The gospel is advancing.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   It's crazy to me that even in prison the gospel is still happening.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   In fact, I'm in chains. Look at verse 14.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   He says, "I'm in chains and because of those chains,
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   the brothers and sisters are preaching more courageously, more fearlessly."
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   He's like, "This is awesome."
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   Are you seeing what he's doing?
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   See, in worldly toxic leadership, what happens in toxic leadership is
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   leaders shine the light on themselves and their circumstances
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   in order to secure power and authority,
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   but gospel leaders shine intentionally the light away from themselves.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Paul's like, "It's not about what's going on for me.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   What's more important is what the Spirit of God is doing in and through this situation.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   Look at how the gospel is growing.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   Look at what's taking place around me by the gospel.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   This is amazing. I rejoice. I'm encouraged. I'm in love.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   This is great."
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   I don't know about you, but if I was in Paul's situation, man,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   I'd be asking you for blankets.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Are you with me?
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   I would be looking for sympathy.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   I'd be trying to retain my power, if you will,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   by having people feel sorry for my situation.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   Paul's subverting that whole thing, the ego, the arrogance,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   the manipulation of others because of circumstance.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   He's saying the thing that really matters is whether the gospel is preached or not.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   Now, Paul takes this now to another level.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   It's not just about his circumstance and his situation
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   that he's trying to subvert and shine the light away from.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   He also then has some things to say about his haters.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   We all have haters, by the way.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   You're a leader. Remember I said at the start of the message, you're a leader.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   That means you're going to have to struggle with some haters.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000]   You're going to have to struggle with some people that will disagree with you.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   One of the struggles and the trials, but also the important things of leadership,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   is that there'll be people around you that will question what you do.
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:47.000]   Over the last eight years that I've been senior pastor here,
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   one of the hardest things I've had to get used to is the fact that people
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   don't always agree with me, that they disagree with me.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Sometimes they strongly disagree with me and they let me know that.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Now, one of the skills of leadership is to be able to do what I call
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   "chew the meat and spit out the bones," right?
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   To listen effectively to the complaints that come about you
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   or about your organization, to understand those things.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   And sometimes they're legitimate and they're true and you should respond to them.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   So there is that way that we are to humble ourselves under that.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   But then there's also a lot of stuff that comes our way that isn't true, that isn't right,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   that is designed to just pull you down, that actually hurts because it's personal
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   and things are said and it's not easy.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   And Paul moves on in verses 15 and 17 to talk about this.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   He says it this way.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   He says, "It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and rivalry,
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   but others out of goodwill.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   The latter do so in love, knowing that I'm put here for the defense of the gospel.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not sincerely,
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   supposing that they can stir up trouble for me while I'm in chains."
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   He's talking about two groups of people.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   One group that were preaching Jesus with the right heart, the right motive, in goodwill.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   And he thinks that's great.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   But he then points out this other group of people who are trying to stir up trouble against him,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   his haters, if you will.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   And he says these people are preaching the gospel out of envy, out of rivalry, and out of selfish ambition.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   Now, scholars agree that what Paul's speaking about here is a group of unbelievers
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   that were trying to stir up trouble for Paul before his sentencing takes place.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Remember I told you, and this is why this is important, that the sentencing is going to come.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   So here's a group of unbelievers that are wanting Paul to be executed.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   And in order to sway the judge, sway the magistrate, what these people are doing is they're spreading the word
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   about what Paul was preaching on the streets.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   So they were going into the corridors of power before Paul's sentencing,
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   and they're going, "Do you know what this Paul was actually saying on the streets of our city?"
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   He was saying this.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   He was saying that there is a God that's come to earth.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   He was saying that a Jewish carpenter from Nazareth is actually the Messiah.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   This Paul was saying that this person was put to death by us in our regime.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   But three days later he was raised from the dead.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   This Paul is claiming that this raised Jewish rabbi from Nazareth is the Son of God.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   He's saying that we should worship this one rather than Caesar.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   He's claiming that this is King, and that if we follow him all of our lives will be right.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   This is what he's trying to say.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   They think they're trying to stir up trouble.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   Paul looks at it and he goes, "Here's the crazy irony.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   They're preaching the gospel.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   Even though they have envy and rivalry and selfish ambition,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   even though they're trying to actually sentence me to death,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   the crazy thing is they're actually sharing the gospel.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.000]   So whether out of goodwill or out of this rivalry, the gospel is still being preached."
[00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   It's like Paul is saying this.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   He understands that the power of the gospel is not in the person, it's in the message.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And he's saying as long as that message is going forth,
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   then it doesn't matter what actually happens,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   whether to me or even the person who's saying it, the power is in the message itself.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Isn't it ironic that even in my chains my haters are furthering the gospel?
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Now we look at Paul this way and we suddenly begin to put him on a pedestal.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   Man, Paul was amazing.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   I mean, how could this guy have such a radical viewpoint in prison?
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   With all the stuff that was happening to him, death coming to him potentially.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   He can still look at the people that hate him and slander him,
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   and he can look at them and say these words, but it doesn't matter.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   It doesn't matter what happens to me.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   What matters is what happens to the gospel and the spreading of Jesus.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   We look at Paul like that and we think, "We could never be like that.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   We could never be him. He's so awesome. He's so amazing.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   He never put a foot wrong."
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   This guy is like on a pedestal.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   It's like, "Ah, Paul."
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Like the Holy Spirit just shines on him all the time.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Do you have that?
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   I have that view of Paul a lot.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   So have a look at what he says in verse 19 and 20.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Is this helping people still?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   No. Great.
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Thank you.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   "For I know that through your prayers and the help given by the Spirit of Jesus Christ,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   what has happened to me will turn out for my salvation.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   I eagerly expect and hope that in no way I will be ashamed,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   but will have sufficient courage so that now as always Christ will be exalted in my body,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   whether by life or by death."
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Notice this. He says to them, "Through your prayers."
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Paul humbles himself.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   He subverts worldly leadership.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   He doesn't put himself up as this ego guy who knows everything and is the expert of everything.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   He says, "No, I survive because of your prayers."
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   Like it's through your prayers that this takes place.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   And not just your prayers, but also through the help of the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   "I could not do this without your prayers or without the work of the Holy Spirit in me.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   I am dependent on both of those things."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   This is Paul bringing himself down to his people and saying,
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   "I'm not perfect. I'm not great. I'm not all these things.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   I realize that actually as your leader amongst you,
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I need your support as much as you think you need mine.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   I need your prayers. Oh, I need the Holy Spirit to help me.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   Because if the Holy Spirit is not here, I will suffer."
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And then he says this. I love this.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   He goes, "I really hope that I have sufficient courage to do the work that I've been called to do."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Isn't that beautiful?
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   "I really hope I have sufficient courage."
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   When was the last time you heard a world leader go,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   "You know, guys, I really hope I have sufficient courage to lead well this country
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   because I've got some fear inside of me."
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Paul's like, "Man, I'm afraid I might die.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   I'm wrestling with that. That's a reality for me.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   But I hope that through your prayers and the work of the Holy Spirit,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   when the time is right, I will find sufficient courage in me.
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   I don't know if I will. There's a fear there,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   and I'm just putting myself vulnerably before you.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   But I hope that sufficient courage is there.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Oh, that we would learn to lead openly,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   brokenly before the people that we're leading
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   so that as one body we could cheer each other on.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   No arrogance, no ego.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Would you pray for me?
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   Because you know what? I make mistakes,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   and I really hope that there's sufficient courage in me
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   when I'm called to stand up for my faith, for the gospel.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   Because I'm not sure if there is.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Can we do that together?
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   This is Paul at work for his people.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   So let me pull all the threads of Paul's incredible model of leadership together for us
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   in one incredible PowerPoint slide. Are you ready?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   You might want to get your phones out and take a photo of this one,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   because it's good.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   Here we go. Let me show you.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   Toxic leadership by gospel leadership.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   Where we saw that toxic leadership is this,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   that first of all it's ego, vanity, and arrogance.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   What Paul teaches in this passage is that we are to subvert the ego,
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   be honest and vulnerable before our people.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   Where toxic leadership is a deficiency of self-awareness,
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   in this passage Paul shows us an acute self-awareness
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   about himself through the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Where toxic leadership is achievement at all costs,
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   no matter who we run over,
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   he talks about sacrificial servant heart for others.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   Where toxic leadership is power over competency,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   what we see Paul do in this passage is shift power from human hands to divine agency.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   When toxic leadership is about self-interest over the greater good,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Paul stands and embraces suffering for the greater good.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   I'm willing to go through this in order that you might go forward in the gospel.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   Could you imagine a society flourishing under this kind of leadership?
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Well you should, because it's called the church.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   The church should be like this, because guess who our leader is?
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   It's the suffering, sacrificial, servant-hearted, ego-deflating,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   incredibly honest, self-aware, and beautiful leader called Jesus Christ.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   And so as we see this and we begin to think about what gospel leadership truly might mean
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   for Hong Kong, for the vine, for your place and sphere of influence,
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   let me challenge you off the back of this with a couple of ways
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   that I think practically you might be able to lead in the week ahead.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   Deal with your ego.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Be courageous in your vulnerability.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   Put people over profit.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   Help people who will not have the ability to help you back.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Look intentionally for ways to subvert your own power
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   in order to provide a platform for those that don't have power.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   Speak the gospel fearlessly.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   Love your haters.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   Rejoice in the work of the gospel.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Shine your light away from yourself.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Be willing to actually embrace suffering.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   Encourage everyone around you, because you can have rejoicing.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   In the reality of that, it is far greater what God is doing in you and through you
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   than what is happening to you.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   That, my friends, is a new way to lead.
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Can we stand together? Let me pray for you.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   Father, we stand together as a church in this moment now,
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   both online, as people are watching this, in their own spheres of influence around the world,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   and here in this room as we all recognise the spheres of influence that are in and upon us.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Father, we come to you as not the experts with gospel leadership,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   but those very much in need of your mercy.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Father, I believe that all of us in this room, when we look at the list of toxic and gospel,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   can find ourselves on both sides of that equation.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   We recognise in our own brokenness that so often we're the ones that actually perpetuate that toxic leadership,
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   whether it's in our families, relationships we might have, workplaces that we're embedded into.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   And the first thing we do, Lord, is we come graciously to you
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   and ask you to forgive us for ways in which we've led in ways that are not your gospel, not your truth.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Father, I want to pray for people in this room that have considerable positions of power and authority.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   I want to pray particularly for people in this room that have considerable leadership, mantle and responsibility.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   Father, I pray that you would now come by your Holy Spirit and just gently love on them,
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   strengthen their hands for the work that you've called them to do.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Lord, you've raised them into places of considerable authority,
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   and yet we all understand the seduction that can come in those places of power.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   So Lord, we pray for those online in this room who carry with them considerable responsibilities.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   And we ask, Lord, that you would keep them tethered to your humility, your grace, your love.
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   Lord, we pray for every single one of us because, as we said earlier,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   we are all leaders for your gospel in our spheres of influence.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:28.000]   Lord, I want to pray for that sufficient courage to lead in a different way than what the world anticipates and expects.
[00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Lord, you called us to be an alternative society, yeast in dough.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   And Lord, I pray now by your Spirit that you would empower people in this room to lead courageously, fearlessly for the gospel.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   And Father, we take this time in this moment to pray for the leaders over us.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Father, we first of all pray for Carrie Lam.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   We pray for her administration in Hong Kong.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Father, we ask that you would just bless her.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   We ask that your presence would be upon her, that your wisdom would be with her.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   We pray, Lord, that for her and her administration,
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   that, Father, your Spirit would be at work in the corridors of their power.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   That, Lord God, you would come by your Spirit and, Lord, open up the ways of the gospel in the administration of our government.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Lord, we pray for those who are of faith in the government,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   that they would see themselves as those that can lead forth your kingdom principles and values for our city in this time.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   Would you strengthen the hands of them?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   And we thank you for Carrie and her leadership.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Lord, we pray for Beijing, recognizing the increasing power and authority that that has over us.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   We pray for Xi Jinping and for his leaders.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   We also know that you have placed many Christians in government.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   We pray that they would be strengthened, that you would strengthen their hands for the work that you've called them to do in a very difficult thing.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Lord, we just pray for the leaders over us.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Lord, we ask that we would go forth into our weeks with a gospel-centered heart.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Father, help us to subvert our egos because they're ugly.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Help us, Lord, to be aware of our flaws and be willing to admit them and deal with them.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   Help us not to put achievement as number one and in that running over the people that got us to the places that we're at.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   Help us, Lord, to subvert our power and to give it away, particularly when we realize that we don't have competency in a particular area.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Lord, would you help us to always put the greater good and the interest of others beyond ourselves, as Paul is so beautifully modeled to us in this passage.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   Lord, would you work in and through us in greater ways than what is happening around us?
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Let's continue to worship together.
