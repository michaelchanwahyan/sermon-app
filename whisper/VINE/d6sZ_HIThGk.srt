1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,300
 Good morning, church.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:03,900
 How are we today?

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:04,740
 >> Great.

4
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:06,460
 >> Good, good to see you guys.

5
00:00:06,460 --> 00:00:07,300
 Very good morning.

6
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,020
 If you're in the overflow, good morning.

7
00:00:09,020 --> 00:00:10,780
 Hello to you as well.

8
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,260
 And if you're joining us online,

9
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,940
 it's good to have you guys with us too.

10
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,140
 Excuse, I'm a little bit still like congested.

11
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:20,420
 I also had sausage McMuffin for breakfast this morning,

12
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,740
 so you know, good life choices I'm making.

13
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,980
 But again, always honored and excited

14
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:31,900
 to be sharing God's word this morning.

15
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,500
 You know, it's June 8th, we're halfway through 2025 already.

16
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,500
 Our taxes were due last week in case you forgot, right?

17
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:41,140
 You still got some time, I guess.

18
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,660
 But you know, it's about these times of the year, right?

19
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,460
 We take a look back and we take stock

20
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,580
 and we start to think about,

21
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,540
 oh, how the year's been going so far

22
00:00:49,540 --> 00:00:52,500
 and how we view it to go in the six months

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:53,640
 that's ahead of us, right?

24
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,820
 And when I think about what's been happening

25
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,780
 in the Sunday services and the life of this church

26
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,860
 on Sunday at least, it's been really amazing

27
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,620
 to see God at work in this body of Christ,

28
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:07,340
 in this community, right?

29
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:09,340
 There've been so many moments where

30
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,020
 because we've made decisions to lean in

31
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,940
 and be obedient to how the Holy Spirit has been guiding us,

32
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:19,140
 right, we've had the privilege of seeing Him at work

33
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:21,940
 in some really cool ways.

34
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,460
 Right, we've been talking about exploring the uncharted

35
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,500
 and God has been revealing through us,

36
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,740
 through the Holy Spirit, lots of cool things, right?

37
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,860
 And one of the most encouraging things I've seen

38
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:35,940
 is when we surrender ourselves to the Holy Spirit

39
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,980
 and just let Him take over what He wants to do,

40
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,060
 especially in this time, right?

41
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,180
 You remember a few months ago,

42
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,800
 we had a time where we didn't even go into the message

43
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:44,540
 and we just continued to preach,

44
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,580
 we just, I mean, we just continued to pray

45
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,540
 and worship and minister to each other, right?

46
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:52,140
 These spontaneous responses of praise,

47
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,420
 these spontaneous responses of worship

48
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:58,140
 and celebrating in each other's joys,

49
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,460
 but also walking with each other in the burdens.

50
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,620
 And of course, one of the most beautiful things

51
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:05,180
 that I've seen, that we've seen,

52
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:07,860
 is that when we've called upon the church

53
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,440
 to pray for each other.

54
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,580
 So the moments when we stood up,

55
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,420
 if you need prayer, open up your hands

56
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,780
 and just to see the entire body of Christ

57
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:16,740
 surrounding those who need prayer

58
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:19,900
 and praying over them, interceding for them,

59
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,740
 speaking on them, speaking for them

60
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,820
 on behalf of the pains and the needs

61
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,540
 and the feeling at that time.

62
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:28,600
 And it just reminds me that this

63
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,900
 is what the church was truly meant for.

64
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:36,940
 And today, as we close out our series on the Holy Spirit,

65
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:40,460
 we're gonna be talking about the gifts of the Spirit

66
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,940
 and the fruit of the Spirit.

67
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:45,340
 And as we talk about the gifts and the fruit,

68
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:49,220
 I want us to keep focusing on the body of Christ,

69
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:51,420
 on the church.

70
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,980
 Now, this might be a different perspective

71
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,260
 than what we normally might think,

72
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,580
 because a lot of the time,

73
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,180
 when we're talking about these things,

74
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:02,020
 we want to take a more sort of personal approach to it.

75
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,580
 We start asking ourselves the question,

76
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,900
 well, what is my gift, right?

77
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,540
 How am I bearing fruit?

78
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,160
 And yes, there is a personal element to these things.

79
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:13,480
 We'll talk about that in a minute.

80
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,580
 However, I think that if we think gifts and fruit

81
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,180
 are just about you or just about us as individuals,

82
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,320
 then we've missed the point completely.

83
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,340
 That's something Justin said a couple weeks ago.

84
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,600
 It was super important, right?

85
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,900
 He said that we shouldn't be like a stopping gate

86
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,120
 of the Holy Spirit, right?

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,380
 But he was calling us to be more like conduits

88
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:36,780
 and allow the Holy Spirit to work through us,

89
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,220
 to flow through us.

90
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:40,740
 And this is exactly what the gifts

91
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:44,500
 and the fruit is all about.

92
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:47,560
 In other words, the Holy Spirit does not give you gifts

93
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,020
 and fruit for your personal benefit.

94
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,300
 The Holy Spirit doesn't give you gifts and fruit

95
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,740
 to make you look good, right?

96
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,780
 The Holy Spirit doesn't empower us with wisdom

97
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,180
 so that people will look up to you and say,

98
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:06,200
 wow, this person is so insightful, so full of knowledge.

99
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,020
 The Holy Spirit does not give you healing

100
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,060
 so that people can start looking to you

101
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,500
 to make them healthy of their sickness and diseases,

102
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,300
 infirmities, evil spirits, whatever it is, right?

103
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,020
 The Holy Spirit doesn't give us patience and kindness

104
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,440
 so that people will say, wow,

105
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,360
 this is what a good, virtuous person looks like.

106
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,800
 No.

107
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,880
 The gifts and the fruit are given to us

108
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,080
 so that the whole entire church,

109
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:31,960
 the entire body of Christ can come together

110
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,240
 and say, praise the Lord.

111
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,280
 The gifts and the fruit being made known among us

112
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,920
 so people can say, this is what it looks like

113
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,840
 when a group of people are worshiping in spirit

114
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,680
 and in truth.

115
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,680
 The fruit and the gifts and the fruit are given to us

116
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,320
 so that people can truly say,

117
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:51,920
 this is God's word being revealed

118
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,960
 and lived out in this kingdom.

119
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,240
 This is the kingdom of heaven on earth.

120
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,000
 The gifts and the fruit are given to us

121
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,280
 so those of us who are tired of our sin

122
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
 can truly come to a safe place

123
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,560
 where conviction and confession and repentance

124
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,740
 is embraced in our community.

125
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,000
 In other words, it's not about you.

126
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,800
 Now, I know this sounds a bit harsh,

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,400
 but we really need to be careful

128
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
 when we come to the gifts and the fruit

129
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,480
 so we take the right approach.

130
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,760
 Because when we look at the world,

131
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,200
 the worldly focus, right,

132
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,220
 it's so focused on making life about us.

133
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,600
 The world is really good at putting people up on pedestals,

134
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,400
 glorifying individuals for their gifts and their talents.

135
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,300
 Right, and as a result,

136
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,320
 we have this sort of weird celebrity culture

137
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,840
 where people just do so, there's such effort and motivation

138
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,160
 for people just to do something, to go viral, become famous

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,520
 so people can look up to them in some sort of way.

140
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,240
 There are people out there with followers on Instagram,

141
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,660
 more than entire countries.

142
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,320
 If you go to see some of these celebrities,

143
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,440
 there's like hundreds of millions of followers,

144
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,960
 more than big countries combined.

145
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,280
 Right, something that's totally not cool one day,

146
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,580
 right, just takes one person of influence to do something

147
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,320
 and then everybody wants a piece of that action.

148
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,720
 Right, we spend time, money, effort going to shows

149
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,600
 and concerts for our favorite music, artists and bands.

150
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,580
 I'm not saying don't go to those things,

151
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,820
 I'm just saying be careful.

152
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:22,580
 Because when we lift up people so much

153
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,060
 and look at their talent so much,

154
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:26,000
 we sometimes even casually call them,

155
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,320
 oh, these people are like our idols.

156
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,180
 But what does the Bible say about idols, Church?

157
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,000
 Now, I'm sounding like a potty pooper here, okay.

158
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,540
 You're like, "Ellison, where's your funny story

159
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,380
 "for this message?"

160
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,140
 Okay, I don't have one today, I'm sorry, okay.

161
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:44,780
 Well, what I'm saying is, I've been saying it,

162
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,660
 we need to be really, really careful

163
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,660
 not to let that sort of thinking seep in

164
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,420
 to the body of Christ.

165
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:55,580
 Because when it comes to things like the gifts

166
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,020
 and the fruit of the Spirit,

167
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,780
 especially when we're talking about the gifts in the Church,

168
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,220
 we too can very easily find ourselves lifting up people

169
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:05,840
 who we see as gifted,

170
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,940
 rather than lifting up the name of Jesus.

171
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,300
 And instead for the Church benefiting

172
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:13,100
 for the gifts and the fruits,

173
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,160
 all the benefits and all the recognition

174
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:18,720
 goes to certain individuals, certain gifts, certain people.

175
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,500
 Right, we've even developed this weird like,

176
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,340
 celebrity pastor and celebrity worship leader subculture

177
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,060
 that exists in this thing that we call Christianity.

178
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,380
 Where honestly, sometimes it's really hard to say,

179
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,620
 are we lifting up Jesus' name

180
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,220
 or are we lifting up this person's name?

181
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:35,520
 We're like, who are we actually praising here?

182
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,060
 >> Check that one out.

183
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:39,980
 >> Thank you, Tony.

184
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,420
 [audience applauding]

185
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,780
 But the Bible has a very different perspective.

186
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:48,660
 Right, let's look at 1 Corinthians 12 together.

187
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,700
 There are different kind of gifts,

188
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,060
 but the same Spirit distributes them.

189
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,380
 There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord.

190
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:00,180
 There are different kinds of working,

191
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,080
 but in all of them and in everyone,

192
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,380
 it is the same God at work.

193
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:08,540
 Now to each one, the manifestation is given for the,

194
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,100
 let's say those last two words together,

195
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,400
 for the common good.

196
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,900
 Right, this is beautiful theological truth

197
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:18,520
 that Paul is declaring with these words.

198
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,960
 But the point being made is that the gifts,

199
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,320
 that everyone's gifts are different.

200
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,380
 But it doesn't mean that one is considered

201
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:28,900
 to be better than the other.

202
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,740
 Why?

203
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,220
 Well, precisely, like we've been saying,

204
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,940
 the gifts are given to us, not for you,

205
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:38,020
 for us as individuals, but for the sake of unity,

206
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:41,060
 for the sake of the common good.

207
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,940
 Right, in fact, the way that these gifts are given

208
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:48,140
 reflect the unity that we see in the God that we worship,

209
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:51,260
 the Father and Son of the Holy Spirit.

210
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,940
 Right, look how Paul phrases the passage.

211
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:56,580
 There are different kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit.

212
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:59,900
 Different kinds of service, but the same Lord.

213
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,780
 It's in everyone, it's different,

214
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,000
 but it's the same God at work.

215
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,980
 Holy Spirit, Lord Jesus, Father God,

216
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,700
 all working in unity together to give us the gifts

217
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,180
 so that the church can also reflect

218
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:16,940
 and display the same unity that we see

219
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,000
 in Yahweh that we worship.

220
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,900
 Time and time and time again,

221
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,860
 the Bible gives a very clear message.

222
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,500
 So I'll say it again, church.

223
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,300
 It's not about you, it's not about us.

224
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,980
 Now again, that's not to say that we cannot honor

225
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,420
 and recognize people at all.

226
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,740
 Right, they are indeed people who are recognized

227
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,700
 for the amazing things that they have done.

228
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,140
 And we need to give honor and credit where credit is due.

229
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,060
 There's people that I look up to in my life

230
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:48,740
 and I think very highly about.

231
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,420
 People who I think would be really cool

232
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,260
 to be like that one day.

233
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,140
 People I've met within this community.

234
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,820
 I mean, Tony voiced up just now,

235
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,580
 but when I'm Tony's age and I'm half as effortlessly cool

236
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,980
 as Tony is, I know I've made it in life.

237
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,980
 Tony is a hero of mine.

238
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,660
 I have Instagram, I scroll through Instagram,

239
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,860
 I follow certain people,

240
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,580
 I'm inspired by the things that they do.

241
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,220
 And even within this community,

242
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,780
 apart from the obvious things that you see on the stage,

243
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:21,540
 if you were to get to know the people around you,

244
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,260
 you would know that there is a group

245
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:27,440
 of really incredibly gifted people in this room.

246
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,020
 On a staff level, on the volunteers,

247
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,100
 we have the best worship team in town, facts.

248
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,860
 I don't care where at church you're from,

249
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,740
 we have the best worship team in town, facts.

250
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:42,980
 We have some of the best preaching and teaching in town,

251
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,740
 facts, these are just facts.

252
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,180
 You can come at me if you want, whatever, okay.

253
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,700
 But the people around us,

254
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,180
 the community that makes up this church,

255
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,980
 you'll see that the Holy Spirit has given all kinds of gifts

256
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,860
 to all kinds of people.

257
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,360
 If we look at the scripture, Paul says it like this.

258
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,980
 To one, there's given through the Spirit

259
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:03,660
 a message of wisdom.

260
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,780
 To another, a message of knowledge

261
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,540
 by means of the same Spirit.

262
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,720
 To another, faith in the same Spirit.

263
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,100
 To another, gifts of healing by that one Spirit.

264
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,060
 To another, miraculous powers.

265
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:16,580
 To another, prophecy.

266
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,620
 To another, distinguishing Spirits.

267
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,020
 To another, speaking in different kinds of tongues.

268
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,340
 And to another, the interpretation of tongues.

269
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,740
 There's several other places where we can find

270
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:28,580
 a list of spiritual gifts, right.

271
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,340
 This is not an exhaustive list,

272
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:32,860
 and we don't have time to go through each and every single

273
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,860
 of these ones specifically today,

274
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,300
 but there are a couple of things I want us to notice

275
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,420
 as we look through things like this.

276
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,840
 Firstly is this, they are given to us,

277
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,040
 they are given to us through the Spirit.

278
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:51,520
 You don't earn these gifts by being extra super holy, right.

279
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:54,260
 You can't buy them with money.

280
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,260
 These gifts are God's way of working through us,

281
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,660
 equipping us, encouraging us,

282
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:03,900
 using us for the sake of His kingdom and His glory.

283
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,660
 Right, they are God's idea.

284
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:11,660
 They are a blessing from God, and God loves giving us gifts.

285
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,300
 Bible tells us specifically that God

286
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,060
 is the best giver of gifts,

287
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,940
 and that every good and perfect gift

288
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,380
 comes from our loving Father in Heaven.

289
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:26,140
 So they're given to us, it's a gift, we don't earn it.

290
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,280
 And also as you see, there are many of them.

291
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,160
 It's a long list, and like I said, it's not the only list.

292
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,620
 There's a variety of gifts and functions,

293
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,180
 and that's a good thing, that's the beautiful thing.

294
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,320
 So therefore, your gift in the Holy Spirit,

295
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,760
 it's not your supernatural, not your superpower

296
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,140
 made for everybody to look at you.

297
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:52,140
 Your gift is your part in the body of Christ.

298
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,340
 This means that unless you're using your gift

299
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,340
 to serve the Lord, to serve the community of Christ,

300
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,940
 to serve the body of Christ,

301
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:05,640
 the church cannot be all that God meant for it to be.

302
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:10,060
 Paul will say it like this in Romans 12.

303
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,700
 For just as each of us has one body with many members,

304
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,860
 and these members do not all have the same function,

305
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,300
 so in Christ, though many, form one body,

306
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,780
 and each member belongs to the others.

307
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,640
 We have different gifts according to the grace given to us.

308
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,420
 If your gift is prophesying,

309
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,160
 then prophesy in accordance with your faith.

310
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,700
 If it's serving, then serve.

311
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,140
 If it's teaching, then teach.

312
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,380
 If it's to encourage, then give encouragement.

313
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,420
 If it's giving, then give generously.

314
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,740
 If it's to lead, do it diligently.

315
00:13:41,740 --> 00:13:44,600
 If it's to show mercy, do it cheerfully.

316
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,940
 Everybody needs to pitch in

317
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:52,460
 because every single person in this room,

318
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:55,020
 the Bible tells us, has a gift,

319
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:58,060
 and therefore you have a role to play.

320
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:00,760
 Again, this is important to keep in mind

321
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,220
 because the danger is,

322
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:04,740
 especially when it comes to spiritual gifts,

323
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,420
 we start to see some gifts as better than the others,

324
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,620
 which means that some people think

325
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,900
 that they're more important than they actually are,

326
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,540
 and some people end up thinking

327
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,380
 they underestimate the crucial part

328
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,840
 that they are to play in God's kingdom.

329
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,260
 So for example, what's happening right here,

330
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:25,060
 people being on the stage, speaking, teaching,

331
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:27,140
 singing, whatever it is,

332
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,780
 to people all throughout the day,

333
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,740
 this is a gift that's often lifted up

334
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,880
 and seen as highly important.

335
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,020
 But what about the gift of serving?

336
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:39,300
 What about the people that held the signs

337
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,100
 that served you by greeting you

338
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,340
 on the way up to the auditorium this morning?

339
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,460
 What about the team of hosts

340
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:48,620
 that passed from the offering buckets just now?

341
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,580
 What about the communion we're about to take later

342
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,300
 that people had to come in at 7 a.m. this morning

343
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,780
 to tear up the pieces of bread,

344
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,100
 to fill up the little cups,

345
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,580
 just so that we can have communion later?

346
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:02,040
 Did it cross your mind that our greeters

347
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,820
 and hosts and volunteers play just as critical a part

348
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,940
 in the body of Christ than the preacher

349
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,620
 or the worship team when it comes to our Sunday services?

350
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,460
 And I'm just talking about Sunday services here.

351
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:16,260
 Without people who are willing to use the gifts

352
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,740
 of serving the church,

353
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,340
 none of this would be possible, guys, none.

354
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:22,860
 There would be no production team,

355
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,340
 the band would be one or two people,

356
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,340
 there would be no kids and youth ministry,

357
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:29,020
 this whole place would be in chaos.

358
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:32,860
 But God, in His infinite wisdom,

359
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,980
 in His perfect knowledge of His children,

360
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,340
 in His generosity, He looks at a group like us,

361
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:40,380
 and then through the Holy Spirit,

362
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,700
 He distributes gifts and expects everyone

363
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:47,000
 to use their gifts and play their part,

364
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,860
 so that the whole church can function healthily.

365
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,620
 This is what He's talking about.

366
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,620
 Again, let's go back to Scripture.

367
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,660
 God has put the body together

368
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:01,940
 so that there should be no division in the body,

369
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:06,180
 but all the parts have equal concern for each other.

370
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,440
 If one part suffers, every part suffers with it.

371
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:13,620
 If one part is honored, every part rejoices with it.

372
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,500
 You see, from a worldly perspective,

373
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,180
 when we get gifts, when we give gifts or get gifts,

374
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,100
 it is something quite personal,

375
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,940
 and you get it with that person in mind.

376
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,660
 Well, hopefully you spare some thought,

377
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,420
 that's a nice thing to do,

378
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,300
 to think about that person and get them a gift,

379
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,680
 birthday, anniversaries, graduations.

380
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,540
 You think about the need

381
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,140
 and you get something tailored for that person.

382
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,300
 And then when that person receives a gift,

383
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,860
 there is no expectation to share it.

384
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,060
 I mean, you wouldn't get, you know,

385
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:44,360
 if I bought Nathan a new pair of shoes,

386
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,200
 I would say something like,

387
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,640
 "Okay, hey, you know, those new Jordans are pretty cool,

388
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,820
 "but you have to let me wear them

389
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,580
 "on Mondays and Wednesdays, okay?"

390
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,000
 Apart from the fact they wouldn't fit,

391
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,720
 it doesn't make sense, that's not how gifts work.

392
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,220
 But when it comes to spiritual gifts,

393
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,820
 the perspective is different.

394
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,940
 So yes, the personal element is still there.

395
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:08,860
 Again, not everyone has the same gift,

396
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:12,540
 which means when God looks at you as his child,

397
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:15,700
 as the person who he knitted together in his mother's womb,

398
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:18,620
 your God who knows the amount of hairs on your head,

399
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,700
 he saw you and he gave you a gift specifically

400
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:24,460
 through the Holy Spirit with you in mind,

401
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,620
 with his wisdom, with his love, with his grace.

402
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:29,500
 And when we receive this gift from God, right,

403
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,900
 there is a sense of closeness and intimacy

404
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,740
 that we feel with the Father

405
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:36,240
 and he draws us closer to him.

406
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,740
 The thing is, after we receive that,

407
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,260
 they are then meant to be shared.

408
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,540
 These gifts are designed for us to use

409
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:47,220
 to help those around us.

410
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,620
 For example, healing is a gift.

411
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,100
 But I mean, there's only so much healing

412
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,300
 you can do on yourself, right?

413
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,580
 And then God gives you the gift of healing

414
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,360
 so that you can have mercy to those around you

415
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,100
 who are in need.

416
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,780
 He gives you the gift of faith

417
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,780
 so that when you see someone struggling

418
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:07,020
 in their season of life, you can come alongside them,

419
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,460
 say, I will pray with you, I will walk with you,

420
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,780
 let's do this together.

421
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,460
 That's the gift of faith.

422
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:17,340
 All these gifts that we get only make sense

423
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,920
 when they're shared amongst the church.

424
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,620
 So if you find yourself with these gifts,

425
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:26,020
 the question we should be asking ourselves is not,

426
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:28,740
 how is this gift gonna benefit me?

427
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:31,340
 That's worldly, fleshly thinking.

428
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,780
 That's a mistake that dude made when he said to Peter,

429
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:36,740
 and if he could buy the gift that he saw Peter had

430
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:39,740
 with money, but what was his response?

431
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,180
 May your money perish with you

432
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,560
 because you thought you could buy the gift of God with money.

433
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:49,700
 You have no part or share in this ministry

434
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,380
 because your heart is not right before God.

435
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:57,020
 So let me remind us again,

436
00:18:57,060 --> 00:19:01,740
 these gifts of the Spirit are given for the common good.

437
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,880
 You see what I'm beginning,

438
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,120
 you understand what I'm saying now?

439
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,260
 That it's not about you.

440
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:10,020
 It's not for one person to stand out at the star,

441
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,140
 but these gifts are given to us to highlight

442
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:16,060
 just how much God wants us to serve

443
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,620
 and to need each other.

444
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:22,820
 So this presents a question and a challenge to all of us.

445
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,900
 What is our gift?

446
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,220
 And once you discover your gift,

447
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:30,540
 how are you using it to serve the body of Christ,

448
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,840
 to serve the Lord, to serve the church?

449
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:37,860
 Because like I said, everyone has a role to play,

450
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,260
 and I'll just say it plainly,

451
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,580
 showing up on a Sunday is not a spiritual gift.

452
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,340
 Right?

453
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:46,180
 It's not.

454
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,300
 But do you know your part?

455
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,380
 Are you playing your part?

456
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,100
 Listen, okay, everybody is welcome here.

457
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,400
 If you wanna just keep coming, we will never turn you away.

458
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:59,820
 We will always, you will always be welcome here.

459
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,820
 However, if you've been here a minute

460
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,020
 and your plan is just to keep coming to church on Sunday

461
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:09,340
 and nothing else, you're really missing out

462
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:12,300
 on the full picture of what it means

463
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,340
 to be part of a body of Christ,

464
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:19,900
 to be a Christian, to be a follower of Jesus.

465
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:21,080
 Right, and this isn't a guilt trip

466
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,220
 'cause we need volunteers for JCA and VBS, all right?

467
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,000
 I'm not, I'm just saying what the Bible is teaching us,

468
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,220
 okay, it's not.

469
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:32,200
 So if you don't know the question,

470
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,880
 you know, how do I find my spiritual gift?

471
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:37,120
 Again, it's a good question,

472
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,780
 and we can talk about this all day.

473
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:42,940
 Let me just give a few practical pointers in this direction.

474
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,880
 First of all, okay, don't treat it like an enneagram

475
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,320
 or a disc or a Myers-Briggs,

476
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,940
 one of those personality tests, that kind of stuff, okay?

477
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:54,220
 Your spiritual gift is not a personality test, all right?

478
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:57,120
 I mean, there are online tools that might be useful,

479
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,940
 but I wouldn't even start there necessarily.

480
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,740
 The first step to finding out your part

481
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:07,740
 and your gift in the body of Christ is to seek God first.

482
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,960
 Seek first the kingdom and all these other things

483
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,960
 will then be given to you.

484
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:14,960
 Right, this means reading your Bible,

485
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,900
 this means prayer and fasting,

486
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,500
 this means constant confession and repentance,

487
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,840
 this means developing and nurturing

488
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,280
 your relationship with Jesus.

489
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,040
 That's the first basic step.

490
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,360
 The second step is this, right?

491
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,800
 When you're following Jesus,

492
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,800
 when you know that your heart

493
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,600
 and the desires of your heart have been made pure,

494
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,240
 then you ask, ask the Holy Spirit to show you,

495
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,520
 where do you want me to serve?

496
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,700
 What is the gift that you've given me?

497
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:48,760
 What is my part in the body of Christ?

498
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,800
 And scripture tells us that when we do that,

499
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:56,800
 if we ask anything according to his will, he will hear us.

500
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:02,620
 One good way to ask is to ask those around you,

501
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,100
 the people that you trust around you,

502
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,480
 the other people that you know

503
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,060
 are also in the same journey of following Jesus.

504
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:11,080
 Find a community that you trust,

505
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,940
 talk to people, come along with them and say,

506
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,780
 hey, you know, I feel like God has given me a gift

507
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:18,180
 in whatever, do you see that in me?

508
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:20,560
 Or maybe ask one of your leaders at the church

509
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,400
 or whatever, say, I feel like I have the gift of this.

510
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,280
 Is there something that you've noticed in me

511
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,320
 that you see in me?

512
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,560
 Ask, ask the Lord, ask those around you.

513
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,900
 Thirdly is this, be content.

514
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:38,200
 So you know in the early stages of singing competitions,

515
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,300
 like Britain's Got Talent and all that kind of stuff,

516
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:43,000
 in the audition stages, there's always these people

517
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,700
 who show up full of confidence,

518
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,720
 thinking they're like the songbird of their generation,

519
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,040
 but in reality, when they start to sing, right,

520
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,920
 it's not that good, right?

521
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,920
 And you end up with, you know,

522
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,000
 that the Ken dibby dibby doubt you lady, right?

523
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,580
 Like you think you have this talent and your gift to sing,

524
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:02,920
 but actually that's not your gift.

525
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,000
 And somewhere along the way, there've been disillusion

526
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,400
 or someone has lied to them.

527
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,860
 You know, maybe they sang in front of their mom

528
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,240
 and the mom's like, oh yeah, yeah, you're really good.

529
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,840
 You're good at everything, son, okay?

530
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,600
 And you go off, yeah, go do the audition.

531
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,120
 And you find out, actually, that's not what you're good at.

532
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,040
 In the same way, right, the Bible does say ask,

533
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,400
 earnestly ask and desire the gifts.

534
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,880
 But it also tells us that everything must be done

535
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,080
 so that the church may be built up.

536
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:37,520
 So whatever the Holy Spirit has decided to bless you with,

537
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,440
 trust Him with that, lean into that.

538
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,020
 Again, I'm not saying you can't ask, you can't desire,

539
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,780
 do those things, the Holy Spirit might choose to work in you

540
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:47,240
 in that way at some time.

541
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:51,980
 But whatever God has given to you, trust Him with that,

542
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,500
 lean into that and serve and work out of that

543
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,620
 so that when the Spirit is at work in your life,

544
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:02,940
 He can give you the gift to serve the body of Christ.

545
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,460
 Now that's a gift of the Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit.

546
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,580
 But the Spirit at work in your life

547
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:14,060
 should also grow fruit within you.

548
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,900
 Well, what's the difference?

549
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,420
 Well, I would say probably that you can look at it like this.

550
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:22,420
 Gifts are normally for certain times and certain seasons

551
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,260
 and certain moments.

552
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,580
 For example, tongues, again, is described

553
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,700
 as one of the spiritual gifts.

554
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,060
 Every now and then, in the worship service at the Vine,

555
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:34,440
 we'll have a gift of tongues and there'll be interpretation

556
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,940
 and the whole church is strengthened and edified

557
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,380
 by the gift of tongues.

558
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,580
 But if that were to happen constantly, every day,

559
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:45,820
 all the time, we wouldn't be able to get on

560
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,420
 to anything else.

561
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:51,780
 Healing, again, is certain gifts for certain moments.

562
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:54,100
 Every now and then, we get called to pray

563
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,460
 for those who are sick and we see healing take place.

564
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,220
 We've seen some very powerful ways the Holy Spirit

565
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:04,220
 has worked and healed people from all sorts of things.

566
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:07,900
 But again, there's a certain time and place for that.

567
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:10,940
 That's not to mean that the Holy Spirit can't heal

568
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,220
 when we pray.

569
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:15,100
 It just means that the Holy Spirit is choosing not to act

570
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,320
 in that way for that particular moment.

571
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,880
 But when it comes to the fruit, the fruit isn't something

572
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,960
 that we see every now and then.

573
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,060
 The fruit of the Spirit is something we constantly

574
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,680
 need to be growing in.

575
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:35,860
 This is why Paul says, "Walk by the Spirit."

576
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,260
 The word walk here isn't talking about like a stroll

577
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:41,020
 down the beach or a stroll in the park.

578
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,620
 It's talking about how you live your life,

579
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:46,780
 the choices you make.

580
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,740
 And we need to be really careful about this

581
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,560
 because again, the consequences are serious.

582
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,380
 Galatians 5, check out what Paul has to say.

583
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:00,060
 Walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires

584
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,500
 of the flesh.

585
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,140
 For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit

586
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,020
 and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh.

587
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:10,900
 They are in conflict with each other so that you are not

588
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,820
 to do whatever you want.

589
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:20,800
 Walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires

590
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,500
 of the flesh.

591
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,180
 It's very clear, Paul's very clear, Scripture's very clear.

592
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,860
 We felt this too.

593
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:31,060
 There's a constant battle going on inside of us,

594
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,700
 outside of us between what the flesh wants

595
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,340
 and what the Spirit is trying to lead us towards.

596
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,900
 And here's the thing, right?

597
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:42,000
 The Bible tells us we can't just do whatever we want

598
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,420
 and call it freedom.

599
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:47,760
 It's a bit sort of contradictory because if we're being told

600
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,780
 how to live, right, on one level that sounds more

601
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:53,200
 like a restriction rather than freedom.

602
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,940
 But what does freedom in this case actually look like?

603
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:00,660
 What does freedom in Christ actually look like?

604
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,180
 'Cause we talk about freedom a lot.

605
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,340
 But one of the great benefits of Christianity

606
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:06,860
 and the life in Jesus is freedom.

607
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,200
 Again, we sing about it, we preach about it,

608
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,780
 we proclaim Bible verses about freedom.

609
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,140
 Who the Son sets free is free indeed, yes, and amen.

610
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,940
 But what are we talking about when we talk about freedom?

611
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,500
 Well, from the worldly, fleshly perspective,

612
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:25,140
 freedom is the ability to say and think and do

613
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:27,980
 and act whatever you like, right?

614
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,940
 A life with no limits and no control.

615
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,980
 This is how kids think, right?

616
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,140
 Kids look up to us, our children look up to us,

617
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,140
 and they think, oh, I can't wait 'til I'm an adult

618
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,940
 so I can eat ice cream all day,

619
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,580
 I can melt my brain with TV, you know,

620
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,500
 and I can just buy any toy I want anytime I want, right?

621
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:47,300
 That is how a kid looks at us, right, and see,

622
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:50,380
 well, freedom is to be able to do whatever we want

623
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:51,560
 anytime we want.

624
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:55,900
 But even as adults, right, we tend to look at freedom

625
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,780
 in this way.

626
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,900
 A life of freedom is if, well, I can live on my own terms.

627
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,140
 Right, isn't that what the world approves of?

628
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,360
 You deserve it.

629
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,540
 Live life on your own terms, do whatever you want,

630
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,740
 be free, don't let anybody hold you down.

631
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,580
 You only live once, right, so come on, just go for it.

632
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:15,380
 Do it, doesn't matter.

633
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:19,380
 Now, life this way might sound appealing.

634
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:23,460
 The only problem is God's Word tells us

635
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,860
 something quite different.

636
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:28,940
 And Scripture warns us that freedom in the flesh

637
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:31,740
 will lead us to some dark places,

638
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:35,380
 places filled with things like sexual immorality,

639
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,900
 impurity and debauchery, idolatry, witchcraft,

640
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:44,060
 hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage,

641
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,120
 selfish ambition, dissensions, factions,

642
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,340
 and envy, drunkenness, orgies, and the like.

643
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:54,160
 I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this

644
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:57,380
 will not inherit the kingdom of God.

645
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:59,880
 When you read through that list,

646
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,400
 you know what it sounds like to me?

647
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,080
 It sounds like chaos and disorder.

648
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,860
 Right, that sounds like everyone out for themselves,

649
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,060
 not caring about those around them.

650
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:16,740
 That list sounds like darkness and hatred and evil.

651
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,600
 It's the road to destruction

652
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,760
 and eternal separation from God.

653
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,560
 Freedom in the flesh is not true freedom.

654
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:31,260
 Firstly, it goes against who you were created to be.

655
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,380
 Right, because you were created to be a human being

656
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,740
 that glorifies himself or herself.

657
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,220
 You were created to be an image bearer of God.

658
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,660
 This means that you feel your sense and your purpose,

659
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:48,080
 not when you're out doing whatever you want,

660
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,340
 but when your life is fully obedient

661
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:53,700
 to what Jesus has called you to.

662
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,500
 That is when you feel most alive.

663
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,420
 That is when you're gonna feel most free.

664
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,700
 That is when you're gonna realize what your purpose,

665
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,000
 your destiny, whatever word you want to use in life is.

666
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:09,020
 Second thing is this, you end up in a terrible place.

667
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:12,620
 Paul says it clearly, that those who live like this

668
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,940
 will not inherit the kingdom of God.

669
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:17,500
 You will have no part in what God's trying to do

670
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:20,620
 in this life or the next.

671
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:24,300
 In other words, you are separated from God now

672
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:26,320
 and for all eternity.

673
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:31,500
 And free living that leads to chaos and separation from God

674
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,660
 is not freedom at all.

675
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:37,060
 Remember what Pastor Andrew said

676
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,820
 at the beginning of this series?

677
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:43,120
 That the Holy Spirit is what brings order out of chaos.

678
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,980
 And this is what he wants to do

679
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,540
 in the body of Christ in our lives.

680
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,860
 And Paul is about to give us

681
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:52,620
 one of the most beautiful examples

682
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:55,980
 of what a life of order in the Holy Spirit looks like.

683
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,860
 I would say that this is one of the most beautiful pictures

684
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,340
 of order and of peace and of the way God wants us to live

685
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:04,260
 outside of Genesis 1.

686
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,700
 Genesis 1, we have Eden and it's perfect.

687
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:10,940
 This is an echo of what God has talked to us about

688
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:11,780
 in Genesis 1.

689
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,240
 Listen to what the Bible says.

690
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:19,340
 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace,

691
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,860
 patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,

692
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,140
 gentleness, and self-control.

693
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:30,340
 Against such things there is no law.

694
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:35,460
 Doesn't this sound a lot more like peace and order?

695
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:40,460
 Doesn't this sound like the things we want to chase in life?

696
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,660
 Isn't this what you hope you've been created for?

697
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:48,340
 Now, there is an important detail to note.

698
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:52,060
 And this is important because this verse is so well known.

699
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,420
 Sometimes as Christians when it comes to this,

700
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,740
 we like to do like a little stock index exchange

701
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,020
 on this passage.

702
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,980
 And we begin to think like,

703
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,500
 oh well, I wasn't very kind today,

704
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,460
 but I did have peace about it.

705
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,100
 Or, well, I didn't so much self-control,

706
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,280
 but there was a lot of joy.

707
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,860
 Don't do this, okay?

708
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:15,420
 Doesn't make sense.

709
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,220
 The fruit of the Spirit is not your stock portfolio.

710
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,500
 If you have lots of gains in one,

711
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,420
 it doesn't cover the losses in the other.

712
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,060
 Do you know what I'm saying?

713
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:28,740
 Can you really be faithful without being patient?

714
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,900
 Is there real joy without having peace?

715
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,220
 There's a simple thing, you might already know this,

716
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,180
 I'm gonna remind us.

717
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:38,980
 It's not the fruits of the Spirit,

718
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:43,980
 it's the fruit, singular, of the Spirit.

719
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:45,340
 If you've not heard that before,

720
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,020
 write it down in your margins, okay?

721
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:50,700
 The fruit of the Spirit.

722
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,140
 And if we're gonna grow in the fruit,

723
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,620
 if we're gonna walk by the Spirit,

724
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,900
 then we're gonna have to dedicate

725
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:00,920
 every part of ourselves in this journey.

726
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,940
 And again, it's not an easy one.

727
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:07,740
 The true Christian life,

728
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,260
 if we're really to follow Jesus with everything we have,

729
00:33:11,260 --> 00:33:13,360
 it's not the easy path to choose.

730
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,900
 It's the narrow path.

731
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,460
 Because like we said, your spirit and your flesh

732
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,900
 are constantly gonna be at conflict with each other.

733
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,660
 There isn't a version of following Jesus

734
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:27,560
 where we just get to coast and sail off into the sunset,

735
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,500
 not giving a thought to how we're actually supposed

736
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:32,160
 to live our lives.

737
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,660
 No, but it's a life of discipline.

738
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:40,020
 Paul calls it, it's a training up for godliness.

739
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,700
 Fruit takes time and effort to grow, right?

740
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,100
 You can't just plonk a tree in some soil

741
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,020
 and just expect it to do its thing.

742
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,520
 It takes nurturing, it takes watering,

743
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,580
 it takes nutrients, it takes protection

744
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,340
 from the elements and other insects,

745
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,420
 it takes pruning and grafting and all that kind of stuff.

746
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:58,400
 It just doesn't happen automatically.

747
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,140
 Which is why, in your Christian life,

748
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,980
 it's always gonna be about choosing God's way

749
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,700
 instead of your way.

750
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:11,260
 Your old self, with its attraction to chaos and sin,

751
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,580
 full of passion and the desires of the flesh,

752
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:15,380
 is always gonna try and draw you back

753
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:17,140
 to that place of chaos.

754
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:20,860
 The enemy and the devil and its minions

755
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,740
 and the enemy of this world is always trying

756
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:26,200
 to use temptation to draw you back into that place

757
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,740
 of separation from God, of living life

758
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:31,540
 without the Holy Spirit.

759
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,320
 This is why we've been saying,

760
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:39,160
 we need to deal with sin seriously.

761
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,480
 And when we made the decision to follow Jesus,

762
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:45,200
 it means also identifying with him in death,

763
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:47,080
 which means that our sinful desires,

764
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,560
 the thing we used to follow in this world,

765
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,960
 have been crucified to the cross with Jesus.

766
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,920
 There is no space for that in our walk

767
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,440
 with the Holy Spirit now.

768
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,960
 Okay, again, take a deep breath,

769
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
 'cause it sounds like a lot of pressure.

770
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,520
 The good news is that you don't,

771
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,320
 or even you cannot do this by your own power.

772
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,480
 And that's good news.

773
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:19,480
 And just as the gifts are from the Holy Spirit,

774
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:23,440
 the ability to put your flesh to death,

775
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:26,560
 to grow in the fruit, to walk with the Spirit,

776
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,360
 that is also something that the Holy Spirit

777
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,140
 has to empower you in.

778
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:35,120
 Right, it's repeated multiple times in this passage.

779
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,360
 We need to be led by the Spirit.

780
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:40,640
 We need to walk by the Spirit.

781
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,120
 We need to live by the Spirit.

782
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:43,920
 We need to keep in step with the Spirit.

783
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,960
 The Spirit is there to guide, to lead, to hold,

784
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,560
 to draw you back, to push you forward,

785
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,320
 to help you live this Christian life.

786
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,000
 And just like we rely on the Holy Spirit

787
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,120
 to give us our spiritual gifts,

788
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,540
 in the same way, the Holy Spirit helps us

789
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:03,600
 to live lives that will bear fruit.

790
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:10,720
 Now again, this is not self-help, okay?

791
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:13,540
 This isn't about making yourself a better person,

792
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,760
 self-improvement, it's not about becoming more virtuous

793
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:19,040
 so people can look at you a certain way.

794
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,200
 This is about dealing with your sin

795
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,520
 so that you can have a living, working,

796
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:27,680
 convicting, obedient, life, eternity-changing

797
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,400
 relationship with Jesus.

798
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,700
 And He is the one who helps you through it.

799
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:37,300
 Remain in me, He says, as I also remain in you.

800
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,380
 No branch can bear fruit by itself,

801
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,860
 it must remain in the vine,

802
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:45,660
 neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me.

803
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:50,780
 A life totally reliant and connected to our Savior,

804
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,720
 to the Holy, and to the Holy Spirit.

805
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,140
 This is what true freedom looks like.

806
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:04,060
 And when we live this way, it tells us there is no law.

807
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:07,940
 God's never gonna stop you from growing

808
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,220
 in the fruit of the Spirit.

809
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:11,220
 No government or authority is ever gonna say,

810
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,660
 stop doing these things, right?

811
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:16,700
 These are good, virtuous, amazing things, right?

812
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,700
 Nothing will ever stop you from growing in the Spirit.

813
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,880
 There is no law against these things.

814
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,420
 And so once you've had the fruit,

815
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,540
 you've tasted and seen that the fruit

816
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,880
 of the Spirit is good, you will begin living

817
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,140
 in a way that brings true life

818
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:38,860
 to yourself and to those around you.

819
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:41,180
 And as difficult as it may be at time,

820
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,820
 you will never want to stop growing in them.

821
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:50,840
 The gifts and the fruit, therefore, go hand in hand.

822
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,000
 You are being called to build up the kingdom of God

823
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,600
 here on earth as it is in heaven.

824
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:03,960
 But you're also being called to live lives of holiness

825
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:08,960
 and closeness that reflect God's heart and who he is.

826
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,400
 And God expects both his followers

827
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,480
 to use their gifts and to bear fruit.

828
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,840
 This is Pentecost Sunday, and this is exactly

829
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,240
 what happens on the day of Pentecost

830
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,860
 when the Holy Spirit first fell upon the followers.

831
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:29,520
 This is a beautiful picture of gifts and fruit

832
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,720
 coming together when the early church is first established.

833
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:36,440
 Acts 2.43 tells us this, that when the Holy Spirit came,

834
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:40,040
 everybody was filled with awe at the many wonders

835
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,300
 and signs being performed by the apostles.

836
00:38:43,300 --> 00:38:46,680
 These are the spiritual gifts at work, tongues, healing,

837
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:49,260
 all these things that the apostles began to minister

838
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,000
 to other people out of the gifts

839
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,460
 that the Holy Spirit had given to them.

840
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,480
 But then it goes on to tell us this,

841
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:58,720
 that all the believers together had everything in common.

842
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,320
 They sold property and possessions

843
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:02,040
 and gave to anyone in need.

844
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,480
 They continued to meet together in temple courts,

845
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,360
 broke bread, ate together with glad and sincere hearts,

846
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:11,560
 praising God and enjoying the favor of all the people.

847
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,080
 And the Lord added to the number daily

848
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,720
 those who were being saved.

849
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,380
 This is the fruit of the Spirit beginning to grow.

850
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,540
 Gifts and fruit, that's how the Holy Spirit

851
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:29,120
 has always wanted to work, has always been working,

852
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,520
 and how he desires to continue to work today.

853
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:35,140
 So I'm gonna ask everybody to stand.

854
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,040
 If you're able to stand, please join me in standing.

855
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,580
 And through communion right now,

856
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:45,200
 we're gonna respond to what God wants us,

857
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,940
 to however God wants us to respond.

858
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:51,240
 Our hosts are gonna hand out a piece of bread to you.

859
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:55,700
 When you get the piece of bread, just hold it in your hand,

860
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,020
 because we're gonna take it together in just a moment.

861
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:02,100
 But as you hold the bread,

862
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:06,060
 you know, the bread, the scripture tells us,

863
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,500
 is a symbol of the body of Christ

864
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:10,500
 that was given and broken for us,

865
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,320
 that God came down to earth as Jesus

866
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,340
 and chose to serve.

867
00:40:19,340 --> 00:40:23,000
 You know, one of the most beautiful pictures of unity

868
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:27,040
 we see is Jesus with his disciples.

869
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:32,600
 And before Jesus shared this meal,

870
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,900
 he got down on his hands and his feet

871
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,120
 and washed his disciples' feet,

872
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:41,820
 showing them that this is what it's like to be a servant.

873
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:43,900
 This is what I'm calling you to.

874
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:47,400
 And so as you hold the bread in your hand,

875
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,580
 have that conversation with the Holy Spirit right now.

876
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,980
 Ask him, what is my gift?

877
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,980
 And how am I to serve you with what you've gifted me with?

878
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:02,180
 Just hold onto this bread,

879
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,620
 and then we'll take it together in just a minute.

880
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,060

890
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:33,220
 So Jesus, as we hold this bread in our hands,

891
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:35,660
 firstly, we're thankful, Lord, for your presence

892
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,260
 that's always with us.

893
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:41,580
 But we know that as we've given our lives to you,

894
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,100
 Lord, there's an expectation even from you

895
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,980
 for us to serve you and bring you glory.

896
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:49,900
 And you don't do that in a mean, harsh sort of way, Lord.

897
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:53,220
 You call us and you beckon us towards you

898
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:56,460
 and you gift us so that we can find out, Lord,

899
00:42:56,460 --> 00:43:01,100
 this purpose that you put us on this earth for.

900
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:04,500
 And so Jesus, I pray that as we take this bread,

901
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,620
 you would reveal or remind it to us,

902
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:09,320
 the gifts that you've given to us.

903
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:12,420
 And as we take it in unity together,

904
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:15,540
 we'll be reminded of the role that we play in your kingdom,

905
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,380
 that we work together as one body for your glory.

906
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:22,700
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

907
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,540
 Take the bread.

908
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:28,300
 And our hosts are gonna serve you with a cup right now.

909
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:31,060
 And of course, the cup reminds us of the redemption

910
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:34,820
 and the forgiveness of sins that we have in Jesus.

911
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,260
 But this is also the juice of a fruit.

912
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:41,260
 And so as you take the cup, as you hold it again

913
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,100
 and take it together in just a moment,

914
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,980
 just like we did with the bread,

915
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:48,500
 be reminded of the fruit that God is growing in you.

916
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,180
 And if it's a time of repentance and confession

917
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:55,180
 that you need to come before the Lord for right now

918
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:59,540
 and tell him, I want this more than anything else,

919
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,020
 this is a good time to do that.

920
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,420
 And just remind yourself of the fruit

921
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:06,460
 that the Holy Spirit is trying to grow in you.

922
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:09,180
 Again, just hold it for a minute, pray,

923
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,700
 and we'll come together and take it

924
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,380
 as one body in just a second.
