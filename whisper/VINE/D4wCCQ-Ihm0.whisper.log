[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340]   And we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.040]   Everyone say, "Hey, can we thank our worship team
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.840]   who so humbly lead us each week?
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.680]   Have a seat."
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.880]   My name is Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.840]   We're glad that you're with us.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.960]   If this is relatively a new thing for you
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.800]   to come to church,
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.760]   or if this is a new thing to come to the Vine,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.520]   we're so glad that you're with us.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.320]   We have three services on Sunday, 9, 15, 11, and 2.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.280]   And it's a real privilege for us to have you
[00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.080]   a part of the two o'clock service here this afternoon.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.840]   I've been saying this for a little while
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.000]   since I returned from my Camino de Santiago,
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.840]   my big pilgrimage hike through Spain,
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.320]   an 800 kilometer journey from the south of France
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.560]   to the northwest of Spain.
[00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:44.880]   But I've been sharing with you
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.560]   that one of the great highlights of the Camino
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.840]   is getting to visit some of the cathedrals and churches
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.160]   along the pilgrimage, along the way.
[00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.440]   The walk takes about 30 to 40 days,
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.200]   depending on how you do it.
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.040]   But along the way, you come to some of these crazy cities,
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.520]   big, beautiful cities, Pamplona, Burgos, Leon,
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.720]   and of course, Santiago de Compostela
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.640]   when you get to the end.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.680]   And each one of these huge cities
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.860]   has these beautiful cathedrals.
[00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.060]   Some of the most amazing cathedrals
[00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.360]   that you'll ever likely see.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.360]   Just beautiful places, massive expanses of sacred space
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.160]   where people for hundreds, if not thousands of years
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.280]   have been gathering in that place
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.760]   to worship Jesus and walking into some of these
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.340]   majestic cathedrals really takes your breath away.
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.640]   It's really a profoundly powerful thing.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.640]   But the great thing about the Camino
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.380]   is that it's not just in the major cities
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.800]   that you get to experience that.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.120]   There are churches throughout the whole of the walk.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.160]   Every day you're going through maybe two or three
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.000]   different villages during the walk.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.940]   And each of those villages will have a church
[00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.320]   and those churches will be of a pretty decent size.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.160]   And you'll go inside of them, they're usually always open.
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.320]   Most of these town or village churches
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.960]   would have beautiful wooden pews,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.880]   beautiful paintings around the walls,
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.120]   some iconography, crosses, lots of candles burning.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.800]   Maybe they seat anywhere from say 70 to 80 to 100 people.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.080]   And these were beautiful places as well.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.160]   But also in the more rural parts of the Camino,
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.980]   in places where you're kind of not anywhere near a town
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.120]   or a village or a big urban center,
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.920]   where you've been walking perhaps for hours
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.360]   in a very quiet rural place,
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.260]   you might stumble across what I guess you would say
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.960]   would be an old rural church.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.000]   Probably one that's not been used for a while.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.140]   Maybe it's been derelict for a number of years.
[00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.680]   You can kind of tell because it's a building
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.880]   that's literally practically falling apart.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.360]   Maybe the church roof might have holes in it
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.840]   and maybe there's lots of growth around it
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.720]   in terms of weeds and the plants and trees around it.
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.660]   And these things look run down.
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.600]   But these were the churches that I liked the most.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.160]   Because these were churches that were rarely visited,
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:57.880]   not many people would go in them.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.920]   And I would find these rural churches,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.000]   I would go inside and I would be the only person in there.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.320]   And I'd probably be the only person in there
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.160]   for 20, 30 minutes.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.760]   And I would sit there and just read and pray
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.840]   and think and reflect.
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.480]   And I found like in the busyness of the Camino,
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.700]   which is a very social and busy thing,
[00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.800]   it was so nice to have these kind of run down,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.320]   derelict, abandoned, if you will, churches
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.880]   to go and spend time in, in prayer and solitude.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.240]   Well, on this one particular day,
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.720]   maybe about seven or so days before the end of my walk,
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.640]   I was cresting up a hill in a very rural area.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.800]   I'd just come through some farmland
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.440]   and I crested up this hill.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.960]   And as I did so, to the right of me
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.520]   was one of these run down, derelict church buildings.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.960]   It was just a small little building
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.440]   that was behind a stone wall and tucked into these trees.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.480]   And it looked quite dramatic.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.760]   So I took a photo of it.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.600]   It's this little kind of stone hut type thing right here.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.120]   And I looked at it and it didn't look particularly
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.080]   like anyone had been in there for a long time.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.440]   It was behind this stone wall.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.040]   But I decided I was gonna go in and pray.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.360]   So I took off my backpack and put it down.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.440]   And I climbed, kind of scrambled over the stone wall.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.980]   And I walked into this derelict building.
[00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.340]   Inside, I didn't know what I was expecting to see,
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.320]   but I was expecting to see a lot more than I did.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.600]   Inside, it was pretty much abandoned and kind of run down.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.680]   And there was really nothing there.
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.120]   In fact, I took a photo of it.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.800]   So here's what it looked like on the inside.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.840]   It was just this kind of concrete, cold building.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.160]   There were no pews.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.880]   There was just this concrete altar at the front.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.920]   There was this old wooden cross on the wall.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.080]   You could tell that the rain and the wind had seeped in a lot
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.880]   and there was like dew and mold all over the place.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:45.760]   And it was kind of a bit smelly
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.280]   and it just wasn't a very nice particular place.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.400]   And after about five minutes in there,
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.980]   I was feeling kind of creepy
[00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.040]   and like I didn't wanna be in there.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.960]   So I just prayed a really quick prayer,
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.440]   maybe like a couple of minutes.
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.520]   And then I moved on, got my backpack
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.400]   and kept on walking along the path.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.280]   I walked about another five kilometers.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.680]   And by then I was like, I think I'm done for the day.
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:07.520]   I'm pretty comfortable.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.020]   I've walked quite a long way today.
[00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:11.240]   And I came to this village with this big church.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.860]   And the church was actually quite well known
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.680]   for welcoming pilgrims in.
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.000]   And you could sleep on the floor of the church
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.340]   for a very small donation.
[00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.860]   So for around about like three or four euros,
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.000]   you could do a little donation
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.240]   and you could sleep on a mat on the floor,
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.600]   the cold floor of the church.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.480]   But the reason why people would go and do it
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.640]   is because there were these monks that ran that church.
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.840]   And the monks were famous for their cooking.
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.400]   And every night they would cook a communal meal.
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:36.600]   And if you're a pilgrim,
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.280]   you're starving by the end of the day.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.660]   And this idea of these monks cooking you a meal
[00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.020]   is like super cool.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.360]   So I went in, I paid my three or four euro donation.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.600]   I had my little mats on the stone floor of the church.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.960]   And then that evening, of course,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.280]   they cooked this incredible meal and we sat down.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.400]   I sat down next to this man and I got chatting with him
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.360]   and his English was pretty good.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.880]   And we got chatting together.
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.500]   And it turned out that he was the local priest
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.760]   of the local parish of that area.
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:07.600]   Now, I didn't tell him I was a pastor or anything like that,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.520]   but it was fascinating to talk to this guy
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.440]   who was this priest of this area.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.280]   And as we were talking and stuff, I was like,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.540]   oh, you never guess what, earlier today,
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.680]   as I was walking here, I came across this rundown,
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.240]   abandoned, derelict church.
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.200]   And I got my phone out and I showed him these two photos.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.120]   And as I did, his eyes lit up.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.760]   He's like, that's my church.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.640]   I'm like, what?
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.440]   He's like, yeah, that's my church.
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.320]   I said, you mean this one is your church?
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.680]   I said, you look after this church?
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.380]   You are not doing a good job
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.240]   of looking after your church, okay?
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.320]   This thing smells, it's rundown, it's damp.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:45.600]   Don't worry, I didn't say that to him.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.080]   But that was what I was thinking on the inside.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.480]   That was my inside voice
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.360]   that luckily I kept inside in that moment.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.800]   But I'm thinking like, that's crazy.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   And I said, well, tell me about this church.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.640]   He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:59.960]   Well, so each Sunday, he's like, I prepare a sermon.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.000]   And then me and my dog,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.280]   we walk the five kilometers to this church.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.440]   And he says, we go in there.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.360]   And he says, look, on some Sundays,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.280]   there is a revival and maybe five people come.
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.760]   I'm like, five people?
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.680]   He's like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.600]   Some Sundays we get five people.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:17.480]   He's like, so excited.
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.280]   And he's like, but often what would happen is,
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   on most Sundays, it's just me and my dog.
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.280]   And then he says, on half of those Sundays,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   my dog doesn't even bother to come with me, it's just me.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.720]   And he says, I prepare a sermon every Sunday
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:32.880]   and I show up there.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.760]   And if somebody comes, then I share my sermon with them.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.360]   And we do the pastor or the priestly rites.
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.000]   But if no one comes, then I just sit there and pray.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.920]   I'm like, you do this every Sunday?
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.680]   He's like, yeah, every Sunday, I prepare a message,
[00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.080]   go there, if someone shows up, great.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.480]   If not, I just sit and pray.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:53.920]   I said, how long have you been serving in this church?
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.840]   He said, and this is literally what he said.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.960]   He said, oh, not too long.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.400]   He said, about 38 years.
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:03.120]   I said, what?
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:03.960]   I said, what do you mean?
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:06.720]   He's like, yeah, about 38 years, he said.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.400]   I said, you've been serving this church for 38 years
[00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:12.920]   and you prepare a sermon every Sunday.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:17.040]   And on the majorities of Sundays, no one shows up?
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:20.440]   Well, we got talking about other things
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:21.960]   and kind of the evening went away.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:23.680]   But I remember like that night as I'm lying
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:26.560]   on the cold stone floor in my little mat,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.240]   I remember thinking to myself this, man, what a waste.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.360]   Like I'm sure this guy is like a really nice guy.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.400]   He was nice, he was funny, he was a good communicator.
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.920]   I was like, I'm sure he preaches great sermons.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.760]   Like what a waste of his gifts
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:39.920]   and what a waste of his talents.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.520]   It must be so frustrating for him
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.000]   to feel like such a failure.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.800]   I remember lying there thinking like,
[00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.920]   I need to pray for this guy, you know?
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.600]   I need to pray that real revival comes
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.680]   and that his church becomes a success, right?
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.080]   And so I committed myself that night,
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.120]   I'm gonna pray for this guy.
[00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.680]   I'm gonna pray every, the rest of my days of walking,
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.000]   I'm gonna remember him and pray for him.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.560]   The next morning we woke up and we rolled our mats up
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.280]   and the priest gave us hugs and wished us all the best
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:07.120]   and we started walking on the path of the Camino
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:07.960]   for the next day.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:11.040]   And as I did, I fell into prayer at some point
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.520]   and as I fell into prayer,
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.720]   I thought of this man straightaway, this priest,
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:16.720]   and I was about to start my prayer.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.320]   You know, Lord, just bless this man.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.040]   He must be so over things.
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:21.760]   He must be like feeling like such a failure,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.640]   Lord, fill him with your love, you know?
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.720]   Like I had the best prayer ever for this guy, right?
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.840]   As I'm beginning to pray for him,
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:30.440]   you know like those times when you're praying
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.160]   and like God shows up, right?
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:33.640]   Anyone ever experienced that?
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:35.480]   No?
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.520]   You know like when you pray, God comes and shows up
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.560]   and it's like part of your prayer, anyway.
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.800]   So I'm praying and God shows up and he shows up
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.840]   and he's like typical like, like he slaps me,
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.080]   like metaphorically slaps me, okay, across my face.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.760]   Like and immediately I knew it was like
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:54.120]   one of those moments where the Lord was not happy with me
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.920]   and where I realized that there was something going on
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.640]   in my attitude or my thinking that wasn't quite right.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:03.000]   And so he began to speak to me and I took out my phone
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.760]   and I started to write down as I often do
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:05.800]   and I feel like God's speaking to me,
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.600]   writing down kind of things he was saying
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   and it wasn't easy what he said.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:09.440]   Let me read it to you.
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.600]   He said this.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.480]   He said, "Andrew, you need to redefine
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.960]   "what you think is successful in ministry and what is not.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.360]   "Your attitude is wrong and your thinking flawed.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   "I have not called you to be successful,
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.680]   "I have called you to be faithful.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:25.680]   "And last night I put beside you one of my favorite examples
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:27.800]   "of this kind of success in my kingdom.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:30.560]   "You were fortunate to be in his presence."
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.760]   Which was deeply challenging to me
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:36.520]   because I thought he was fortunate to be in my presence.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.800]   'Cause I'm a great pastor of a big church in Hong Kong
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.960]   and we have lots of people come on a Sunday.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:47.920]   And I thought this guy needs to learn a few tips and tricks,
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.360]   how to get the people back with great stories.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:57.120]   But I was the one fortunate to be in his presence.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.120]   And it was almost like I was in his presence.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.120]   And it was almost like God was saying,
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:03.600]   "I'm looking down, Andrew, on you and this guy.
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.360]   "And if you were to judge success in the kingdom
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.760]   "in worldly perspectives, then yeah,
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.040]   "you're doing a great job.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.200]   "But if you actually wanna judge your ministry
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.240]   "by the successful standards of the kingdom,
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:22.560]   "this man is the one you need to be spending time with.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.760]   "Because I don't look at things the way that the world does.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.440]   "And this one is faithful."
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.240]   As we continue to think about what it is for us
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.720]   as a church community in this season
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.920]   to move into uncharted territory and uncharted waters.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.080]   We've been saying in this series
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:42.120]   that we've been doing here at the Vine
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.480]   that this whole series on Acts is about
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.360]   how do we posture our hearts
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.800]   for the season that's ahead of us.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.960]   And if God is taking us into uncharted waters,
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:51.760]   we have to realize that right at the start,
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.280]   we need to redefine for ourselves
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.320]   what success is gonna mean for us in this season.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.000]   And if we don't redefine for us what success means,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.840]   then we're gonna head into an uncharted season
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.600]   and into uncharted waters,
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.640]   thinking that we know what we want God to do
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:12.800]   or what we think will define for us what success is.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:14.680]   And when that may not happen,
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.080]   we'll walk out of this season feeling deflated and upset.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.880]   And actually there is so much here
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:22.240]   that I think we have to realize
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:25.440]   is that we so often hold on to a worldly perspective
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.040]   of what success is,
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.040]   whether that's for the church communally,
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:31.000]   whether that's for you individually,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.680]   and particularly here in Hong Kong,
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:35.560]   we so drive ourselves by that thinking
[00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:38.200]   of what we think success should look like
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:40.500]   when actually when it comes to the kingdom of God,
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.640]   it's anything but.
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:46.240]   It's like a procession of death
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.480]   getting actually met with the true procession of life.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:52.320]   If I was to put it as simply as I could,
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.940]   I would say it this way.
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:58.600]   I would say that if we really wanna be the people in Hong Kong
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:02.280]   who are ready to move when the Holy Spirit speaks,
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.880]   we will have to release the pressure to succeed
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.880]   with the priority to be faithful.
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.320]   Come on, church.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.920]   We will need to release the pressure
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:14.840]   that we feel all the time in this city
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:18.120]   to be successful, defined by however that might be,
[00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:21.480]   and we will need to embrace the priority
[00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:24.680]   to put in our lives a priority to be faithful
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:27.040]   to whatever it is that God has called us to do
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.880]   over and above looking successful
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.500]   in how the world might deem that and look at that and say.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.320]   Not that there's nothing wrong with achieving things.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:38.480]   Not that there's nothing wrong with doing well
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:42.100]   and getting promoted and having a good life
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.240]   and having a great job.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.000]   There's nothing at all wrong with that stuff.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.080]   The problem is though,
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.960]   in the terms of how we often think of what success looks like
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.180]   in the corporate world or just the world that's out there,
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.320]   when we take that and apply that to God's kingdom,
[00:13:54.320 --> 00:13:57.200]   it's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:13:58.480]   And while there's nothing wrong
[00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:01.400]   with a sense of worldly success in our lives,
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.000]   where we want to be found is faithful.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.920]   And what we have to understand
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.960]   is that sometimes a commitment to faithfulness
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.160]   will actually look very different
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:12.760]   to what worldly success looks like.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.360]   In fact, I would define it like this.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:16.960]   I would say success in God's kingdom
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:20.200]   is not found in the abundance of achievement,
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:22.880]   it's found in the faithfulness of obedience.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:26.160]   It's not found in the abundance
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.340]   of the things that we achieve in life.
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:31.240]   It's actually found in just being faithful
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:33.560]   to the small thing perhaps
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:36.060]   that God has asked us to be obedient to.
[00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:41.440]   During Vision Sunday, back at the beginning of March,
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:44.200]   as I kicked off this season of Unchartedness with us,
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.480]   I shared about that picture of an early pioneer boat.
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:50.160]   Remember this, the pioneers, the early settlers
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.480]   that would get on a boat and they would push off
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.160]   and they'd be going out in search of new lands,
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.060]   lands that have never been discovered before,
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.540]   where there were no maps or anything for the waters
[00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:01.320]   in which they were sailing into.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:02.520]   And they would go with that mixture
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.040]   of excitement and nervousness.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.920]   And I shared on that Sunday the picture
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:08.440]   of like the captain who's leaning forward
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:09.740]   in the bow with the telescope,
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.540]   looking out towards where the new lands might be.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.980]   But then all these other sailors on the ship
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:18.000]   who are each doing their own little part on the ship
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.240]   so in order the boat to go in the direction
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.480]   that the captain actually wants the boat to go in.
[00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:25.440]   One of the things I didn't share that Sunday though
[00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:27.800]   is in the days of the early settlers
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:29.600]   when they were sending out these boats,
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:31.920]   the majority of the boats would go out
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:34.160]   and come back having discovered nothing.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.440]   Maybe they had two months of supplies on the boat
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.280]   when they set out from port.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.980]   And at the critical time,
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:42.660]   they realized that if they kept going,
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:45.460]   they would all die 'cause their stuff would run out.
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:47.600]   So they have to turn around and go back to harbor
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:49.700]   before anybody else would starve.
[00:15:49.700 --> 00:15:51.780]   So they had to make these judgment calls all the time.
[00:15:51.780 --> 00:15:53.520]   And the majority of the boats that went out
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:56.560]   would return having discovered nothing.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:58.880]   Can you imagine if you were in the boat,
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.240]   if you were one of those sailors
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.640]   who had gone out for two months and had found nothing
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.840]   and came back to the harbor empty handed,
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.320]   you'd be feeling upset, you'd be feeling frustrated.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.920]   You didn't achieve the thing
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:10.740]   that you were hoping to achieve.
[00:16:10.740 --> 00:16:13.100]   We gotta be very careful
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.580]   and we have to think about this really importantly.
[00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.020]   For us at the Vine is we're launching out
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:19.580]   into uncharted waters.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:22.020]   The temptation for us is going to be
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:24.300]   always to discover the land.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:28.580]   As if like the whole purpose of setting out
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.740]   is to discover this thing out there.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:32.140]   I want you to know this,
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.700]   when God calls a church into uncharted seasons,
[00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:37.380]   He is not promising the spectacular.
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:40.160]   He's not promising that there's gonna be
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:42.520]   suddenly something amazing up ahead.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:44.660]   There may be, there may not be,
[00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:46.640]   the promise, the focus for us
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:48.860]   is not on what we might achieve.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:51.560]   The focus is if we're being faithful
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.480]   in what He's asked us to do.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.660]   We saw this beautifully last week
[00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:58.920]   when promise preached on Ananias and Paul.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.920]   And when we saw Ananias, right?
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:03.160]   Who God calls him to go to Paul,
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:06.060]   but God doesn't give him how it's all gonna turn out.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.680]   He doesn't say, "Hey, this is all gonna go well for you.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:08.960]   "Everything's gonna be great.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:09.880]   "You're gonna be fine.
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:11.820]   "I know he's scary and he's been killing people like you,
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.720]   "but don't worry."
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.680]   God didn't reassure him of any of that
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:16.560]   like promise said last week.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:20.960]   But what Ananias was called to do was to go.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.840]   And Ananias was faithful to go.
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.060]   And if we, as we start this season as a church,
[00:17:28.060 --> 00:17:28.900]   are kind of saying,
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:32.340]   well, we're only gonna go if it's worth it.
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:34.360]   We're only gonna go if we're gonna discover
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.100]   the thing that God has for us.
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.240]   We're only gonna go out there
[00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.080]   if that's the way.
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:41.140]   In other words, if we become outcome focused,
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:43.100]   what we've done is we've put ourselves
[00:17:43.100 --> 00:17:44.880]   like the captain in the bow
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.360]   rather than putting ourselves in the heart of the ship.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.080]   Our role is not the captain.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:51.040]   That is Jesus.
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.760]   Jesus is the one who, as we head out into the unknown,
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.520]   he's the one steering the ship
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:58.080]   by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.440]   telling us where to go.
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:04.040]   And we, our concern is not the eventual outcome of that.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:06.840]   Our concern is are we doing and steering the ship
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.240]   in the direction he wants us to?
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.000]   Is this making sense to you?
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.440]   As soon as we start over focusing
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.800]   and over emphasizing on what's out there,
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:19.320]   we'll end up standing on the deck of the boat,
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:21.040]   staring out into the horizon
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:22.880]   and not steering the ship at all.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:30.320]   Success and failure are words reserved for the captain.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:36.080]   The words reserved for us is faithfulness.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:39.360]   Faithfulness is what the servants do.
[00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:42.600]   When Jesus says, "Come and follow me,"
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:48.720]   he's inviting us into a journey of being found faithful.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.800]   And while there may be for some of us in this room
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:55.520]   in the season ahead, amazing, spectacular, incredible things
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.240]   and of course we believe and hope and pray
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.600]   that that will be the case for some of us,
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:02.260]   the reality is for many of us in this season of Uncharted,
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:04.980]   there may not be the dramatic around the corner.
[00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:07.220]   But whether there is or there isn't,
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.260]   God looks and he turns to you and says,
[00:19:09.260 --> 00:19:10.500]   "Here's what I call of you.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:11.860]   "Here's what I require of you.
[00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:14.060]   "Here's what I'm asking of you.
[00:19:14.060 --> 00:19:15.420]   "That the very small thing
[00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.820]   "that I've already placed in your hands,
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:19.420]   "the very thing that to everybody else
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.980]   "might seem everyday, might seem ordinary,
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:25.140]   "might even seem mundane, that's the thing.
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:29.060]   "That through hundreds and thousands of people
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.140]   "who commit to the daily following of Jesus,
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:34.780]   "the faithfulness in the small things,
[00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:37.140]   "God then does the big thing."
[00:19:37.140 --> 00:19:43.380]   And this invitation to us is so important and so profound
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:46.420]   because it's an invitation to life,
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.620]   which seems so counterintuitive
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:50.700]   to what the world might try to tell us.
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.980]   Life is found in the abundance of bigger and better.
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:56.260]   The kingdom says life is found
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:20:00.620]   in the simple small sacrifices of being found faithful.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:05.420]   Like a priest who prepares a sermon every Sunday
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.700]   even though he has no people in his church.
[00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.660]   Or like a parent who has faithfully prayed
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:15.020]   for their adult child to come to Jesus,
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.620]   but year after year it seems like that child
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.700]   is just getting further and further away.
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:23.100]   Like the small business owner
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.820]   who's faithfully making sacrificial decisions
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.620]   that no one will ever know
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:30.580]   in order to ensure that the business
[00:20:30.580 --> 00:20:33.620]   would be able to stay afloat in a tough market.
[00:20:33.620 --> 00:20:37.380]   The day by day faithful decisions
[00:20:37.380 --> 00:20:40.420]   of what God has put in our hands.
[00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:43.300]   When we live like that,
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.500]   God says you are lucky to be in that person's presence.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.700]   What I love about the book of Acts,
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:54.740]   which we've been studying in this series,
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.780]   is that the book of Acts
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:21:00.420]   is not actually how it appears when you read it.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:02.100]   The book of Acts as Luke presents it
[00:21:02.100 --> 00:21:04.020]   of course is presenting this story
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:06.420]   of these incredible men
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:09.300]   who are almost like super apostles, right?
[00:21:09.300 --> 00:21:11.700]   The ones that do amazing things.
[00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:15.980]   People like Peter and Paul and Barnabas and Silas and James.
[00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:19.140]   These great early leaders of the church.
[00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.980]   And Luke as he's presenting the work of the early church,
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:24.700]   he's highlighting the amazing things
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:27.980]   that these great people do in the faith.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:29.060]   And when we read the book of Acts,
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.260]   it's tempting for us to kind of think
[00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.460]   that the reason why the church in Acts,
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:36.220]   the early church, grew to such power and prominence
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:39.460]   is because only of these amazing few
[00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.740]   that do such great things.
[00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:43.460]   But actually dig a little bit below the surface
[00:21:43.460 --> 00:21:44.900]   in the book of Acts and you'll realize
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.300]   that the thing that actually grew and sustained the church
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.780]   wasn't the big amazing super apostles,
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:54.100]   it was those in the towns and the villages
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:55.660]   who were a part of the church
[00:21:55.660 --> 00:22:00.500]   who day in, day out built God's church.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.580]   The unknown, the unmentioned.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:05.940]   Did you know that one of the most prominent churches
[00:22:05.940 --> 00:22:09.560]   in the whole of the time period that Acts covers
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.160]   is the church in Antioch?
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.380]   It's the church where people were called Christians
[00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:15.020]   for the very first time
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:16.920]   because of the way that they were living their lives.
[00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:20.340]   That church was not founded by any of the apostles.
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:22.100]   We don't even know the names of the people
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:23.380]   that founded the church,
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.140]   but that church was the most prominent church
[00:22:26.140 --> 00:22:28.380]   in all of the book of Acts,
[00:22:28.380 --> 00:22:31.500]   founded by a bunch of people
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.940]   who will never know their names,
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:35.380]   but they were found faithful.
[00:22:35.380 --> 00:22:39.220]   Every once in a while, as Luke is presenting
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:41.460]   the story of these amazing apostles and what they did,
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:44.300]   he drops into the narrative a glimpse
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.940]   of some of these kind of not known,
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.860]   not really celebrated, kind of know nothing type people
[00:22:52.860 --> 00:22:54.180]   who because of their faithfulness
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:57.260]   do something truly profound.
[00:22:57.260 --> 00:22:59.060]   And I wanna share one of those stories with you.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.860]   It's an apostle by the name of Jason.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:02.900]   So he's not an apostle.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.860]   It's a person by the name of Jason.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.540]   And Jason lives in a town called Thessalonica.
[00:23:09.540 --> 00:23:11.780]   And Thessalonica was one of the towns
[00:23:11.780 --> 00:23:13.940]   that Paul and Silas came to
[00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:16.460]   in the middle of their second missionary journey.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.900]   And during this journey,
[00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:19.300]   they visited a whole bunch of places
[00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:21.500]   and they come to the city of Thessalonica.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:24.140]   And in Thessalonica, Paul and Silas do
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.260]   what they would always do in their missionary journey,
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:27.900]   and that is go to the synagogue
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:30.540]   and start to share Jesus with the Jews living
[00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:33.260]   or are a part of the synagogue there.
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.780]   And as they do that, things begin to happen in the city.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:38.380]   And I wanna pick up the story from that point.
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:41.020]   So this is Acts 17, starting in verse four.
[00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:45.020]   Some of the Jews were persuaded by Paul and Silas
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:46.260]   in their presentation of the gospel
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:47.980]   and joined Paul and Silas,
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.020]   as did a large number of God-fearing Greeks
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.020]   and not a few prominent women.
[00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:54.820]   But the Jews were jealous.
[00:23:54.820 --> 00:23:57.780]   So they rounded up some bad characters from the marketplace,
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.260]   formed a mob and started a riot in the city.
[00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:05.140]   They rushed to Jason's house in search of Paul and Silas
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.780]   in order to bring them out to the crowd.
[00:24:07.780 --> 00:24:10.140]   This is the first time we hear of this person, Jason.
[00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.580]   And here's what takes place.
[00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:15.740]   We don't get any backstory about Jason whatsoever.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:17.140]   Luke doesn't give us any details.
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:19.540]   But because we understand a little bit
[00:24:19.540 --> 00:24:21.020]   about how the churches were formed
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.900]   and how the church was run at that time,
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.620]   we can make some pretty good guesses
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:26.260]   about the sort of person Jason was.
[00:24:26.260 --> 00:24:29.860]   First of all, he had obviously had enough wealth
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:31.940]   whereby he had a home that was large enough
[00:24:31.940 --> 00:24:34.020]   to have people like Paul and Silas and others
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:35.220]   come and stay and live with him.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:36.420]   That wasn't a given.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:39.660]   So he's a man of relative successful career background
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:41.300]   and a bit of finance.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:43.860]   We also know of course, that he's a believer in Jesus.
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.980]   And it's very likely that he was already a believer
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:49.600]   before Paul and Silas showed up.
[00:24:49.600 --> 00:24:52.980]   Paul and Silas did not found the church in Thessalonica.
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:55.980]   The church was already active and going.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:24:57.500]   It's possible, we don't know,
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.300]   but it's possible that Jason was one of the people
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.980]   on the church in Jerusalem.
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.500]   And that when persecution came to Jerusalem in 70 AD
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:07.700]   and the church spread out into the Greek Roman Empire,
[00:25:07.700 --> 00:25:11.260]   a number of the believers ended up settling in Thessalonica.
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:12.780]   So whether that was Jason or not,
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:15.620]   we know that he settled in this village, in this town, sorry.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:16.980]   And as he settled in this town,
[00:25:16.980 --> 00:25:20.660]   he starts what we can assume is a church in his home.
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:23.140]   We can assume this because when the mob
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:25.060]   are searching for Paul and Silas,
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.580]   they choose to go to Jason's house and looking for him.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:30.940]   In other words, they must have known that Jason
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.060]   was holding or hosting some sort of Christian community
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:36.980]   in his home in Thessalonica.
[00:25:36.980 --> 00:25:38.820]   So peel back the curtain for a sec.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:42.360]   Here's Jason and he's kind of like a nobody.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:45.180]   He's done well in business, he's made some money.
[00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:46.900]   He's come to faith at some point in his life
[00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:49.140]   through some way and he started running a church
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:49.980]   in his home.
[00:25:49.980 --> 00:25:51.980]   Now that church is gonna be small.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:55.020]   I mean, Thessalonica was hostile to the gospel.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.660]   It was a hard place for people who believed in Jesus.
[00:25:58.660 --> 00:26:00.260]   So maybe there were five people at the church,
[00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:01.380]   maybe there were 10 people, 15,
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.440]   we don't know the numbers at all.
[00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.460]   But it's a little bit like my priest in the Camino.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:10.500]   Jason faithfully preparing a message every week
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:13.300]   to sit with the people that were coming to his house
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.700]   to hold onto the hope that this Jesus
[00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.700]   was actually the Messiah in the middle
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:19.260]   of the Greco-Roman Empire.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:22.540]   But then one day something amazing happens.
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.540]   One day all of Jason and the church's prayers were answered
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.540]   'cause they had been praying that God would send them
[00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:28.820]   some success.
[00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.620]   They had been praying that God would do something special
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:34.900]   in their city and now Paul and Silas has shown up.
[00:26:34.900 --> 00:26:38.060]   Paul, the apostle Paul, the one that everybody
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:40.300]   had heard stories about who was persecuting the church
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:42.660]   and then came into this dramatic encounter with Jesus
[00:26:42.660 --> 00:26:45.780]   and was now powerfully doing miracles for God
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:47.020]   in the Greco-Roman Empire.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:49.060]   He's now shown up in Thessalonica.
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:51.740]   And you can imagine for Jason and his little house church,
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.220]   they're like so excited.
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.460]   Finally, success is gonna come for our ministry.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.160]   Finally, people are gonna come to faith.
[00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.740]   And Luke says to us that actually some success does come.
[00:27:02.740 --> 00:27:04.940]   Some of the Jews come to faith in the synagogue,
[00:27:04.940 --> 00:27:07.540]   some prominent women come to faith, which is great.
[00:27:07.540 --> 00:27:10.420]   A large number of Greek people begin to believe in Jesus.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.860]   And so there's this mini sort of revival taking place
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.820]   and Jason must be so excited about this
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.460]   and then something happens.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:22.180]   Notice in verse six, it says this,
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.580]   "But when they did not find them,"
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:26.540]   this is the crowd looking for Paul and Silas,
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:29.580]   "they dragged Jason and some other brothers
[00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.100]   "before the city officials and shouted,
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.020]   "'These men have caused trouble all over the world
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.460]   "'and have now come here,'
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.460]   "and Jason has welcomed them into his house.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.080]   "They are all defying Caesar's decrees,
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:46.540]   "saying that there is another king, one called Jesus."
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:52.060]   Jason's life has just become a nightmare.
[00:27:52.060 --> 00:27:54.080]   What he thought was revival,
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.120]   what he thought was a definition
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.940]   of what success would look like,
[00:27:57.940 --> 00:28:01.380]   suddenly, because they can't find Paul and Silas,
[00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:02.700]   he's dragged before the courts.
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.500]   He's dragged before the very people
[00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.180]   had the power to sentence him to death.
[00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:08.580]   And when he's dragged in front of them,
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:09.860]   notice what happens.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:12.460]   They begin to accuse Jason
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.420]   of what they were accusing Paul and Silas of.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:16.780]   They can't find Paul and Silas,
[00:28:16.780 --> 00:28:18.860]   so they have to find somebody to take the heat,
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.580]   somebody to take the punishment
[00:28:20.580 --> 00:28:22.620]   for the crime that they had for Paul and Silas.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:24.860]   And so Jason and the brothers in his church
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.260]   are the ones who begin to take the punishment,
[00:28:28.260 --> 00:28:30.620]   who are the ones accused of doing the things
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.140]   that Paul and Silas were doing,
[00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:34.140]   even though they hadn't done them.
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:37.140]   And they're accused and they're brought before the court
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.700]   and the punishment is being given to them
[00:28:39.700 --> 00:28:41.740]   rather than Paul and Silas.
[00:28:41.740 --> 00:28:45.140]   It's like Jason is now having to stand in the gap
[00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:46.740]   on behalf of Paul and Silas,
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:48.260]   and he's the one being slandered.
[00:28:48.260 --> 00:28:50.220]   He's the one being told he's a criminal.
[00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.340]   He's the one who's being punished
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:53.980]   for what's happening in the city.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.780]   Not only that, but notice what happens next in verse eight.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.860]   It says this.
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:00.940]   It says, "When they heard this,
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.620]   "the crowd and the whole city officials
[00:29:02.620 --> 00:29:04.200]   "were thrown into turmoil.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.720]   "Then they made Jason and the others post bond
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:09.380]   "and let them go."
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.180]   This phrase, post bond.
[00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:12.400]   This is a really interesting thing
[00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.900]   that happened in those days.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:16.460]   What would happen is that you get dragged before the court,
[00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:18.260]   you get accused of all these crimes.
[00:29:18.260 --> 00:29:20.860]   You're supposed to have the punishment for those crimes,
[00:29:20.860 --> 00:29:24.660]   but you could pay a extortionately high price,
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:28.980]   spend money to buy yourself out of that punishment.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:31.980]   To basically buy, to pay the price
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:34.520]   so that that punishment no longer applies
[00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:36.220]   to Paul and Silas.
[00:29:36.220 --> 00:29:38.580]   So this is quite profound because now Jason
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:40.680]   is not only suffering on their behalf,
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:43.440]   being accused for what they should have been accused for,
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:47.560]   he's now paying the price so that they can go free.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:50.060]   And that price was a high price.
[00:29:50.060 --> 00:29:53.080]   It was a very extortionate amount of money.
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.320]   And most people didn't pay it
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.400]   'cause it was so stupidly expensive,
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:58.480]   and therefore you'd have to suffer under punishment.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:01.280]   But somehow Jason and his brothers get this money together.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:04.800]   They pay the bond price so that Paul and Silas
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.600]   could go free.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:09.680]   Think about this.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:11.640]   I wonder if that reminds you of anyone.
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:16.080]   I wonder if that reminds you of someone called Jesus
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:19.920]   in Jerusalem who's himself arrested
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:23.320]   and put on trial for crimes that he didn't commit.
[00:30:23.320 --> 00:30:26.120]   Who is put before trial before all the people,
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.400]   slandered for things that he had not done,
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:32.480]   silent before those that were accusing him.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.960]   And one who eventually is taken to the cross
[00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.840]   and nailed to that cross,
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:40.180]   having to pay the high bond price
[00:30:40.180 --> 00:30:43.960]   so that those, you and me, who should have been punished
[00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.380]   are now set free.
[00:30:45.380 --> 00:30:47.960]   Interesting, isn't it?
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.300]   That in the Christian faith,
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:54.680]   the greatest symbol of hope and life, the cross of Jesus,
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.260]   is actually by its very definition,
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:31:00.220]   the antithesis of success in the world's eyes.
[00:31:00.220 --> 00:31:04.700]   In fact, the cross looks like failure.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.020]   It looks like everything didn't work out.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:09.320]   In fact, it looks so much that way
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:12.360]   that the people in the world were mocking and laughing.
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.040]   Call yourself the king of the Jews.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:16.040]   You can't even save yourself.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.800]   But actually, when God looks at the cross of Jesus,
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:25.000]   God looks at it with a different definition of success.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:26.720]   And he looks down on his son Jesus
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.780]   and he says, "This one has remained faithful.
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.420]   "This one has been faithful
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:34.000]   "to the things that I had called him to do."
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.640]   Oh, there was that time in the Mount of Olives
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:38.200]   when he wrestled.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:40.800]   Oh Lord, if you could take this cup from me, please take it.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.440]   "But your will be done," Jesus says.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.880]   And when God looks at the cross of Jesus,
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.060]   he sees the most successful thing
[00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.240]   that has ever happened in the kingdom.
[00:31:52.240 --> 00:31:54.420]   Somebody who was so faithful
[00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.740]   that he was willing to forgive all of the world's sin,
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:32:00.800]   that the bond price was paid by his blood
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.500]   so that everybody else would go free.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:07.240]   The cross is this beautiful picture, powerful picture,
[00:32:07.240 --> 00:32:10.480]   of what success looks like in God's kingdom.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:13.240]   One man who is found faithful.
[00:32:13.240 --> 00:32:16.220]   So now here's Jason.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.580]   Jason, who was thinking success was gonna look like this,
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:20.800]   and there was a little bit of that
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:22.620]   looking like it was happening.
[00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:26.660]   But then is suddenly brought to his own moment of the cross
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.780]   and Jason having to walk the very same path
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:31.540]   that Jesus walked on behalf of Paul and Silas.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:33.880]   I don't know about you, but if I was Jason,
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.460]   I would have been very tempted
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:37.660]   to be a little bit like Judas,
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:38.500]   to say to the magistrate,
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:41.420]   "Hey guys, okay, you couldn't find him in my home.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.400]   "That's 'cause I know where he is.
[00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:44.800]   "In fact, if you let me go,
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.960]   "if you follow me, we'll go to the marketplace.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.940]   "The man that I go up to and kiss, that man's Paul."
[00:32:51.180 --> 00:32:53.500]   He could have taken the Judas route.
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.140]   I think Jason could have also taken the Peter route.
[00:32:56.140 --> 00:32:58.460]   He could have gone, "I don't know Paul and Silas.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.300]   "I don't know who they are.
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.460]   "Pfft, who, Paul and Silas?
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:01.300]   "I don't know Paul and Silas.
[00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:02.280]   "Do you know Paul and Silas?
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.340]   "Oh, we don't know Paul and Silas."
[00:33:04.340 --> 00:33:07.740]   Right, he could have denied even knowing Paul and Silas.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:10.460]   I think Jason had a lot of outs.
[00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:11.940]   He had a lot of ways that he could handle this.
[00:33:11.940 --> 00:33:13.280]   He didn't have to spend all his money
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:15.420]   to pay the bond price so that they could go free.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:18.000]   But here's Jason, a nobody,
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:22.780]   running a small church in the city of Thessalonica,
[00:33:22.780 --> 00:33:24.620]   a city hostile to the faith.
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:27.700]   He decides, "Even if it's gonna cost me,
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.260]   "I'm gonna be found faithful."
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:33.420]   And so he makes small decisions
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:35.400]   that have big ramifications.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.140]   Now, here's the other interesting thing.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:40.180]   The narrative, Luke writing the story,
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.300]   suddenly that night, Paul and Silas,
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:44.380]   they flee Thessalonica,
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:47.820]   and Luke follows now Paul and Silas' story again.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.340]   And the spotlight shifts away from Jason and Thessalonica
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:53.260]   to Paul and Silas, and the next thing they do,
[00:33:53.260 --> 00:33:54.540]   the next great place they go to,
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:56.060]   and the next great miracle they do,
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.100]   here's the thing, though.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:59.660]   Jason remained behind.
[00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:01.660]   Oh, we don't hear this story.
[00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:03.820]   This story's not told us in the book of Acts,
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.060]   but if you dig a little bit below and have a think about it,
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.900]   Jason remained in Thessalonica.
[00:34:07.900 --> 00:34:09.620]   I mean, he remained there.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:11.160]   He had nowhere else to go.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:13.300]   He wasn't off on some great crusade.
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:15.020]   He was the one who just spent all his money
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:17.220]   to enable Paul and Silas to go.
[00:34:17.220 --> 00:34:19.900]   He was the one whose reputation has now been slandered,
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:22.700]   and he's the one who's got to now live in the very town
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.320]   where he's become famous for all the wrong reasons.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:30.460]   He's the one who's gonna have to now suffer
[00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.300]   day in, day out for the faithfulness
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:35.200]   that he's shown to the kingdom of God.
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:39.500]   Now, we don't know because Luke doesn't tell us,
[00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:44.720]   but a number of years later when Paul is in prison,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.760]   and he's thinking, how do I leave a legacy?
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.780]   What are the churches I need to reach out to and encourage?
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.260]   He writes two letters to the church of Thessalonica,
[00:34:54.260 --> 00:34:57.180]   one and two Thessalonians that we have in our scriptures.
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:01.960]   So something happened through the faithfulness of Jason
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.560]   that would grow to such an extent
[00:35:03.560 --> 00:35:05.560]   that Paul eventually would write these letters
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:07.880]   to the church to encourage them and inspire them.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:09.640]   The church didn't die out.
[00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:14.640]   The church thrived because one man was faithful.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:20.600]   The vine itself has been built over some 30 years now
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.160]   by men and women that have been incredibly faithful.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.000]   This church has not grown just because
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.540]   there's been a few people with a gift
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.560]   who have stood on a stage or a platform in the spotlight
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:31.200]   and done something.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.680]   This church has grown and has done what it's done
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.600]   in our city in the humble ways that we have
[00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:40.520]   off the back of hundreds of Jasons over the years.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:43.640]   Paul and Silas needed Jasons in their ministry.
[00:35:43.640 --> 00:35:45.480]   The vines needed them in ours.
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   Let me introduce you just briefly
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.720]   to two of those Jasons in our midst.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:51.060]   This is Auntie Hing and Auntie Heng.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:54.320]   Auntie Hing and Auntie Heng may not be familiar to you,
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.360]   particularly here at the two o'clock
[00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:57.520]   when we don't have children's ministry available,
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:01.080]   but Auntie Hing and Auntie Heng have run the creche
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:06.080]   at our church pretty much every Sunday for 30 years
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.520]   here at the vine.
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.640]   For almost 30 years, these two ladies
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:16.400]   have served our creche ministry at the vine.
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:19.600]   They have sat and looked after the youngest
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:24.160]   of the children of our church for almost 30 years.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:26.520]   If you've been coming to the vine for any period of time
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:30.080]   and you've had a young child, a toddler or below,
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:34.640]   here at the vine, these ladies have looked after your child.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:38.000]   These were the ladies that spoke faith into your children
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:39.520]   before anyone else did.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:42.680]   These were the ones who never did it for spotlight,
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.000]   fame, never did it so that we'd put their photo
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:45.840]   up in front of everybody.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:47.080]   In fact, when we told them we were doing this,
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.040]   they ran away.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:53.640]   But for 30 years, Jesus would say to us at the vine,
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:55.900]   we were fortunate to be in their presence.
[00:36:55.900 --> 00:37:00.160]   These two lovely ladies have just resigned.
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:01.920]   They've come off of our staff now.
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.720]   We took this photo just a few weeks ago
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.320]   as we were celebrating them for their years of service.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:08.820]   They've both resigned and they're retiring
[00:37:08.820 --> 00:37:10.720]   and they're wanting to spend more time with their families
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:13.540]   and do a bit of traveling to visit their families overseas.
[00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:15.660]   We honor them, we bless them.
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:18.480]   I think when the Lord looks at these two women,
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.160]   he says like he did at the end of the parable
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.560]   of the talents, well done, my good and faithful servants.
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.880]   You are faithful in the small things.
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.040]   Now come and share in your master's happiness.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:30.360]   And how about for you?
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:34.620]   How is it that you are being called to be faithful?
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:37.880]   What is it that God has put into your hands?
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.320]   What are some of the small things that he has blessed
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.680]   and given to you and challenged you with?
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:46.160]   We often say here at the vine
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:50.000]   that large doors swing on small hinges.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.360]   And this church is filled with these incredibly small hinges
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.140]   like me and you.
[00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.920]   People who have been tasked by God to do one thing,
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:03.580]   something, and maybe it's a small thing in our eyes,
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:05.280]   but you need to understand this,
[00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:09.440]   that the small things for us are not small for God.
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:11.880]   In his eyes, it's actually those things
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:15.840]   that become the moment by which our souls are shaped
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:19.560]   and we're able to see the value of the kingdom of God
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:21.040]   and the treasures that are within it.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.620]   That's the beauty of the small things,
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.780]   our faithful commitment to that.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:28.220]   And perhaps as we start this season,
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.000]   we need to resist a little bit of that desire we have
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.640]   for the bigger and the greater and the better
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.800]   and actually realize that the one small thing
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.640]   that everybody else might think is nothing much at all.
[00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.480]   As we remain faithful to that,
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:44.480]   God can lead us where he wants to lead us.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.560]   It was of course Mother Teresa
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.120]   who said that famous thing, didn't she?
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:49.560]   "Not all of us get to do great things,
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:52.500]   "but all of us can do small things with great love."
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.680]   And I think that in many ways is the heart
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.280]   of what this passage around Jason is all about.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.600]   A man who did small things but with great love.
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:06.080]   Love for his city, love for Paul and Silas,
[00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.240]   love for the gospel.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.400]   And as we think about us beginning this journey
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.600]   that's ahead of us,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:14.480]   what are some of these small things that we can do?
[00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:18.360]   In that evening when I was having dinner with the priest,
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.680]   I asked him at one point, I said,
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.800]   "Have you ever felt like giving up?"
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.040]   Which seemed like a reasonable question
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.680]   to ask a man who was pastoring a church
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.920]   without any people in it.
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.920]   And I asked him the question,
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.840]   he stood there or sat there
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:32.040]   and just kind of thought about it for a bit
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:33.160]   and he said these beautiful words.
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.840]   He said, "Let me be honest with you."
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:37.960]   He said, "There have been many times
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:40.560]   "when I've asked the Father why.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.780]   "Why does it appear that there's not a lot of fruit
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:43.780]   "in my ministry?
[00:39:43.780 --> 00:39:47.020]   "But I've come to tell over the years
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:51.040]   "that God very rarely answers the whys of life."
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:54.340]   He said, "In fact, the why is his concern, but not mine."
[00:39:54.340 --> 00:39:56.980]   He said, "My concern is the thing he's asked me to do
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.120]   "and that I will not give up on."
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:02.600]   There's a moment in the Old Testament
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:05.200]   where God calls Nehemiah to rebuild the walls
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:06.240]   around Jerusalem.
[00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.600]   It's this beautiful thing that God asks Nehemiah to do.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:11.080]   And as a leader of Israel at the time,
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.120]   it was an incredibly hard project.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.360]   And you can look through his story
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:16.700]   to see how many times he wanted to let it go,
[00:40:16.700 --> 00:40:19.280]   how many times he faced opposition,
[00:40:19.280 --> 00:40:21.920]   how many times it cost him dearly
[00:40:21.920 --> 00:40:23.840]   to see through that project.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.960]   And there's this one point where Nehemiah is so worn down
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.100]   by the challenges and the opposition
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:31.560]   that he actually turns to God and he says this,
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:33.720]   "Lord, I cannot do this on my own."
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:36.640]   So he says, "Strengthen my hands."
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.840]   In other words, I wanna be found faithful,
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:41.040]   but I know that this is such a challenging time.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.320]   There's so much criticism, so much attack.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.000]   I feel so worn down.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:46.760]   I don't think I can do it on my own strength.
[00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:49.000]   So he turns to God and he says, "Strengthen my hands
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.760]   "'cause you put something in these hands.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:52.860]   "And you put something in these hands
[00:40:52.860 --> 00:40:54.400]   "that you're calling me to be faithful to
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:55.320]   "and I need your help.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:59.080]   "So would you strengthen my hands?"
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.260]   Every single person in this room,
[00:41:00.260 --> 00:41:02.200]   God has placed something in your hands.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:05.480]   Sometimes when you compare it with others,
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.720]   you think what you've got in your hand is nothing.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.760]   God doesn't look at that.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.920]   He doesn't compare things like that.
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:12.800]   He looks at you and says, "I've placed that in your hand.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:14.000]   "I've placed that in your hand.
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.220]   "I've placed that in your hand.
[00:41:15.220 --> 00:41:17.040]   "I've placed that in your hand."
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:19.200]   And here's the mere definition of success.
[00:41:19.200 --> 00:41:20.720]   Here's when God will look over you and say,
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.360]   "Well done, my good and faithful servant."
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.600]   He'll just say, "Have you been faithful?
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:26.080]   "Have you just been faithful
[00:41:26.080 --> 00:41:27.760]   "with that little thing I put in your hand?"
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:30.260]   And if you're feeling like you're about to give up,
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:34.460]   simple prayer, "Strengthen my hands."
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.980]   Can I pray for you for that?
[00:41:35.980 --> 00:41:37.260]   I wonder whether you would stand with me
[00:41:37.260 --> 00:41:40.680]   and let's just come before the Lord together as a community.
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:50.460]   Maybe as you just quieten your heart before him.
[00:41:55.080 --> 00:41:59.240]   Perhaps you are like me many times in my ministry,
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:00.280]   in my life,
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:05.440]   where you felt like turning around, giving up.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.360]   For some of you, maybe it's a relationship.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.320]   Maybe there's been a really challenging relationship
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:15.240]   in your life and maybe for some of you, it's your marriage.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:16.840]   Maybe it's a relationship with a boss
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.640]   or maybe it's a family member
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:20.760]   and you're so tempted to give up on it.
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:23.980]   Some of you have been praying for your children
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:27.900]   to come to faith and you're so, so close to giving up.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:32.200]   Some of you have been trying really hard in something
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:34.960]   and you felt like you'd been faithful and you have been.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.800]   And it feels like that there's no fruit,
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:39.640]   just like that priest on the Camino.
[00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.240]   He must have many times said, "Why do I even bother?"
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.120]   It's easy for us, I think at times,
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:47.800]   because faithfulness is a counter-cultural call.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:50.740]   We're living in a day and age now
[00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:52.640]   where faithfulness is not cool.
[00:42:53.960 --> 00:42:55.100]   Actually, the cool thing is,
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.660]   is to change your job every three seconds.
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:00.220]   The cool thing is not to actually put roots down.
[00:43:00.220 --> 00:43:01.700]   The cool thing is to be fancy free,
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:04.340]   just to travel and do whatever you want.
[00:43:04.340 --> 00:43:06.100]   The cool thing is to give up.
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:08.340]   The cool thing is to just let go.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:11.160]   The cool thing is to not be tied down.
[00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:15.740]   But the Bible says is that the kingdom of God
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:19.000]   is against the pressures and the spirits of this age.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.200]   Perhaps for some of us in this room,
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:23.700]   there's a fear of commitment.
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:28.580]   There's a fear of staying the course.
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:33.140]   And I wanna speak over you
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.660]   that the Lord is calling for His church
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:39.580]   and He's saying, "Will I find it faithful?"
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:45.340]   And so I wanna pray over you here this afternoon.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:46.940]   If this is resonating for you,
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.820]   if you realize that there are some challenges
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:50.700]   in this space for you,
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:53.060]   if you feel like you're exhausted and worn out,
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:53.900]   you wanna give up,
[00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:55.860]   if you feel like running in the other direction,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:57.720]   totally understandably I know,
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:43:59.920]   'cause I feel like that many times too.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:02.100]   I wonder whether you just open your hands before you,
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:03.640]   just in the quietness of this moment
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.460]   and whilst all our eyes are closed.
[00:44:05.460 --> 00:44:06.940]   And by opening your hands in front of you,
[00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.500]   you're just opening your hands
[00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:12.100]   and you're gonna say that prayer that Nehemiah prayed.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:13.980]   Lord, would you strengthen these hands?
[00:44:13.980 --> 00:44:15.300]   I feel like giving up.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.700]   I feel like turning away.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.580]   I feel like not sticking the course.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:20.660]   It's been difficult.
[00:44:20.660 --> 00:44:21.540]   It's been hard.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:24.740]   The Lord knows the pain that you've been through.
[00:44:24.740 --> 00:44:27.380]   The Lord sees that pain and He loves you
[00:44:27.380 --> 00:44:28.460]   and He knows it's not easy.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:31.900]   There's Jason before the people, paying the bond price.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.940]   Christ on the cross, the ultimate price paid
[00:44:34.940 --> 00:44:38.940]   for the glory of our forgiveness and freedom.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:41.660]   And I believe in this time,
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.820]   He's looking for a church that's faithful,
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:46.020]   not a church that's successful,
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:48.460]   not at least in terms of how the world defines it.
[00:44:49.980 --> 00:44:51.420]   So Lord, I wanna pray for the men and women
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.900]   in this room right now whose hands are open before you.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:56.620]   I wanna pray by the power of the Spirit
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:44:59.360]   and the hope that there is and the procession of life
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:01.940]   that comes against every procession of death.
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:05.520]   And Lord, anyone in this room who's worn out, tired,
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:07.940]   who's struggled to stay the course,
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:11.340]   Lord, we wanna pray right now, strengthen their hands.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:15.060]   In the name of Jesus, we pray, strengthen their hands.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.540]   Lord, whether that's for work,
[00:45:16.540 --> 00:45:17.980]   whether that's for marriages,
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.700]   whether it's for relationships,
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.820]   whether it's for their relationship with you,
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.860]   whatever part of their life that resonates with,
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:26.720]   but Lord, I wanna pray that you would strengthen them
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:29.220]   for the course that you have set them, Lord.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.260]   I wanna pray that whether they see breakthrough or not,
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.500]   they would say, the Lord has asked of me this one thing,
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:37.540]   and I will be found faithful,
[00:45:37.540 --> 00:45:41.020]   that I have a heart and a desire and a hunger,
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.420]   no matter what it might cost,
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.540]   no matter how challenging it might be,
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:47.380]   I wanna be successful in the eyes of the kingdom,
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:50.360]   even if that means failure in the eyes of the world,
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:52.120]   strengthen our hands, Lord.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:57.420]   Strengthen your hands of your church, Lord.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.180]   And I wanna pray that joy would be released,
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:03.220]   that Lord, it might not be easy,
[00:46:03.220 --> 00:46:04.700]   the path that might be ahead,
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:08.700]   uncharted waters don't guarantee us an easy time,
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:11.460]   but I wanna pray for joy in the journey, Lord.
[00:46:11.460 --> 00:46:15.540]   Just like that priest who was so,
[00:46:15.540 --> 00:46:18.780]   his eyes lit up when he saw an empty church,
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:21.220]   I pray these people's eyes would light up
[00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:26.860]   as they stay faithful to what you've placed in their hands.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:29.420]   And we pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.900]   Amen.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:33.480]   (gentle music)
[00:46:33.480 --> 00:46:36.060]   (gentle music)
[00:46:36.060 --> 00:46:46.060]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
