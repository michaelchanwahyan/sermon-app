1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Alright, couldn't put that in the rundown because she would hide.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Great.

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:11,960
 Well, everyone, I am going to tell you some things about me today that I'm going to need

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,000
 you not to judge me on.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,120
 I've got lots to share with you about relationships and friendships.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,760
 So I'm going to start off by telling you about me back in 2013.

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:29,080
 Back in 2013, I was young, I was fit, I was stronger, I looked good, my jawline was more

8
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:30,080
 chiseled.

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,080
 You talked about this before.

10
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:32,080
 I looked really nice back then.

11
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,840
 I was full of faith, but I was also dead broke.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,520
 And I came to Hong Kong in 2013 dead broke with not really any money, but I came to Hong

13
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,280
 Kong with a confidence knowing that God had called me to come to Hong Kong.

14
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,280
 I couldn't tell you why.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,480
 I don't know why I really believed this, but I had prayed and I was sure God wanted me

16
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,480
 in Hong Kong.

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,600
 So I came to Hong Kong, but let me tell you, my time in Hong Kong was not without its set

18
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,600
 of challenges.

19
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,280
 The first major challenge being I'd never been to Hong Kong before.

20
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,400
 So I moved here after never having ever stepped foot here.

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,400
 Zoom out a little bit.

22
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,400
 I moved here.

23
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,880
 I'd never been to Asia before.

24
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,840
 So when you're 23, you're bold and young.

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:21,040
 I came out here anyways, and I have to be honest, again, please don't judge me, but

26
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,480
 my understanding of what I thought Hong Kong would be like, I couldn't tell you where it

27
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,440
 was on a map, but I expected sesame chicken.

28
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,160
 I expected teriyaki chicken.

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,920
 I expected fortune cookies.

30
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,040
 I had this very Panda Express on every corner mentality, and I was severely disappointed,

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:40,000
 but Chasu balls are great, so it's all right.

32
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
 It's made up for it.

33
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,840
 But yeah, I had this perspective, and I will say the one thing I take pride in is I'm not

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,000
 like all the other Americans.

35
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,720
 I did know this one thing, that Hong Kong is not in Japan.

36
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,720
 I knew that.

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
 I knew that.

38
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,640
 I was home this Christmas.

39
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,600
 All the people that were like, "So how's Japan?

40
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,600
 How's Japanese?"

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
 I'm like, "Oh my goodness."

42
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
 So I knew that much, which is good.

43
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
 It's a low bar, but I'm proud of it.

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:09,040
 No, all I really knew about Hong Kong, this is honest, was the movie Rush Hour.

45
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,040
 Lee and Carter.

46
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
 That is all I knew.

47
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:14,520
 I knew nothing about this place, but I knew God wanted me here, so I came.

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,520
 I moved over to Hong Kong, and let me just say there were quite a few challenges, guys.

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:24,280
 I moved here with 10,000 Hong Kong dollars in my account.

50
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:27,280
 Now this was only a few years ago, what, 2013?

51
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,120
 10, 12, 11 years ago?

52
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,920
 I can't count.

53
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,600
 $10,000 did not get you very far in 2013.

54
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,160
 I didn't realize this because being a young university student, I thought 10K was just

55
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,320
 enough to get me where I needed to go.

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,680
 I get here, and 10K is not enough to get you a flat.

57
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,880
 So let's just say I had some major challenges trying to figure out how do you stretch $10,000

58
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,240
 to lead you into the things of God.

59
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,800
 I couldn't afford anything.

60
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,880
 I couldn't afford groceries.

61
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,280
 I couldn't afford living.

62
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,280
 I couldn't...

63
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,360
 Like month to month was a proper challenge, and so I found myself in this position where

64
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,320
 on one hand, I knew, I had prayed, I had felt that God had called me to move here for some

65
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,200
 very particular reasons.

66
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,360
 I stood on that conviction.

67
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,520
 I knew I needed to be here.

68
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:18,040
 On the other hand, that $10,000, that wasn't going to get me very far.

69
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,760
 And I found myself in that position of wrestling when you don't really know what do you do

70
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:29,120
 when God calls you into something, but the challenges are overwhelming.

71
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,840
 You find yourself convicted that you know where you're supposed to go.

72
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:37,800
 God has called you to move forward, but what do you do when the resources aren't there?

73
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
 If you...

74
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,800
 Anything like me, you've been in that place where you felt that tension before, where

75
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:47,520
 your conviction and your resources don't line up, where your conviction and the things that

76
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,740
 you need just aren't really harmonious.

77
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,960
 This was me back in 2013.

78
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,520
 I knew God wanted me here.

79
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,860
 I was convinced of it.

80
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,620
 No one could tell me any different, but I also didn't know how I was supposed to follow

81
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:12,600
 God into a city I'd never been into before, into the unknown, really confused, really

82
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:17,240
 flustered, overwhelmed.

83
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:22,000
 I look back at that time and I recognize I had the right start.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,040
 I made the right choices.

85
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,760
 I wore the right clothes, but if we have three of these things and we're missing one very

86
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:35,800
 critical important aspect, I think we can oftentimes start in the direction that God

87
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:43,960
 wants us to go, but we will find it ridiculously challenging to remain there.

88
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:51,160
 Perhaps God is calling us to consider if we have the right people with us.

89
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,080
 See, we've been in the story of David so far in 1 Samuel, and we've seen that David's calling

90
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,520
 is incredible, right?

91
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,200
 He's been anointed to be the next king of Israel.

92
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:04,120
 He'd be the second king, and it wasn't because of his looks.

93
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:09,000
 He wasn't particularly tall or strong or anything on the outside that would give you this understanding

94
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,440
 that he should be king, but he'd been anointed because of his heart's posture towards God,

95
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,440
 right?

96
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
 So things are going pretty good for him.

97
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,000
 He goes into Saul's court, and not expecting to, he's now given the job of playing the

98
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,800
 harp and the lyre to help calm down King Saul, right?

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,600
 And when he would play his harp and his lyre, there would be a soothing that would happen

100
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
 to Saul.

101
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,240
 And even though he was possessed and haunted by these evil spirits, it would soothe him.

102
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,360
 So David finds himself soothing the king.

103
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,680
 And while he's doing his regular responsibilities, a season arises where a man by the name of

104
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:48,960
 Goliath is threatening the people of God, and nobody from the army, nobody feels that

105
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,000
 they have the courage to stand up.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,720
 I mean, these are God's people, but no one has the strength and the ability to say, "I'll

107
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
 take him on."

108
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,520
 And what does David do?

109
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,520
 David steps up.

110
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,200
 He decides he will go and fight Goliath, and he's given this great honor where Saul's like,

111
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,000
 "Here, well, if you're going to fight Goliath, if you're going to stand in front of the people,

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,360
 here, wear my stuff."

113
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,800
 And David rejects that, takes it off, and he stays dressed in the expectations of God.

114
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:19,520
 If you were here last week, that would make sense to you.

115
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,680
 We get the fact that Saul ends up loving David for what he's doing at that time.

116
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,680
 David's life isn't too bad.

117
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,560
 You're anointed to be king, and things are going well.

118
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,840
 He fights Goliath, and he wins against all odds.

119
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:36,320
 So, so far, he's starting off pretty well.

120
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,600
 But as he's about to find out, this is not enough.

121
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,000
 He's been authentically himself.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,960
 He's been doing things the right way, making the right choices, but this wouldn't be enough

123
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,960
 to sustain him in what was to come next.

124
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:53,840
 He would realize that he would need the right people being their authentic self around him

125
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,600
 in order to continue going down the path that God had for him.

126
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:03,640
 And it's as we think about this, we reach a new character in the story, Jonathan, Saul's

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,640
 son.

128
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:08,840
 So I'm going to take us here to 1 Samuel 18, verses 1 through 4.

129
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:09,840
 It's on the screen.

130
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
 You can read with me.

131
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,560
 After David finished talking with Saul, Jonathan became one in spirit with David, and he loved

132
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,560
 him as himself.

133
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:21,000
 And that day, Saul kept David with him and did not let him return home to his family.

134
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,680
 Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself.

135
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:30,040
 Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along with his tunic

136
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,000
 and even his sword, his bow, and his belt.

137
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
 So what's happening here?

138
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,920
 Why are we given this story?

139
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:42,500
 David has just come off of this mountaintop experience of defeating Goliath and destroying

140
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,520
 the Philistine army, cutting off the head of this giant and baking Israel in a place

141
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:50,080
 where it's victorious and no longer in danger again.

142
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:57,320
 And we get this random story of David and this relationship that Jonathan has.

143
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:02,200
 David has impressed the king, starts off saying, "Saul is like, 'Who is this kid?'"

144
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:07,240
 Like how does he go from being a shepherd boy to now fighting a giant and winning for

145
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,360
 the whole nation?

146
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,720
 Who is his father?

147
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,720
 What family?

148
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,780
 He is impressed.

149
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,360
 Everything about David, everything about David has now caught his eye.

150
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,440
 It's also caught the eye of his son, Jonathan, who is like, "Wow, what is this guy?"

151
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,860
 And he ends up committing himself to David.

152
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,640
 He ends up befriending David.

153
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,560
 It says that David is now going to be stuck with Saul for a while.

154
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,120
 He's not allowed to go back home.

155
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,800
 So I reckon David was probably glad someone probably around his age to be his friend in

156
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:36,800
 that space.

157
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,800
 I'm pretty sure that was a bit of a relief for him.

158
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,080
 But here David has two options.

159
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,600
 In front of him lies two people.

160
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,900
 There's Saul, there's Jonathan.

161
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:53,320
 And it's not so easy to recognize who is who when it comes to who are the right people

162
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,160
 to have with you as you move into the things of God.

163
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:02,220
 And so what we're going to do is we're going to evaluate both Saul and Jonathan and see

164
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:08,120
 how some words are similar, some actions are similar, but actually only one of these guys

165
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,640
 is the right type of people for David to be able to move into the things of God.

166
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,640
 Are you guys with me?

167
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,040
 All right, let's look at this.

168
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:21,360
 The first thing we know about Saul is it tells us that the Spirit of God had left Saul.

169
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:26,160
 Now you don't have to be a biblical scholar to recognize that, you know, in your setting,

170
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,920
 if the Spirit of God has left somebody, pro tip, they're probably not the right person.

171
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,960
 If the Spirit of God, it said that because of his disobedience to God, the Spirit of

172
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,760
 God had left him in what, an unclean spirit, an evil spirit, a demonic spirit had entered

173
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:42,760
 him.

174
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:47,600
 This should be our first indicator without us having to be scholars to recognize something's

175
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,240
 off about Saul.

176
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,680
 But I think for David, it probably wasn't that easy to recognize.

177
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,760
 So for us, we're reading it back and we're getting the narration.

178
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,000
 For David, it actually tells us that Saul loved David.

179
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,480
 So David's in this position to discern this man loves him.

180
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,640
 I mean, think about what he did last week, right?

181
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,920
 So he offers him his kingly gear, his armor to be the best, to have the best stuff, to

182
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:13,880
 look the best part in order to fight Goliath.

183
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:18,920
 From the naked eye, it looks like Saul is for David, right?

184
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:24,600
 Those seem like good things, but think about how in order for Saul to even do this, give

185
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,600
 David his stuff, he first has to be abdicating his responsibility as king because it's the

186
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,560
 king's job to defend his people.

187
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,560
 He's hiding.

188
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:40,560
 He's not actually living as God has called him to live, fulfilling the responsibilities.

189
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:46,720
 And so even though he's offering this good stuff done from the wrong place, it's rejected

190
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,640
 by God, right?

191
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,040
 So David is able to put those things down and not take it with him.

192
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:02,280
 Although Saul gives him this great honor, his motives are unpure, and so God does not

193
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,280
 find it acceptable.

194
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,000
 Let's look at Jonathan.

195
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,240
 We want to get four verses to really get an idea of who Jonathan is.

196
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:15,640
 We don't get much of a backstory before that, but what we see about Jonathan is we learn

197
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,240
 about his love for David.

198
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
 That's the first thing we get.

199
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,960
 Two times across these three verses, we hear that Jonathan loved David.

200
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,960
 See, the right people are committed in love, right?

201
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
 So think about this.

202
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:33,000
 It says it two times, and I think for us, as we read Scripture, in our basic discipleship,

203
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:38,280
 one thing we should keep in mind, when we are reading the Scripture, and a phrase or

204
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:45,120
 word reappears multiple times, the biblical author is intending for us to catch on to

205
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
 something.

206
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,120
 He's emphasizing something.

207
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,840
 And so we have to ask ourselves, what is he actually saying?

208
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,840
 Slow down and read the text here.

209
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:57,760
 He's showing us the posture, the true posture of Jonathan's heart towards David.

210
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,920
 Because again, Saul loved David.

211
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:04,560
 It says it once, and we see that things were not right, but we get a repeat here that Jonathan

212
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:07,520
 loved David twice.

213
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,200
 Now, I think it's something we have to ask ourselves.

214
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
 This is pretty interesting.

215
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,840
 When I thought about it, if you're the king's son, if you're Jonathan, and your dad brings

216
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:27,440
 home this other kid, or young adult, however old they were, brings him home, and him doing

217
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:34,560
 his job so well, it soothes your dad's soul, probably like, "Whoa, what's going on?"

218
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,880
 And then he stands up and he defeats the biggest threat to your nation, representing God even

219
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,520
 greater than the king does.

220
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,880
 You're probably like, "Whoa, what's going on?"

221
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,840
 Now he's going to be stuck in your house, in the king's court.

222
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:55,920
 I think for many people, the legitimate question would be, "Is this dude trying to take my

223
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,880
 place?"

224
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
 That's a fair thing.

225
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,480
 That's a logical sequence to take.

226
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,120
 If someone is showing up doing all the right things, kind of in your space, jealousy would

227
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,640
 be the natural response.

228
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,600
 I'm not sure of too many people that would say, "Yeah, let me align myself to this person.

229
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,000
 Let me love them like I love myself.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,640
 Let me value them first.

231
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,640
 Let me prioritize."

232
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:25,240
 That is not the natural response, but this is what we find in Jonathan towards David.

233
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,560
 Most of us would have a hard time loving a potential threat.

234
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,320
 I mean, just think about Instagram.

235
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,520
 Most of us, we go on social media and we see that people have all these things that we

236
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,000
 want, things that we desire, and it's not really love.

237
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,800
 I mean, we press the heart button, but it's not really love that we feel towards them,

238
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,800
 is it?

239
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:47,200
 A lot of times, when people are doing well, our natural tendency is jealousy.

240
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,240
 But I think we learned something here from Jonathan, that we're called to love.

241
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,360
 His love for David was as he loved himself.

242
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:01,280
 I think if we're not careful in our jealousy, in our natural predisposition, we end up envying

243
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,280
 others.

244
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,880
 We end up jealous of others.

245
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:10,760
 We end up coveting our neighbor instead of loving them like we love ourselves.

246
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,040
 But Jonathan loves David.

247
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,040
 That's what we get.

248
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,720
 The scripture tells us again and again, Jonathan loved David as much as himself.

249
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:20,720
 When I looked at this, I immediately thought about where else does this take place?

250
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,720
 And this is a good practice for all of us.

251
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,400
 When you read something like that that's repeated, again, yes, you're meant to focus on those

252
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:30,920
 phrases, but that phrase, "as much as he loved himself," where else does this also show up

253
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,560
 in scripture?

254
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,400
 I went straight to Matthew chapter 22.

255
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,120
 Matthew chapter 22 is a great passage because Jesus is standing there, and one of the top

256
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:43,640
 teachers of the law approaches Jesus with the desire to test and trap him.

257
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:50,960
 And he says, "Jesus, good teacher, of all the commandments that are out there, which

258
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,600
 is the greatest one?

259
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,360
 Which is the best?

260
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:59,960
 Of all the commandments of Moses, which is the best one for us to follow?"

261
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:05,400
 Jesus looks him in the eye and goes, "You shall love your God with all your heart, with

262
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,960
 all your mind, with all your soul, with all your strength."

263
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,480
 And I'm sure dude was like, "Okay, good job.

264
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
 No blasphemy there.

265
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,480
 Check."

266
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:15,960
 And then Jesus goes, "And," which I'm sure is through everybody else off because a question

267
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:19,520
 like that, "Which is the greatest?" is meant to come with only one answer.

268
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:24,160
 Jesus says, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, strength, and,"

269
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,800
 he adds an extra thing, and I'm sure they're all like, "What is he about to say?

270
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,080
 What else can there be?

271
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,520
 Loving God must be the only thing.

272
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,600
 It must be the top thing."

273
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:36,000
 Jesus says, "And love your neighbor," what's the phrase?

274
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,160
 "As you love yourself, as much as you love yourself."

275
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,900
 Jesus would say that all of the laws of God hinge on these two things.

276
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:55,680
 If you love God with all your heart, wholly, and you love your neighbor as yourself, love

277
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,080
 your brother as yourself, love those around you as you love yourself.

278
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,920
 First John would tell us that if you don't love others, the love of God is not in you.

279
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:08,120
 A bit of a harsh way of putting it.

280
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,120
 But this is Jonathan's love, right?

281
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:12,080
 That term, "As he loved himself."

282
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,120
 This is the way that Jonathan loved David.

283
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,120
 It's a costly love because it puts him in this position where he values David the same,

284
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,280
 if not more, than himself, which is a bit unnatural, right?

285
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,960
 Like who loves other people more than they love themselves?

286
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,800
 No, Jonathan's love for David was that greatest commandment kind of love.

287
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:38,920
 And all of our examples of love in Scripture is this others-centered love.

288
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:40,840
 It's caring for those around us.

289
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,240
 It's giving our lives on behalf of others around us.

290
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,360
 And it's great because Jesus says this thousands of years later, but David and Jonathan are

291
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:50,520
 living this out way beforehand.

292
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:55,440
 So we're meant to kind of see that bit of a hyperlink between the two concepts, others-centered

293
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,440
 love.

294
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,520
 And I think when we see this, we should be asking ourselves, of those in our community,

295
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,880
 if we are asking, "Who's the right people?

296
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,840
 I'm torn between this and this."

297
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,640
 Is there others-centered love visible?

298
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,680
 Because that's actually meant to be what marks us as disciples.

299
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:16,800
 It's meant to be a key characteristic of anyone who chooses to follow God, that yes, they

300
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,920
 would love God wholly, but also they would love their neighbor as theirselves.

301
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:27,720
 See, the right people are committed to this kind of love.

302
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,520
 The thing is that this kind of love is not a result of trying really hard.

303
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,520
 It's not a result of...

304
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,720
 Oh, it's Jethro and me.

305
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,000
 That's great.

306
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,580
 That's the right kind of love right there.

307
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,480
 This kind of love is not a result of trying hard.

308
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,400
 It's not a byproduct of just mustering up all your strength and energy.

309
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,680
 No, if we actually go back to what we see in Matthew 22, there is an order.

310
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:58,720
 Jesus says, "First, you love God with all that you have, and from that flows the ability

311
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:02,080
 to love your neighbor as yourself."

312
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,200
 He doesn't say, "Love your neighbor as yourself and then try to love God."

313
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,320
 He also doesn't say, "Just love God."

314
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,200
 He gives us this command that we must first love God.

315
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,040
 See, the people in your life cannot truly love you as much as they love themselves if

316
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,360
 they don't love God.

317
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,920
 It's impossible.

318
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,760
 So what we need in our lives when it comes to community aren't just people with the same

319
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,360
 hobbies as us, as much as that's good.

320
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,160
 What we need in our lives are not just people who work in the same field as us or who are

321
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,240
 same-mindedness or same ideology as us.

322
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:39,000
 No, we need people who choose to love God wholeheartedly because it's only from that

323
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:45,960
 place of wholehearted love to God can you have the ability to love others as you love

324
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,240
 yourself.

325
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,320
 This is the mark of a true disciple of Christ.

326
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,080
 This is what we're all aiming to be like, to love God with all that we have, all our

327
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,840
 heart, with all our soul, with all our mind, with all our strength.

328
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:02,600
 And if we're going to walk into this year that God has set for us, we need people who

329
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:08,200
 are going to walk with us who carry this characteristic of love for God before everything,

330
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:14,920
 which naturally flows into love for others.

331
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:23,000
 In the next couple of verses, we see more similarity between Jonathan and Saul.

332
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:27,080
 This time it's not just in their actions or in their words of love, it's in what they

333
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,080
 do.

334
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,080
 So I'm going to read for us 1 Samuel 18, verse 4.

335
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:36,280
 It says this, "And Jonathan took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, along

336
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:41,680
 with his tunic and even his sword, his bow, and his belt."

337
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,600
 If you were here last week, you've been tracking this through this series.

338
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,040
 Last week was all about the clothes, right?

339
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,840
 Pastor Andrew wore the oversized jacket that was terrible on him, the one that kind of

340
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:50,840
 fit.

341
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,840
 It was all about what you wear.

342
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,360
 And the whole idea is Pastor Andrew was showing us how Saul had offered David his stuff.

343
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,440
 He had done almost the exact same thing.

344
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,120
 He had taken his clothes and put it on David.

345
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,680
 And Jonathan is doing the same thing.

346
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:10,120
 The biblical author was trying to get us to think, to see the connection, right?

347
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:15,360
 You've got Saul who did this, you've got Jonathan who did the exact same thing, yet what's implied

348
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,320
 are two different results.

349
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:22,420
 For Saul, he's dodging responsibility, right?

350
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,800
 Because Goliath is still ahead of them.

351
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:27,220
 He gives him his armor before he goes to fight Goliath.

352
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:29,340
 But think about when the Jonathan story occurs.

353
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:31,200
 This is after the battle.

354
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,200
 What is the purpose of giving someone all this stuff after the battle?

355
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,480
 He doesn't have another giant to go and fight yet.

356
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,240
 He's actually, everything is good.

357
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
 Everyone's pleased with him.

358
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,600
 We're all celebrating that the Philistines are no longer threatening our existence.

359
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,760
 Our nation will live.

360
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,760
 We are okay.

361
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,020
 We're not made their slaves.

362
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:48,020
 Everything is good.

363
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:51,440
 So why would Jonathan start giving him this stuff?

364
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
 What would be the purpose?

365
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,160
 It's very different from what Saul was doing.

366
00:20:55,160 --> 00:21:01,020
 I'm going to actually read this to you because as I look through this, I found very deep

367
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:05,100
 perspective that is not my own idea, but it's something for us to consider and it really

368
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,160
 helps us understand what's happening.

369
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,060
 So just play as close attention as you can.

370
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:16,540
 Scholars would say that the word used here for robe often denotes a royal robe.

371
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:22,060
 Ancient Near East texts would speak of this special robe as the robe worn by the crown

372
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,520
 prince.

373
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:28,820
 So if Israel had the same planned customs as other nations, that would mean Jonathan

374
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:34,840
 would have been renouncing his claim to the throne by giving David that robe.

375
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:40,340
 This represents, or this along with the bow and daily garments given from Jonathan may

376
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:47,260
 very well represent his willingness to give up and transfer his particular position as

377
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:49,480
 heir apparent to the throne of Israel.

378
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:57,840
 He was thus expressing loyalty and possibly submission to David.

379
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:01,040
 Sit on that for a minute.

380
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:04,560
 Jonathan, simplify this concept.

381
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:11,080
 Jonathan is offering David a sacrificial friendship, one that's not characterized by competition,

382
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:16,160
 one that's not characterized by just seeing what's on the outside or by insecurity.

383
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,040
 It's characterized by sacrifice.

384
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:22,800
 One where the other person lays down the essence of their life.

385
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:26,960
 We know that scripture says greater love has no one than the one who lays down their life

386
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,960
 for a friend.

387
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:33,040
 Yes, that's talking about physical life and death, but I would ask how much greater is

388
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:39,800
 it when your life leads to the throne, to the highest position in the land, to give

389
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,760
 up your actual destiny?

390
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:48,480
 To give up the thing that's probably the most desirable thing in your nation.

391
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,200
 To give up the top spot.

392
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:54,520
 I mean, he was gonna be king, the second king of the nation.

393
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,720
 This is where you wanna be.

394
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,480
 This is the position you wanna be able to inherit, and he is willingly, sacrificially

395
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:10,400
 laying that down in order to display sacrificial friendship.

396
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,480
 See, because Jonathan loved David the right way, his actions are gonna support David.

397
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:27,280
 Those who are committed to Christ-like love are committed in Christ-like actions.

398
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:35,520
 Had his love been for himself, Jonathan could have done lots of other things and not laid

399
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,640
 down his crown.

400
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:44,520
 Had his love been for himself, Jonathan would have tried to self-preserve.

401
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:52,040
 But from his action, we can clearly see that he truly is living in a sacrificial relationship

402
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:56,480
 where his love looks a lot like the love of Christ that we see.

403
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,880
 I mean, I find it wild because this isn't normally how the world works.

404
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:06,640
 Imagine with me, just for a minute, pretend that we lived in a world where this is how

405
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,000
 people treated one another.

406
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,400
 Imagine if your friends were friends with you not just because you benefited them, or

407
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,160
 only friends with you until you had disagreement.

408
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:23,000
 Imagine if people came into your life to support you fully in godliness.

409
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:27,760
 Imagine if the community around you had no self-interest in mind, if they were willing

410
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:36,000
 to give up everything, not so that David could have like, be cool and be king, but so that

411
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:42,200
 David could walk into following God, into what God had for him.

412
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:47,640
 Imagine a world or a community, and I guess to an extent, I'm not chewing us out, but

413
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:51,960
 I guess to an extent it's sad because that's actually meant to be the community that we

414
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,960
 live in.

415
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,040
 This is meant to mark the church.

416
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,840
 This is meant to be how we live with one another.

417
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:03,760
 Relationships like this, where it's not about me, where it's not about my self-interest,

418
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:11,080
 but I care enough about the person next to me to do whatever I can to help them walk

419
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:17,120
 into the things of God, into godliness.

420
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,760
 Not harboring jealousy because maybe they got the promotion and I didn't.

421
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,760
 Not being mad because they can afford a good holiday and I can't, or they have the perfect

422
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:33,000
 relationship or the perfect house or the perfect car or the, they have, whatever it is.

423
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:40,720
 Not just living by sight, but truly discerning, living by the spirit, and actually cooperating,

424
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,720
 working alongside the things that God is doing in the lives of others.

425
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,440
 That is actually the purpose for community.

426
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,520
 That is why we exist.

427
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,480
 Man, these kinds of people will definitely make you feel good about yourself, but beyond

428
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:01,280
 that, they will help you walk into the things of God.

429
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,640
 They encourage and they will support.

430
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:08,880
 They are present, they are active, and they are intentionally engaged in helping you reach

431
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,360
 the things of God.

432
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,440
 And what Jonathan does here is not just symbolic.

433
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,840
 Yes, he takes off these garments and passes it to David, but it's actually followed up

434
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,920
 with some action.

435
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:23,480
 If you look at the next three chapters from 19, 20, and 21 of 1 Samuel, you will see in

436
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:31,200
 the narrative that David goes from everything's not that bad to running for his life, to fleeing,

437
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,200
 to hiding.

438
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:36,680
 There's a certain point where he's in a cave while still waiting for the promises of God.

439
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
 He is running.

440
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:38,680
 He is desperate.

441
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,440
 He is almost an outlaw in the kingdom that he's been promised.

442
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:46,920
 And you recognize that it's at that point that God had done something incredible.

443
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:53,240
 The very thing David needed to be able to sustain in the promises of God was not just

444
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,600
 found in his good heart.

445
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,080
 It would be found in this relationship.

446
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:02,760
 See, what Jonathan would do is remarkable.

447
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:08,480
 He would lie to his father, to the king who had the right to kill him, but also to his

448
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,280
 father, his father, right?

449
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,280
 He would lie to him.

450
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:12,280
 He would deceive him.

451
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:16,280
 He would go against the king of the nation in order to help David.

452
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:18,320
 There's one point I thought was very interesting.

453
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,040
 It said that when this evil spirit would possess Saul, there was one point where Jonathan made

454
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:30,000
 him so mad in trying to save and protect David that Saul lunged a sphere at him to try and

455
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,000
 kill him.

456
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,340
 It said with the intent to kill him.

457
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:35,960
 So it wasn't just a symbolic, "Okay, yes, you can become king and I'm going to support

458
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:36,960
 you."

459
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,520
 Dude backed it up with the way he lived.

460
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:46,840
 He put himself, he put his life on the line to help this man walk into the things of God.

461
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,400
 Y'all, that is unreal friendship.

462
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,320
 That is sacrificial friendship, sabotaging your dad's plans.

463
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,260
 Now, I obviously, I come from the US and the culture I come from has a very individualistic

464
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,260
 society.

465
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:08,460
 And so whenever I read through this, you know, growing up or over the years, it never really

466
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,300
 stuck out to me, but I had a greater appreciation reading this after being in Hong Kong for

467
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:19,460
 the past 11 years because in this culture, we value family a lot.

468
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:22,500
 We operate as a unit, right?

469
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:29,420
 And the idea of going against your family is not something you just gloss over and get

470
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,100
 to the fun part of the Scripture.

471
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:33,340
 That makes you halt in your steps, right?

472
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:38,620
 The idea of sabotaging your family in order to help the things of God in another place,

473
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,540
 that's wild, especially here.

474
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:48,780
 Push even further, the idea of going against your father, that definitely brings some sort

475
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,780
 of tension.

476
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:54,380
 So much so, because again, I've not grown up in Hong Kong.

477
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:57,660
 So I talked to someone who did, the girl who did these slides, her name is Veronica, and

478
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:02,980
 I was asking her about what does it make you feel when you zoom in on the idea that Jonathan

479
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:12,940
 had to resist, shrug off, lie to, lose, push back, disagree with his father?

480
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:17,620
 How does that make you feel in your context, even your story, even your life?

481
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:19,100
 And she was like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's tension.

482
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
 It's all those things.

483
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,820
 It feels awkward, and it's like, 'Oh, I could never do that.'"

484
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:27,380
 But what was even greater was the next day, came back to work, and she was like, "Dude,

485
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:31,420
 thinking about that, I had dreams about it last night.

486
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,480
 It caused me that much distress just thinking about what that would mean, that it seeped

487
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,100
 into my dreams last night."

488
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,660
 This is the level of sacrificial friendship.

489
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:48,780
 Like, I give you that example to show you just how sacrificial of a friendship Jonathan

490
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:52,160
 had with David.

491
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,780
 And even greater, David is this man of God.

492
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:57,820
 David is doing all the things right.

493
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,180
 And I feel like maybe it's something we need to specifically keep in mind.

494
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,580
 He's able to slay giants.

495
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:08,300
 He's able to be anointed as king.

496
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:13,700
 He's able to soothe Saul's soul.

497
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:21,260
 But in order for him to properly step into what God has for him, the destiny and the

498
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:29,340
 promises of God, even with God's help, he needs a friend.

499
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:32,720
 Think about that.

500
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:38,520
 Even with God by himself, David needed a godly community.

501
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,560
 He needed a true spiritual friendship.

502
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:49,320
 He needed sacrificial people who were in his life willing to help him follow and go where

503
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,320
 God was leading.

504
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:54,840
 I think for you and I, we're not that much different from David.

505
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,600
 We also have obstacles in where God is calling us to be, the things that God has for you

506
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,400
 this year, where he's hoping to develop and grow you.

507
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,000
 There will be things that prevent us from that.

508
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,640
 And having the right people are critical.

509
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,400
 And every time I preach on community here, I recognize it.

510
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:15,120
 It's a bit of like a preaching to the choir, because I think in theory we all recognize

511
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,480
 community is good.

512
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
 No one's like, "Boo, community.

513
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,480
 We hate it."

514
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,040
 No, especially not with Pastor Jennifer, our community group's pastor here.

515
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,520
 We definitely don't say that.

516
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,720
 But there is this basic temptation that we do have to resist.

517
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:36,200
 There is this passive pattern that we step into where, yes, we know this is important,

518
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:45,880
 yet we unfortunately believe and live out the lie that we can do it on our own or that

519
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,680
 we actually don't need others.

520
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:49,680
 It's a passive belief.

521
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,640
 I don't think most of us are trying to cut people out.

522
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:57,440
 It's not an active belief, but the consequences are still as dangerous.

523
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,280
 We are tempted to not recognize that we genuinely need.

524
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,200
 It's not really an option.

525
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,560
 We genuinely need the right people.

526
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:12,520
 We're tempted to think that if we just make the right choices, if we just start the right

527
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:17,400
 way, if we just wear the right clothes, we'll be okay.

528
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:22,800
 But our biggest help is ignored when we don't realize that we desperately also need the

529
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,800
 right people.

530
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,960
 But here's the thing.

531
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,960
 God knows.

532
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,840
 He knows that you need support to keep your faith strong.

533
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,120
 He knows that when things get hard, you need help to be emboldened to withstand whatever

534
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,040
 obstacles are in front of you.

535
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:42,440
 He knows that you need strengthening in the days and the weeks ahead to resist the insecurities

536
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:45,040
 and to resist spiraling into fear.

537
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,840
 My question is this.

538
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,360
 What if God is saying that the very thing you need is only going to be found as a byproduct

539
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,040
 of investing in relationships with the right people?

540
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:02,120
 What if that's the only option?

541
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,120
 What if that's his only way?

542
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,960
 It's not like a plan A, plan B. What if that's the only plan?

543
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,400
 What if this is God's way of actually providing the help that we need?

544
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,960
 I mean, that's certainly what he did with David.

545
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,000
 We can find ourselves thinking that we need to pray the right prayer, attend the right

546
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,600
 amount of services, join the right teams, read the right passages in Scripture, go to

547
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:30,040
 the right self-help person, do all the right things, wear the right clothes, have the right

548
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,080
 belief system, attend the right classes, and God is saying, "Stop praying the right prayer.

549
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,800
 I've given you the right people."

550
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,720
 Like this is our biggest help, and he's provided so many of us.

551
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,000
 I mean, just look to your left and your right.

552
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:48,600
 When I speak of the right people, you guys are it, right?

553
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,400
 Also you guys as well, not just this time.

554
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:59,800
 Yes, that's the reality.

555
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:02,280
 God has designed it this way.

556
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,440
 He's designed it intentionally to be this way.

557
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:11,080
 And perhaps the things of God are not actually meant to be attained in isolation because

558
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,800
 the things of God are not just for us.

559
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,760
 Maybe that's why he won't let you do it by yourself.

560
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,840
 Maybe that's why he wouldn't just let David get to where he needed to go by himself.

561
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:25,240
 See, David's kingship was not just for David.

562
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,400
 You could even argue it was never for David in the first place.

563
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,240
 It was God's way of leading his people, God's way of being present with his people.

564
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,880
 The king served a role, all right?

565
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:42,400
 So the thing that you're being led towards isn't just for you.

566
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,240
 When we try and do it on our own, we end up super susceptible to that faulty thinking.

567
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,560
 We tend to think that the end all be all is receiving whatever God has for me in this

568
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,720
 year of action.

569
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:56,480
 We end up worshiping a me-centric God.

570
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:01,680
 But what if the purpose God has for you is only accomplished with the right people because

571
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,440
 the purposes are for the benefit of all people?

572
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:14,840
 God's purpose, the whole Bible is this beautiful picture of God redeeming and reconciling all

573
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,240
 creation back to himself.

574
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,840
 That is the whole book, right there.

575
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,840
 That is what we're aiming for.

576
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,480
 That is what he's doing.

577
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,160
 So we need the right people to help us follow Christ correctly, knowing that whatever God

578
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,120
 has in store for you and for you this year, whatever new thing you start, whatever year

579
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:36,040
 of action, however it manifests itself, it's not just for you.

580
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,680
 Having the right people helps us recognize that it's actually all connected to God's

581
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,800
 heart and his plan to redeem and reconcile all things back to himself.

582
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,720
 Guys, apart from these kinds of relationships there, I don't know another way that you can

583
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:57,560
 actually stay where God's sending you.

584
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:00,520
 So if you want to start, well, do the first three things.

585
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,520
 Make good choices.

586
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,080
 You know, wear the right clothes.

587
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,080
 Have the right start.

588
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,040
 But I think most of us aren't interested in just starting the things of God, right?

589
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:16,080
 Most of us are interested in abiding and remaining and being steadfast in the things of God,

590
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:19,600
 continuing the good faith journey.

591
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:25,920
 And I really don't want us to miss out on the true gift, the true gift that friendship

592
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,920
 is.

593
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:33,520
 Like, David and Jonathan's story, I was, this morning we were praying before the 9/15 service.

594
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:36,160
 One of our staff, Gordon, was praying.

595
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:39,960
 He was like, "Jesus, thank you," all this stuff, you know, "for Pastor Promise and for

596
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,400
 just this unique, you know, story of friendship."

597
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,440
 And it hit me because it's actually not meant to be unique.

598
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,560
 It's actually meant to be pretty common.

599
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:55,600
 It's meant to be the way that we naturally operate, the way that we naturally live being

600
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,640
 there for one another.

601
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,800
 So I started off this whole sermon, this whole talk, telling you about all my faulty things

602
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,640
 and coming to Hong Kong with only 10K in my pocket and looking for Panda Express on every

603
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:08,120
 corner and being very sad.

604
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,440
 I want to tell you how it ended.

605
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,000
 So I get here, and again, I don't have praying hard enough didn't make rents become super,

606
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,200
 super, super affordable or free.

607
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,760
 But what ended up happening was ridiculous.

608
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,000
 This is true.

609
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,800
 We prayed for a free flat.

610
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,400
 So me, my best friend Rick, my other best friend, Irem.

611
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,840
 Rick used to serve here on the worship team.

612
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:35,280
 Irem used to be one of our designers at the Vine before they both moved to the States

613
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,280
 a few years back.

614
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,280
 And we prayed.

615
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,080
 We're like, "God, give us a free flat."

616
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,400
 Now those kind of prayers are a lot easier when you're 23 years old.

617
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,720
 I realized I must not have that kind of faith anymore.

618
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,000
 But we prayed for that.

619
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,360
 And here's what happened.

620
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,120
 God did not give us a free flat.

621
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,760
 There you go.

622
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:58,800
 No, what he did was a lady in the church offered to give us her flat for one US dollar a year.

623
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,000
 Y'all, I know, that was me.

624
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,720
 I was like, "Wait, this stuff happens?"

625
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,720
 I genuinely couldn't believe it.

626
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,280
 But here's the thing.

627
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,280
 Here's the kicker.

628
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:14,320
 She gave the flat to Rick and Irem, not to me because I didn't work at that church.

629
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,880
 So here I am.

630
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:18,960
 My needs haven't been met yet, but I know God wants me in Hong Kong, but how am I going

631
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,960
 to live?

632
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:24,240
 Like, how am I supposed to like...where do I go?

633
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,680
 And if I had not had these relationships with Rick and Irem, people who weren't just interested

634
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:35,640
 in me hanging out in Hong Kong, but who prayed and discerned with me, who were like iron

635
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:42,000
 sharpening me to do the things of God, I would have not had the blessings that came through

636
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,000
 being friends with them.

637
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:47,360
 So I was able to live with them, slept on the couch, but it worked.

638
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,480
 It was good.

639
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,480
 We were okay.

640
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,400
 These guys monthly would be a part of my support system.

641
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,840
 They were interns, so remember, not much money, right?

642
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,360
 And church interns, so like very low money.

643
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,880
 Just put it out there, put it out there.

644
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,120
 But they were giving every single month to help make sure that I could live each minute.

645
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,120
 There were countless, y'all.

646
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:09,120
 There were...

647
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:13,280
 Like I think about it, and there's countless of examples of different people, the right

648
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:17,320
 people, people who were spiritually helping me, but were also financially helping me,

649
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:20,680
 who had no obligation to me, who had no reason to support me.

650
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,920
 I think I've shared with you about how I got money to be able to propose to my wife because

651
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:28,320
 some dude just gave...like God just provided, but he didn't just provide the thing, he provided

652
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,320
 the people, right?

653
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:33,960
 I remember when we first got here, one of the...yes, those are the big blessings that

654
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:37,520
 happened, but some of the practical things like, you know, where's Jollibee?

655
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,520
 That was big.

656
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,280
 My mates showed me where Jollibee was.

657
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:45,840
 I learned that maybe I can't get sesame chicken, but char siu bao is the next best thing, right?

658
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
 Quality stuff.

659
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:51,800
 I didn't know how to get off of the bus, off of a minibus, and I was...y'all, I was terrified

660
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,160
 waiting for the bus driver, right?

661
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:56,920
 Like I'd sit there, my hands would get sweaty, I'd be practicing over and over, "Oh, I'm

662
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,240
 about to see someone go, I'm about to see someone..." and just be like, "Am I going

663
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,240
 to say it this time?"

664
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,840
 And he'd go past my stop, I'm like, "I'll just wait until someone else says it, and

665
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,080
 I'll walk back an extra two kilometers."

666
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:10,720
 But my friends were the ones that taught me and showed me and helped me actually be sustained

667
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,960
 in this city.

668
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,920
 Those are silly examples, but they're practical.

669
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,960
 They're everyday things, and the people that God has in your life, they're not just here

670
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:17,960
 for the big miracles.

671
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:23,920
 It's also here for the everyday small things, the simple things.

672
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,520
 And I share that because I want that for us.

673
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:34,400
 I don't want us starting in the way of God not being able to finish.

674
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:40,120
 I don't want us being alone when there's so many people who love Jesus right here.

675
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:46,920
 When the church is meant to be the help of God in the world, when we are meant to be

676
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,840
 His activity, His hands and His feet, His provision may very much be the people in your

677
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:56,440
 life, the right people in your life.

678
00:40:56,440 --> 00:41:00,080
 So we've talked about what the right and the wrong look like.

679
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,160
 So this isn't a sermon where we get reflective.

680
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:04,640
 I'm actually going to get you all to just go ahead and stand.

681
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,880
 As the worship team comes up on stage, everyone go ahead and stand up.

682
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:17,800
 All right, everybody, go ahead and stand up, stand up, stand up.

683
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:22,840
 And the way I want to end this whole series, we've learned lots of things.

684
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:29,240
 We've understood lots of ways, things that God has for us, how we begin well.

685
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:36,040
 And I want to pray for us that we would be able to find the right people.

686
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:41,920
 I want to pray commissioning us to actually following through and investing in the right

687
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
 relationships.

688
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:46,720
 I want to pray for the boldness to be able to do that, for the vulnerability that that

689
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,520
 requires because that's not always easy.

690
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:55,520
 A lot of us carry hurt from wrong people, wrong relationships that make it so hard to

691
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:58,240
 step into the right relationships.

692
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,040
 And God's not just going to wash over that.

693
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:03,640
 He's going to deal with that hurt.

694
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:08,320
 And so if you will, I'm going to ask you to close your eyes and just open your hands as

695
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:18,480
 a sign, as a posture of receiving this prayer, not from me, but through what only God can

696
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,480
 do.

697
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:23,840
 Jesus, we come before you this morning and first of all, we say thank you for your love.

698
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:28,040
 We thank you for the love that you give us that even equips us and allows us to love

699
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,400
 others.

700
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:34,000
 We thank you for this cloud of witnesses that we have with us in this room.

701
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:39,120
 We thank you for relationship and how you've designed things to be a certain way.

702
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,400
 Father, we recognize, we understand, and we see it.

703
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:48,840
 And we ask first God, for those of us who are looking for spiritual friendships, sacrificial

704
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:54,320
 friendship, friends who actually love, relationships that actually model a love for you, Holy Spirit,

705
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:58,200
 would you begin to show us where to look?

706
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,600
 God, would you give us the right metric?

707
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:05,400
 Would you help us not just look at the things that we see with our eyes, but help us to

708
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,320
 evaluate correctly?

709
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,760
 Help us to find people who are going to put you first, who are going to love you, and

710
00:43:14,760 --> 00:43:19,960
 whose relationship with us will push us into greater love and obedience to you.

711
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:23,560
 People who will help us be more disciples of Christ.

712
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:26,240
 God, we ask for those people.

713
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:34,760
 God, for those of us who carry scars and burdens and frustrations of past relationships with

714
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:39,240
 the wrong people, moments where we've been hurt, moments where we've not been heard,

715
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:47,080
 taken advantage of, forgotten, neglected, whatever the word is, God, you see what happens.

716
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:51,520
 You see the scars we carry and your heart breaks for us, but you also don't stop there

717
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,360
 because you're a God of healing.

718
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,840
 You're a God that restores.

719
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:00,800
 So Holy Spirit, would you restore our hearts, restore the parts that are broken and make

720
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,600
 whole again what is needed?

721
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:09,400
 Would you give us the boldness, supernaturally, to be able to step into the right relationships?

722
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,640
 Would you allow us to be able to invest into the right relationships?

723
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:20,440
 Holy Spirit, would you transform us, continue to transform us, not just to receive the right

724
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:27,800
 people, but God, may the vine be full of people who are the right people for others.

725
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:30,840
 Holy Spirit, do your work in us.

726
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:37,320
 As we step into this year of action, may we go with the right start, may we make the right

727
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:43,400
 choices, may we wear the right clothes, and Holy Spirit, would we go with the right people.

728
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,440
 In Jesus' name we pray.

729
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:47,440
 Amen.
