[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Yes, God, we give you thanks. We give you praise. We thank you that we have been singing
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.680]   out of a vision 20. That says now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.720]   ask or imagine according to the power that is at work within us to him be glory. So we
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.280]   give you glory, Lord. We give you glory. We thank you that we can trust in you that there
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:40.640]   is hope in you. But I feel God highlight that for some people who are struggling here, that
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:47.680]   there may be three things that is causing you anxiety and fear. Perhaps it's a situation
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.840]   at work, or perhaps you're out of work and you're looking for work and finances are a
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.480]   worry. For some, perhaps it's a relationship with a close one, a family member. And maybe
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.680]   for some it's a health issue. We can trust that scripture that God will do immeasurably
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.080]   more. But I feel like right now what God wants to do is he wants to come and meet you because
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:22.840]   I feel like there may be anxiety or fear that is used by the enemy as an attack to stop
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:31.080]   you from connecting with God. And so God, I pray for those who are struggling with anxiety,
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:37.120]   with fear, who are struggling to come into your presence right now in Jesus's name. I
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:46.480]   bind all this fear, all this anxiety in Jesus's name. We say this weapon has no power over
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:59.720]   you and we speak God's presence over you. Draw close to God now. We thank you that you
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:07.440]   are making a way now through those who perhaps found it hard to connect with you just now.
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:14.640]   We thank you that this connection is re-established. So just take a moment. We've got time. Take
[00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:23.480]   a moment to come into God's presence if you found that hard just now. Same with our friends
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:42.480]   online. Draw close to God now. I thank you that nothing can separate us from your love,
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:58.240]   to receive his love. So we thank you God that you are faithful and I thank you for everyone
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:06.640]   who is here, who is drawing close to you. We thank you that that will continue. We thank
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   you that this is for those, for some people it's a re-establishing, it's a new beginning.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:23.440]   So we praise you Lord. We praise you. We give you glory. In Jesus's name we pray. Amen.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:33.200]   Amen. Amen. Thank you everyone. Yes. Thank you worship team for leading us in that. Wow,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:41.080]   what a great time of worship. And now we are moving into a time of hearing our talk and
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.040]   we do have Pastor Andrew speaking to us today, not in person. I know he has tuned in online.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.800]   So how about we just say together, we need to say it very loudly, just say hello to Pastor
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.080]   Andrew. Can we do that? Say hello Pastor Andrew together. One, two, three to that screen over
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:05.800]   there. Hello. Great to have you with us online Andrew. We can't wait to have you next week.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.600]   And today Pastor Andrew has a great timely sermon for us. So I just like to pray for
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.240]   us again that we will continue to keep our hearts open as we listen to this talk. So
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:25.020]   let me pray. God, we thank you again for your faithfulness. We thank you for this message
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:30.640]   that you have put on Pastor Andrew's heart. So God, I pray for each of us here and those
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:36.720]   of us who are joining online. God, that you will keep our hearts open, that we'll be able
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.600]   to receive the message you have for us, that we'll receive everything that you have for
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.440]   us. We won't miss anything that you have for us. So bless this time Lord, in Jesus's name.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.400]   Amen. Let's watch Pastor Andrew on screen.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:04.500]   Hey church, I am so excited to be with you today. I'm currently in quarantine, but next
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.180]   Sunday I'm going to be back physically with you and we're going to be starting a brand
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.420]   new sermon series on the book of Philippians. Over the next seven weeks, we're going to
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:17.420]   be diving into that book, unpacking a little bit about what it means to live as a Christian
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.580]   in society and community. So that's from next Sunday. Really excited to be with you then.
[00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.900]   But today I'm actually carrying in my spirit a message for us as a church, something that
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.460]   I think is actually really critical for how many of us are feeling in this current season.
[00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.020]   It's actually a word I brought to our staff a few months ago, but I felt like it was for
[00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.140]   a broader community than just our team. And so I wanted to bring it to all of us together
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:48.980]   today. And really, if you're feeling at all, like in this current season, you're feeling
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.220]   a bit drained, you're feeling a little bit tired, maybe you felt like you've been pressing
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.780]   into something and it hasn't worked out or hasn't come through, or maybe just all the
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:03.460]   stuff of COVID is just draining you, you're feeling empty, then that's what's on my heart
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:09.980]   today. I want to speak into all of us in the areas of our tiredness and bring something
[00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:16.100]   that I believe will be a help to you in this time. I want to read from 2 Kings chapter
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:22.060]   four, and I'm going to focus on the first seven verses. So let me read this to us. "The
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:28.100]   wife of a man from the company of the prophets cried out to Elisha, 'Your servant, my husband,
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.740]   is dead, and you know that he revered the Lord. But now his creditor is coming to take
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.820]   my two boys as his slaves.' Elisha replied to her, 'How can I help you? Tell me, what
[00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.820]   do you have in your house?' 'Your servant has nothing there at all,' she said, 'except
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:53.160]   a little oil.' Elisha said, 'Well, go around and ask all of your neighbors for empty jars.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.740]   Don't ask them for just a few. Then go inside and shut the door behind you and your sons.
[00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:04.980]   Pour oil into all of the jars, and as each is filled, put it to one side.' She left him
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.520]   and afterwards shut the door behind her and her sons. They brought the jars to her and
[00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:15.180]   she kept pouring. When all the jars were full, she said to her son, 'Bring me another one.'
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:22.920]   But he replied, 'There are no more jars left.' Then the oil stopped flowing. She went and
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:28.700]   told the man of God, and he said, 'Go and sell the oil and pay your debts. You and your
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:35.080]   sons can live on what is left.'" Father, as we just lean into this Word together today
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:40.100]   as a congregation, I want to pray right now that your anointing would come and fall on
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.760]   us. Lord, we are hungry, not just for your Word, but for your presence. Lord, we're hungry
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.820]   for you to meet us in the places that we're feeling right now, in our emptiness, in our
[00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:57.960]   tiredness, in the stuff that is going on. Lord, we come to you in need of your filling.
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.820]   Would you open up this Word to us by your power and your Spirit? We pray this in Jesus'
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:12.260]   name. Everyone says, "Amen." On February 16th, 2007, I was told by a doctor
[00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.860]   that I am infertile. Now, this is a story that I've shared many times with us at The
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:20.740]   Vine, and so I'm not going to go into a huge amount of detail about it today. In fact,
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:25.280]   I actually want to share something of that story that I've not actually shared before.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:28.900]   My wife and I, we'd been trying for children for about two years, and then we had entered
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:34.220]   into about a year's worth of tests and procedures and all of that stuff that culminated on that
[00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:38.920]   day with the doctors telling me that I was infertile, that I'd never be able to biologically
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:43.460]   father a child. And you can imagine all the emotions that that brought for me. You can
[00:08:43.460 --> 00:08:48.460]   imagine how devastating that was. My wife and I had had all these plans for the biological
[00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:51.700]   children that we were going to have as you do when you get married. And so it was an
[00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.300]   incredibly difficult time. It was also a difficult time with my relationship with Jesus. I felt
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:09:01.260]   like God had given me a real passion to build a family and then had created me in such a
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:07.020]   way that I was never going to be able to biologically do that. And I couldn't reconcile that tension.
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:14.020]   So I was sitting in all of that in the midst of this communication to me that I was infertile.
[00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:19.820]   Well, a couple of weeks later, I felt this stirring by the Holy Spirit to actually lean
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.780]   in and to pray and to believe for a miracle. The only way that my wife and I were going
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.900]   to be able to have kids is if God intervened with a miracle. And that was really sitting
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.020]   on our heart. And it was something that we believed in and believed for. And so I did
[00:09:32.020 --> 00:09:37.300]   a little bit of a radical thing. I gathered up a whole group of my friends, both those
[00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:41.540]   we were in New Zealand at the time. So I reached out to friends here in Hong Kong, as well
[00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:45.660]   as those that were in Bible college with us in New Zealand. And I said, look, we're going
[00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:50.060]   to fast and we're going to pray for 30 days. And I encouraged everybody just individually
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:55.620]   on their own to take whether it was five minutes, 10 minutes, 30 minutes every day, fast a meal
[00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.580]   and pray for a miracle in my life. And it was something that I was committed to doing
[00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:05.460]   30 days, really excited about. I remember day one, I set aside the time I sat in this
[00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:08.700]   little chair in the room that Chris and I were renting at the time was a small little
[00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:13.860]   room. But I sat in that chair and I just opened up my heart to God and began to think about
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.620]   what it is that I could pray for. And God in that moment came and spoke directly to
[00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:24.380]   my spirit. And he said this, he says, what is it that you have to bring me today? What
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:31.900]   is it that you have to bring me today? I felt like God was encouraging me to bring him something.
[00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:36.780]   And so as I sat there, I thought about, well, well, I'm filled with faith for this miracle.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.780]   I'm filled with all the things that I have on my heart for what God wants to do next.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.340]   I'm excited about how God wants to build a family. I believe that you can actually bring
[00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.380]   a miracle in my life. And so the things that I brought to him in that first day of prayer
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:54.460]   was just all of my excitement, all of my passion, all that faith I had inside of me to believe
[00:10:54.460 --> 00:10:59.460]   that God could come through and do this crazy miracle and change me physically so I could
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.180]   have children. And I remember actually that first day I prayed for about an hour and it
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:10.140]   was so passionate, so full of life, so full of hope, so full of faith. Day two comes and
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.860]   I'm sitting there in that same chair. And once again, straight away, God says the same
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:19.940]   thing to me. What is it that you have to bring me today? And so once again, I was like, well,
[00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:24.020]   the faith that I've got, the belief that I know that you heal, the stories that I've
[00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:27.860]   read in your scriptures and how I believe that those things can happen today. And I
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:31.420]   leaned in again and prayed and prayed. Day three, same question. What is it that you
[00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:34.660]   can bring me? God, I'm going to bring you all of this stuff, all of this faith. Day
[00:11:34.660 --> 00:11:41.020]   four, five, six, the same question kept coming. By about day five or six, I was like, oh,
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:44.820]   okay, God, I'm bringing you the same stuff that I brought you yesterday. You know, all
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:48.900]   that stuff that I've already prayed, but hey, you've asked again. All right, here it is.
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:52.260]   Here's all that faith. Here's all the things I'm believing. And I felt like I was beginning
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:56.780]   to kind of repeat myself a little bit. By about day eight or nine, I was beginning to
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.260]   get stressed the night before my prayer time, thinking like, God's going to ask me tomorrow,
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.580]   what is it that I'm bringing? And I'm going to have to come up with something new, something
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:09.820]   fresh. Like, what am I going to say to God tomorrow about what I'm bringing him? Well,
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:15.540]   by day 15, I was really getting myself in a place where I was just feeling like this
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:20.300]   was kind of strange. Every time I sat down to pray, God was asking me, what is it that
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:26.020]   I am bringing him? So day 16 comes and I sit there in that chair. And by this point, you
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:30.980]   know, to be honest with you, I felt like I didn't really have anything more. In fact,
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:36.180]   I felt like I didn't have anything left. In fact, all the emotions that I've been carrying
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.820]   over the last three or four weeks since I was told that I was infertile were sitting
[00:12:40.820 --> 00:12:47.860]   present with me. Unlike day one, where I felt like I had all that faith, by day 16, I felt
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:55.060]   like I had nothing. I felt like I was emptied of all of that passion, all of that excitement.
[00:12:55.060 --> 00:13:01.060]   And actually the honesty of my emotions came to me. That feeling of being a bit angry with
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:07.180]   God, of being frustrated with him, the feeling that I didn't actually have a faith for a
[00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:11.700]   miracle, the embarrassment of that, but the honesty of that was probably the reality.
[00:13:11.700 --> 00:13:17.420]   Like I don't know if God could actually physically change me. And so as I sat there on day 16,
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:22.060]   and as I began to pray, that inevitable question from God came, what is it that you have to
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:28.740]   bring me today? And for the first time in those 16 days, I think I actually answered
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:36.260]   honestly to God. And I basically said, God, I don't think I've got anything. I don't think
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:43.380]   I'm really bringing to you today any hope, any faith. In fact, I'm bringing anger. I'm
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:49.860]   bringing tiredness. I'm bringing confusion. I feel like literally I've got nothing. And
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:58.140]   so I came before God and I said, literally, God, today I have nothing. And then God responded
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:02.340]   in a way that, you know, like how sometimes God speaks and he doesn't tell you kind of
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:06.900]   what you want to hear, but kind of what you need to hear. You know, those moments where
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:11.420]   God is kind of blunt with you and it's kind of like a life-changing thing, even if it's
[00:14:11.420 --> 00:14:18.180]   not exactly what you were hoping to hear. Well, God kind of just comes to me very closely,
[00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:21.660]   very intimately and presently. I could feel his presence very strongly on me in that moment
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.740]   as I was sitting there on that chair. And I just said to him, I had nothing for him.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:31.700]   And he comes and he speaks into my soul and he says this, he says, "Good, because now
[00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:41.100]   we can begin." Now, Andrew, we can begin. We can begin the process of my transformation
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:46.480]   of your life. We can bring and begin that process of your healing and restoration. You've
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:53.020]   got nothing? Well, then you're at a place where I can come and begin to work. And I
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.740]   recognized that there was a nakedness that I was bringing to him, a vulnerability, an
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:04.140]   honesty that cut through all of the fake stuff that I was trying to give God. And instead,
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:11.460]   I was just saying, this is who I am, hurting, broken, vulnerable, and nothing. And that
[00:15:11.460 --> 00:15:19.340]   for God was the moment where he felt like he could actually begin to rebuild my life.
[00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:24.380]   The story that I just read to us of this woman coming before Elisha, she's in the same kind
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:29.900]   of place. She's at the end of her rope. The first verse tells us a couple of things about
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.300]   her. She's a widow. Her husband's just recently passed away. And in those days and in that
[00:15:34.300 --> 00:15:39.820]   time, being a widow was actually a really hot, hard, rough, tough thing. It wasn't an
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:45.300]   easy thing to do. Being a widow is actually the lowest form of kind of social hierarchy.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.380]   So she had that already against herself. But we then learned some other things, that her
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:54.740]   husband who's just passed away was actually a member of Elisha's band of prophets. He
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:00.080]   was serving and helping Elisha in his prophetic ministry, which tells us that he wasn't an
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:04.700]   industry person. He wasn't earning a lot of money. He was actually working and serving
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:09.280]   Elisha. Therefore, he was surviving off of the donations and the generosity of the community
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:14.100]   of faith around him. And we know actually that he didn't have a lot of money and it
[00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:18.620]   was difficult for him to provide for his family in that role, because the woman then tells
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:24.300]   us that her creditors, the creditors of her family, those that had lent the family money
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:29.180]   because her husband had been serving Elisha, they were now knocking on her door demanding
[00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:34.100]   payment because he's passed away. And she's coming to Elisha, essentially her husband's
[00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:39.140]   boss and saying, "How are you going to fix this situation? I mean, we've got nothing
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:45.300]   now. How are you going to come and change this situation?" And she says, "If I can't
[00:16:45.300 --> 00:16:50.060]   do something here, the creditors are going to come and take my two sons," which actually
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:54.620]   was the legal thing that they could do in those days. If the family couldn't pay financially
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:17:00.140]   for that debt, they could come and take children and have those children work for them to pay
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.700]   off that debt over time. And as she says, she says, "They want to come and make my sons
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:11.220]   slaves." Now, as a widow, having sons was her only possibility of a future life. And
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:17.220]   so she's in the most desperate, difficult situation. And so she comes to Elisha and
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:22.660]   she says, "What are you going to do to help fix this?" I want to show you how Elisha responds
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:29.900]   here in verse 2. He says this, "Elisha replies to her, 'Well, how can I help you? Tell me,
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:36.380]   what do you have in your house?'" I love this question. I think it's such a beautiful and
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:41.140]   important question. The first thing he says to her is, "What is it that you actually have
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:46.220]   in your house?" To me, this is the same question that God was asking me on all of those days
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:51.060]   of that prayer and fasting. "Andrew, what is it that you're bringing to me today? What
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:57.380]   is it that you have?" And I think Elisha is trying to zero in on her honesty. He's trying
[00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:02.660]   to find out exactly where she is. Is she aware of her situation? And is she willing before
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:08.240]   Elisha to be fully honest and true and vulnerable and naked and transparent before him in her
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.580]   answer? And here's the thing in this message. I feel today this is significant. I think
[00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.620]   God is coming to many people who are listening to this right now. And God is coming to you
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.940]   and He's asking you that same question on this Sunday. He's saying, "Hey, what is actually
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:30.300]   in your house today? What is it that you're bringing into this place of worship? What
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:35.500]   is it that you're bringing in your relationship with me?" I feel like God is leaning into
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.100]   some of us today and He's asking that question personally, honestly, and He's looking for
[00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:44.500]   you to give an honest answer. And there's many of us that are sitting here listening
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:48.100]   to that, thinking to ourselves, "Well, I'm not exactly sure that I have much at all.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.140]   I'm not exactly sure that in this season of my life that I have anything of worth to bring
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:56.380]   God. I kind of come to church today. I'm in this environment with people. I'm singing
[00:18:56.380 --> 00:19:01.060]   the songs. I'm seeing what's going on. But personally, deep down inside, I don't think
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.900]   there's anything left in the house, you know, in my soul, in my emotions, in who I am. I'm
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:15.140]   completely dry and drained." Notice how she responds here on the second part of the verse.
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:23.100]   She says, "Your servant has nothing there at all except a little oil." She's honest
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:29.080]   with him right up front. She says, "You know what? My house is empty. I got nothing left.
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:33.060]   There's nothing here that I have to offer you, Elisha. I've got no way of paying you.
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.420]   I've got no way of getting myself out of this situation. Like, there's nothing I have."
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.660]   And then she says, "Except I have a little bit of oil left." She's talking about olive
[00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:47.900]   oil, the kind of oil that was used to help in some cooking as well as some medicines
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:53.420]   in those days. She says, "I've got a little bit of this oil left." Now, the mention of
[00:19:53.420 --> 00:20:00.700]   the oil here opens up two avenues of layers of meaning in this story. On the one side,
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.460]   this story becomes a story of social justice. It becomes the story of Elisha taking that
[00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:10.740]   little oil, multiplying it so that she can pay off her creditors and that her sons won't
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:15.700]   go into slavery and that there is liberation for her and her family from that debt so she
[00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:20.280]   can live a good life. That's a social justice element of the story. And it's a powerful
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:25.420]   story about how God comes and provides for those that are in need. That's a beautiful
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:30.380]   layer to the story. But when oil is mentioned in the scripture, we also have to realize
[00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:35.100]   that there's always a second layer of meaning, something that goes beyond the surface level
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:40.340]   and takes us a little bit deeper. Oil in the Old Testament always was a reference to the
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:46.260]   anointing of God, to God's presence and His anointing and His authority on people. When
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:52.020]   kings came into authority, oil would be poured on their head as a symbol of God's acceptance
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:58.540]   and anointing of them. Prophets and those that serve the prophets, people like this
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:04.220]   woman's husband who worked for Elisha, they also would have been poured with oil to signify
[00:21:04.220 --> 00:21:09.580]   to the community around them that God is anointing them for service. We see this actually happening
[00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:13.380]   in the New Testament. Remember that moment where the woman comes whilst Jesus is reclining
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:18.060]   at the table of a Pharisee and she breaks open that perfume and pours it on His feet.
[00:21:18.060 --> 00:21:23.380]   Again, a symbol of honor, a symbol of anointing, a symbol of preparing Him for the work that
[00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:29.580]   He had to do. So whenever we read in scripture about oil and about this kind of idea of oil
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:34.820]   flowing, it links us to this deeper meaning of God's anointing. So this story has something
[00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:39.140]   to say about God's heart for social justice, absolutely. But it's also got something to
[00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:45.380]   say about God's anointing upon His people, about how God wants to pour out His power
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:50.860]   and His love and His grace and His spirit on people. I want us to keep both layers of
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:56.020]   meaning in our minds as we go through this passage together. Now I want you to see what
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:02.300]   the woman says here. It's powerful. She says, "Except for this little bit of oil." You see,
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.300]   she offers to Elisha the one thing that's left, just a little bit of oil. And I think
[00:22:07.300 --> 00:22:11.780]   this is actually super encouraging for us as we're listening to this. Because no matter
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:16.420]   how drained you might feel, no matter how tired you might be, no matter how it might
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:20.300]   feel like you're at the end of your rope, that there's no hope for you. If you're a
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:27.140]   Christian listening to this, you are never completely without oil because oil symbolizes
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:30.940]   the spirit of God. And we know that the Bible tells us that when we come to Christ, when
[00:22:30.940 --> 00:22:36.260]   He's our Lord and Savior, His spirit comes and sits in us. It dwells in us. It comes
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:41.780]   upon us. Paul would write that the same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead now is in
[00:22:41.780 --> 00:22:47.500]   us. If you profess Jesus as your Lord and Savior, no matter how tired, exhausted, no
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:52.500]   matter how distant you might feel from Him, you have a little bit of oil still in you.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:57.820]   There is the presence of God. His spirit never departs us. It never leaves us. And I think
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.780]   that's encouraging for some of you listening to this because you're feeling like you're
[00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:04.860]   a long way from God. You're feeling like things have really stacked up against you. You're
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.460]   feeling completely drained and empty. And scripture would say, no matter how empty you
[00:23:09.460 --> 00:23:15.980]   feel, you're not completely empty. There is still always His spirit in you. And His spirit
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:21.300]   is like a deposit for the work that He wants to do in your life. You see, the woman goes
[00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:26.340]   to Elisha and she says, "All I've got is this little bit of oil. If you see the amount of
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:31.180]   nothingness around me, it's overwhelming. I've just got this little bit of oil in comparison."
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:37.900]   See, Elisha doesn't see the oil as little. He's not overwhelmed by the nothingness around
[00:23:37.900 --> 00:23:42.820]   her. Instead, he sees the oil differently. He looks at the oil and what he sees is a
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:49.180]   deposit for the miracle that was about to take place. The oil was a significant deposit
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.780]   for everything that was about to happen in the rest of this story. And some of you need
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:56.980]   to hear that this morning, that no matter how tired you are, if you're a Christian,
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:03.620]   the spirit of God is in you and it's a deposit for the work that He longs to do, for the
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:09.540]   anointing that He longs to bring, for the hope that He wants to refill in your life,
[00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:17.220]   for the season that is ahead of you. You are never without oil. Are you hearing this, church?
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:22.220]   You're never without the presence of God if you are a Christian, if you've given Him your
[00:24:22.220 --> 00:24:28.540]   heart and your life. And I think this deposit becomes the thing that next gets used for
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:34.300]   everything that God wants to do. And I think for some of us in this room, what the invitation
[00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:38.780]   is right now is to bring a prayer to God. And the prayer is literally this, "God, in
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:44.660]   this season of my life right now, I have nothing. In this season of my life right now, I actually
[00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:54.700]   have nothing except for a little bit of oil. Would you come?" That prophetic statement
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.540]   that there is still the spirit of God in me, no matter how hard these things might be,
[00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:03.940]   no matter how difficult it is, that there's still that spirit of God in me, just that
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:09.420]   prayer opens the door for an incredible work of the spirit of God in your life. And some
[00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:14.580]   of you, that's a prayer, simple, that you need to make today that I think will actually
[00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:19.940]   shift everything that's going to happen next. And I want to show you what actually happens
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:25.380]   next for this lady. Let's pick it up in verse 3. Elisha says to her, "Go around and ask
[00:25:25.380 --> 00:25:29.800]   all of your neighbors for empty jars. Don't ask for a few. Then go inside and shut the
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:35.300]   door behind you, you and your sons, and put all those jars to one side. Pour oil into
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:39.940]   the jars, each as they're filled, and then put them to one side." So she left him and
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:46.560]   afterwards shut the door behind her and her sons. It's fascinating what Elisha does here.
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:50.140]   He says to her, "Okay, we're going to work together with that little bit of oil. Your
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:55.860]   oil that you bring and God's work of the miracle, partner together to do something significant."
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:01.020]   And he essentially tells her two things. First of all, "I want you to go into your community
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:05.780]   around you." He says, "Go into the village, into the town, to your neighbors, and ask
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:11.420]   them to give you empty jars." Now, this is significant because what he wants her to realize
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:16.900]   is that although she feels like she's completely isolated and completely alone, she's not without
[00:26:16.900 --> 00:26:20.740]   community. That no matter how isolated she might have been feeling because her husband
[00:26:20.740 --> 00:26:25.540]   is gone and she thinks her sons are going to be taken by creditors, she's actually planted
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:30.420]   in a whole community around her that actually can help her to get to the next step of her
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:36.260]   life. This is like God basically saying that we always, whenever we're feeling like drained
[00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:41.500]   and exhausted, we always are not without hope because we have communities, place community
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:47.580]   around us. And so often when we're feeling alone, we isolate ourselves from that community.
[00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:51.700]   But Elisha is very specific to this woman, "Go to your neighbors and ask them to help
[00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:56.340]   you. Ask them to give you those empty jars and then bring them in." So for some of you
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:01.580]   watching this, if this is a season of difficulty for you, just be really careful not to isolate
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:06.500]   yourself from your community. Like Elisha inspires this woman to reach out to her neighbors,
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.860]   I want to inspire you today to reach out to the neighbors around you, to this community
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:14.380]   of faith, the people sitting around you right now, your community group that you might be
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:18.540]   a part of, or if you're not a part of a community group, a pastor or somebody in this church
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:24.100]   that can come around you today and help speak life into you. You are not without community.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:30.780]   You're a part of the body of Christ. The church of Christ is a place of great abundance for
[00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:37.060]   you. And that's a word of encouragement and a word of hope. So first of all, Elisha says,
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:40.900]   "Realize that you're in this community and that community can help you." The second thing
[00:27:40.900 --> 00:27:45.560]   he says though, interestingly, is that he says, "Go behind closed doors, shut those
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:50.780]   doors off so that you and your sons are in private, and then begin to pour that oil in
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.340]   those empty jars." This is Elisha basically saying, "Yes, number one, your support is
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:59.380]   found in your community, but there's also the support and the miracle of God that is
[00:27:59.380 --> 00:28:05.300]   found in your private obedience in your relationship with Him." Elisha says, "Go in, close those
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:10.300]   doors so no one sees, and then do this in faith and obedience." And so when we find
[00:28:10.300 --> 00:28:14.100]   ourselves in places of being a little bit burnt out, a little bit tired, a little bit
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:18.820]   drained, not only is it the community that we can reach into, it's also our own private
[00:28:18.820 --> 00:28:25.180]   devotional relationship with Jesus. The stuff that happens behind closed doors is as important.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:29.100]   The stuff that happens that no one sees, those prayers that take place that no one's aware
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:34.620]   of, the way that we come and be obedient to God in the quiet place, the private place,
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:40.020]   those places are also filled with the hope of God. Those places are also where the miracles
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:45.160]   of God take place. So there's this balance, and I love how Elisha shows us this, the balance
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:50.420]   of reaching out to community, but also taking responsibility and the privacy of our relationship
[00:28:50.420 --> 00:28:55.260]   with God. And it's in both of these that we begin to move forward in the miracles He has
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:29:02.180]   for us. See, there is the community, the public community of faith, but there's also the private
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:07.100]   community of our relationship with Jesus. And those two things, when we lean into them,
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:12.480]   actually open us up to the great work that He wants to do in us. And let's see what happens
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:18.060]   with that work as we carry on in verse 6. "When all the jars were full, she said to
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:24.020]   her son, 'Bring me another one.' But he replied, 'There is not a jar left.' Then the oil stopped
[00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:29.700]   flowing. She went and told the man of God, and he said, 'Go, sell the oil and pay your
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:35.700]   debts. You and your sons can live on what is left.'" The end part here is actually super
[00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:40.420]   critical to everything that we've been saying. There's a situation here where the empty jars
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:46.340]   are now all full. There's no more empty jars. And the scriptures say here that the oil stopped
[00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:51.560]   flowing. Once the jars were full and there was no more empty jar to bring, that oil stopped
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:57.020]   flowing. And it says that then she comes to the man of God and tells him this. But the
[00:29:57.020 --> 00:30:00.980]   question actually the text doesn't help us with is what does she actually tell him? Does
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:05.980]   she tell him, "I've got no more empty jars," or does she tell him that the oil stopped
[00:30:05.980 --> 00:30:09.580]   flowing? And it's really important that we understand this because if she says the oil
[00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:14.660]   stops flowing, then from her perspective, it's God's problem, not hers. It's like God
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:18.340]   has stopped the anointing. The anointing is not flowing. The oil is not coming anymore.
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:22.540]   Or did she go to him and say, "Hey, these jars, there's no more empty jars. And because
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:27.860]   there's no more empty jars, the oil has stopped actually flowing." Well, in the English, we
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:32.060]   don't know what she says, but in the Hebrew, it actually links it to the first part of
[00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:36.100]   that. She actually comes to Elisha and she says, "Guess what, Elisha? There's no more
[00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:41.100]   empty jars." You see, the woman's made the connection between the jars and the anointing.
[00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:45.500]   She's made the connection between the emptiness and the flow of God. And that connection is
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:49.340]   super important because she understands that when there's nothing that is empty anymore
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:55.020]   to bring, there's no more oil that's going to flow. So she understands that actually
[00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:59.700]   something's critical about God's presence. Something's critical about the anointing of
[00:30:59.700 --> 00:31:05.860]   God on us, that God loves to bring his anointing and to fill the things that are actually empty.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:11.420]   She understands something that I want to speak over every single person here. She understands
[00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:18.460]   this, that our emptiness is the gateway to the anointing of God. Our emptiness is the
[00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:23.660]   gateway to God's anointing. And then that seems almost counterintuitive to what we think
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:28.140]   about the anointing of God. You see, so often as Christians, we link the anointing of God
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.740]   to what we do well, to the good things that we have, to our gifts and our talents and
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:36.860]   the stuff that we do well. We think God's anointing comes on us when we're actually
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:41.300]   operating in our talents and all the things that seem to come easy to us. That's often
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:46.220]   when we say, "Oh, yeah, the anointing was on me." And now, of course, God does use our
[00:31:46.220 --> 00:31:50.660]   gifts and our talents and our strengths and all that good stuff. But actually, what we're
[00:31:50.660 --> 00:31:55.860]   learning from the scripture here is that God longs to bring his anointing. He longs to
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:32:02.620]   fill the things that are empty. And sometimes we're so full of ourselves that we have no
[00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:07.180]   room for the anointing of God. Sometimes we're so proud of the gifts and the talents that
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:13.820]   we bring that we have no need to pray and ask God to anoint us. Sometimes, actually,
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:22.100]   it's in the desperation moments that we actually come to God honestly and say, "I've got nothing."
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:30.220]   God then rolls up his sleeve, leans forward to us and says, "Good. So now we can begin."
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:37.140]   And this is what's happening here in this story. As there's no more empty jars, the
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:44.260]   oil stops flowing. God loves to pour out his oil and his love and his power and majesty
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:50.540]   into the things that are desperate, the things that are empty. And so your emptiness today,
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:54.580]   the thing that you're struggling with, the fact that you're feeling drained and tired,
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:59.860]   God understands exactly where you're at. He knows how you're feeling. He knows how difficult
[00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.860]   this time has been. He's seen all the stuff that's happened with COVID, all the stuff
[00:33:03.860 --> 00:33:08.020]   that's happened in our workplaces, all the tensions that have been in our relationships,
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.580]   the fact that many of us have not been able to travel to go home and see family and how
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:16.420]   all of this stuff is beginning to add stress and anxiety on our lives. So many of us are
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:22.340]   feeling like, "Oh, this is just all too much." God sees that. And what he sees is what Elisha
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:27.300]   saw. He sees that there's a little bit of oil and a lot of emptiness, and he gets the
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:34.860]   joy of pouring himself out on those that come and say, "I've got nothing to bring, but I
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:41.260]   need you." And I wonder as you're listening to this, whether that resonates with you today,
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.700]   whether like this woman, you're able to make that connection that our emptiness is not
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:51.140]   a negative thing, that actually our emptiness opens ourselves up to the gateway of the anointing
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:56.980]   of God. Here's an amazing thing that science teaches us. It's only empty things that can
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:34:03.220]   be filled. Come on, church. Only empty things that can actually be filled. And if you're
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:09.300]   feeling empty today, I believe you are primed for a visitation of the anointing of God.
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:14.340]   You're primed for the presence of God to come. When I sat there on that chair on day 16 and
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:19.860]   I said to God, "I've got nothing," he said, "Now we can begin." As the woman comes to
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:26.220]   Elisha and says, "I got nothing except this oil," he says to her, "Well, now God can begin."
[00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:32.500]   And as you're listening to this, maybe your honest prayer and cry is, "I just don't have
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:38.620]   it anymore. I just can't stir up the faith anymore. I just can't get the energy I used
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:43.820]   to have. I'm just feeling like everything has worn me down and worn me out." You are
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:50.380]   primed for the presence of God to come. If you come to Him and just say, "I am in need
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:56.940]   today," God's anointing will flow. I sense what the Holy Spirit is saying to us as a
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:04.580]   church is this, "Bring me the empty jars. Bring me the empty jars." He wants to come
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:10.060]   today and fill you with new hope. And perhaps your response today is just to say, "I'm that
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:15.940]   empty jar. I'm the one today. I'm the one who's exhausted and drained and empty and
[00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:22.460]   in need of God." And maybe it's simply you responding today to say, "Come, God, come.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:27.100]   I don't have anything to offer, but I know your Spirit is still inside of me. I'm feeling
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:32.380]   like I'm really drained and tired, but I do know that that deposit is in me because I
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:38.140]   believe that you are my Lord and Savior." And so as an empty jar, you come today and
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:43.900]   God's presence and His Spirit can flow and speak and encourage and move on you. And I
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:48.140]   think as we do this as a church, as we're honest with Him in this season that we're
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:54.260]   in, we can be excited about the reality that His anointing will touch us and fill us.
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:59.100]   So if this is speaking to you, I want to speak and pray this over you. And so here's what
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:02.940]   I want to do. I want to invite everyone to stand right now in this moment, just across
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:07.500]   the service. Why don't we all stand together? The team's going to come and they're going
[00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:11.700]   to be with us as they begin to provide a bit of worship in the background. But I want to
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:15.760]   now come and just lean into this ministry moment with us together. You see, you're an
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:22.220]   empty jar, but God's excited. He's leaning into you with that gentleness and that love.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:28.220]   And He's saying, "It's okay, because now we can begin." Let's pray.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:36.060]   Father, we come to you in this moment. We come as honest people before you. And as we
[00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:45.580]   stand before you now here, we pray that, Lord, the story of this woman would inspire us.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:49.860]   That Lord, you encourage her to connect with her community. Lord, some people here today,
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.540]   that's going to be their journey too. That you've provided a great community around them
[00:36:53.540 --> 00:36:57.820]   that they're not accessing and not using. And that perhaps today you're challenging
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:37:04.860]   them to reach out beyond just themselves. Lord, you also showed this woman that importance
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:09.620]   of the privacy of her obedience with you. Perhaps for some people listening to this,
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:14.500]   that's an important word for them too. That maybe they've allowed that obedience of their
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:18.380]   relationship with you, that trust and faith of you. Maybe that's been drained from them
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:25.260]   in this time. And maybe they're being encouraged today just to reemphasize and refocus on their
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:31.500]   private relationship with you, that community with the Holy Spirit on a daily basis.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:36.460]   But most of all, Lord, you're saying to us as a church, bring me the empty jars. And
[00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.900]   Lord, I believe that there are many people standing right now that would resonate with
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.620]   that. And so as we're standing together, our eyes are closed. Everybody's just in this
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:49.100]   moment of ministry. If that's speaking to you, I want to encourage you just to open
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:54.460]   your hands right now, just across this service for those watching online as well. Just open
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:38:01.260]   up your hands before the Lord. It's a simple way of just gesturing openness, vulnerability
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:07.980]   and need. And so Father, as our hands are open before you across this room, Lord, we
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:15.420]   do so because we resonate with this idea that you fill empty things, that you come and you
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:22.380]   flow. And Lord, we are feeling in a place of emptiness. Lord, we're feeling in a place
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:28.420]   of need. So Lord, I pray for every person right now whose hands are open before you.
[00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:34.620]   Every person who is leaning into this moment. Lord, would you come and begin a new work,
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:40.220]   a fresh work. Would your Holy Spirit begin to flow? Would you begin to meet people wherever
[00:38:40.220 --> 00:38:45.100]   it is that they need to be met? Lord, would you bring that encouragement that you will
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:50.380]   fill them with your love, fill them with your hope, fill them with your strength? Lord,
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:56.700]   I pray that authority would come. Lord, your anointing of oil always symbolize an authority.
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:01.860]   I pray for those that need that sense of your authority in their lives. But as they stand
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:06.260]   with their hands open before you, you would come and do that also in this moment. So Holy
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:14.300]   Spirit flow, we pray. And Lord, as you fill the empty jars, Lord, we pray that we would
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:19.940]   be able to keep bringing these jars to you. Lord, that on a daily basis, we would be honest
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:24.860]   with you. On a daily basis, we bring our struggles and our strife and our challenges and our
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:29.860]   pain and our hurt, our anger, the stuff that we're feeling in this season. Now, this wouldn't
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:34.940]   be a one-off moment in this service right now, but we would have a lifestyle of remembering
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:39.940]   the story of this woman, connecting the community, having that privacy of our faith with you,
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:48.340]   but also bringing our emptiness. Like day 16 for me, I've got nothing in my house, Lord,
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:54.700]   except a little bit of oil. Lord, I pray that that would inspire and encourage us as a church
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:40:01.020]   in this season. And we thank you for this in Jesus' name. I encourage you to continue
[00:40:01.020 --> 00:40:05.220]   just to lean in to what the ministry of God is doing in this moment as the team comes
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:05.860]   and does worship.
