1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,680
 What are we gonna do with Bethlehem?

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:08,100
 Bethlehem is the great irony of the Christmas story.

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,500
 When we celebrate Christmas in our modern time

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,820
 and modern tradition, when we think of Bethlehem,

5
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:15,340
 I think it conjures up for us

6
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,280
 the perfect hallmark Christmas card nativity scene,

7
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,140
 doesn't it?

8
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:20,100
 You know, when we think of Bethlehem,

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,860
 we think of like perfect animals

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,360
 that never smelt bad in their lives, right?

11
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:26,160
 We think of like this beautiful manger,

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,880
 this beautiful soft lighting on Mary and Joseph.

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,640
 Mary just having given birth,

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,700
 but looking slim as ever, right?

15
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,240
 We think of Bethlehem as this calm and peaceful

16
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,240
 and holy and beautiful place where nothing could go wrong,

17
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,020
 where the angels gathered to sing Kumbaya forever.

18
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:48,960
 But Bethlehem, the real Bethlehem,

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,800
 the Bethlehem of the first Christmas

20
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,500
 was anything but like that.

21
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,800
 Bethlehem itself was a forgotten town

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,520
 just about five miles south of Jerusalem.

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,920
 Jerusalem, this incredible city of David,

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,600
 Jerusalem that had the temple,

25
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,720
 Jerusalem, the place where you would expect

26
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,320
 the Messiah to come, not Bethlehem.

27
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,120
 Bethlehem may be the birthplace of David,

28
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,120
 but it was just an outpost.

29
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,400
 In fact, scholars believe that at the time of Jesus' birth,

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,400
 there was only about say 20 to 25 families that lived there.

31
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,040
 That's roughly about 180 to about 220 people.

32
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,160
 It was a small little place.

33
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,960
 And we know from the Christmas story

34
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,680
 that it was a place of a tight knit community

35
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,760
 that didn't like outsiders.

36
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,620
 So when Joseph arrived,

37
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,060
 despite the fact that Joseph was related

38
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,240
 to most of the families in that village,

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,540
 none of those families welcomed them.

40
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:51,480
 None of the 20 to 25 families

41
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,520
 that could have opened their homes bothered to do so.

42
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,360
 Why?

43
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,160
 Because they were not married

44
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,280
 and there's Mary pregnant out of wedlock

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,340
 and none of them wanted to suffer the shame

46
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,760
 of being associated with her,

47
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,900
 which really is ironic

48
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,680
 because Mary is carrying inside of her

49
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,120
 the hope of the world

50
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:13,880
 and Bethlehem essentially closes their doors to it.

51
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,440
 So much so that they were born,

52
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,000
 or Jesus was born in a cave,

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,360
 not as stable as we often think of it

54
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,720
 in our modern celebrations.

55
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,200
 I've actually been to Bethlehem

56
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,560
 and I've gone to the very place

57
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,500
 where they think Jesus potentially was born.

58
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,600
 It's a grotto under the main temple,

59
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,000
 the main sort of cathedral that they have there.

60
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
 And that grotto is dark and it's cold

61
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
 and it's gritty and it's horrible.

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,560
 It's not the place that any of you

63
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,120
 would choose your son to come into the world.

64
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,340
 That's Bethlehem.

65
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,860
 The carol we just sung

66
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,960
 captures it quite profoundly and beautifully.

67
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,320
 It says this,

68
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,440
 "Above thy deep and dreamless sleep

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,260
 "as silent stars go by,

70
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,600
 "yet in the dark,

71
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,680
 "the dark grotty gritty streets

72
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,860
 "shine of this everlasting light

73
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,960
 "for the hopes and the fears

74
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,520
 "of all the years are met indeed tonight."

75
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,160
 The hopes and the fears.

76
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,600
 That's a great summary of Bethlehem.

77
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,520
 The hope that was in Christ Jesus carried in Mary

78
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,360
 and yet the fears of a people

79
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,200
 gripped in the oppression of empire.

80
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,960
 Bethlehem was dark and cold.

81
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,120
 Mary and Joseph were rejected

82
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,580
 and shunned by their own family.

83
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,960
 That's how the Christmas story actually begins.

84
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,320
 And if all of that wasn't bad enough,

85
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,580
 Bethlehem then becomes the one place

86
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:44,080
 of the greatest, most horrendous atrocity

87
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,200
 that is seen in the whole of the New Testament.

88
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,940
 In fact, Matthew, as he continues his story

89
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:51,280
 about the birth of Jesus,

90
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,920
 takes us into the reality of this atrocity.

91
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,480
 It was a genocide.

92
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:01,080
 A genocide happens in Bethlehem.

93
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,160
 Let me read this to you from Matthew chapter two,

94
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,160
 starting in verse 16.

95
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,320
 It says, "When Herod realized

96
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,240
 "that he had been outwitted by the Magi,

97
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,400
 "he was furious and he gave orders

98
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,260
 "to kill all the boys in Bethlehem

99
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,820
 "and in the surrounding vicinity

100
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,920
 "who were just under the age of two years old.

101
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,660
 "In accordance with the time

102
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,600
 "that he had learned from the Magi."

103
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,960
 You wanna know what the true Bethlehem Christmas story

104
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,780
 is about?

105
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:29,840
 It's about genocide.

106
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,000
 It's about a group of people that rejected Mary and Joseph

107
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,240
 'cause they didn't wanna be associated

108
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,280
 with the shame of them.

109
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:38,400
 And it's about the reality of weeping mothers

110
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,000
 in a very broken place.

111
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,520
 Matthew tells us here that Herod,

112
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,800
 in a fit of jealous paranoia,

113
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,440
 decides to kill all of the boys under the age of two.

114
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,480
 Now, scholars generally would say

115
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,620
 that was probably only about 12 to 20 or so boys.

116
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:58,960
 But if you were any of those families,

117
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,400
 that was the world to you.

118
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,920
 And Matthew wants you right in the midst

119
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,820
 of all of your, "Woo-hoo, it's Christmas time."

120
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:13,320
 He wants you to suffer the pain

121
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:16,080
 of the injustice of genocide.

122
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,760
 Which really blows my mind.

123
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,600
 And I wonder whether today,

124
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,120
 you might be able to also imagine what it would have been

125
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,240
 like to be one of the mothers of Bethlehem

126
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,600
 at the time of Jesus's birth.

127
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,560
 Can you imagine if you're one of those mothers

128
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,440
 and you've spent all this time hearing about a decree

129
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,400
 that Herod has given,

130
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,220
 and you're worried that one day,

131
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,860
 suddenly you're gonna hear it.

132
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:45,880
 You're gonna hear the hoofs of the horses

133
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:48,520
 of the soldiers coming into Bethlehem.

134
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,000
 And you know that that's the moment

135
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,680
 where your child might be taken.

136
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,920
 And so as you hear the horses,

137
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,000
 you grab your child and you wrap your child up in a cloth

138
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,240
 and you tell the child to be as quiet as possible

139
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,800
 because you don't want the child to be crying.

140
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,400
 And you try to shush the child

141
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,080
 and you put it at the back of the room,

142
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,640
 hoping that when the soldiers come, they won't hear it.

143
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,720
 And then suddenly there's the knock on the door.

144
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,760
 Suddenly you know that the soldiers are right there

145
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:15,160
 at the front of your door and you open the door,

146
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,120
 hoping that they won't hear the child,

147
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,760
 but the child is still crying.

148
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,200
 And so the soldiers come straight in.

149
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:24,640
 They grab the child from you and you start to scream.

150
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,040
 You start to wail.

151
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,200
 You start to fight back.

152
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,360
 You say, "No, not my child.

153
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,800
 You can't take my child."

154
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,920
 And the soldiers storm out of the house

155
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:33,400
 and they slam the door.

156
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:40,720
 And then you can no longer hear your child screaming

157
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,840
 and crying anymore.

158
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,680
 You immediately know that he's gone forever.

159
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:54,520
 Oh, sure, there are some angels that sing at Christmas time,

160
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:56,640
 but that's also the sound of Christmas.

161
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:02,640
 The sound of mothers who lose their sons

162
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,240
 to the atrocity of genocide

163
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,800
 and the injustice of an oppressing empire.

164
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,920
 I wonder if you could imagine what it would have been like

165
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,080
 to be some of those mothers of Bethlehem.

166
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:17,160
 I like to call them the weeping mothers of Bethlehem.

167
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,320
 Could you imagine how they would feel to know

168
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,400
 that the coming of the Messiah

169
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,760
 necessitated the death of their child?

170
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:26,920
 I wonder if you could feel

171
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:30,760
 what it would have been like for them to think,

172
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,920
 "Well, if that is what the coming of the Messiah

173
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,360
 is all about, then that doesn't sound

174
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,000
 like a fair exchange to me."

175
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,360
 Can you imagine how those mothers would have felt

176
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,360
 when they heard that God showed up in a dream to Joseph

177
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,640
 and told Joseph about the coming genocide

178
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,240
 so that Joseph and Mary could escape the death?

179
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
 Could you imagine the questions

180
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,240
 that might have sat on the mother's heart?

181
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,560
 "Why didn't God give us the dream as well?"

182
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:03,920
 And Matthew doesn't shy away from the reality

183
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,600
 of the hardness of these questions.

184
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,040
 He doesn't shy away from the reality

185
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,200
 of what is happening in this story.

186
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,000
 In fact, he could have just put it aside, couldn't he?

187
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,280
 He could have just wiped away this part of history.

188
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,720
 He could have said, "When I present the story of Jesus,

189
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,040
 I just want the angels, I just want the shepherds,

190
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,280
 I just want the wise men.

191
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,120
 I want it to feel all nice and comfortable."

192
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,360
 No, he decides that he needs to mention the genocide

193
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,680
 'cause he's like, "I am not gonna allow them

194
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,880
 to sweep this under the rug of history."

195
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,560
 When Luke writes his story about the birth of Jesus,

196
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,400
 he doesn't mention the genocide.

197
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,840
 And it's almost like Matthew is saying, "We will speak up.

198
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,920
 We will know that this was also a part of the reality

199
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,360
 of the coming of the Messiah."

200
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,680
 And by putting it in his gospel,

201
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,920
 it's like Matthew is saying,

202
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,120
 "I honor those children that were killed.

203
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,240
 I honor the mothers who are weeping

204
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,280
 because injustice is a part of our story."

205
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:58,560
 That we need to understand that when we come

206
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,040
 to celebrate the arrival of Jesus,

207
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,160
 it comes in the context of the most horrendous atrocity

208
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,560
 that you could imagine.

209
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,040
 And it's like Matthew is saying,

210
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:10,920
 "This is what it means to be a Christ follower,

211
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,960
 that we recognize injustice and we do something about it,

212
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,320
 that we don't shy from the realities,

213
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,600
 that there is brokenness in the world,

214
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
 there is darkness in the world."

215
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,640
 And if you wanna know what the Messiah is really about,

216
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,880
 it's about actually changing the injustice

217
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,920
 for the justice that he would carry.

218
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,240
 Matthew would say,

219
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,720
 "Sit with the weeping mothers of Bethlehem

220
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,360
 and don't rush to the nice presence under your tree.

221
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,960
 And feel a little bit of the journey

222
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,640
 that they would have gone through.

223
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,680
 And understand what it is to carry the name of Christ,

224
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,200
 to be one who's willing to speak up

225
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,760
 for not just the weeping mothers of Bethlehem,

226
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,800
 but now the weeping mothers of Hong Kong.

227
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,720
 Be willing to stand up for the vulnerable

228
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,360
 and the hurting and the marginalized

229
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,280
 in our place at Christmas time.

230
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:07,120
 To be able to say that there are things happening here

231
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,240
 that we're not happy about,

232
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,760
 that there are things happening here that are not right,

233
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,400
 that the voice of the church might rise up,

234
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,520
 yes, even at Christmas time,

235
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,360
 and say enough is enough.

236
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,000
 Are we willing to sit at Christmas time

237
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,320
 with those who carry the scars of injustice

238
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,960
 and the burdens of brokenness?"

239
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:33,160
 And as I challenge you with that question,

240
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,040
 I want you to think about it.

241
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:35,920
 And as you think about it,

242
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,240
 I want you to hear the justice cry

243
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,120
 of one of the most famous carols that we have.

268
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,840
 who mourns in lowly exile here.

269
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,900
 The justice cries of Asaam saying,

270
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,740
 "We're mourning, we're in exile,

271
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,580
 and we need you to come, God, and liberate us.

272
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,100
 Come, God, and change us."

273
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,540
 And Matthew, as he's wanting his people

274
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,980
 to sit in the reality of the genocide

275
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,420
 that happens in Bethlehem,

276
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:42,340
 he wants them to sit there because of what it will do

277
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,380
 to enable them to see the glory

278
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:47,100
 that is to come in Christ Jesus.

279
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:48,800
 And in order to make this connection,

280
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,860
 Matthew does something

281
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:53,300
 that is perhaps unprecedented in history.

282
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,940
 As his final connection to the Old Testament,

283
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,060
 Matthew takes Israel right back

284
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,540
 to one of the worst atrocities of their history

285
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,700
 to try to connect that to the current atrocity in Bethlehem

286
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,100
 in order that he might show them

287
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,180
 the powerful light of Christ Jesus.

288
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:14,340
 And I wanna show you how amazing it is and how he does it.

289
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:17,700
 Let me show you this from Matthew 2, verse 17.

290
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,820
 It says, "Then what was said

291
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,900
 through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled."

292
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:23,860
 So he's just told us about the genocide,

293
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,140
 and then he said, "This happened

294
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,700
 to fulfill a prophecy of Jeremiah."

295
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:31,780
 And here's the prophecy, "A voice is heard in Ramah,

296
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:34,620
 weeping and great mourning,

297
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:36,300
 Rachel weeping for her children

298
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:40,180
 and refusing to be comforted because they are no more."

299
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:42,260
 Welcome to the Christmas story.

300
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:44,420
 I know you came to a carol service

301
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,860
 and you were expecting to feel warm and fuzzy,

302
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,100
 but Matthew embraces the reality

303
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,520
 that right in the Christmas story,

304
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:54,620
 there's weeping and there's mourning

305
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,980
 and there's Rachel who cannot be comforted.

306
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,300
 And as you read this quote from Jeremiah,

307
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,900
 you're probably wondering how does this fit in at all

308
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,060
 to the reality of the joy that can be found in Jesus?

309
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:07,900
 Well, to understand that,

310
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:10,740
 you need to go back to Jeremiah itself.

311
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,260
 Matthew's quoting here from Jeremiah 31, verse 15.

312
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,620
 Now, Jeremiah is a brutally difficult book to read.

313
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:20,700
 I don't know if you've ever studied the book of Jeremiah.

314
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,500
 It's not an easy book.

315
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,620
 It's the kind of book that gets in your face

316
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,300
 about your sin and your brokenness.

317
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:29,540
 It was a prophetic word that Jeremiah had for Israel

318
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,260
 at a moment of their greatest pain and suffering,

319
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,860
 where they were at the mercy of being attacked by Babylon.

320
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:40,140
 And Jeremiah has a window of being able to say,

321
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,260
 "Hey, if you turn from your sin,

322
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,980
 if you turn from your brokenness,

323
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:46,100
 there can be hope for you again in the future."

324
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,820
 But he's pretty brutal with them

325
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,700
 about the stuff that's going on in their lives.

326
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,800
 So Jeremiah is not an easy, fluffy read.

327
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:57,140
 But verse and chapter 31 is the shifting point of Jeremiah.

328
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,700
 In chapter 31 onwards, Jeremiah begins to speak of a hope.

329
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:03,300
 He begins to say that there is a new time and a future

330
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,940
 where God is gonna come and act.

331
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,420
 And in Jeremiah 31, he actually speaks about

332
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,980
 that famous idea that a new covenant will happen,

333
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:14,560
 that the old covenant was written on stone of tablets,

334
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,540
 but in time is coming where a new covenant will come for you.

335
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:20,100
 And that new covenant will be like the Spirit of God

336
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:22,140
 riding on the flesh of your heart.

337
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,760
 And he begins to say that there is hope for the future.

338
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,420
 There is stuff that's gonna happen that God is gonna do

339
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,500
 that is gonna change your perception about who you are,

340
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,380
 about the world.

341
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,340
 You're gonna have His heart in you, His Spirit in you.

342
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,260
 It's a great chapter.

343
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,260
 But before he gets all there,

344
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:43,260
 he roots them into this moment.

345
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,020
 And he says, "Do you remember Rama?"

346
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:50,120
 And he tells us about a place and a person.

347
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,240
 The place, Rama, was one of the most famous places

348
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,660
 in Israel in those days.

349
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,840
 And it was famous for two things.

350
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,920
 The first is this, Rama was the place where Israel fled to

351
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,200
 just before they were taken into exile in Babylon.

352
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,840
 Rama was the place where they gathered to mourn

353
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,740
 those that had been killed by the warring armies of Babylon.

354
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:14,460
 Babylon had come in just previous to this,

355
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,960
 had actually torn down the walls of Jerusalem,

356
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,940
 desecrated the temple, and murdered and killed

357
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:21,760
 many of the Jewish people.

358
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,320
 And the remnant of Jerusalem, the remnant of Israel,

359
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:28,480
 gathered at Rama, a small little town,

360
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,240
 just about five miles north of Jerusalem,

361
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:34,740
 and they gathered there to weep for the reality

362
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,060
 that so many of their families, their relatives,

363
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,400
 and the people that they knew had been killed.

364
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,320
 It was a place of great mourning, a place of great weeping.

365
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,480
 It was remembered in their history as that moment.

366
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:48,120
 Before the remnant is taken into exile,

367
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,780
 we met at Rama and we weeped.

368
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:55,200
 It's also known for a second thing.

369
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,700
 Rama is a very important place in the history of Israel,

370
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:02,140
 'cause Rama is the place where Saul was anointed

371
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,400
 the first king of Israel by Samuel,

372
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,940
 which is really fascinating, because Rama is honored

373
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,840
 and thought of in Jewish thinking

374
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,480
 as the birthplace of the kingdom,

375
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:15,800
 the birthplace of the line of kings

376
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,880
 who would eventually bring the Messiah

377
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,720
 through the Davidic dynasty.

378
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,480
 All of that began in Rama.

379
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,000
 So Rama is this incredibly interesting juxtaposition

380
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,560
 of weeping and worship, of a place of pain

381
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,460
 and hurt and turmoil, and a place of hope

382
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,720
 for the future coming of a king.

383
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,620
 Then Jeremiah mentions a person, Rachel.

384
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:42,360
 This is Rachel of the Genesis time.

385
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:47,360
 Rachel, sorry, put that there.

386
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,280
 In case it catches fire.

387
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,360
 This is Rachel.

388
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,920
 That would be really dramatic, wouldn't it?

389
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,080
 We're talking about death!

390
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,920
 (audience laughing)

391
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,880
 That's not planned.

392
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,000
 If that happens, run.

393
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:58,840
 Okay.

394
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:02,540
 So, no, don't run.

395
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,640
 All right, back on track, back on track.

396
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:09,200
 Okay, so Rachel is of the Genesis, Rachel,

397
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,360
 second wife to Jacob.

398
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,120
 Now, Rachel is an interesting character.

399
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,560
 Rachel is mentioned here because of Rachel's life.

400
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,100
 She actually died 1,000 years before Rama,

401
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,140
 before the events that took place at Rama.

402
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:23,520
 But Jeremiah brings her to those events

403
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,000
 for a very particular reason.

404
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,360
 Rachel's life was a difficult life.

405
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
 She was the second wife of Jacob,

406
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,160
 but because she was the second wife,

407
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,840
 she actually wasn't attributed to

408
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,200
 or given the same kind of privileges

409
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,560
 as his first wife, Leah,

410
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,320
 even though Jacob loved Rachel more.

411
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,360
 And when Jacob got married to Rachel,

412
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,800
 their great hope was that they would have many kids.

413
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,040
 Their great hope was that they would be

414
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,600
 a father and mother, many children through them.

415
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,360
 But Rachel was barren.

416
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,480
 Rachel didn't bring any children into the world

417
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,560
 for many, many years.

418
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:55,900
 And the whole time, Leah and her concubines

419
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,440
 were having lots of kids.

420
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,680
 You can imagine the indignity

421
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,080
 of what it would have been for Rachel

422
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,960
 to desire children, not be able to have children

423
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,880
 for many, many years,

424
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,080
 and watch all of the other women around her

425
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:08,460
 having children with her husband, Jacob.

426
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:10,520
 Well, towards the end of her life,

427
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,120
 she managed to conceive.

428
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,480
 She actually has two children.

429
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,560
 Joseph is her first, and her second is Benjamin.

430
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,800
 Now, she actually dies in childbirth,

431
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,560
 giving birth to Benjamin.

432
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,340
 She changes, in her last thing that she says,

433
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:29,580
 in her dying breath, she changes his name to Ben-Omni,

434
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,600
 which means the man of my sorrow.

435
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,720
 And why is Rachel sorrowful?

436
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,840
 Why is she weeping?

437
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,280
 Because she had great hopes

438
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,240
 that she would be able to bring into the world

439
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,240
 a lot of heirs for Jacob.

440
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,280
 She had great hopes that through her

441
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,920
 would come a great nation.

442
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:51,200
 And on her deathbed, as she's giving birth to Benjamin,

443
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,960
 as she dies, she's like, my lot has just been sorrow.

444
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,140
 But God has a way of taking the worst expectations

445
00:21:59,140 --> 00:22:01,880
 of our lives and doing something amazing through them.

446
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:04,080
 See, God has a way of stepping into

447
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,520
 what we think are our failures

448
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,340
 and doing something tremendous.

449
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:11,660
 Although Rachel would never see it.

450
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:15,680
 For the centuries after the birth of Joseph and Benjamin

451
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,680
 would come the 12 tribes of Israel.

452
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,840
 Joseph would father Ephraim and Manasseh,

453
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,800
 and they would go on to father the 10 tribes

454
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,700
 that would go up north eventually.

455
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,960
 Whereas Benjamin would father all of the sons

456
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
 that were related to the two tribes,

457
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,760
 the Benjamin and Judah, that remained itself.

458
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,240
 In other words, all 12 tribes of Israel

459
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,300
 came actually from Rachel.

460
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,840
 This is why she was known as the mother of Israel.

461
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,640
 This is why when Jeremiah speaks about the mourning

462
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:42,900
 that's happening in Ramah,

463
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,000
 speaks about the fact that the children of Israel

464
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
 had been slaughtered by the Babylonians,

465
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,240
 he brings Rachel into that picture,

466
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,560
 the mother of all Israel.

467
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,200
 And he's like, it's as if Rachel is mourning

468
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,840
 for the death of her children right here in Ramah,

469
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,000
 and nothing can comfort her.

470
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,600
 And when Matthew is thinking,

471
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,200
 what Old Testament prophetic verse can I bring forward

472
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,040
 to talk about what's happened in Bethlehem

473
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,240
 at the time of Jesus' birth?

474
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:11,040
 Oh, I know, it's Ramah again, it's Rachel again.

475
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:15,240
 It's as if even now in the first century in Bethlehem,

476
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,040
 it's like Rachel is mourning

477
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:20,280
 for the children of Israel once again.

478
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,040
 And why is she mourning?

479
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,680
 She's mourning for both personal reasons

480
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,360
 and national reasons.

481
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,480
 Personal reasons because there's been death

482
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,360
 within her family, national reasons

483
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,920
 because the line of David must have been broken now.

484
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,100
 If all of the children have been murdered,

485
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:40,600
 then surely the Messiah has been murdered, it's all over.

486
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,480
 And Matthew is trying to make the point,

487
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,080
 it's just like Ramah all over again.

488
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,040
 Can you feel it?

489
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,320
 Can you see it?

490
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,960
 He's like, do you feel Rachel's pain?

491
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,880
 Because here in Bethlehem,

492
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,840
 they think it's all over once again.

493
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:02,600
 Now, I know you came to a carol service to feel good,

494
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:08,240
 but I want you to know

495
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,560
 that the story of the darkness of Christmas

496
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,200
 is where you will find its light.

497
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:18,080
 If you really wanna know what Christmas is about,

498
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,360
 then you can't rush from the darkness

499
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,520
 and the pain of genocide.

500
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,300
 If you really wanna see the light of Christmas,

501
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:29,040
 if you really wanna know what the true joy of Christmas is,

502
00:24:29,040 --> 00:24:33,180
 it's actually found when you sit in the darkness for a bit.

503
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:36,240
 I love the way actually that N.T. Wright puts this

504
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,800
 when he writes of Christmas, he says it this way.

505
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,280
 He says, "Christmas is not a reminder

506
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:43,160
 "that the world is really quite a nice place.

507
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:46,960
 "It reminds us that the world is a shockingly bad place."

508
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,880
 Christmas is God lighting a candle,

509
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,020
 and you don't light a candle in a room

510
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:53,480
 that's already full of sunlight.

511
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,520
 And Matthew's trying to bring this painful moment

512
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,320
 of Israel's Old Testament history

513
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,660
 into this moment in the first century

514
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:02,160
 by sort of saying, hey, look,

515
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,200
 do you realise what happened here

516
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,800
 in the midst of the worst thing

517
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,460
 that we thought could happen to us?

518
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:10,800
 God lit a candle when it was so dark,

519
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,280
 when it was so broken,

520
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:16,440
 when even the children of our mothers were being slaughtered.

521
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,280
 That's the time when God came.

522
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,020
 That's the time when God showed up.

523
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:22,080
 You wanna know what kind of God it is that you serve?

524
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,320
 You wanna know what kind of God it is

525
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
 that is to be worshipped?

526
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,480
 It is one who does not shrink back from injustice,

527
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,780
 does not stand back from brokenness,

528
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:33,880
 but one who actually moves into darkness to transform it.

529
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,400
 That's your God,

530
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,360
 Matthew's saying in his story about the birth of Jesus.

531
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,160
 He's saying, if you wanna know joy,

532
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:47,760
 see joy come out of the midst of darkness.

533
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:52,900
 God left all of the comfort of heaven

534
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,320
 and joined the struggle on earth.

535
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:02,400
 God came to the backdrop of rejection,

536
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:06,080
 loneliness, jealousy, and murder.

537
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,660
 And that should set your heart on fire.

538
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,120
 'Cause that means God can come and show up

539
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,880
 in our city when we need it.

540
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,160
 It means that God can come and show up in your family

541
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,820
 when you need him to.

542
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,700
 It means that if God chose a dark, damp cave

543
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:24,380
 to bring his son into the world,

544
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,420
 he can choose the darkness of your heart.

545
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:29,420
 It means that he can move into the neighbourhoods

546
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,920
 where you need him to move into in your life.

547
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,300
 It means that he can find you right where you are,

548
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,980
 right here and right now.

549
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,700
 No matter how hard things are,

550
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,320
 no matter how broken it might be,

551
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:41,180
 no matter how difficult things might be for you,

552
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,980
 he can meet you in this moment

553
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,700
 and he can change and transform you

554
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,020
 and bring the joy of his life.

555
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:47,780
 That's what Christmas is all about.

556
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,900
 And you can't celebrate Christmas

557
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:54,360
 unless you see the light in the darkness.

558
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,620
 Are you with me, church?

559
00:26:55,620 --> 00:27:01,580
 Now, there's something quite profound here

560
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:04,600
 that goes beyond just what Matthew is doing

561
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:08,640
 and connecting a very painful time of Old Testament story

562
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:11,360
 to the painful time of Bethlehem's story.

563
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,020
 If you go back to Jeremiah 31,

564
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,160
 although Matthew only quotes verse 15,

565
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:23,320
 it's actually verses 16 and 17 of that passage

566
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,900
 that I think Matthew has in his heart for his people.

567
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:29,280
 I wanna read it to you from Jeremiah 31, verse 16 onwards.

568
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,600
 It says this, this is what the Lord says.

569
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,280
 "Restrain your voice from weeping

570
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,840
 "and your eyes from tears,

571
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,720
 "for your work will be rewarded, declares the Lord.

572
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,320
 "They," speaking of the children,

573
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,780
 "will return from the land of the enemy.

574
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:47,080
 "So there is hope for your future, declares the Lord.

575
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:50,120
 "Your children will return to their own land."

576
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,400
 Jeremiah prophesies and he says, "It's like Rama again.

577
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,680
 "It's like Rachel is weeping over the death of her children.

578
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,680
 "It's like we think that this is the end,

579
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,280
 "but guess what, with God, there is no end.

580
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,440
 "With God, there is always a new thing.

581
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,080
 "With God, there is always a light

582
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,380
 "breaking into the darkness.

583
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:08,660
 "Look, your children will return.

584
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,960
 "The exile is not the end of Israel."

585
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,480
 Basically, Jeremiah is prophesying.

586
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,840
 When you come out of exile, you'll come back to Jerusalem

587
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,040
 and you'll have generations going forward.

588
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,980
 The Davidic line is not broken.

589
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,720
 The Messiah is not dead.

590
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:26,040
 Jeremiah is saying, "There is a hope for your future."

591
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:28,720
 And Matthew goes, "That's what I wanna say to Bethlehem."

592
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,520
 And he grabs this passage, he applies it to Bethlehem.

593
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,440
 And he says, "This is the same for you too,

594
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,840
 "weeping mothers of Bethlehem.

595
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,360
 "You think this is your end.

596
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,280
 "You think the Messiah is done, but no, you just watch.

597
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,160
 "He's gonna return out of Egypt.

598
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,920
 "He's gonna live and teach and do miracles

599
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:44,960
 "and do all this stuff.

600
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,840
 "He's gonna go to the cross and pay for your sin.

601
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,120
 "He's gonna rise again into new life.

602
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,200
 "It's all gonna happen.

603
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,120
 "There is hope for your future," he's saying to his people.

604
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,360
 You wanna know what Christmas is about?

605
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,200
 That's what Christmas is about,

606
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,640
 that there is hope for your future.

607
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,920
 And then just like Jeremiah to his people,

608
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,240
 Matthew to his people,

609
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,000
 I wanna do this to my people and say over you,

610
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,080
 "This is not the end.

611
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,980
 "Whatever is going on in your life right now,

612
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,880
 "whatever hardship you might be suffering,

613
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,460
 "whatever thing might be taking place, it is not the end.

614
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,780
 "God has not forgotten you.

615
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,000
 "God has not given up on you.

616
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,040
 "He is the light in your darkness.

617
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,840
 "He is the one born into atrocity

618
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,760
 "and adversity.

619
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,200
 "He is the one who flourishes the most

620
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,320
 "when things are difficult.

621
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,080
 "He's the one who shines a light

622
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,320
 "and you don't need a light

623
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,040
 "when the room is full of sunlight,

624
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,600
 "but when you're feeling down,

625
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,720
 "when you're struggling,

626
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,080
 "when things are overwhelming, that's Christmas."

627
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,880
 That's a good story for us now.

628
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:49,280
 And there's this amazing thing that it says here in Jeremiah.

629
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,920
 He says this, he says, "Restrain your voice from weeping."

630
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,520
 Now on the surface, it sounds like he's saying,

631
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,120
 "Oh, just stop weeping."

632
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,960
 Like, why are you weeping?

633
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,280
 You shouldn't weep.

634
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,200
 It's not what it's saying, okay?

635
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,680
 In the Hebrew, the word restrain there

636
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,640
 is actually the word that is better translated

637
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,280
 to be like retrain or reframe.

638
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,480
 In other words, change your voice.

639
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,800
 In other words, there is a season and a moment

640
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,960
 and a time where it's right to weep.

641
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,680
 It was right for Rachel to weep over Rama.

642
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,880
 It was right for the mothers of Bethlehem

643
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,720
 to weep over the loss of their children.

644
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,140
 It's not like God was showing up and saying,

645
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,200
 "Ah, just get over it.

646
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,600
 "It's not a big deal," right?

647
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:29,560
 This was a painful tragedy and Matthew sits in it.

648
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:30,680
 God sits in it.

649
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,500
 That's fine.

650
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,320
 But what he's also saying is this,

651
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,840
 "When you know that the Messiah is with you,

652
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,380
 "it gives you the chance.

653
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:41,220
 "It makes you in a time where you can now retrain your voice,

654
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:44,580
 "reframe your voice so that you're not just weeping,

655
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,480
 "but you're also rejoicing."

656
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,160
 So you're not just crying out for injustice,

657
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,000
 but you're also speaking up for freedom.

658
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,740
 So you're not just walking in the darkness,

659
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,020
 but you're also singing about a light that has come.

660
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:00,000
 "Refrain your voice.

661
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,980
 "Take your voice and make it sound something.

662
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:05,400
 "Align yourself to the light of Christ.

663
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,660
 "Find the joy of Christmas welling up inside of you

664
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,320
 "and sing as loud as you can,

665
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,100
 "because even though the times are dark,

666
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,780
 "we will declare that he will return,

667
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:20,980
 "that he is coming back."

668
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:23,340
 See, there is joy,

669
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:28,060
 even in the midst of the hardest and darkest of shadows.

670
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:32,320
 It blows my mind to think that the one boy

671
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,760
 that escaped the clutches of Herod

672
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,680
 is the only boy that can comfort Rachel.

673
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,740
 He's the only person who can comfort you.

674
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:46,040
 He's the only one who can birth that joy inside you.

675
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,620
 That really is the message of Christmas.

676
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:53,380
 He's the only one that can retrain and reframe your voice

677
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,980
 so that you're not just wailing and weeping,

678
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:58,380
 but you're also rejoicing.

679
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,540
 I love that carol, "O Come, O Come, Emmanuel,"

680
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:04,380
 'cause it doesn't shy from Satan's tyranny.

681
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,820
 It doesn't shy from the reality of sin.

682
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,700
 That carol doesn't shy from the darkness of death

683
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,180
 or even from the reality of hell.

684
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,540
 And yet at the end of each of those dark verses comes,

685
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:19,140
 "Rejoice, rejoice."

686
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,860
 In other words, retrain, reframe your voice

687
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:26,060
 so that you might actually speak of the beauty

688
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,060
 that is found in a light that comes in darkness.

689
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:33,340
 May you rise up at Christmastime.

690
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,300
 May you not shy away from the realities

691
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:37,780
 of the hardness of life and the brokenness of this world,

692
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,020
 but may it not get you down.

693
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,540
 May instead you find the joy

694
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,740
 that is only able to be in you

695
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,100
 because Christ has come.

696
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,540
 That's Christmas.

697
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,040
 That's the promise of better days.

698
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,300
 That's why we spent four weeks

699
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,140
 taking a look at the Old Testament,

700
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,780
 because I want you to feel and know and see

701
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,680
 the beauty of that first Christmas

702
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:05,420
 so that your rejoicing finds its profundity,

703
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:06,560
 even in your pain.

704
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,820
 Can we rejoice?

705
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,800
 Would you stand with me?

706
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,860
 I wanna pray for you.

707
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:14,440
 (gentle music)

708
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,460
 Maybe you'd open your hands as we pray.

709
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,100
 Father, I thank you so much

710
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,580
 for the men and women in this room,

711
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,940
 for those online watching right now.

712
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:25,660
 Father, I thank you so much for the power

713
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:29,380
 that there is in your story of birth.

714
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,500
 Thank you, Lord, that Matthew didn't shy,

715
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:35,220
 didn't try to sweep an atrocity under its rug

716
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,340
 and pretend it didn't happen.

717
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,940
 I'm grateful that he dipped into some painful moments

718
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,060
 of the Old Testament.

719
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,640
 Showed us a woman who died thinking

720
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,340
 that her life had come to nothing,

721
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,100
 who you would then over centuries

722
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:55,100
 turn into the greatest of all people, your people.

723
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,500
 And Lord, I thank you that the stories

724
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,860
 of the people in this room,

725
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,760
 though some of them may be quite dark,

726
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:10,300
 though some in this room may be carrying considerable pain,

727
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,100
 hardship, hurt, while each one of us

728
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,740
 understands the darkness of sin

729
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:19,380
 and the struggles that we can find ourselves in,

730
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,640
 we will rejoice.

731
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:25,740
 We will find joy rising up in us.

732
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,540
 And we know that as we exclaim your joy,

733
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,380
 even in the brokenness we're struggling with,

734
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:35,100
 that that is the message of Christmas.

735
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:39,780
 Christ, come, Emmanuel, God with us.

736
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,540
 Lord, I pray over each person here

737
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:44,380
 that as they celebrate Christmas this year,

738
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:47,580
 they would do so reframing and retraining their voice

739
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:50,100
 to be able to give you glory

740
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,600
 no matter what is happening for them in this time.

741
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:56,480
 Lord, we worship you.

742
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,260
 We honour you.

743
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,540
 We love you so much.

744
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,540
 We have so much to sing about,

745
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,420
 so much to be joyful about.

746
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:07,780
 We thank you that you're doing that here,

747
00:35:07,780 --> 00:35:11,180
 right here, by your Spirit in this moment.

748
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:15,160
 Rejoice, rejoice.

749
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:20,380
 May your heart be afire for Christ.
