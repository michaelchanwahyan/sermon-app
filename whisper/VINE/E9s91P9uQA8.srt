1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,560
 So Jesus, as your rivers of gold flow through, Father, we surrender everything to you, as

2
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:13,720
 Susanna was saying just now, as we've been worshipping, as we've been praying, as we've

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:17,340
 been singing.

4
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:21,280
 The good things, Lord, we give you praise and thanks for and say, Lord, you are worthy

5
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:23,120
 of all our praises.

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:29,600
 Thank you for being the great and powerful God that we've been singing about.

7
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:35,520
 The name above all names, the one and true God.

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,360
 And for the broken things, Lord, as we continue to hand them to you and knowing that you can

9
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:48,440
 do the impossible, that things that are broken and final, Lord, you have the final say and

10
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,560
 you have the final word.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:58,160
 And ashes can turn into beauty and dead things can come to life, that bones can become flesh

12
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,420
 when you speak your word, when you're at work, Lord.

13
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,120
 And so we just pray that you will be the one, your love, your kindness, your goodness, your

14
00:01:06,120 --> 00:01:10,960
 power will be what holds everything together.

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,400
 And the way we embrace that is by fully surrendering to you, Jesus.

16
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,900
 So we do say, Lord, we surrender.

17
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:26,120
 We surrender this time, we surrender our worship, we surrender everything we have about ourselves

18
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:29,080
 so that we can have you, Jesus.

19
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:34,960
 So that we can, yeah, so that you can work in our lives, Holy Spirit.

20
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,720
 So Lord, we praise you and we thank you.

21
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,680
 Continue to be with us as we continue this worship service through the word and throughout

22
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,720
 our week later, Lord, may you continue to be fully glorified in all that we do.

23
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,600
 We surrender to you, Lord, in all that we do.

24
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,640
 In Jesus' name we pray.

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,640
 Amen.

26
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,320
 Thank you, worship team.

27
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,320
 Thank you, church.

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,320
 Please take a seat.

29
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,320
 Welcome.

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,320
 Good morning.

31
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,960
 If you're in the overflow, big welcome to you as well.

32
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,280
 If you're watching online, hello.

33
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,680
 If you have a seat next to you, I encourage you to maybe scooch up a little bit so we

34
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,680
 can free up some seats.

35
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,600
 There's some people standing in the back.

36
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:14,240
 There's some people in the overflow that would love to come sit down.

37
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:18,560
 So if you have a seat next to you, it's time to release that so that people can come and

38
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,560
 sit next to you.

39
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:24,240
 There's a few down here, so our hosts will come and try and fill up our seats as well.

40
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:29,000
 As always, good and honored to be here with everybody to bring God's word.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
 I'm a Hong Kong boy.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
 I grew up here in Hong Kong.

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
 How many of you guys grew up here in Hong Kong?

44
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,360
 Did you get a wave of hands?

45
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
 Okay.

46
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,360
 A lot of us.

47
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
 Really cool.

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,360
 Okay.

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,200
 So I think you can agree, a really fun and exciting place to grow up as a kid.

50
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,640
 One of my favorite pastimes, maybe you resonate with this too, was to go to the video games

51
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,160
 arcades that used to be everywhere.

52
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,160
 Right?

53
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,160
 [inaudible 00:01:50]

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,160
 Right?

55
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,720
 That was one of my favorite things to do back in the day.

56
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,720
 Right?

57
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,160
 Before home consoles were popular, before we had mobile phones with all kinds of games

58
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,840
 on them, the arcade was the place to hang out.

59
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:02,840
 Right?

60
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,840
 If you wanted to play video games, you wanted to spend time with your friends, you would

61
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,640
 go to the arcades.

62
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,640
 And they would be everywhere.

63
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,720
 There used to be so many arcades.

64
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,720
 Right?

65
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,400
 Street Fighter, Final Fight, Initial D, Dance Dance Revolution.

66
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,800
 You look like an idiot trying to step on all those arrows.

67
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,800
 It was so much fun.

68
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:19,800
 Beatmania.

69
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,800
 Right?

70
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,160
 You would go to the arcades and DJ and make music and stuff like that.

71
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:25,160
 So much fun.

72
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,160
 Right?

73
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
 After school, you take your lunch money.

74
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,040
 You're supposed to buy lunch with it, but you didn't.

75
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,040
 Right?

76
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,440
 So you go to the arcade, you go up to the counter, you change your money for the one

77
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,640
 dollar coins, and that was your afternoon sorted.

78
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,640
 Right?

79
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,200
 The best extracurricular activity you could do.

80
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,200
 Okay?

81
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,160
 However, there was a problem.

82
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
 Right?

83
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,240
 Because these arcades actually had an age requirement.

84
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,760
 And so technically, technically you had to be 16 year old to go in and play these games.

85
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:53,760
 Right?

86
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,320
 So, you know, let's travel back in time.

87
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,320
 Imagine it's 1996.

88
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,320
 Okay?

89
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,320
 12 year old Ellison.

90
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,840
 I'm just into secondary school.

91
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,880
 I'm like 4'5" at the time.

92
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,880
 Okay?

93
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,360
 Trying to pass as a 16 year old.

94
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,360
 Okay?

95
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,360
 You can judge for yourself.

96
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,280
 This is a picture of me at 12 years old.

97
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,280
 Okay?

98
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,280
 Right.

99
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,480
 I look about 9, probably.

100
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,480
 Okay?

101
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,480
 And I know it's paid off now.

102
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,480
 Okay?

103
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,480
 I still look young.

104
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
 I still don't raisin.

105
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,480
 Right?

106
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,480
 That's what they say.

107
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,480
 But back then it was ultra frustrating.

108
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,480
 Right?

109
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,880
 Because I would walk into the arcade and the manager would take one look at me and say,

110
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,160
 "There is no way this little boy is 16 years old.

111
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,160
 Right?

112
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
 You need to get out."

113
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,160
 Right?

114
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:32,160
 So desperately I tried to make myself look older.

115
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,160
 Right?

116
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,160
 I would try to put on glasses.

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,160
 Right?

118
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,160
 Put on spectacles to make myself look more mature.

119
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,160
 Right?

120
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
 That never worked.

121
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,560
 You know, put on certain clothes to make myself look older.

122
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,560
 That never worked.

123
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,080
 Or a walk-in weary confident.

124
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,320
 That never worked until I found one way around this.

125
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,360
 I discovered fake IDs.

126
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,360
 Okay?

127
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,880
 Now, I'm not proud of this.

128
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:53,880
 Okay?

129
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,160
 But desperate times call for stupid decisions.

130
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
 Okay?

131
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:01,320
 So I thought if I had a fake ID, it wouldn't matter how I looked.

132
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,360
 I could just show the ID and I would be, you know, playing games all through my afternoon.

133
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,360
 Right?

134
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,480
 The more idiotic part of this plan, I had no idea how to get a fake ID.

135
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
 Okay?

136
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:15,360
 I mean, my dad's a policeman, you know, so it was like, it was a really big problem for

137
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,360
 me.

138
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,360
 Okay?

139
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,440
 So I decided to make it myself.

140
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,440
 All right?

141
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,760
 I had it so I wish I could show you a picture of it.

142
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,200
 It was like red with like lightning bolts in the background.

143
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,200
 Okay?

144
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,200
 I used Microsoft Word.

145
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
 Okay?

146
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,640
 Amazing Word art, graphics, all that kind of stuff.

147
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,640
 And I became Jarvis.

148
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
 I don't know why I chose the name Jarvis.

149
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,640
 Okay?

150
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,240
 Jarvis Lee, 16 years old.

151
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,240
 Okay?

152
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,360
 Attending Washington Heights International School.

153
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
 Okay?

154
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,360
 It was just completely made up.

155
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,160
 I thought it was legit, like laminated and everything.

156
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:45,160
 Right?

157
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,120
 And to my surprise, it would sometimes work.

158
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,000
 Only if the lady behind the, you know, the arcade manager was an old Chinese lady who

159
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,120
 didn't read any English.

160
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,120
 Okay?

161
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,000
 That was the only situation it would work.

162
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:03,240
 You know, but as I was reflecting on my childhood and reflecting on this passage, some of these

163
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,800
 things made me think about some questions that I had.

164
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,760
 Because so often in life, right, we judge things.

165
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,760
 We have to judge things.

166
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:16,100
 We often judge things based upon the way it looks.

167
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:20,080
 And often this leads to us having a fear of other people's judgment.

168
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,080
 Right?

169
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:25,880
 And because of other people's judgment, what we think they might think about us, we want

170
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,240
 to change the way we are.

171
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,880
 Or maybe I'll ask it this way.

172
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:35,760
 Have you ever wished you could be, or you were, or you look like someone else because

173
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,840
 of what other people's expectations of you were?

174
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,960
 Right?

175
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:45,200
 We were in week two of our sermon series and we're starting 2025 Strong Together.

176
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,440
 And we're looking at these passages in the book of 1 Samuel.

177
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,520
 And we're discovering, right, we want to see how we can begin well.

178
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,880
 But we're shifting our focus from intimacy last year into action.

179
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,520
 And we recall, you know, last year Andrew talked about us not letting the things of

180
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,680
 the past, right, these emotional barriers of hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and

181
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,440
 failure hold us back because these things often stop us from moving forward to where

182
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,920
 God wants us to go.

183
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,360
 And so today I want to talk to us about our choices.

184
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,520
 And this is an important step to take because we've moved, right, we've been moved and motivated

185
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,520
 into action.

186
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,520
 Right?

187
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,520
 That's the whole point.

188
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:29,580
 Together as a body of Christ we hear God calling us into action.

189
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:34,800
 But in order to act well, we have to choose well.

190
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,240
 But this is the issue, right, we very much make choices based on outward appearances.

191
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,400
 Right?

192
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,220
 From like fruit at the wet market to the people we meet every day, we are constantly making

193
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,080
 judgments based upon the way things look and then based upon our judgment of them we'll

194
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,320
 make certain choices.

195
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:57,960
 There's academic studies done about this, right, we'll tell you that no matter how much

196
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,960
 we embrace, you know, the mantra of don't judge a book by its cover, the truth is we

197
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,600
 go about our daily lives responding to a lot of people based upon their physical appearance.

198
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,920
 And the sad truth is that if you're deemed to be more attractive, you're often treated

199
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,960
 more favorably or so I've been told.

200
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
 I don't know, maybe you can ask Nathan.

201
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
 Is that true?

202
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,400
 Yeah?

203
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,480
 Going around as a handsome man?

204
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:25,280
 We're going to look at the passage today, right, and as we continue tracing Samuel's

205
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,540
 journey, my prayer is that it would challenge us to shift our perspective, right, to open

206
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:36,720
 up our eyes to the fact that if we are truly to follow God with our lives, we have to see

207
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,000
 things from his perspective.

208
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,640
 And we must learn to embrace the things that he values so we can live the lives and make

209
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,120
 the choices that God wants us to make.

210
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,880
 Because at the end of the day, that is our goal, right, as followers of Jesus.

211
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,880
 That is where we find our significance.

212
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,960
 That's where we find our meaning in lives.

213
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:02,620
 That's where we want to put our efforts into beginning and acting not with our agenda,

214
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:05,060
 but with God's heart for us.

215
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,340
 And true significance, true action is going to come when you discover and embrace God's

216
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,660
 direction for you.

217
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:18,240
 So we're going to go to scripture, 1 Samuel 16, 2 to 13, and we're going to pick up from

218
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,740
 where Andrew left off last week.

219
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,540
 I'm going to read, it's a longish passage, so bear with me.

220
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,540
 You can read together and let's see what God says.

221
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,580
 "But Samuel said, 'How can I go if...'"

222
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,420
 Sorry, let me start again.

223
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,820
 "But Samuel said, 'How can I go?

224
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,660
 If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.'

225
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:41,620
 The Lord said, 'Take a shepherd with you and say, 'I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.

226
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:45,620
 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show you what to do.

227
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:49,340
 You are to anoint for me the one I indicate.'

228
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,260
 Samuel did what the Lord said.

229
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:54,860
 When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town trembled when they met him.

230
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,660
 They asked, 'Do you come in peace?'

231
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:02,740
 Samuel said, 'Yes, in peace I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.

232
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,460
 Consecrate yourselves and come to the sacrifice with me.'

233
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,200
 Then he consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.

234
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:16,200
 When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, 'Surely the Lord's anointed stands here before

235
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,200
 the Lord.'

236
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,940
 But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Listen, do not consider his appearance or his sight, for

237
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,740
 I have rejected him.

238
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,740
 The Lord does not look at the things people look at.

239
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,900
 People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.'

240
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:35,460
 Then Jesse called Adimadab and had him pass in front of Samuel.

241
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:38,800
 But Samuel said, 'The Lord has not chosen this one either.'

242
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,180
 Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, 'Nor has the Lord chosen this one.'

243
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:48,780
 Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, 'The Lord has not

244
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,100
 chosen these.'

245
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:52,980
 So he asked Jesse, 'Are these all the sons that you have?'

246
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:55,540
 'They are still the youngest,' Jesse answered.

247
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,700
 'He is tending the sheep.'

248
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,160
 Samuel said, 'Send for him.

249
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,740
 We will not sit down until he arrives.'

250
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,900
 So he sent for him and had him brought in.

251
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,620
 He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features.

252
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,380
 Then the Lord said, 'Rise and anoint him.

253
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,340
 This is the one.'

254
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:18,700
 So Samuel took the horn of oil, as he did last we remember with Saul, and anointed him

255
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,620
 in the presence of his brothers.

256
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:25,260
 From that day on, the Spirit of the Lord had come powerfully upon David.

257
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:28,580
 Samuel then went on to Ramah.

258
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,620
 So a quick recap of the story so far.

259
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,220
 Israel had had the first taste of what it's like to have a king rule over them.

260
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:40,900
 And with Saul as a king, what started off as a good thing, has very quickly turned sour,

261
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,140
 just as God had warned them that it would.

262
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:49,620
 And ultimately, Saul disobeys God, he makes some really, really silly, really bad choices,

263
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,500
 and as a consequence, he is rejected as the king of Israel.

264
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:58,140
 But I think to get an even fuller picture of what's happening, we need to go even further

265
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,520
 back.

266
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:03,900
 Because the whole reason the Israelites wanted a king in the first place was because they

267
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,420
 too had made a pretty bad choice.

268
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:10,940
 A new nation, a new group of people emerging out of slavery into the Promised Land, they'd

269
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,260
 been wandering in the wilderness, they looked around them and they saw that every single

270
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:19,900
 other country, all the other people around them, had a physical king, an actual dude

271
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,580
 that they could look to, a person they could see to lead them.

272
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:28,380
 And so they started to think, "Well, we actually, we want to be just like them."

273
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:31,980
 In fact, the very words of the people were, "We want a king over us.

274
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,420
 Then we will be like all the other nations with a king to lead us, to go out before us,

275
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,980
 and to fight our battles."

276
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,380
 And we mentioned this last week a little bit as well, but I want to revisit it because

277
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:48,020
 this baffles me every time I read it.

278
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:53,940
 Just to think, after all that God had brought them through, out of slavery, into the wilderness,

279
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:59,780
 looking after them with food and miraculously, like manna and quail and water gushing from

280
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:04,820
 the rock, parting the Red Sea, bringing down the walls of Jericho, countless miraculous

281
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,580
 victories over their enemies.

282
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:11,780
 Time after time after time, God proving his faithfulness to them, and time and time again,

283
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:16,580
 God proving to them that he is the greatest, the strongest, more powerful than any human

284
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:20,420
 king or any other God could ever be.

285
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:25,420
 And yet, Israel said they would rather have a human king rule over them other than God.

286
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,940
 They had forgotten their role as the chosen people, as the ones who had been set apart

287
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,940
 by God.

288
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:38,420
 I mean, just think, if Samuel felt rejected, how do you think God felt in that moment?

289
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:44,620
 The Israelites made a terrible choice because they forgot their first love.

290
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:48,940
 They forgot who it was that had given them everything they had, and instead they wanted

291
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:54,300
 to conform and become like everyone else.

292
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,860
 But how about us, church?

293
00:13:56,860 --> 00:14:02,020
 When we look back at our own lives, and as we point through and as we recall all the

294
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,100
 things God has guided us through, maybe some of us in this room were once enslaved to sin,

295
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,860
 but God has set you free from that.

296
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,540
 Maybe once we were in a season of wilderness, wondering where to go, now God has led us

297
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,140
 to a promised land.

298
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:21,340
 Maybe God has helped you overcome and defeat enemies that you thought would destroy you.

299
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:26,380
 But now that things are good, perhaps we've been looking around and thinking to ourselves,

300
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:30,140
 "Actually, you know, maybe there actually is a better way.

301
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,660
 A lot of people around me don't follow God.

302
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,820
 A lot of people around me aren't about Jesus.

303
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:38,220
 Maybe it would be better to be like everyone else."

304
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,540
 It seems like sometimes when we look at people and the way they live their lives, we don't

305
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,060
 know God, they have more freedom.

306
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:46,540
 They can just do whatever they want to do.

307
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:48,960
 Maybe that's the way to live.

308
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,740
 Or maybe you're suddenly feeling a bit self-conscious about your relationship with Jesus, and because

309
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:58,780
 it's a bit different, you're starting to feel a bit weird and feel like you stand out a

310
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,900
 little bit.

311
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:04,220
 And so you try to fit in and you want to conform and look like everyone else rather than representing

312
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:07,620
 Jesus with how you live your life.

313
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:11,740
 And I feel like as we do this, if we make these sort of choices, God's heart is grieved

314
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:16,940
 when he sees his children walk away from him in this way.

315
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:22,420
 Let me be a reminder for us this morning, I'm preaching to myself as well, church, okay?

316
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,340
 Stay faithful to God.

317
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:28,020
 There is no other way.

318
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:34,420
 The best choice you can make in your life is to keep being obedient to Jesus.

319
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:41,340
 Now, this might be the best choice, but as we've probably discovered, it's not going

320
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:43,760
 to be easy.

321
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,860
 And I think there's one big barrier that holds us back from starting off this journey, from

322
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:54,060
 making this choice to being obedient to Jesus, holding us back from faithfulness.

323
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,980
 And this is the fear, the question of what if.

324
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:04,580
 It's the fear of what if that actually initially holds Samuel back when God tells him to go

325
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:09,020
 and anoint one of Jesse's sons to be the new king of Israel.

326
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,020
 Listen to it again.

327
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,860
 He says, "How can I go if?"

328
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:12,860
 What if?

329
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:17,060
 If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.

330
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:19,220
 If Saul hears about it, he will kill me.

331
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,220
 And you know what?

332
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:23,700
 He had some legitimate grounds for his fears.

333
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,180
 Saul had just been told, and the Bible tells us he had just been removed as king, so he's

334
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,820
 very conscious of what's happening with his role.

335
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,820
 He's angry.

336
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:33,940
 He's emotional.

337
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:37,340
 He's the kind of guy that's very capable of taking someone's life.

338
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,160
 Actually, the whole nation is afraid.

339
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,900
 When Samuel comes to the elders of the village, they say even they're trembling about what's

340
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,220
 going to happen next.

341
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:52,020
 And we can apply this to our own lives too.

342
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,100
 But when God charges us with something, when God tells you to do something, maybe it's

343
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,140
 something a bit challenging.

344
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:59,260
 Maybe it's something a bit tough.

345
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:03,540
 Maybe it's going to take a little bit of courage, a little bit of a risk.

346
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:06,820
 But how do we respond?

347
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:12,280
 I know often in life, my own answer to this starts with a what if.

348
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:15,740
 I'm not sure, you know, in the church, if you relate to that.

349
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:19,940
 I wonder how many of us are stuck in this what if, and I wonder how many of these what

350
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:25,580
 ifs hold us back from what God really wants to do through us.

351
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:30,420
 I wonder how many of us are letting our what ifs stop us making the right choice to be

352
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:33,380
 obedient to God.

353
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:40,080
 Because listen, if we focus on what ifs, the list could go on forever.

354
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:46,200
 There is always going to be the question of what if whenever God asks us to do something.

355
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,840
 This is what Moses struggled with, when God told him to go back into Israel, to free your

356
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,520
 people, let the people go.

357
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,400
 What if was one of the first things Moses responded.

358
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,440
 What if they don't believe me?

359
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,400
 What if the Pharaoh, you know, I'm not a good speaker.

360
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,680
 What if, what if, what if?

361
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,440
 What if I never find anyone else ever again?

362
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,480
 What if I fail?

363
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,680
 What if people make fun of me?

364
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,760
 What if I get rejected?

365
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,840
 What if it doesn't work out?

366
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,760
 These echo the five emotional barriers that Andrew talked about last week, right?

367
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:23,320
 The hurt, disappointment, regret, shame, and failure, all can be rooted in the what ifs.

368
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:28,600
 And if we just focus on what ifs, it will spiral us down into a deep, dark pit that's

369
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,280
 very, very difficult to climb out of.

370
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:36,140
 I know in my own life, one of the biggest what ifs came when we were deciding to start

371
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,760
 a family and have children.

372
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:41,280
 All right, let me explain a little bit what I mean by that.

373
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:44,080
 When I was born, I was born with a genetic condition, right?

374
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:48,000
 It was an unexpected thing, and no one else in my family has it.

375
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,320
 And it's one of these things that progresses over time, right?

376
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,600
 And it progressively can get worse.

377
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,400
 It's actually very, it's a bit unusual.

378
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:59,000
 You never really know how it's going to turn out, but it does progress over time as you

379
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,920
 get older.

380
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:05,160
 And one of the things is that it's a 50/50 chance whether or not you pass it down to

381
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,600
 your kids.

382
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,960
 And so as we were deciding about having kids, you know, we were fostering, do we adopt,

383
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:14,000
 do we have our own biological children, right?

384
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,640
 What if was a huge question, right?

385
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:23,520
 And we asked ourselves, I asked myself, what if our kids inherit my disorder?

386
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,640
 What's life going to look like for them, right?

387
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:29,720
 What if they have to suffer through all the turmoil, the emotions, everything that I had

388
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
 to go through?

389
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,560
 The last thing I would want them to go through is what I went through myself, right?

390
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:40,320
 What if it affects them in ways that we can't even see coming right now?

391
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:47,000
 Now, just to be real, right, my wife and I, we have two children, two boys, and both our

392
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,520
 boys have indeed ended up inheriting my genetic condition.

393
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:57,720
 In other words, my, our, what if became a reality.

394
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,560
 Like the thing I feared most became a reality in our lives.

395
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,840
 But you know what we came to realize in this process?

396
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,640
 What we realized in this process is that, and what I, as I was looking at this passage

397
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,480
 and reflecting, is that our God isn't a God of what ifs.

398
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,240
 Our God is a God of even if.

399
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,040
 Amen?

400
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,480
 And as Brittany and I reflected back on this journey, she was really the one who reminded

401
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:29,800
 me that actually God never promised that everything would be okay.

402
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:35,800
 Right, God never promised that our boys would be born without this genetic disorder.

403
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:39,400
 Even though that's what we fasted and prayed for, this is, we would gather people around

404
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,520
 and we prayed and we prayed and we prayed.

405
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,000
 And Brittany reminded me that we realized that the only promise that God gave was that

406
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:53,960
 he would be with us even if.

407
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:59,720
 And what we have now is beautiful and it's exhausting, but my family is a choice that

408
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,400
 I would make over and over and over and over again.

409
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:10,560
 Now, just to keep it real with you too, do I still hope and pray things could be different?

410
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:11,560
 Yes.

411
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:16,040
 Are we constantly praying for healing over myself and my sons?

412
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,040
 Of course.

413
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,040
 Every single night, that's my prayer for them.

414
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:25,800
 But even if, even if God doesn't answer those prayers, I'm going to give thanks for the

415
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:31,200
 beautiful gift that he has given us in our family and in our children.

416
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:37,320
 Listen church, don't let your what ifs hold you back.

417
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,560
 This is what Daniel and his friends were facing in the fiery furnace, right?

418
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:46,280
 And they decided that even if they were going to be burned alive, they would stay faithful

419
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:48,080
 to God.

420
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,320
 I have no clue what you guys are going through.

421
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:57,360
 I've sat and been with you and sat with you through some of us in this room today.

422
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:02,200
 And I know some of us here are going through unimaginable things right now.

423
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:09,680
 But what I do know is this, even if the worst case scenario in your mind comes true, even

424
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:16,840
 if then God is with you and if we are faithful and obedient to God, he assures that he will

425
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:21,080
 never leave us or forsake us.

426
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,280
 And this is what Samuel does, right?

427
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,080
 He responds in obedience, even if he had the potential for him to be, to end up dead.

428
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,960
 Scripture tells us Samuel did what the Lord said.

429
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:39,140
 Church, will this be our response?

430
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:45,440
 Even if it's the hard thing to do, are we willing to do what the Lord says?

431
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,520
 Because if we're going to embrace this year as a year of action, it means that the Lord

432
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:52,200
 is going to call us to do something.

433
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,560
 And more often than not, it's going to be challenging, right?

434
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:59,560
 The things that God calls us to do are not going to make sense from a worldly perspective.

435
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:05,240
 It's going to take an even if mindset for us to go forward in these things, right?

436
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:09,480
 What if Jesus tells you to give your money away to this or to that, would you be willing

437
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,920
 to do it?

438
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:14,560
 What if the Holy Spirit impresses on you that you need to forgive that person who has hurt

439
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:18,280
 you so profoundly, would you be willing?

440
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:21,320
 What if God says you need to go and share the gospel with that colleague that you've

441
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:26,280
 been sitting next to for three years that you've never talked to about Jesus, would

442
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,040
 you be willing to do it?

443
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:36,600
 Samuel's about to discover that God does things in his own and amazing ways.

444
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:43,720
 And he obeys God and God sends him to Jesse's house because he has a task to anoint one

445
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:49,040
 of his sons as the next king of Israel.

446
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,400
 And so Samuel arrives, let's go back to the story.

447
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:58,400
 When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab and thought, "Surely the Lord's anointed here stands before

448
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
 the Lord."

449
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:04,200
 But let me remind us again, "The Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not consider his appearance

450
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,800
 or his height, for I have rejected him.'

451
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,920
 The Lord does not look at the things people look at.

452
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,560
 People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.'

453
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:18,200
 Then Jesse called Edim-ed-dab and had him pass in front of Samuel.

454
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,720
 And Samuel said, 'The Lord has not chosen any of these sons.

455
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,040
 The Lord didn't choose any of his seven sons.'

456
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:29,280
 So Jesse asked, 'Are these all the sons that you have?'"

457
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,880
 So in my mind when I read this passage, it was like a scene out of America's Next Top

458
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,880
 Model.

459
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,640
 Two beautiful models stand before me, but only one can become America's Next Top Model.

460
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,840
 I do a pretty good Tyra Banks impression.

461
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:45,520
 Anyway, that's for another time.

462
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,440
 So big brother Eliab stands up.

463
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:52,600
 He is tall, he is handsome, he's the man.

464
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,600
 This is the very reason Samuel thought Eliab was the man, because Saul had very similar

465
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
 features, we find out.

466
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:03,360
 Saul was also tall and handsome.

467
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,240
 One Samuel chapter 9 tells us that Saul was tall and handsome, a handsome young man, as

468
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,880
 tall, a head above everybody else.

469
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:16,000
 And Samuel is so impressed by what he sees in this beautiful specimen of a person.

470
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,200
 And he says, "Surely, surely this has got to be it.

471
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,080
 What I'm looking at, he's so handsome, he's so tall, he's so beautiful.

472
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,160
 It couldn't possibly be anyone else."

473
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:30,960
 But God had other plans.

474
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,600
 And maybe this has been you.

475
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:36,340
 Maybe you've seen something and it looks good.

476
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,560
 It makes you feel good.

477
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,060
 It's attractive, it's desirable.

478
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:44,200
 And because it looks so good, you've come to the decision that surely this is what God

479
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,720
 wants for me.

480
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,560
 Or this relationship, it feels so good.

481
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,960
 Surely this is the right person for me.

482
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:55,200
 This boy I met is so handsome, he has to be it.

483
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,680
 This girl I met is so pretty, or surely she's the one for me.

484
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:02,000
 This job, it pays so well, I get to work in Central.

485
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:07,000
 This must be the right place for me to do my work.

486
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,640
 Listen, just because it looks good doesn't mean it is good.

487
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:18,160
 And there are so many things that look good and we think will be good for us, but it is

488
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:22,440
 not what God wants for our lives.

489
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,560
 My son Isaiah could eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner, ice cream, every single meal,

490
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,760
 but obviously that's not good for him.

491
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:34,280
 God challenges Samuel, change your perspective.

492
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,920
 Don't look at the things other people look at.

493
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:40,720
 Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him.

494
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,800
 For a short guy like me, that's music to my ears, right?

495
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,140
 Always overlooked because of being short.

496
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,360
 But listen seriously how God speaks, right?

497
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,240
 This is strong language.

498
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,160
 Do not consider.

499
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,960
 In other words, God says don't even think about it.

500
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:00,480
 Don't let what you can see with your eyes make your decision for you.

501
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,040
 He might be big, he might be tall, he might be handsome.

502
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:06,680
 In the world's opinion, he looks the part.

503
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:12,560
 He might look exactly what you have in mind as a king, but he is not the one.

504
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,720
 And God goes far to say that actually he has rejected Eliab as king.

505
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,000
 This is the same word he uses when he removes Saul from his power position as king.

506
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,080
 He uses the same word, he is rejected.

507
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:27,760
 I have rejected this man as the king of Israel.

508
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:32,920
 In other words, what God is trying to get Samuel to know is that despite how he looks,

509
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,720
 despite your own judgment, like I said, he's not the man.

510
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,720
 Why?

511
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,640
 Because the Lord does not look at the things people look at, and we should give a hallelujah

512
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,280
 to that.

513
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,720
 But let's think about this for a moment.

514
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,240
 What is it that we find so important?

515
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,400
 What are some of the things that we look at?

516
00:27:54,400 --> 00:28:00,160
 What are some of these outward appearance things that we put so much weight and importance

517
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,160
 upon?

518
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,760
 Again, don't hear me wrong.

519
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:05,680
 I'm not saying don't take care of yourself.

520
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:10,520
 Of course, keep fit, work out, put some makeup on, choose a nice outfit, get a haircut.

521
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,440
 All this stuff is not bad in and of itself.

522
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,080
 However, it becomes bad when we only use these earthly things and this earthly perspective

523
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:24,320
 to make judgments about other people and how we make our decisions.

524
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,160
 And what becomes a problem is it becomes bad when we only use these things to judge how

525
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:32,840
 we make our choices.

526
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,200
 But so often this is how society, and maybe even us, we live our lives.

527
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:42,240
 We talked about this a little bit just now, but very much we live in a day and age when

528
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,280
 we totally judge things based upon outward appearances.

529
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:52,560
 The things people look at, like how you look, of course, the car you drive, the watch that

530
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,640
 you're wearing, the job you hold, where you live, how much money you appear to have, the

531
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:02,080
 partner you're with, the places you go eat, the places you go on holiday, how much money

532
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:06,920
 you have, how much money you spend on your handbag, your education level, things like

533
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,920
 this.

534
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:13,920
 But even the more important things are things like your ethnicity, the color of your skin.

535
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:18,680
 And we as a people are so prone to make judgments based on these outward appearance things.

536
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,400
 And Hong Kong as a society is systemic for this.

537
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:27,240
 And the problem is it leads to us making really, really horrible choices when we live like

538
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,240
 this.

539
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:31,520
 Firstly, it affects the way we treat each other.

540
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,480
 We see an important looking guy, we see a rich looking person, and a poor looking person,

541
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:41,000
 and we begin to treat the rich looking person better.

542
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,760
 We see a person who appears to be less educated or less successful and we immediately make

543
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,920
 certain assumptions about them.

544
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:52,520
 We see someone of a different ethnicity or skin color and immediately our mind is filled

545
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,840
 with prejudice and racist and discriminatory thoughts.

546
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,800
 So it affects the way we treat each other.

547
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,200
 But it also affects the way you treat yourself.

548
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:08,200
 And often we will go to painstaking lengths to appear a certain way to try and impress

549
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,880
 other people.

550
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,120
 Maybe you're trying to force your body to make a certain way, causing harm to your personal

551
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,800
 health.

552
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,480
 Maybe you're going deep into debt, you're buying all this stuff and going on holidays,

553
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:23,880
 eating all these fancy things just to give the impression that your life is good and

554
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,880
 perfect.

555
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:31,040
 And we compromise our dignity and values and relationships just so that we can feel and

556
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:34,600
 be accepted.

557
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:38,280
 But listen to what scripture tells us, church.

558
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:40,960
 Charm is deceitful.

559
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:43,640
 Beauty is vain.

560
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:50,080
 And don't forget that even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.

561
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:54,320
 In other words, even the most evil things sometimes can have the appearance of looking

562
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,320
 good.

563
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:02,160
 And you know, actually it's easy to make yourself look good.

564
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,880
 To keep up an appearance.

565
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,720
 To make your social media look like your life is perfect.

566
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,920
 But it's all just a facade.

567
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:15,920
 And this is exactly the things that frustrated when Jesus looked out at the world when Jesus

568
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,920
 was here.

569
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,040
 He saw the Pharisees, right?

570
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:22,960
 One of the most frustrating things about them was that Jesus said they were like whitewashed

571
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:23,960
 tombs.

572
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,840
 Good on the outside, but rotten on the inside.

573
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:32,640
 You justify yourself in front of others, but God knows your heart.

574
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,120
 What people value highly is detestable in God's sight.

575
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:46,280
 Outwardly you appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

576
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:50,840
 This isn't the people we've been called to be, church.

577
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:54,480
 We haven't been called to be people that just look good on the outside.

578
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,360
 We haven't been called to be people that make choices based upon outward appearances.

579
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:00,360
 Well, let me say it this way.

580
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,040
 Jesus didn't die on the cross just so that we could appear to be good, right?

581
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,320
 And one of the dangers we face at the beginning of the year is that we focus all our energy

582
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,880
 into making choices so we can appear to be good on the outside.

583
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:19,080
 And as long as I appear to be good, everything is going to be fine.

584
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:23,920
 But come on, do we really want to live like this?

585
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:28,000
 It's kind of easy, but it's also super exhausting.

586
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,440
 And you're going to fool some people for some time, maybe even for yourself for a while.

587
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:38,800
 But again, let's be reminded, God, the Lord, does not look at the things people look at.

588
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:45,280
 People look at outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.

589
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:48,960
 The Lord is after our heart.

590
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,680
 He sees our motivations.

591
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,880
 He knows your intentions.

592
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,180
 He sees others.

593
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:56,160
 He sees things others don't see, right?

594
00:32:56,160 --> 00:33:00,320
 Your character, your values, the places you've been, the thoughts you hold in your mind,

595
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,440
 your desires, your hopes, and your dreams.

596
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,360
 The psalmist will even say he knows when you rise up and he knows when you sit down.

597
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:09,360
 He knows everything about you because he created you.

598
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,120
 He is your heavenly father.

599
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,960
 There is no hiding.

600
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,560
 There is nothing that goes unnoticed when it comes to God's knowledge of us.

601
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:22,560
 And that includes what happens inside your heart.

602
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:25,480
 So the question for us this morning, church, is this.

603
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,680
 How is your heart?

604
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:30,440
 Is it clean?

605
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,140
 Is it pure?

606
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:36,560
 Is it set on the things that are above and not on the things of earth?

607
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:41,480
 Do you have a heart of flesh instead of a heart of stone?

608
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,600
 Does your heart meditate on the word of God?

609
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,000
 Is it full of the joy of the Lord?

610
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,000
 Is it wise?

611
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,500
 Do you have a heart that seeks to please the Lord?

612
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,680
 Does it come alive at the hearing of God's word?

613
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:58,480
 You have a heart that God would be after.

614
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,640
 These are the things that we should be concerned with most.

615
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,640
 Things of the heart.

616
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,060
 And yes, this is the harder choice to make.

617
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:13,720
 But when we take a good look at our hearts and squeeze it and test it, is it the things

618
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,340
 of God that comes out?

619
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,700
 Because this is the kind of church that Jesus is looking for.

620
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,600
 This is what he went to the cross for.

621
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:28,480
 Not superficial change, but for hearts that are longing for his presence in their lives.

622
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,860
 You see, the world might overlook the importance of the heart.

623
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:35,700
 We see that Samuel and Jesse almost did.

624
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,060
 And these seven sons come before them and all of them probably are tall and handsome,

625
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:44,320
 but none of them are the one that God has chosen.

626
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:48,820
 It's kind of funny in this story because he goes saying, "You have only seven boys.

627
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:49,820
 Only seven sons?

628
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:50,820
 You have any more?

629
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,820
 Maybe not enough."

630
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,820
 Right?

631
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:54,980
 Now, Jesse was probably thinking, "It must be one of these.

632
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:57,540
 It can't possibly be David."

633
00:34:57,540 --> 00:35:01,140
 He didn't even bother calling David in in the first place until he was reminded, "Oh,

634
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,140
 yeah.

635
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,140
 I have one more son.

636
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:05,180
 He is out tending the sheep."

637
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:10,340
 And so from out in the fields, away from everyone, David is called in.

638
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,860
 He's the youngest, Jesse answered.

639
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,620
 He is tending the sheep.

640
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:18,100
 So he's sent for, he's brought in, he's glowing with health.

641
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,300
 It says he has fine and handsome features.

642
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:22,540
 And the Lord said, "Rise up and anoint him.

643
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:23,540
 This is the one."

644
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:30,060
 So Samuel takes a horn of oil and anoints him in the presence of his brothers.

645
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,700
 There is still the youngest.

646
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,020
 This is also translated as the smallest.

647
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:39,300
 For Samuel, this was like a turning point.

648
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:40,540
 This is what the Lord's been saying.

649
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:42,500
 He's been telling me, "Don't look at this height.

650
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,340
 Here comes this little guy now.

651
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:47,300
 Maybe he's the one."

652
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:51,860
 And into the story, introduced to David, the shepherd boy.

653
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:54,300
 Glowing, healthy, and handsome, it says.

654
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,500
 Now again, let me explain for a minute because it sounds a bit contradictory.

655
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,580
 God just said, "Don't consider his outward appearance."

656
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:03,220
 Now scripture divides and describes David as fine and handsome.

657
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:05,060
 So what's up with that?

658
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:10,860
 It's important because notice, David was not picked because of his looks.

659
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:14,180
 It just so happened that he was good looking.

660
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,580
 It's the same point that scripture is trying to highlight.

661
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,340
 It doesn't matter how you look.

662
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:23,100
 If you're handsome, congratulations, God can use you.

663
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:27,420
 If you look a bit different, God can choose you too.

664
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,020
 The same point remains.

665
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:33,060
 The looks is not what God looks on as important.

666
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:35,460
 What matters is your heart.

667
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:39,300
 And we're going to find out the qualities that David had were beyond his handsome and

668
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,300
 rugged looks.

669
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:43,900
 It's because he had a heart that was after God.

670
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:48,820
 He was a man after God's own heart.

671
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,100
 And the fact that he was a shepherd boy is also a significant detail.

672
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:56,180
 Again, on the outward appearance, something others would have overlooked.

673
00:36:56,180 --> 00:37:02,180
 Being a shepherd would not have made sense for him to become king.

674
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,980
 You needed someone for a king to be from a military background who knew how to fight.

675
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:11,180
 Who is this kid who's been tending sheep?

676
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:15,500
 What right does he have to become a king?

677
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:18,980
 David is almost like a male Cinderella in this story.

678
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:24,140
 Cast out to the field to do the domestic chores.

679
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:30,220
 But as we consider further on in the story, when Jesus comes to this earth, how else does

680
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,500
 he describe himself as the good shepherd?

681
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,780
 As pastors, the word pastor actually means a shepherd of the people.

682
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:45,700
 So it's ironic that as the people would have never chosen a shepherd boy to lead the nation,

683
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:50,380
 this is exactly what God had in mind all along.

684
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:52,780
 It looks like he doesn't know how to fight, but check this out.

685
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,060
 You'll find out next week.

686
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:58,100
 It was very much because he was a shepherd out in the fields protecting his sheep that

687
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:02,900
 David acquired the skills that he needed to fight and bring down Goliath when he was in

688
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:06,020
 one-on-one combat with him.

689
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:11,420
 My point is this, God is serious when he says he looks at the heart.

690
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:16,500
 God isn't concerned about outward appearances and social norms.

691
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:22,900
 So church, let me ask you again, how is your heart?

692
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:28,640
 Because it might seem like according to the world, you don't have what it takes.

693
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,620
 People might have said to you, "Oh, you haven't achieved very much.

694
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:34,380
 What do you have to show for yourself?"

695
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:38,340
 It might seem like from outward appearances and earthly standards that you haven't been

696
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,180
 successful.

697
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:44,900
 Don't let the world lie to you.

698
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:51,860
 Stop listening to that junk and open your eyes to see things from God's perspective.

699
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:56,900
 Are we as a body of Christ able to rise above these superficial and earthly standards?

700
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,760
 The call on us, like I said, has not been to conform to this world, but to allow the

701
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:06,100
 Holy Spirit of God to transform and renew us.

702
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:10,940
 And this starts by the renewing of our hearts.

703
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:17,900
 The Psalms will teach us to pray, "Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast

704
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,420
 spirit within me."

705
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,020
 Create in me a pure heart, not so I can look good to everyone else, not so I can appear

706
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:32,380
 to be righteous, but create within me a pure heart so that empowered by the Holy Spirit,

707
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,180
 I'm able to do your will.

708
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:39,740
 I'm able to choose to live life in the way that God has called me to live.

709
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,060
 I don't care what the world thinks.

710
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,580
 I don't care about that stuff.

711
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:48,460
 If this is really going to be a year of action for us, if we're serious about seeing the

712
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:52,620
 life of the Holy Spirit move in this church, if we're serious to see people coming into

713
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:57,820
 life-changing, salvation-giving relationship with Jesus, then this needs to be a place

714
00:39:57,820 --> 00:40:04,300
 where all of us, I'm calling all of us to reflect the heart of God.

715
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:07,980
 This needs to be a place where someone who doesn't know Jesus at all walks in and says,

716
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:08,980
 "You know what?

717
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,980
 These people are different.

718
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,780
 I'm not judged here as I am on the outside world.

719
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,020
 They don't live life the same way.

720
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,740
 They don't make decisions the same way.

721
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,820
 They have hearts that reflect the heart of Jesus."

722
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:30,260
 And if we want to see the Spirit of God move powerfully in our midst, our hearts have to

723
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,900
 be in the right place.

724
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,420
 So this is how we're going to end.

725
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:40,980
 I'm going to ask all of us to close our eyes so we can just focus on what God wants to

726
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:44,340
 speak to us in this time.

727
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:49,580
 So I encourage you, church, if you're online and overflow outside right now, just close

728
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:59,060
 your eyes so you can focus.

729
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:04,420
 And our prayer is going to come from the line in the psalm that I read just now.

730
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:08,940
 I'm going to invite you in a minute to pray and repeat after me.

731
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:13,020
 I'm repeating Scripture, but you repeat after God's Word.

732
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:16,020
 But only do so if you're ready, church.

733
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:33,940
 Only do so if this is something that, a choice that you're making for yourself.

734
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:51,700
 So I'm going to read, and like I said, if you feel ready, you can repeat this as well.

735
00:41:51,700 --> 00:42:00,180
 Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.

736
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:07,940
 Now let that sit with you for a minute, and invite the Holy Spirit now to come and move

737
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:14,820
 in your heart, to do that searching, to search the depth, to bring up anything that you need

738
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:24,660
 to confess to the Lord, to deal with, to hand over to Him, and just invite the Holy Spirit

739
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:43,660
 now to come and move within you.

740
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:48,420
 And as the Holy Spirit is moving, I again invite you to repeat these words after me

741
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:51,060
 from Psalm 139.

742
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:55,340
 Touch me, God, and know my heart.

743
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:59,900
 Test me and know my anxious thoughts.

744
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:07,540
 See if there's any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting.

745
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:22,620
 And so Jesus, as we come before you now as a church, we pray for our hearts.

746
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:26,940
 But I pray that you would come and do the work that only your love and your presence

747
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:32,880
 can do.

748
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,260
 And yes, the world might have a certain, we have to be in this world, and we have to

749
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:45,500
 live lives, and we have to go about our daily work and things like that.

750
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:50,460
 But it's precisely in those spaces, Lord, that you want us to represent you.

751
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:56,140
 It's precisely in the way we live our lives that you want us to reflect who you are, the

752
00:43:56,140 --> 00:44:00,860
 heart that you have for us and the people around us.

753
00:44:00,860 --> 00:44:05,780
 And so Jesus, we give our hearts to you.

754
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:11,820
 Give us hearts that are clean and pure and new so that we can make the choices and live

755
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:15,540
 the life that you have called us to live.

756
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:25,740
 And as your body, Lord, as your children, as this church, as followers of you, we carry

757
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:32,620
 that with us every single day of our life, Lord.

758
00:44:32,620 --> 00:44:33,620
 Come change our hearts, Jesus.

759
00:44:33,620 --> 00:44:34,620
 We pray this in your name.

760
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:34,620
 Amen.

761
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:35,460
 Amen.

762
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:36,300
 Amen.

763
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,880
 (gentle music)
