1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Thank you church for worshipping with us,

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,400
 singing songs with us.

3
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:05,600
 Thank you worship team for leading us so well.

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,520
 Hey, if you take a seat,

5
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,080
 you can say hello to the person next to you,

6
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,120
 give them a nice warm Christmasy welcome

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:14,440
 to our service this morning.

8
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,980
 So good to be with everybody.

9
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:22,680
 All right, well it's lovely to see wonderful faces.

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:26,020
 My name's Ellison, I'm one of the pastors here at the Vine.

11
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,000
 If you're here with us for the very first time,

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,680
 we like to do this at some point during our services,

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,980
 towards the beginning, we want to welcome any newcomers.

14
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:35,760
 So if a friend has brought you today

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,480
 or if you found yourself coming to the Vine

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,580
 for the very first time,

17
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,080
 if you're joining us online for the very first time,

18
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,540
 you can drop a comment in the box

19
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,460
 to let us know where you're tuning in from.

20
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,840
 But if you're in this building right now,

21
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,640
 we'd just like you to give us a wave

22
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,140
 so we know who you are.

23
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,560
 Any first time comers to the Vine today?

24
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,840
 Can we see, all right, welcome, yes.

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,800
 Can we see a few hands over here and around the place?

26
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,000
 Welcome, thank you so much for joining us.

27
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,280
 You've chosen a great season

28
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,560
 to step into the life of this community.

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,000
 If you can see, we're very festive right now.

30
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,920
 There's a Christmas market going on,

31
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,840
 lots more Christmassy things happening

32
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,080
 in the next few weeks.

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,760
 And so hopefully you'll continue to come and join us,

34
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,720
 whether it's the first time,

35
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,240
 or if you've been here for many, many years

36
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,480
 like Hudson has now, all right.

37
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,800
 Okay, hey, on your seats you'll find a little present.

38
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,800
 It's a Christmas prayer calendar.

39
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,400
 Now you look at it, it looks really nice,

40
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,840
 it looks really put together and all that.

41
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,060
 But I wonder if anyone can tell me,

42
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:34,560
 there's something not quite right with this calendar.

43
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,120
 Can anybody tell me what it is?

44
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:39,000
 You're gonna need to use your

45
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,800
 investigation skills a little bit.

46
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,880
 - Days of the week.

47
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,800
 - The days of the week, that's right, Bernice,

48
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,080
 that's right, okay.

49
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:48,000
 Now, the idea of this calendar

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,920
 is that for each and every day,

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,760
 there's something for you to pray about.

52
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,480
 It's an Advent prayer calendar.

53
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,520
 So we thought this would be a really cool way

54
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,640
 for the whole church, for the whole community

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,920
 to be praying for the same things on the same day,

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,600
 you know, as an act of unity together

57
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
 as we step into Christmas.

58
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,700
 But it works as a prayer calendar,

59
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,160
 but it doesn't work as a calendar

60
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,240
 because the 1st of December actually starts on Thursday

61
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,120
 and not Wednesday, okay.

62
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,640
 This is what happens when you leave Ellison

63
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:20,400
 to design things like this, okay.

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,600
 My eye for detail, I apologise profusely.

65
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,200
 Please don't fire me, okay.

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,080
 But apart from that though, it's a great calendar, right.

67
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:33,040
 So you can put up on your wall, on your fridge.

68
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:37,000
 Just don't rely on it to set dates, to set appointments

69
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,840
 'cause you will be a day late and a dollar short,

70
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,060
 as they say, okay.

71
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,960
 But as a prayer calendar, I hope it's a blessing

72
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,840
 for you and your family.

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,000
 It gives you something to pray for.

74
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,600
 And it's, yeah, just something that we thought

75
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,840
 we would be good for us to focus in on together

76
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,640
 as a community, all right.

77
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,880
 So this is the prayer calendar gift,

78
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,320
 if you can call it that, from us to you guys.

79
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:01,000
 As you see outside as well, there's lots of,

80
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,800
 today's the first week of Advent.

81
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,920
 And coming up in the next few weeks of Advent,

82
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,360
 there'll be lots of different things happening

83
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,800
 in the life of this community.

84
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,560
 Today is the Christmas market.

85
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,520
 So you've already seen a few vendors outside.

86
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,720
 Lots of wonderful things to shop for.

87
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,040
 All the proceeds, this is important for you to know,

88
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,720
 all the proceeds that are gathered here today

89
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,040
 will go towards ICM, Inner City Ministries,

90
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,160
 a mission partner that we work very closely with,

91
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,040
 with some ethnic minorities here in the heart of Hong Kong,

92
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:30,640
 in Jordan, in the Temple Street sort of area.

93
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,040
 And so, obviously, you've seen some amazing things outside,

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,880
 a mulled wine kit, bags for lazy people

95
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,160
 who don't wanna wrap gifts, you know,

96
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,640
 all that kind of stuff, it's really cool.

97
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,000
 So if you have some time after the service,

98
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,920
 please do check out the Christmas market,

99
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,360
 buy a few things if you're able to.

100
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,920
 It'll be a great way to support

101
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,720
 the really great mission partners of ours this season.

102
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,280
 Also, downstairs on the first floor,

103
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,320
 if you don't have to rush off after the service,

104
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,200
 there's a complimentary photo shoot available

105
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,040
 for you as well.

106
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,640
 So if you come with a friend, if you come with a family,

107
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,560
 or even if you're by yourself.

108
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,520
 I went to the Viva dinner a few weeks ago,

109
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,160
 and I was by myself, so I had to do

110
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,280
 this photo shoot by myself.

111
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,720
 No one wanted to take a photo with me,

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,080
 but I still had a good time with it.

113
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,840
 So even if you're by yourself, go and take a photo.

114
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,480
 It would be something good to remember the season by,

115
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,480
 but that is available for you downstairs

116
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,240
 on the first floor as well.

117
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,720
 All right, well, we're here to worship,

118
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,400
 and we're here to be together,

119
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,640
 but we're also here to hear from Andrew

120
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,920
 and from the preacher, which is Andrew today.

121
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,960
 And so hear God's word.

122
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,600
 So let's put it together for Andrew

123
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,120
 and give him a round of applause.

124
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,960
 - Yeah. - Yeah.

125
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,800
 - Okay, and Andrew's gonna kick off

126
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,520
 our new sermon series. - That's right.

127
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,680
 - Lead us into Advent together.

128
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,520
 - Definitely. - Yes, okay.

129
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,400
 Any details missing or good, right?

130
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,840
 - My detail's actually very good.

131
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,680
 - Yeah, I know, yeah.

132
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,520
 You should've checked the candidate, then, bro.

133
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,920
 - Not very good. - Yeah.

134
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,560
 - If you'd given it to me, I would've seen it.

135
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,640
 - I know, yeah. - But you didn't,

136
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,480
 'cause you-- - Okay.

137
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,480
 (audience laughing)

138
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,040
 - You obviously didn't think at all.

139
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,360
 - I know, sorry, oh.

140
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,200
 (audience laughing)

141
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,640
 - Actually, we're a very forgiving church.

142
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,800
 I forgive you. - Oh, thank you.

143
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,040
 (audience laughing)

144
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,680
 - You guys heard it, okay, all right.

145
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,600
 Well, okay, let's pray for Andrew now.

146
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,760
 Jesus, we do thank you.

147
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:11,600
 Lord, we thank you for, yeah, just this time.

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,680
 We thank you for your spirit.

149
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,720
 We thank you that we can have hope in our hearts

150
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,400
 as we look forward to this Christmas season.

151
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,560
 So this message that you've given to Andrew,

152
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,280
 Lord, may he speak it boldly.

153
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,600
 May he speak it with conviction,

154
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,040
 just as you've intended for him to speak it.

155
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,920
 And Lord, open our ears, open our minds

156
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,720
 to receive and hear what he has to say.

157
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,360
 In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

158
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
 - Amen, can we not thank Alison?

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,240
 Oh, no, sorry, let's thank Alison.

160
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,560
 Give 'em a round of applause, we love you.

161
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,960
 (audience applauding)

162
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,720
 Yes, well, welcome to the Vine.

163
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,120
 If you are relatively new here,

164
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,720
 whether in the room or online right now,

165
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,640
 we are so glad you're here.

166
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:50,000
 My name's Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here, and welcome.

167
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,360
 We're glad you're present with us.

168
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,200
 I don't know about you,

169
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,200
 but I woke up not feeling particularly Christmassy.

170
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,920
 You know, it's still November, right?

171
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,440
 So I came into this room and I was like, ah!

172
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,360
 And now I feel a lot more Christmassy,

173
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,680
 and perhaps you do too.

174
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,200
 But I hope after our time together today,

175
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,360
 after what I wanna share in my heart with you,

176
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,280
 that it will help you actually to really experience Christmas

177
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,640
 as I think it was originally intended to be.

178
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,360
 And I wanna start my time together with you today

179
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:18,960
 actually telling you a story about my family.

180
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:19,920
 It's a story about my family

181
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:22,200
 that I've not shared here at the Vine before,

182
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,240
 but it's one that I think is going to blow your mind.

183
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,800
 My great, great, great, great grandfather

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,040
 was called Francis Cravel.

185
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:37,040
 He was born in 1770 in Bosum, England.

186
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:42,920
 He was the only son actually to Elizabeth and John Cravel.

187
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:47,920
 And Francis ended up marrying his childhood sweetheart.

188
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,960
 Her name was Martha Quennell.

189
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,080
 And they got married in the late '70s.

190
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,120
 And after they got married in the early 1800s,

191
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,760
 they started to have a family.

192
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:58,160
 They actually ended up having four children,

193
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,120
 one who was called Oliver.

194
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,560
 And Oliver, I can trace my personal lineage,

195
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,920
 my personal generational history

196
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:09,840
 right the way back to Francis's son, Oliver.

197
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,640
 Now, Francis was not a Christian.

198
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,320
 In fact, his whole family were not believers in his day,

199
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:18,160
 something that was a little bit strange in those days

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,840
 as they lived in the UK at a time

201
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
 when there was great revival within the churches.

202
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,240
 But Francis and his family,

203
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,600
 Martha and the kids were not Christians.

204
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,600
 But on the 5th of November, 1809,

205
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,520
 Francis had a dream.

206
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:38,760
 And in this dream, he saw a room filled with people.

207
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,000
 And this room was filled with people

208
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,080
 who were intently listening to one person.

209
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,840
 And that person was what he could tell in the dream,

210
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,680
 a young English man.

211
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:51,200
 And he was standing on a small platform

212
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,880
 just raised off the floor,

213
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:56,320
 and he was holding up a Bible in the air.

214
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,080
 Now, this is quite a strange dream for Francis to have

215
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,240
 given the fact that they weren't, like I say,

216
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,320
 church-going family.

217
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,640
 But he could see this dream very clearly.

218
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:09,280
 And as the dream continued to unfold,

219
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,600
 he could tell that everybody in the room

220
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,760
 that was listening to the young Englishman

221
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:16,680
 who was holding up the Bible were foreigners.

222
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:20,600
 In particular, he could tell that they were Chinese people.

223
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,880
 After he had this dream, he woke up

224
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,960
 and he told the dream to his wife, Martha.

225
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,040
 And they wondered what the dream meant,

226
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:33,160
 because again, none of them really knew any preachers.

227
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,440
 They certainly didn't know any young Englishman.

228
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,440
 And they certainly in those days didn't know any Chinese.

229
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,720
 Now, that dream would have been lost to all history,

230
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,320
 unless of course, Francis himself wrote it down.

231
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
 And what is amazing in history

232
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,600
 is that Francis was an avid diary writer.

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,400
 And his diary has been passed down

234
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,880
 from generation to generation.

235
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,760
 This is Francis's diary.

236
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:10,080
 This came to me when my father passed away three years ago.

237
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,220
 And he gave it to me as is rightfully to be done,

238
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,760
 passing down through the family history.

239
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:20,360
 I wanna read to you Francis's entry on November 5th, 1809,

240
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:26,360
 some 213 years ago.

241
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:30,760
 He said this, "The dream seems strange to me.

242
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:33,880
 For I sense despite my lack of faith,

243
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,920
 a divine suggestion within it.

244
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,540
 The young Englishman seemed to reflect me,

245
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:44,080
 or at least a future version of me.

246
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,160
 And the people listening intently

247
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,680
 also seemed to be in the future, many Chinese people.

248
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,440
 As I awoke and spoke of this to Martha,

249
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,600
 she said a strange thing.

250
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,760
 She said, "Perhaps you dreamt of a future time

251
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,760
 of one of your own blood who will do

252
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,640
 just as you saw them do.

253
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,860
 It seems to me a great mystery,

254
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:10,960
 but I am quite joyful about it."

255
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:17,080
 I mean, could you imagine that God 213 years ago

256
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:22,160
 would appear to somebody in my generation, my family,

257
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,960
 bring the word of God to them in a dream,

258
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:28,400
 see a young preacher standing, holding the Bible

259
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,880
 in front of a whole bunch of Chinese people in the room.

260
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,560
 I mean, is that not the most amazing thing?

261
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,860
 I mean, can you believe it?

262
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:38,780
 (congregation applauding)

263
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,980
 It's the most amazing thing.

264
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,680
 Or at least it would be if it were true.

265
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,360
 I lied to you.

266
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,640
 I just made up that whole story.

267
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,400
 Not one word is true,

268
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,880
 except for I did have a relative

269
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,360
 who's the name Francis Kerbal.

270
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,760
 He was in fact married to Martha Quennell.

271
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,120
 They did have a son called Oliver who is in my family line.

272
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,840
 And this is actually from 1802,

273
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,120
 but it is a Bible, not his diary,

274
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,680
 and it is still passed down through my generations.

275
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,840
 Now I know what you're thinking right now.

276
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,840
 You're thinking, "That guy ripped me off.

277
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,280
 That was a great story.

278
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,240
 My emotions were there, right?

279
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,400
 And I ripped you off.

280
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:25,000
 I told you a lie and pastors are not supposed to lie."

281
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,600
 Why did I lie to you?

282
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,800
 Well, it's because I wanted to create in you a feeling.

283
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,000
 That feeling you just had,

284
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,000
 the feeling that made you clap your hands,

285
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,500
 the feeling of awe, of wonder, of astonishment,

286
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,800
 the feeling that God could maybe do something like that

287
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,480
 through generations and generations,

288
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:52,000
 that God might give a dream to someone

289
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,800
 and generations later, that dream might come to pass,

290
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,240
 the astonishment that we actually have a God

291
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,880
 who could do something like that,

292
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,840
 that feeling that you just felt,

293
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,840
 welcome to the very first Christmas.

294
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,640
 'Cause that was the feeling that they had

295
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,020
 at the first time when Jesus was born.

296
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,440
 And the reason why I wanted to start with that

297
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:19,420
 is because the reality is that for many of us,

298
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,280
 myself included,

299
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:24,960
 we don't really have that feeling about Christmas anymore.

300
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:28,160
 Oh, and by the way, you know that other feeling you felt

301
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,440
 when you found out I lied to you?

302
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,560
 You know that one where you rolled your eyes

303
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,120
 and you felt a little frustrated

304
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,800
 and there was a bit of latent anger

305
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,040
 and you were very disappointed that I lied to you?

306
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,480
 You know that feeling?

307
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,620
 That's the feeling of the first Good Friday

308
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,260
 when Jesus died on the cross.

309
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,720
 That's how his disciples felt.

310
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,640
 In fact, the two disciples on the road to Emmaus

311
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:52,240
 shortly afterwards were having a conversation together

312
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,560
 and they said, "We thought he was gonna be the Messiah,

313
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,520
 but I guess he's just a prophet

314
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,040
 'cause he's just died on the cross."

315
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,240
 Disappointment, rage, upset, anger.

316
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,200
 It's fascinating, isn't it?

317
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:08,260
 The feelings that surround Jesus's ministry.

318
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:10,900
 And I wanted to begin my talk with you today,

319
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,720
 the first talk of our series of Advent.

320
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,880
 If you're new to church,

321
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,060
 Advent is the four Sundays that run up to Christmas.

322
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,360
 Advent in the Latin mean coming,

323
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,160
 and it's the time where we prepare our hearts as the church

324
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,720
 for the coming of Jesus at Christmas.

325
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,200
 I wanted to start our celebration of Advent

326
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,360
 by creating in you not the feeling

327
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,160
 that you normally have at Christmas,

328
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,880
 but the feeling of the actual Christmas.

329
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,260
 The feeling that the Jewish people had

330
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:41,160
 when they were longing for the Messiah to come,

331
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:43,460
 and the reality that when he did come,

332
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,400
 they were like a short intake of breath

333
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,200
 and were like, "Oh my gosh,

334
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,840
 everything the prophets had ever spoken about this son,

335
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:53,360
 he's actually happened.

336
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,600
 The prophets weren't lying, it actually came true."

337
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,640
 In my fictitious story of Francis,

338
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:03,240
 writing it down in his journal for generations to read,

339
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:06,040
 in our scriptures we hold, don't we?

340
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:10,320
 So many of these prophetic utterances in the Old Testament,

341
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,480
 utterances that explain to us the hope

342
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:17,320
 that God's people had for a Christmas to come.

343
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,300
 And I want you to think about it this way,

344
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:21,760
 because it's quite interesting for us today

345
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,840
 in 2022 when we celebrate Christmas,

346
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,400
 'cause for us, the celebration of Christmas

347
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,880
 is something that happened in the past.

348
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,380
 It's something that happened over 2000 years ago

349
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:35,120
 that we now celebrate in the present.

350
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,660
 But when you read the Bible,

351
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:39,120
 you've got to understand that the majority of people

352
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,640
 in scripture, for them,

353
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,800
 Christmas was not something in the past,

354
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,320
 Christmas was something in the future.

355
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:48,320
 That they hadn't had yet the Messiah come into the world.

356
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,380
 And there was this longing, there was this hope,

357
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,000
 there was this desire that God in some point in the future

358
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,360
 would step into human history and change everything.

359
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,320
 And because they had this longing for desire,

360
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,480
 when it actually took place, they were like,

361
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:08,480
 "Ah, it is real, he is here,

362
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,280
 and the world is never, ever going to be the same."

363
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,680
 And if you're gonna celebrate Christmas in 2022,

364
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,120
 that's the feeling I want you to have.

365
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,900
 You wanna celebrate Christmas really.

366
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,300
 And look, we love trees and presents and mulled wine

367
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,400
 and all of that good stuff,

368
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,020
 and I hope you have amazing Christmas that way.

369
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:33,740
 But as your pastor, I want you to feel Christmas.

370
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,660
 I want you to feel it

371
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,060
 as the original people were feeling it.

372
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:39,880
 And they were longing for this God to come,

373
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,100
 because the prophets of the Old Testament

374
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:45,200
 had dreams like my story of Francis.

375
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,500
 They had visions and hopes and they wrote them down.

376
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,260
 And these visions and these dreams

377
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:54,500
 drove God's people forward for over 500 years

378
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,420
 as they waited for their dream to come into reality.

379
00:15:58,420 --> 00:16:00,660
 And in the Old Testament, you can read in Isaiah

380
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:03,300
 and Jeremiah and Zechariah and Ezra

381
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,340
 and some of the other Old Testament prophets,

382
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,660
 as they began to lean forward into the idea

383
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:10,340
 that a day will happen when a child will be born,

384
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,820
 and they begin to speak over Israel

385
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,260
 some things about the coming of this child.

386
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,300
 And so if you look through the Old Testament prophets,

387
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,380
 you'll hear these words, things like,

388
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,140
 "Oh, he's a coming son of man.

389
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:26,540
 He's gonna be a son of man who's going to come.

390
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:29,060
 And when he comes, we will know him

391
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:31,380
 like we've known no one before,

392
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:35,080
 that he will come be born of a virgin.

393
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,540
 Like this virgin will give birth to him.

394
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,460
 And when that happens,

395
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,860
 everybody will know that this child

396
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,220
 is the saviour of the world."

397
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,780
 And because of this, they began to understand

398
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,260
 that if the saviour comes,

399
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:50,540
 then what that means is that evil will be overcome

400
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,940
 with good.

401
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,940
 And it will be like when this child arrives

402
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:56,820
 that a light has shone in the darkness,

403
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,340
 like a light has come around.

404
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,060
 And this child, he will have all authority

405
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:03,740
 sit on his shoulders.

406
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:06,380
 And the prophets began to speak of a name

407
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,060
 that this child would hold.

408
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,100
 "Oh, he'll be like a wonderful counsellor,

409
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:14,780
 like a mighty God, an everlasting father.

410
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,860
 And ultimately we will come to know him

411
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,300
 as the Prince of Peace."

412
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,140
 They understood the prophets

413
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:24,740
 as they began to speak of the coming day

414
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:28,140
 that this saviour would arrive.

415
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,060
 They understood that he would come

416
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,660
 through the reign of David's throne,

417
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,500
 that it would come through David's lineage

418
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,100
 as the ultimate King of Israel.

419
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,900
 And this guy, this child to be born,

420
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:43,260
 he will actually establish justice and righteousness

421
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,740
 on earth for all eternity.

422
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,380
 It'll be like those who are captives will be set free.

423
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,580
 It'll be like those who are in darkness

424
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:55,020
 will come out like prisoners coming out of the darkness.

425
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:57,900
 And they began to say that when this child is born,

426
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:02,620
 it'll be like the year of the Lord's favour forever.

427
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:06,740
 So all of this stuff on the screen behind me right now

428
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:11,740
 is spoken 500 years before the birth of Jesus.

429
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:15,580
 And all of this stuff helped to form in Israel

430
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:18,900
 their expectations of that very first Christmas.

431
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:22,540
 Sometime in the future, this child will be born

432
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,020
 and not only will he be born as a child,

433
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,460
 but when he grows up and through his life

434
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,260
 and all that he does, he'll deal with our sin.

435
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,580
 He'll actually forgive us and restore us.

436
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,100
 We'll be in right relationship with God again

437
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,500
 and the world will be just as it was designed to be.

438
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:41,860
 So Christmas for those in the Old Testament

439
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,500
 was about one central theme.

440
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:48,860
 The promise of better days.

441
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:56,380
 'Cause when Jesus comes, when this son of man comes,

442
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:59,060
 the world will not be like it is right now

443
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,380
 with all of its tensions and sin and destruction

444
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,780
 and pain and hurt, but the world will be changed

445
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:06,900
 and transformed in the beautiful renewal of a God

446
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:10,900
 who comes down to meet with his people and sets them free.

447
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,460
 Oh, and so the people longed for the promise of better days.

448
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,880
 Christmas for them was not just a spiritual thing,

449
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,300
 but it had political, social,

450
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,500
 and cultural connection to it.

451
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,780
 Christmas for them.

452
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,300
 The reason why they longed for it so much

453
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,780
 was 'cause they believed that if God entered the world

454
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:32,300
 like this child, then the world would never

455
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,300
 be the same again.

456
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,740
 And I think we've lost so much

457
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:39,820
 of the original power of Christmas.

458
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:43,140
 There's one thing I want for all of you

459
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,960
 over the next four weeks of Advent.

460
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,960
 It's to recapture something of the promise of better days.

461
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:54,260
 If you're anything like me, that's a good thing,

462
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,060
 because I would like some better days.

463
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,740
 I don't know about you.

464
00:19:57,740 --> 00:20:00,340
 The world's been a pretty tough place to live in recently.

465
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,940
 Hong Kong's been a bit of a challenging place

466
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,540
 to live in recently.

467
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:05,860
 Maybe there's stuff going on in your life personally,

468
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,820
 things happening in your family.

469
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,940
 Maybe it's just stuff going on around you

470
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,740
 and you're severe of influence, maybe in your workplace

471
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,460
 or the wider sense of your family.

472
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:17,820
 And you would echo that sense of better days.

473
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:20,860
 Oh, I can't wait for 2023.

474
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:24,020
 Like it's gonna be better than now, right?

475
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:27,060
 And this longing that the Old Testament prophets

476
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,520
 placed in Israel for this longing for coming

477
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,620
 for better days had to be held in their spirits

478
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,860
 for 500 years, because at the time that Isaiah

479
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,000
 and some of the other prophets finished prophesying,

480
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,860
 nothing happened, silence for over 400 and something years.

481
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,700
 I don't know what it's like for you to wait on a promise.

482
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,980
 I can wait maybe about three days.

483
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,540
 Imagine having to wait over 400 years.

484
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:56,900
 It's not a surprise then that when the first Christmas

485
00:20:56,900 --> 00:21:01,900
 finally arrived, everybody in Israel was like,

486
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,760
 (gasps)

487
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:04,620
 that exact feeling I gave you right at the start,

488
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,300
 even though I lied to you, not the lying feeling,

489
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,060
 but the one before it, okay?

490
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:10,940
 That was the feeling they all had.

491
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,320
 And when Matthew and Luke write their accounts

492
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,640
 of Jesus's birth, they wanna try and help us

493
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,100
 to feel that feeling.

494
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:20,400
 They wanna communicate us why Jesus is so important.

495
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,420
 So Matthew in particular, throughout his gospel narrative

496
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,280
 of the birth of Jesus, he includes four examples

497
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,560
 of the Old Testament prophetic words about Jesus.

498
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,300
 'Cause in those four examples, he's trying to teach

499
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,400
 the people that will read his gospel

500
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,360
 what that feeling really is about,

501
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,480
 what Christmas really is about.

502
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:41,280
 That it's not some arbitrary day,

503
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,240
 it's not just some day where we celebrate something

504
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:44,960
 that's happened 2000 years ago,

505
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,580
 but it's actually a day that fulfills

506
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,840
 the Old Testament longing and hope.

507
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,360
 And so over the next four weeks,

508
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,800
 we're gonna take one of Matthew's four Old Testament

509
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,680
 sayings, one each week, and we're gonna help you

510
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,120
 to feel really Christmassy.

511
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:06,120
 And by that, I mean the real Christmas, not the modern one.

512
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,960
 Can I have me an amen?

513
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:11,600
 Let me not lie to you anymore in the name of Jesus.

514
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:16,960
 And let me read to you the gospel of the birth of Jesus

515
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,100
 as Matthew tells it.

516
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,280
 This is Matthew 1, verse 18.

517
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:24,600
 This is how the birth of Jesus Christ came about.

518
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,600
 His mother Mary was pledged to be married to Joseph.

519
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,400
 But before they came together, she was found

520
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:32,220
 to be chucked with child through the Holy Spirit.

521
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,540
 Because Joseph, her husband was a righteous man

522
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:37,520
 and did not want to expose her to public disgrace.

523
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,180
 He had in mind to divorce her quietly.

524
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,840
 But after he had considered this,

525
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:45,720
 an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream

526
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:49,360
 and said this, "Joseph, son of David,

527
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,700
 do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife,

528
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,040
 because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.

529
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,880
 She will give birth to a son,

530
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,740
 and you are to give him the name Jesus,

531
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:03,560
 because he will save his people from their sins."

532
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,120
 Verse 22, note this.

533
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,880
 "All of this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said

534
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,080
 long ago through the prophets.

535
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,760
 The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son,

536
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:20,760
 and they will call him Emmanuel, which means God with us."

537
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,040
 Matthew does this amazing thing.

538
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,920
 He's telling the story about the birth of Jesus.

539
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,980
 He tells about the virgin side of that.

540
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,640
 He tells about Joseph trying to be an honorable person

541
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,200
 and quietly divorcing his wife,

542
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,040
 not to bring shame on her family.

543
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:34,000
 And then God shows up in a dream.

544
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,520
 This one really took place.

545
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,680
 I'm not lying to you.

546
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,840
 This dream happened.

547
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,780
 And in that dream, the angel actually says to him,

548
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,280
 "No, don't be afraid.

549
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,240
 Take her to be your wife.

550
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,600
 Go home together.

551
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,120
 Don't lie with her until you're actually married,

552
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,760
 but you're gonna see this child come through."

553
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,820
 And he says this,

554
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,640
 "And this is all to fulfill one of those prophetic words

555
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,200
 that was spoken 500 years ago."

556
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,860
 And then he quotes Isaiah 7, verse 14.

557
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:09,240
 And Isaiah 7, verse 14 starts all of the prophetic utterances

558
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,600
 about the coming of Jesus.

559
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,280
 It is the very first

560
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,080
 of what would become many prophetic utterances

561
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,640
 that would create this messianic hope

562
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,040
 of a child coming in the future.

563
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:25,200
 And so as we start Advent, may we start in Isaiah 7.

564
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,200
 And I wanna show you what the true Christmas

565
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,520
 is really all about.

566
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,400
 Let's start just a little bit earlier

567
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,800
 so we can get some context here,

568
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,800
 'cause context is important.

569
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,680
 Isaiah 7, verse 1 says,

570
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:40,680
 "When Ahaz son of Jotham, son of Uzziah, was king of Judah,

571
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:46,360
 King Rezan of Aram, and Picah son of Ramiah, king of Israel,

572
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,240
 marched up to fight against Jerusalem,

573
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,360
 but they could not overpower it.

574
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,720
 Now the house of David was told this,

575
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,640
 'Aram has allied itself with Ephraim.'

576
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:01,000
 So the hearts of Ahaz and his people were shaken,

577
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,420
 as the trees of the forest are shaken by the wind."

578
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:06,440
 Now, there's a lot of names and places there.

579
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,360
 Let me just pull it all together very simply

580
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,080
 and tell you what's going on here.

581
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,080
 This is a very important time in Israel's history

582
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,280
 in the Old Testament.

583
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,040
 At this point, Israel has split into two nations.

584
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,200
 It's called the divided kingdom period.

585
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,360
 The 10 of the tribes of Israel have gone north

586
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,080
 to set up a new nation,

587
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,960
 which annoyingly, when you read the Bible,

588
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,280
 they call themselves Israel,

589
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,880
 which confuses you with the previous Israel.

590
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:30,640
 But anyway, they're also known as Ephraim,

591
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,680
 how they're referred to in this passage.

592
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,800
 That's the 10 tribes that went north.

593
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:38,120
 Two tribes remain south, Judah and Benjamin.

594
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:41,400
 And they were headed now by a king, King Ahaz.

595
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,760
 And he represented the southern kingdoms.

596
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,560
 Now, there's a north king and there's a south king,

597
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:49,380
 and this gets very game of thrones, okay?

598
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:52,040
 'Cause the king of the north is attacked

599
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:54,240
 by the Assyrians even further north.

600
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,280
 And because there's a war happening there,

601
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:59,840
 the king of the north writes the King Ahaz in the south

602
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,760
 and says, "Would you come to our aid?

603
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,240
 "Will you come and fight the battle with us and for us?"

604
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,320
 And Ahaz refuses to send his people into war

605
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,360
 for the 10 tribes that are north.

606
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,880
 Now, because of that, the king of the north is upset,

607
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,560
 as you could imagine he would be.

608
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,120
 And so he decides, "Okay, well,

609
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,400
 "if you're not gonna join us,

610
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,980
 "we're gonna force you to join us.

611
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:24,220
 "We're now gonna attack downwards.

612
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,300
 "We're gonna attack into Jerusalem.

613
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,620
 "We're going to force your men to come

614
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,420
 "and fight our battles."

615
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,400
 Now, word of this, that the north are gonna come

616
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,600
 and attack the south, comes to King Ahaz of the south,

617
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,780
 and he is filled with fear.

618
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,600
 In fact, he's described here in the Bible

619
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,300
 that he is trembling like leaves of a tree

620
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,220
 in the wind might tremble.

621
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:49,960
 Not a very nice picture to have in all of history.

622
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,780
 Now, we're told something else about Ahaz

623
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,100
 that's really important.

624
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,460
 We're told that he's a part of the house of David.

625
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,960
 And why is that important?

626
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,780
 Because the house of David represented

627
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:02,340
 the Davidic kingship through the blood.

628
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,100
 Ahaz had been blood related to David.

629
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,160
 And scripture will begin to tell us

630
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,500
 that the coming Messiah would come

631
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,540
 through the bloodline of David.

632
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,440
 In fact, right at the birth of Jesus,

633
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,940
 Matthew starts his gospel with the genealogy,

634
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,580
 which goes from Jesus all the way back to King David

635
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,700
 through King Ahaz.

636
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,100
 So Ahaz is part of the bloodline of the saviour.

637
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,060
 And the house of David was supposed to be faithful.

638
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,220
 The house of David was supposed to be confident and strong

639
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,000
 and show their faithful commitment to God,

640
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,200
 but Ahaz is afraid.

641
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,940
 I wonder if you've ever had to be faithful,

642
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,380
 but you've had to wrestle with fear

643
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,340
 in the midst of that faithfulness.

644
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,380
 Well, if so, then you're just like Ahaz.

645
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,580
 Verse three, notice what happens next.

646
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,900
 Then the Lord said to Isaiah,

647
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:56,020
 "Go out, you and your son, Sherjusab, to meet Ahaz

648
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,580
 at the end of the aqueduct of the upper pool

649
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,660
 on the road to the washerman's field.

650
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:03,980
 Say to him this, 'Be careful, keep calm,

651
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,660
 and don't be afraid.

652
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:09,220
 Do not lose heart because of these two smouldering stubs

653
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,120
 of firewood.'"

654
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:12,180
 That's the two nations that wanna attack them.

655
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,060
 "Because of the fierce anger of Rezin and Aram

656
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,660
 and of the son of Ramiah.

657
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:20,700
 Aram, Ephraim, and Ramiah's son have plotted your ruin,

658
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,400
 saying, 'Let us invade Judah.

659
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,940
 Let us tear apart and divide it amongst ourselves

660
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,700
 and make the son of Tebal king over it.'

661
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:30,060
 Yet this is what the sovereign Lord says."

662
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:34,220
 Okay, God shows up to Ahaz, who's trembling scared,

663
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,620
 and says, "Just chill out, buddy.

664
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:37,900
 I'm with you.

665
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,900
 I'm here.

666
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,300
 You don't need to be afraid.

667
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,020
 I'm gonna fight some battles with you.

668
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,620
 It's gonna be okay, all right?

669
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,340
 Yes, they're plotting against you,

670
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:49,300
 but you're not alone."

671
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:50,340
 And he says this to them.

672
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,740
 He says, "This, i.e., the attack on you,

673
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:53,980
 will not take place.

674
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,220
 It will not happen.

675
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,980
 For the head of Aram is Damascus.

676
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,720
 The head of Damascus is only Rezin.

677
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,720
 Within 65 years, Ephraim will too be shattered by a people."

678
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:05,620
 That actually happened, by the way.

679
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:06,920
 Assyria came down,

680
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,220
 actually defeated the 10 tribes in the north.

681
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,700
 That happened in 756 years before Jesus.

682
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,940
 And he says this,

683
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,460
 "The head of Ephraim is Samaria.

684
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,740
 The head of Samaria is only Ramiah's son.

685
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,200
 If you do not stand firm in your faith,

686
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,500
 you will not stand at all."

687
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,860
 Ooh, we can preach on that one for a while.

688
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,900
 God says to Ahab, "If you don't stand firm in your faith,

689
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,540
 you will not stand firm at all."

690
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:32,380
 God is constantly calling his people to faithfulness.

691
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:34,580
 Constantly calling them not to be perfect,

692
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,060
 not to have it all worked out,

693
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:38,220
 but to be faithful in believing

694
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:40,740
 that God can do the impossible.

695
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,020
 Faithful in believing that God could step in

696
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,740
 in the worst of circumstances,

697
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,180
 and so he says to Ahaz,

698
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:51,180
 "If you just stand faithful, then you will be able to stand."

699
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,660
 The question is, did he stand faithful?

700
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,580
 Well, let's carry on.

701
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,620
 Verse 10.

702
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,180
 Is this okay, everybody?

703
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,060
 I know it's a lot of scripture,

704
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,660
 but track with me 'cause this is about your Christmas.

705
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,900
 Verse 10, "Again, the Lord spoke to Ahaz,

706
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,300
 'Ask the Lord your God for a sign,

707
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,940
 whether in the deepest depths or in the highest heights.'"

708
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:13,420
 God says to Ahaz, "Ask me to act on your behalf.

709
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,100
 Ask me to fight battles for you.

710
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,100
 Ask of me."

711
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,100
 It's like God wants to be

712
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,060
 in intimate relationship with humanity.

713
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,780
 He wants to be in relationship with them.

714
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,180
 He wants to have that kind of connection with them,

715
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,380
 and so he's saying, "Would you be in communion with me?

716
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,820
 Would you just ask me?

717
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,100
 Would you actually ask me for a sign?

718
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,660
 And if you just simply ask me for a sign,

719
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,980
 I will respond to you.

720
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,340
 I will act on your behalf.

721
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,700
 I will come and fight your battles.

722
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:35,980
 Just ask."

723
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:39,020
 Notice what Ahaz says.

724
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:42,180
 But Ahaz said, "I will not ask,

725
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:45,340
 for I will not put my Lord my God to the test."

726
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,340
 Ahaz is so funny.

727
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,740
 He's not faithful.

728
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,940
 He doesn't respond in a faithful way to God,

729
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:52,100
 but he tries to hide his lack of faithfulness

730
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,380
 behind religious piety.

731
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,420
 He quotes the 10 commandments back to God.

732
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,500
 He's like, "Those are your rules, buddy.

733
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:00,700
 You said, 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.'

734
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,420
 Well, I'm not going to put you to the test."

735
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,780
 And it's almost like God is like, "Oh my goodness."

736
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,700
 It's a little bit like when I saw that Advent calendar.

737
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,220
 I was like, "Oh my goodness."

738
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,780
 It's Ellison again.

739
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:17,820
 His God going, "Oh my goodness," Ahaz.

740
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,460
 Like, "Dude, you just had to ask me for a sign.

741
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:23,780
 Thursday, the 1st of December.

742
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:25,380
 That's all you had to remember."

743
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:37,740
 Notice how the Lord responds.

744
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,620
 Verse 13, then Isaiah says this.

745
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,900
 The Lord's speaking through Isaiah.

746
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,780
 "Hear now, you house of David.

747
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,780
 Is it not enough to try the patience of men?

748
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,780
 Will you also try the patience of my God?

749
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:52,300
 Therefore the Lord himself will act,

750
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,500
 will give you a sign."

751
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,340
 Here's the sign.

752
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:56,460
 The virgin will be with a child

753
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,420
 and you will give birth to a son

754
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,220
 and she will call him Emmanuel.

755
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:03,860
 Here's the very first mention of the Messiah.

756
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,660
 The very first mention of the coming messianic hope.

757
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:09,580
 The very first time God steps into his people and says,

758
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,420
 "If you are not gonna be faithful,

759
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:13,620
 I am still gonna be faithful on your part.

760
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,900
 I'm gonna step into your brokenness

761
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,380
 and I'm gonna send you a sign."

762
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,660
 And you wanna know what that sign is?

763
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,620
 The sign's gonna be the most amazing thing

764
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,900
 you could ever expect.

765
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,500
 I'm gonna take a virgin,

766
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,380
 someone who has never laid with a man.

767
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,780
 She's gonna be pregnant.

768
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,620
 She's gonna bring forth a child

769
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,940
 and that child is gonna be called Emmanuel.

770
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,340
 The word for virgin here is the Hebrew word Alma.

771
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,140
 It's a very old, rare word.

772
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,900
 It's only used six times in the Old Testament.

773
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,340
 It doesn't actually specifically mean virgin.

774
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:43,940
 It means a woman or a girl

775
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:47,100
 who is too young to carry a child.

776
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:50,140
 And so this girl is going to carry a child.

777
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,780
 And what basically Isaiah is saying

778
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:55,660
 is God is gonna act in a miraculous, impossible way,

779
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:58,740
 just like we had in that prophetic word from Hudson earlier,

780
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:01,380
 that God can do the impossible.

781
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,180
 This is exactly what Isaiah is saying.

782
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,700
 God is gonna come in the future

783
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,340
 and do something where all we can respond to

784
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:09,660
 is to say, "That's crazy."

785
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,860
 In other words, that they will have the same feeling

786
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,100
 that you had at the beginning of this sermon

787
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,300
 when you were like, "Wow, that's amazing."

788
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,620
 Then he says this,

789
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,220
 "This child is gonna be known by this.

790
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:27,100
 His name will be Emmanuel."

791
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,300
 Now that doesn't sound particularly amazing to us,

792
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,060
 or perhaps it does sound familiar to you

793
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,740
 because we sung it in a song earlier,

794
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:38,780
 and we often use that name around Christmas time.

795
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,940
 But I wonder whether you've actually ever stopped

796
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:43,580
 to wonder why Isaiah mentions it here

797
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,100
 some 500 years before Christmas.

798
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:48,140
 His name will be Emmanuel.

799
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:52,100
 Emmanuel means literally God with us.

800
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:54,780
 Here's the question you should ask

801
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,900
 as a good biblical scholar.

802
00:33:56,900 --> 00:34:01,900
 Why is God being with Israel important in Isaiah chapter 7?

803
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,460
 And why is that also important

804
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,620
 when we think about the first Christmas?

805
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,540
 Well, we have to wind all the way back

806
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,660
 to the beginning of the biblical story

807
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,740
 to answer that question.

808
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,820
 Are you ready for a bit of biblical history?

809
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,860
 I know it's 11 o'clock, you're getting hungry.

810
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,540
 You wanna go to lunch and visit the market,

811
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,860
 but just stay with me for a few more minutes, okay?

812
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:23,140
 'Cause this will blow your mind even more

813
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:26,500
 than my story at the beginning when I lied to you.

814
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,940
 In Genesis 1 and 2,

815
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,620
 right at the beginning of the biblical story,

816
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:33,540
 we see a picture of what God with us looks like.

817
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,300
 See, Adam and Eve were created to be in intimacy with God.

818
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,540
 They were created to be in His presence.

819
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,140
 And God is actually spoken of in Genesis 1 and 2

820
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:44,020
 as walking in the garden with Adam and Eve.

821
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:47,140
 He communed with them in the fullness of His presence.

822
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:51,140
 There was this beautiful intimacy between humanity and God.

823
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,540
 So much so that at the end of Genesis 2,

824
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,940
 it actually says that Adam and Eve were naked and unashamed.

825
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,900
 It wasn't just talking about their physicality,

826
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:01,900
 it was talking about their emotion and their mental state.

827
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,980
 It was talking about how they thought of each other,

828
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,140
 how they thought of God.

829
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,940
 There was nothing between them.

830
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,540
 There was nothing to separate them.

831
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:12,580
 There was this complete openness, a brokenness,

832
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:15,460
 a vulnerability between themselves and the other.

833
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:19,620
 It was like nakedness without any shame at all.

834
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,740
 And the Bible describes this as shalom.

835
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,060
 The way the world is supposed to be,

836
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,860
 the way the world was created by God to be Him

837
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:29,900
 in relationship with Adam and Eve,

838
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,500
 walking in that garden, creating intimacy,

839
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,220
 where they were naked and unashamed.

840
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,380
 It's like God is saying, "This is very good."

841
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:41,060
 And then in Genesis 3, we know what happens next.

842
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,380
 Through Adam and Eve's choices,

843
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,940
 they bring sin into the equation.

844
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,700
 They disobey the obedience of God

845
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:47,860
 and what God had asked them to do.

846
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,900
 And they bring sin and brokenness.

847
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,820
 And immediately everything is ruptured.

848
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,940
 All of that intimacy of Genesis 1 and 2

849
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,140
 is completely ruptured.

850
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:57,980
 And suddenly Adam and Eve start fighting against each other,

851
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,260
 the first married couple

852
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,180
 to have a bickering argument together.

853
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,740
 They start blaming each other.

854
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,460
 Then they start blaming God.

855
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:06,500
 Then they start blaming creation.

856
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:08,460
 And all of the intimacy of the relationships

857
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,380
 in Genesis 1 and 2 are totally ruptured in Genesis 3.

858
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:14,820
 So much so that at the end of Genesis 3,

859
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,740
 a statement takes place from God.

860
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,740
 He casts Adam and Eve out of the garden.

861
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:23,220
 And in doing that, it was his way of saying,

862
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,180
 because of the choice that has been made,

863
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,740
 the brokenness that is here,

864
00:36:26,740 --> 00:36:29,260
 there is no longer the ability, because I'm holy,

865
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,780
 for us to be present with each other.

866
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:33,780
 And so he sends them out of the garden.

867
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:38,500
 And basically God is no longer with us at that point.

868
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,780
 Are you with me still?

869
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:44,020
 And really the whole rest of the Old Testament,

870
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,380
 from Genesis 4 all the way to the end of Malachi,

871
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,380
 is a story of a people, Israel,

872
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:52,460
 longing to be back in relationship with God.

873
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,740
 Wanting to be back in relationship with Him.

874
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:57,660
 Wanting to know the intimacy that was there in the garden.

875
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,220
 Wanting to feel that naked and unashamed.

876
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:03,420
 Wanting to know what it would be to be in a place of shalom,

877
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,260
 where everything is good again.

878
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:08,020
 And what you see in the Old Testament narrative

879
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:10,380
 is God's people desiring intimacy,

880
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,300
 and God Himself desiring to be close to them.

881
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:17,820
 But because of the sin and the reality of brokenness,

882
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:20,340
 there's this tension in the Old Testament

883
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,540
 between a people that long for intimacy,

884
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,740
 a God that longs to be with His people,

885
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,500
 and yet now a necessary separation.

886
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:32,860
 So for example, God is with His people,

887
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:35,060
 but now He's a burning bush.

888
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:37,500
 And Moses has to stand at a distance.

889
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,020
 God comes as a cloud of fire on the top of Mount Sinai,

890
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,220
 but only Moses is allowed to come up and be in His presence.

891
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,260
 God comes in a pillar of fire into the tabernacle,

892
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:49,340
 but Israel are not allowed to go into the tabernacle.

893
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,100
 They're only allowed to stand outside of their tents

894
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,820
 and experience His glory from a distance.

895
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,820
 Then God's presence comes into the temple

896
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,020
 to the Holy of Holies,

897
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,140
 and God is with His people like never before,

898
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:01,460
 but only one person is allowed to go

899
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:03,900
 into the Holy of Holies, and only on one day a year,

900
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,340
 and only after they spent weeks

901
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,220
 cleansing and purifying themselves,

902
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:08,660
 otherwise they would be consumed

903
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:10,020
 in the Holy presence of God.

904
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,020
 So yes, God is with His people,

905
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,940
 but He's not really with His people in the fullness

906
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,020
 that Genesis 1 and 2 suggested.

907
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,420
 Are you tracking with this?

908
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:21,040
 Why is all this important?

909
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,700
 Because by the time you get to Isaiah 7,

910
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:26,540
 Israel has never been in a worse situation.

911
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,260
 War, they split up as a nation.

912
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,080
 There's now two different nations.

913
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,100
 They're dealing and struggling with idolatry and sin

914
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:34,220
 like never before,

915
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,020
 and they're wondering what's next for them.

916
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:39,980
 And God breaks into the worst moment of their lives

917
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,100
 and their history, and He says, "Guess what?

918
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,260
 Here's a sign.

919
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:45,420
 I am sending a child to you,

920
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,420
 and he will be known as Emmanuel, God with us."

921
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:53,740
 In other words, it's happening.

922
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,260
 It's gonna happen.

923
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,580
 I'm gonna restore my intimacy with you.

924
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,100
 I'm gonna restore that presence in your life.

925
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,380
 You're gonna know what it is to have that awe

926
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,700
 and that astonishment.

927
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,660
 There is a time coming in the future

928
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,860
 where you will know the fullness of the presence of God.

929
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,860
 And all of God's people began to lean

930
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:11,760
 into the messianic hope,

931
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,780
 this future long for intimacy with God.

932
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,060
 Oh, if this could only happen, if God could come.

933
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:20,980
 And the reason why they wanted that intimacy again

934
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:23,020
 was not just so they could feel nice and fluffy

935
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,860
 and like they're floating on clouds.

936
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:28,040
 They wanted the intimacy 'cause they desired shalom.

937
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:31,380
 They wanted peace on earth.

938
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:33,840
 They wanted victory from their brokenness.

939
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:36,460
 They wanted victory from all of the danger

940
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,500
 and the anger and the hurt.

941
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,020
 They wanted to be set free

942
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,860
 from the things that were chaining them.

943
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,100
 They longed to know the goodness

944
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,340
 of what it was like in Genesis 1 and 2

945
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,060
 to finally experience the goodness and the liberation

946
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,380
 and the freedom of God.

947
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:56,380
 So Emmanuel is not just a statement about God's proximity,

948
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,520
 it's also a statement of his victory.

949
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:03,420
 When they heard Emmanuel, God with us,

950
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,140
 it wasn't just like, oh, great,

951
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,580
 God's gonna come and be with me.

952
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:10,020
 It was, oh, great, there's gonna be victory finally.

953
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,180
 I'm gonna know freedom.

954
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,340
 I'm gonna know joy.

955
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,220
 I'm gonna be set right again.

956
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,820
 Are you still with me?

957
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:20,820
 Now, all of that sits behind the moment in Matthew,

958
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:27,440
 the moment where God comes and does something crazy

959
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,540
 with a virgin, with a woman

960
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,300
 who should not have been able to have a child,

961
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:35,380
 just like Isaiah had prophesied,

962
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,020
 to a man who didn't really know what was next

963
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,140
 or what to do, to a moment in Israel's history

964
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,460
 where they are under the greatest oppression and slavery

965
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:47,260
 that they had ever been under in the Greco-Roman Empire.

966
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:52,260
 And God shows up and Isaiah knows it.

967
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:56,140
 Isaiah has prophesied this some 600 years before.

968
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,260
 And Matthew takes that prophecy.

969
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,000
 And I want you to see what Matthew does.

970
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,020
 This is not arbitrary.

971
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:03,500
 He sees Jesus.

972
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,740
 He understands the birth of Jesus.

973
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:07,900
 And he's the first one in all history to go,

974
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,620
 hang on a second.

975
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:12,740
 This is exactly what Isaiah had mentioned 600 years ago.

976
00:41:12,740 --> 00:41:14,900
 And he takes the prophecy of Isaiah 7

977
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,900
 and he plants it right in his narrative

978
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:17,940
 of the birth of Jesus.

979
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,220
 And he's saying, don't you realize

980
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:21,300
 this is Emmanuel, God with us.

981
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,940
 He's talking about the incarnation of Jesus.

982
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:26,060
 He's talking about the reality that in Jesus,

983
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,220
 we have fully God and fully human.

984
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:31,780
 You see, Emmanuel is not about God being near us.

985
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,340
 Emmanuel is about God being one with us.

986
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,500
 The incarnation is the representation

987
00:41:38,500 --> 00:41:40,700
 of the greatest amount of intimacy

988
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:43,200
 God could ever have with humanity.

989
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,700
 There is no more intimate reality

990
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,220
 that you can have than Jesus Christ,

991
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:52,660
 fully God, fully human, now merged completely as one.

992
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:55,420
 That's the power of the incarnation.

993
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,400
 That's what we see at Christmas.

994
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,580
 That's the birth of Jesus.

995
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:04,580
 And this incarnation sets everything else on its axis.

996
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,460
 'Cause the victory is now here.

997
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,500
 Jesus would go on in his life, death and resurrection,

998
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,380
 to pay the price for sin,

999
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:17,380
 to stand in the gap as the only perfect sacrifice,

1000
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,660
 the one to give up his life

1001
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,020
 so that others could know freedom.

1002
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:21,540
 He would, in his resurrection,

1003
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:23,340
 show us that death is defeated,

1004
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,060
 that we are now alive in the greatest amount of living

1005
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,100
 that we could ever feel.

1006
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,820
 And yes, we still wrestle with sin.

1007
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:31,260
 We still sit in the reality of darkness around us

1008
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:33,860
 as we wait for his triumphant return.

1009
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:37,300
 But Christmas is God drawing a line in the sand

1010
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:40,580
 and saying, "I am now with you."

1011
00:42:40,580 --> 00:42:43,020
 You see, what was a messianic hope

1012
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:44,620
 for everybody in the Old Testament?

1013
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:46,300
 Oh, a time is coming when he comes,

1014
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:49,580
 is our present reality.

1015
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:50,580
 And this is why,

1016
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:53,180
 if we just casually show up for Christmas day,

1017
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:54,780
 and we're like, "Yay, Christmas day,

1018
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,060
 I guess I get presents."

1019
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:00,020
 I think God goes, "Oh, come on."

1020
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:03,060
 And I think you're more Ahaz than Matthew.

1021
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,300
 And I want you to feel Christmas again.

1022
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,380
 I want you to own it again.

1023
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:10,020
 And here's what Christmas means to you.

1024
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,820
 You are so privileged to live

1025
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:16,300
 on this side of the birth of Jesus.

1026
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:18,900
 'Cause for many people for centuries,

1027
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,180
 he was just a hope, a promise for a better day.

1028
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:24,860
 You're living in the better days.

1029
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:27,940
 So when you come to Christmas,

1030
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:32,940
 you come accepting his presence in all of you right now.

1031
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:35,260
 In every single part of you,

1032
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,260
 in all of your brokenness and your hurt, your messiness.

1033
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,460
 See, Jesus just doesn't come to you

1034
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:42,260
 when you're feeling good about it.

1035
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:43,660
 He doesn't show up in your life

1036
00:43:43,660 --> 00:43:46,780
 when you've got everything worked out nice and neat.

1037
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:49,900
 The beauty of Christmas is that he's a present for everybody.

1038
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,820
 He's here for all humanity.

1039
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:56,980
 No matter how dirty or distant you might feel right now,

1040
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:00,180
 the fullness of his presence is here.

1041
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:05,060
 The promise of better days are your days.

1042
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,940
 So Emmanuel, God with us.

1043
00:44:07,940 --> 00:44:09,780
 Emmanuel is not for the religious.

1044
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:12,940
 Emmanuel is not for the church.

1045
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:15,820
 Emmanuel is not for songs that we sing.

1046
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,620
 You wanna know what Emmanuel is for?

1047
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:19,940
 Emmanuel is for the drug addict

1048
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,340
 who's struggling to keep his life together

1049
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,300
 whilst he searches for his next fix.

1050
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:26,100
 Emmanuel is for the single mother

1051
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:27,940
 who's selling her body in one shot

1052
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,260
 to provide for her family.

1053
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:31,020
 Emmanuel is for the investment banker

1054
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:33,220
 who's struggling with suicidal thoughts

1055
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,420
 because of a position he took on the markets.

1056
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,820
 Emmanuel is for the refugee family

1057
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:41,220
 who's embedded in difficult neighbourhoods in Hong Kong

1058
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:43,140
 with racial overtones.

1059
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,700
 Emmanuel is for your senior pastor

1060
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,980
 who knows his brokenness,

1061
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:51,340
 even amongst his best ability to lead God's people.

1062
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:54,460
 And Emmanuel, mostly, is for you,

1063
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,540
 for your story, for your narrative,

1064
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:00,180
 for your narrative, your brokenness,

1065
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:02,700
 your great highs, your great lows,

1066
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,100
 for the great things that are happening in your life,

1067
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,540
 for the messy things that are happening in your life.

1068
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:08,220
 His presence is here.

1069
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:11,540
 See, Emmanuel does not mean he is close when you deserve it.

1070
00:45:11,540 --> 00:45:13,540
 Does not mean he is sometimes close.

1071
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:17,020
 It means that he is here, right here, right now.

1072
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:19,620
 That victory is yours.

1073
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:22,140
 That's Christmas.

1074
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,100
 That's the feeling I want you to have,

1075
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:26,900
 awe, astonishment, wonder,

1076
00:45:26,900 --> 00:45:30,780
 that you were chosen to live this side of Christmas

1077
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:33,180
 so that you might be able to now walk

1078
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,340
 with Emmanuel, God, with you.

1079
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:39,260
 I wonder whether I could pray for you.

1080
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:40,740
 Let's pray.

1081
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,940
 Father, I thank you so much

1082
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,820
 for every person here in this room.

1083
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:47,140
 I thank you, Lord, for every family represented,

1084
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,900
 every community represented.

1085
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:53,100
 Father, I thank you that each person here

1086
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:55,900
 is on the side of better days.

1087
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,300
 And Lord, it's easy for us to experience

1088
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,660
 all that we have in Hong Kong in the last three years

1089
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:01,780
 and ourselves long for better days,

1090
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,060
 and perhaps rightly so.

1091
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,140
 But Lord, we don't have the same longing

1092
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:10,740
 that those some 400, 500, 600 years

1093
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,420
 before the first Christmas held in their hearts,

1094
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:15,500
 because we're now walking in the time of your life,

1095
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:17,300
 death, and resurrection.

1096
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:18,340
 We're now walking in a time

1097
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:20,940
 where your Holy Spirit is made available to us.

1098
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:21,940
 We're now walking in a time

1099
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:24,100
 where it's not just one person, one time a year,

1100
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:25,740
 that can go into the Holy of Holies,

1101
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:28,500
 but it is every person all the time

1102
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,380
 welcomed into your presence.

1103
00:46:30,380 --> 00:46:33,380
 And so, Lord, I wanna pray for that for each person here.

1104
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,820
 I wanna ask, Father, that you would move

1105
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:36,700
 by your Holy Spirit right now.

1106
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,860
 Lord, I pray that we would start our Advent season

1107
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,500
 with this declaration of your presence,

1108
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:44,100
 of Emmanuel, God with us,

1109
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:46,020
 not drawing us back to the garden,

1110
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:49,140
 but taking us forward to Revelation 21, 22,

1111
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:52,540
 to a new Jerusalem, a time where you will be with us.

1112
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,740
 There will be no more suffering,

1113
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,380
 no more pain, no more hurt,

1114
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,380
 where there'll be healing for all the nations,

1115
00:46:57,380 --> 00:46:59,780
 where every tribe and tongue will confess

1116
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,660
 that you and you alone are Lord.

1117
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:05,020
 Lord, you are taking us that direction.

1118
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,100
 Lord, may our celebration of Christmas

1119
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:11,260
 still retain the awe and wonder of that first Christmas.

1120
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:14,540
 And as we long for better days,

1121
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:20,300
 may we not forget that we have our victory here in you.

1122
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:24,660
 And Lord, we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

1123
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,900
 Everyone says, would you stand with me?

1124
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:28,180
 And we're gonna respond together

1125
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:32,220
 as we sing once again of this incredible victory

1126
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:33,380
 that we have in Jesus.
