1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,520
 Let's put our hands together for Joshua for the way he leads with joy and grace.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,520
 Thank you so much.

3
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,360
 It's such a pleasure to have you with us leading up front.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,360
 How's everyone doing?

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,360
 Uh-oh.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,360
 Is it the weather?

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,080
 Do we have to pray for the weather?

8
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,080
 Please don't.

9
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:23,840
 I love this kind of weather.

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,480
 I'm going to spend Christmas in Singapore.

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:28,000
 I'm going to miss this weather.

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,000
 Anyway, anybody loves movie here?

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,720
 Okay, two of you, three of you, that's not too bad.

14
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,880
 I want to give you a little bit of local culture sort of information.

15
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:47,560
 If you've been around town lately, if you've been walking on the streets or scrolling on

16
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,040
 social media, there's actually a local movie that's under the spotlight right now.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,320
 It receives so much attention because it hit $80 million box office in just two weeks'

18
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,320
 time.

19
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,960
 Just to give you a bit of context, in Hong Kong cinema history, there's only been one

20
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,400
 movie so far that has hit the $100 million mark.

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,940
 This one, it's quite likely to be the second one.

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,360
 It receives a lot of attention.

23
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,440
 A lot of people are talking about it.

24
00:01:17,440 --> 00:01:22,760
 It has a very interesting name, interesting title.

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:32,600
 It's called The Last Dance, or The Last Dance for all my British friends here.

26
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:39,320
 It's actually about a Taoist priest or about a wedding planner who somehow entered into

27
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:42,760
 the funeral industry by chance.

28
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,280
 He had to partner with this Taoist priest.

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,840
 Through this whole process, this wedding planner turned into a funeral planner.

30
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,720
 He was learning about life and death through this whole funeral experience.

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:02:02,000
 While the Chinese name of this movie was actually taken from the very rituals that Taoists perform

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,680
 at a Chinese funeral, it's not about all these religious or spiritual practices.

33
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,240
 It's more about finding out the meaning of life and death.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:14,920
 But today I don't want to talk about this movie.

35
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,960
 I'm not going to spoil it for you guys.

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,520
 I do want to zoom in a little bit into one particular character.

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,720
 There is this family behind me on the screen.

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,320
 There is this family, the oldest guy is the Taoist priest.

39
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,880
 He performs all the rituals.

40
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,560
 In Chinese, we call him La Mo Si Fu.

41
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,880
 He does all the very funny dance.

42
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,200
 That's what he does.

43
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,680
 He actually has a son.

44
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,600
 Very conveniently, his son followed his father's footsteps and also became a Taoist priest.

45
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,960
 This would be his son right here.

46
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:54,680
 But somehow, this son of his, who himself is a Taoist priest, he actually married a

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,680
 Catholic lady.

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,840
 Or a Christian, a Catholic lady.

49
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,240
 They gave birth to a very cute son.

50
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,840
 The son followed his mom to be a Catholic.

51
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,000
 This is a true Hong Kong story in many different senses.

52
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:14,440
 But one of the ways it's very Hong Kong is that as this boy is growing up, he needs to

53
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,160
 apply for a school.

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,240
 And of course, his mom would want him to apply to get into a Catholic school or a Christian

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,440
 school.

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,000
 And this is a true Hong Kong story because the school said if both parents are baptized

57
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,000
 into the church, the boy would get extra points to get into the school.

58
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,160
 Very Hong Kong, right?

59
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:42,240
 So like what all mothers would do, this mom wearing that hat behind the husband, required,

60
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:45,520
 asked the husband, "Hey, could you get baptized?"

61
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,520
 She asked a Taoist priest to get baptized.

62
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,840
 And of course, for the son, the priest said, "Yeah, I'll do it.

63
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,920
 I'll do it for him."

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,400
 And later, okay, I know this is a bit of a spoiler, but I promise just this little bit,

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,400
 all right?

66
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,880
 You can still go to watch the movie.

67
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,240
 It's still very enjoyable with this little bit of spoiler.

68
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:10,320
 So there was one time the whole family was having dinner and the wife was doing this,

69
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,240
 "Hey, hey, hey."

70
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,240
 Like what?

71
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,120
 "Hey, now you're baptized.

72
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,920
 You got to say grace before your dinner."

73
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:26,840
 And so the Taoist priest, the younger one, was forced to say grace in front of the entire

74
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:27,840
 family.

75
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:33,560
 You can't even imagine what his father would react to that.

76
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:42,000
 It's funny, there are so many modern movies and TV shows that they would include kind

77
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,280
 of like a Christian character or a character with Christian or Catholic faith background

78
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,840
 into the plot.

79
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:53,760
 And in other shows and movies we watch, we sometimes would see that.

80
00:04:53,760 --> 00:05:00,000
 Yet, it's also not a trail of these characters and their faith.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,640
 Sometimes it's quite negative.

82
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:10,720
 In pop culture, when a Christian is in the plot of a movie or a TV show, well, at best,

83
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,080
 that character, what they want to show you is that this character is quite committed

84
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,380
 or this character has very strong moral values.

85
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,200
 But strong moral values sometimes means this character is sort of like conservative or

86
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:38,360
 old-fashioned or stubborn, illogical, judgmental, and worst case scenario, this guy is hypocritical.

87
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,720
 This is how Christians are being seen in a modern-day pop culture or in entertainment.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,440
 And sometimes we think that, "You know what?

89
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,600
 This is just stereotype just because they never step foot in a church, they never meet

90
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,040
 people like you and me.

91
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,480
 That's why they have such a stereotype."

92
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,220
 Perhaps that's what we're thinking.

93
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,880
 To a certain degree, I agree because they haven't met you guys, so that's why they don't

94
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,360
 know better.

95
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,800
 But maybe some of us here, we're rather new to this faith.

96
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:13,560
 Maybe a couple weeks ago, you were not Christians yet, and that's also how you used to see

97
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,240
 Christianity.

98
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,360
 That's how you used to see Christians.

99
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,160
 That's how you used to see people in the church, were like old-fashioned, judgmental, hypocritical,

100
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:26,840
 until you have an encounter with Jesus himself and you join a community of faith and you

101
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,760
 find, "Oh, maybe it's not that bad.

102
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:29,760
 It's a little bit different."

103
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:37,240
 Or maybe you're sitting here right now even feeling a little bit uncomfortable when you

104
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:43,640
 hear the name Christian being associated with all these qualities I just mentioned.

105
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:53,800
 But my point is, collectively as a church, we may have certain reputations.

106
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,400
 I know some of you understand what I'm talking about.

107
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,800
 I can feel it.

108
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:06,040
 I know sometimes those labels on us, they may not do us justice, but I would also like

109
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,280
 to call us to a place of reflection today, church.

110
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,600
 What do these impressions about Christians come from?

111
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,280
 Where do they come from?

112
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,320
 What are we known for in this city?

113
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,360
 What are we known for as a church here in Yuen Long?

114
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,080
 Interestingly, when we open up the New Testament and look at a group of people who are known

115
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:34,360
 as the Pharisees, they have certain reputations as well.

116
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:39,840
 As a New Testament reader, as we read through this book, we probably form our opinions about

117
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:46,400
 them based on the narratives and the comments in the gospel story about this group of people.

118
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:52,000
 We normally know the Pharisees as they're stubborn, they're judgmental, legalistic,

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,120
 self-righteous, hypocritic.

120
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,720
 That's how we see them.

121
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:05,040
 And surely if one of these Pharisees, if they were alive today, and if he stand right here

122
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:11,520
 with us in this room right now, he would tell you, or he would try to tell you a different

123
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,520
 story.

124
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:17,040
 He would try to disagree with all the labels we had on them, and he would start to explain

125
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:23,680
 to us what Pharisees believe in and what are the practices all about.

126
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:30,960
 They were actually a group or a movement started about 150 years before the time of Jesus.

127
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,880
 That's a period of time between the Old Testament and the New Testament.

128
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,560
 And just as the prophet Daniel prophesied in the Old Testament, there were rulers or

129
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:49,440
 nations rising to power to rule over the Jews or Israel after they returned from exile.

130
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,560
 We know that Persia actually replaced Babylon as the new superpower.

131
00:08:54,560 --> 00:09:00,840
 And then we all heard about Alexander the Great, his Greek empire took over the entire

132
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:05,120
 region and then it was the Romans.

133
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,440
 But when Alexander the Great, when the Greek empire took over that area, they tried to

134
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
 do something.

135
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,820
 Well, the Romans actually copied them as well.

136
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,520
 They tried to export their own culture, their language, their practices, their philosophies.

137
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:26,960
 They've been teaching everyone in the entire empire in different regions how to talk right

138
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,120
 in Greek, how to think like a Greek.

139
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,120
 They've been doing that.

140
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,800
 So that's why in the New Testament, the language of the Bible is no longer written in Hebrew.

141
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,320
 It's actually written in Greek, Koine Greek.

142
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,400
 Oh yes, yes, positive, yes.

143
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,400
 It's Koine Greek.

144
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
 It's not classical Greek.

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,120
 It's not the modern Greek we're reading.

146
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:49,720
 It's a very special form of Greek that was popular during that time.

147
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:53,720
 So we read the New Testament or it's written in Greek.

148
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,280
 But not just that.

149
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:02,160
 When this language, we do have a lot of Hong Kongers here who are slightly more mature

150
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
 in age.

151
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,220
 We were born before 1997.

152
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:12,120
 So you would have a sense of, you know what it means to be in a colony.

153
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,600
 Some of us here, like myself, I'm Chinese.

154
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:20,800
 Well, speaking about my ethnicity, but I grew up learning English.

155
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,360
 That's why I can preach here today.

156
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:27,040
 I grew up learning English because we were a British colony.

157
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,000
 And I don't just learn English.

158
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,600
 I learn, I pick up the way how English speakers would think.

159
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,680
 I pick up the way, I pick up Western philosophies as well.

160
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:42,520
 Because of that, I pick up a little bit, just a little bit of Westerner kind of lifestyle.

161
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:49,480
 So when these Jewish people, when they were being influenced by the Greek or Roman culture,

162
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,600
 it's not just the language they spoke that was influenced.

163
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,440
 It's also the way they think, the way they see life.

164
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,840
 And they slowly shifted away from the original Hebrew roots.

165
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,600
 And there was a group of Jewish people.

166
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,980
 They saw that.

167
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:14,600
 They saw how the people are no longer rooted in their faith, in this Hebrew faith of theirs.

168
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,400
 And so they decided to do something.

169
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:21,320
 And they recognized that if there's one thing that sets them apart from the rest of all

170
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,240
 the other nations or people around them, that would actually be God's word.

171
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:30,220
 More precisely, that would be the law of God, the law of Moses.

172
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:36,300
 And so this particular group of people, they started devoting themselves to studying, to

173
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,060
 try, not, well, translating a little bit as well.

174
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:45,880
 Studying, they copy it, and they started teaching the word of God or the law or the prophets.

175
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,400
 And these group of people, they said, we must align our lifestyle with the standard of the

176
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,760
 law of Moses.

177
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,200
 And that's not enough.

178
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:58,200
 Sometimes we don't know specifically in our everyday life how we can actually practice

179
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,200
 that.

180
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,080
 So we should come up, we should extend it a little bit, give it a little bit of commentary.

181
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:07,120
 And we have all these oral traditions.

182
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,680
 And this group of people, now we know them as the Pharisees.

183
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:19,380
 If we look at the name Pharisee itself, it's actually from an Aramaic word called perushim.

184
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:24,180
 It actually means to separate, to divide, or distinguish.

185
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,440
 So they are saying, we are the separated ones.

186
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,120
 We are the ones who are set apart.

187
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,120
 Does that ring a bell?

188
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,200
 Does that sound familiar?

189
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,240
 Maybe you've heard of it in the church before as well.

190
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,800
 We are the holy one.

191
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,220
 We're the separated ones.

192
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,640
 We are the one that are set apart.

193
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,600
 And they just keep doing this and doing this.

194
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,940
 They try their best to interpret whatever laws they know about and how to apply that

195
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,880
 in their everyday life.

196
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,260
 And so, and they come up with more and more and more rules and traditions.

197
00:12:56,260 --> 00:13:01,040
 If there's one thing, this group of Pharisees, they want to be known for, they want to be

198
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,260
 known as the righteous people.

199
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,800
 They want to be known as the pious people.

200
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:15,720
 But fast forward 150 years later, when we meet them in the stories of the New Testament,

201
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,800
 their reputation wasn't quite what they wished for.

202
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,380
 Self-righteous, legalistic, judgmental, hypocritical.

203
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:26,900
 These were their reputations.

204
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,840
 And this is how they are remembered for thousands of years now.

205
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:39,740
 And the problem is, church, there was a gap between what their beliefs stood for and what

206
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,140
 they were known for.

207
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,060
 Let me repeat again.

208
00:13:43,060 --> 00:13:49,620
 I believe this group of Pharisees, when they first started, they have every good intention

209
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,060
 to honor God, to do His will.

210
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:58,260
 But what their beliefs actually stood for and what they were ultimately known for, there's

211
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,660
 a gap there.

212
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:04,420
 And that's a problem or a question for us today as well.

213
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:10,780
 When we look at our reputation as a church in the city or as the church in the city or

214
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:19,340
 in this world, is there a gap between what our faith stands for and what we're known

215
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,340
 for?

216
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,380
 So we reflect on this together today.

217
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:31,380
 I do want to open the Bible and read yet another of Jesus's parables with us today.

218
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:38,260
 We're going to look at Luke 14, and here's the background in first one.

219
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:45,620
 Luke 14, first one, it says this, "One Sabbath when Jesus went to eat in a house of a prominent

220
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,420
 Pharisee, He was being carefully watched."

221
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:56,060
 One verse, but there's tons of information in this single verse.

222
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,220
 So first of all, this is a Sabbath.

223
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,340
 And it's important because, again, spoiler alert, a miracle is going to happen in this

224
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:08,980
 chapter and it's going to take place later.

225
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,580
 In the Gospels altogether, in all four Gospels altogether, there were seven recorded miracles

226
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,980
 on Sabbath.

227
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:21,380
 And this is the last healing miracle on Sabbath in the writings of Luke, and there were two

228
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,140
 before it.

229
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,460
 But every single time when Jesus performed a healing miracle or any miracle on Sabbath,

230
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:35,060
 the result was always that some kind of tension and conflict would rise up between Him and

231
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,620
 the Pharisees.

232
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,700
 Because in the Pharisees' interpretation of the law, no work is to be done on Sabbath,

233
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,380
 like not at all.

234
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:50,060
 And performing miracle, healing someone, it's actually work.

235
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,860
 It's productivity, I guess, you get someone healed, hallelujah.

236
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:59,620
 But that means if Jesus heals someone on Sabbath, He's breaking the law.

237
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:02,020
 He's breaking the law of Moses.

238
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:06,620
 That makes Him a very terrible person, or at least according to their version or their

239
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,860
 interpretation of the law.

240
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:16,380
 And so now a leader of the Pharisees invited Jesus for a meal in His house, and they are

241
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,420
 watching Him.

242
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:21,740
 "My eyes are on you.

243
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,540
 We're watching you."

244
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:29,540
 The immediate story tells us that there was a man that was ill with a disease called dropsy,

245
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:32,600
 some sort of like swelling in the body.

246
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,740
 But this is interesting.

247
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:40,820
 Sick people, like we've always explained here, sick people in those days are considered,

248
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,780
 they're probably sinners.

249
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:48,140
 And these Pharisees who want to set apart from bad people, from sinful people, they

250
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,500
 try to stay away from them as much as possible.

251
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:58,380
 But in the house of a Pharisee leader, there is a sick person.

252
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:01,820
 There's a possibly sinner here.

253
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:07,380
 So I could only guess this is probably a setup because they're watching what Jesus is going

254
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,420
 to do.

255
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:09,940
 This is totally a setup.

256
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,840
 But you know that every time you put a sick person with Jesus in the same room, there's

257
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,380
 only one thing that could happen.

258
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,460
 The sick person walks out being healed.

259
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,060
 I think we need more of that, amen?

260
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,060
 We need more.

261
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:26,660
 We need to put sick people in the same room with Jesus more so that they get healed.

262
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,500
 So Jesus would perform his miracles.

263
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,500
 We need that.

264
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,780
 And so that's what happened.

265
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,220
 And then this is what's happened next.

266
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:37,860
 I'm going to start from verse seven.

267
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:43,720
 So when Jesus noticed how the guests picked the places of honor at the table, he told

268
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,340
 them this parable.

269
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:50,420
 When someone invites you to a wedding feast, do not take the place of honor for a person

270
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:53,700
 more distinguished than you may have been invited.

271
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:59,220
 If so, the host who invited both of you will come and say to you, give this person your

272
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
 seat.

273
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:05,160
 Then humiliated, you will have to take the least important place.

274
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:10,460
 But when you are invited, take the lowest place so that when your host comes, he will

275
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,700
 say to you, friend, move up to a better place.

276
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,380
 And you will be honored in the presence of all the other guests.

277
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:23,060
 For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled and those who humble themselves will

278
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,060
 be exalted.

279
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:30,540
 Then Jesus said to his host, when you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your friends,

280
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,860
 your brothers or sisters, your relatives, or your rich neighbors.

281
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:39,420
 If you do, they may invite you back and so you will be repaid.

282
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:44,940
 But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, the blind, and you

283
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,660
 will be blessed.

284
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:54,580
 Although they cannot repay you, you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous.

285
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:59,700
 So first of all, when we look at this passage, who are these guests?

286
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,900
 Easy.

287
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:07,540
 Those are the Pharisees, teachers, experts of the law who come all the way just to watch

288
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:09,460
 Jesus.

289
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:16,180
 And here Luke described Jesus noticed how they picked the places of honor, the front

290
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:20,420
 row seats, the head table at the banquet.

291
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:24,860
 To give you a little bit of context, in a Jewish feast those days, they adopted the

292
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:28,340
 Greco-Roman furniture called a triclinium.

293
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:31,680
 Oh, that's this table right here.

294
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:37,920
 It's a couch for three people and they will put different triclinia together and they

295
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,720
 will arrange it in a U shape.

296
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:46,680
 And what they do is the guests would recline on this table on their left elbow.

297
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:50,520
 They would all recline like this and they eat and they chat.

298
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,600
 That's how they spend the evening.

299
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,200
 I don't know how they can do that all night.

300
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,880
 If I do this for 50 minutes, I'll have a cramp.

301
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,400
 I don't know how to do that.

302
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,520
 But that's their culture.

303
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:05,120
 And the places of honor, it's here in the center of that table.

304
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,360
 And also those seats like right next to him, those on his left, on his right, who would

305
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:14,880
 either sit at his back or the other one who would be sitting there and leaning into his

306
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,960
 bosom.

307
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,440
 These are the places of honor.

308
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,840
 And Jesus was saying, "Hey, do not pick these."

309
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,640
 In today's culture, this would be the head table, the front row seat where you have a

310
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,640
 sign VIP there.

311
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,720
 So these people, they want to be VIPs.

312
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:34,920
 The Pharisees like to pick these places of honor.

313
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,960
 Jesus actually mentioned this in different locations in the Bible.

314
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,720
 If you flip through all the gospels, you would see Jesus commenting on this practice or this

315
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:48,880
 behavior that they like the VIP seats, they like to be VIP.

316
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,620
 And so Jesus, he decided to tell them something, to share a message with them.

317
00:20:54,620 --> 00:21:01,040
 But what's interesting here is that this message, which appear, Jesus was just addressing that

318
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:07,160
 behavior, kind of like what Jesus was telling these Pharisees, it's just what's happening

319
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:10,240
 regarding the scene right there.

320
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:15,600
 And in fact, he didn't just comment on their behavior on the spot.

321
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,780
 He turned this whole scenario into a parable.

322
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:26,200
 He wanted to tell them something about the kingdom of God through this scenario.

323
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:31,720
 So Jesus, all these words, yes, it relate directly, it's relevant directly to what happened

324
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,120
 in that house of the Pharisee that night.

325
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,600
 But Jesus wanted to tell them something more than that.

326
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,440
 Jesus wanted to tell them something about the kingdom of God because his conclusion

327
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,480
 in verse 11 is this, "For all those who exalt themselves will be humbled and all those who

328
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,040
 humble themselves will be exalted."

329
00:21:53,040 --> 00:22:00,640
 These are the exact wordings found in another parable about the Pharisees' prayer and the

330
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:05,220
 tax collectors' prayer in Luke 18, and Pastor John preached that to us several weeks ago.

331
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:10,880
 But why is this parable in the Pharisees' house, why is it a parable about the kingdom

332
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,880
 of God?

333
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,440
 Why don't we take a closer look?

334
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:20,760
 It says the proud will be humbled and the humbled will be exalted.

335
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,200
 So in English, you know, grammar, this is passive tense.

336
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,200
 They will be humbled, they will be exalted.

337
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,340
 Now the question is, who is going to exalt them?

338
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,700
 Who is going to humble them?

339
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,480
 And this is the kind of writing technique of the Jews.

340
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:41,600
 The scholars of the Bible actually call this grammar or this figure of speech, they call

341
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,160
 it the divine passive.

342
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:48,760
 Meaning that they omitted the mentioning of God here as a form of respect.

343
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:56,640
 But Jesus was indeed pointing to the moment of the final judgment when God himself will

344
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,560
 be there, sit in front of everyone.

345
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:05,320
 And all those who exalt themselves while they're in this life, God is going to humble them.

346
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,680
 Those who humble themselves in this life, God is going to exalt them.

347
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,180
 God is going to raise them up.

348
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,020
 This is God's doing.

349
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:16,680
 This is what he wants to do.

350
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:22,440
 It may appear here that Jesus was giving them a word of advice about the social life.

351
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:30,980
 But if we look closer, Jesus really wanted to communicate the ultimate reality that they

352
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,720
 and all of us here, it's going to face one day.

353
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,840
 And so church, get ready for that.

354
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:45,000
 Because how you choose to live in this life would affect how you spend eternity.

355
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:51,380
 You can try every day, try your very best to promote yourself, to gain status, and to

356
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:57,980
 be powerful, to be famous, to look good in front of other people, trying to be somebody

357
00:23:57,980 --> 00:24:01,600
 while you are in this life.

358
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,500
 And then you spend eternity as a nobody.

359
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:13,380
 Or you can live your life in a way that as though you are a nobody here in this part

360
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,980
 of the world, in this life.

361
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:21,460
 And the day when you stand before the King of Kings, the Lord of Lords, when you stand

362
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:28,020
 before his throne, he will tell you, "My son, my friend, come.

363
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:31,660
 I have the place of honor for you.

364
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:36,100
 You are my VIP in my kingdom.

365
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:40,100
 Somebody will know you as a somebody in eternity.

366
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
 It's our choice.

367
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,940
 It's up to us."

368
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:46,500
 He's asking us, "What would you choose?

369
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:53,420
 How are you going to choose in your everyday life while you're on this side of eternity?"

370
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,020
 And the most beautiful thing here is that we thought, yeah, Jesus is rebuking these

371
00:24:58,020 --> 00:25:01,760
 Pharisees, saying, "You know, you guys are so bad."

372
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:07,220
 But in fact, Jesus is giving them a choice, offering them a choice.

373
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:11,780
 Jesus is warning them, "God would humble you one day if you don't humble yourself right

374
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:12,780
 now."

375
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:19,460
 But he also invites them into the humility, into humbling themselves.

376
00:25:19,460 --> 00:25:27,140
 So one day when they stand before the judgment of God, they will actually be exalted by God.

377
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:30,020
 Jesus is not here to condemn them right now.

378
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:33,600
 He's inviting them into that ultimate reality.

379
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:40,280
 I do want to exalt you, my friends, but first you do have to humble yourself in this life

380
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:49,040
 so that one day when I meet you in that final judgment, I can exalt you.

381
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:55,400
 And as Christians, I'm sure we've all heard about the virtue of humility, but this is

382
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,200
 a tricky part, church.

383
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,940
 I struggled with that myself as well in my life.

384
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:08,280
 If we spend the rest of our lives trying to be humble, trying to do or say all sorts of

385
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:14,680
 things to look humble, to sound humble, and at the end of the day, we go home, we look

386
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:19,440
 at ourselves and say, "Oh, I'm such a humble person today.

387
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,640
 When I talk to Pastor Tim, oh, I was so humble just now.

388
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:29,720
 Oh, when I talk to my friend, oh, I'm such a nice guy.

389
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,880
 I finally achieved humility."

390
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:37,120
 Oh, so good, right?

391
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,380
 That's the voice of pride speaking, right?

392
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:47,320
 And so let me do read you a paragraph from C.S. Lewis.

393
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:52,580
 He says this, "Do not imagine that if you meet a really humble man, he will be what

394
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:55,320
 most people call humble nowadays.

395
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,440
 He will not be sort of greasy, you know, swarmy person who is always telling you that, of

396
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,440
 course, he's nobody.

397
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:05,160
 He's not going to say that to you.

398
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,720
 Probably all you will think about him is that he seemed a cheerful, intelligent chap who

399
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,520
 took a real interest in what you said to him.

400
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:18,660
 If you do dislike him, it will be because you feel a little bit envious of anyone who

401
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:22,580
 seems to enjoy life so easily.

402
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,760
 He will not be thinking about humility.

403
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:30,720
 Well, in fact, he will not be thinking about himself at all."

404
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:35,040
 Okay, if anyone, if you need to take picture, do it now.

405
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,380
 I'm going to move on.

406
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,800
 And there's another pastor, Pastor Rick Warren, he said something quite similar, which is

407
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,240
 complimentary to what I read just now.

408
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:48,960
 He said, "Humility is not thinking less of yourself.

409
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,660
 It is thinking of yourself less.

410
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:55,440
 Humility is thinking more of others.

411
00:27:55,440 --> 00:28:03,020
 Humble people are so focused on serving others, they don't think of themselves."

412
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:06,500
 And so you see, here's the problem with the Pharisees.

413
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:08,900
 Yes, they've been trying to obey the law.

414
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:14,960
 They've been trying to fulfill all these requirements, but their focus was still on themselves.

415
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,720
 They thought about themselves too much.

416
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:27,160
 If we focus solely on ourselves, our pursuit of righteousness will eventually turn into

417
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,160
 self-righteousness.

418
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:30,800
 Let me say that again.

419
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:40,020
 If we focus solely on ourselves, our pursuit of righteousness will inevitably lead to self-righteousness.

420
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,940
 I don't know what motivates us to read the Bible, to come to church on a Sunday, to sing

421
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:49,640
 those worship songs, to behave like a Christian every day.

422
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,140
 But if we are doing that for ourselves, if we're trying to make ourselves feel better,

423
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:59,260
 that I'm a Christian, so I'm better than, "Oh, that person sitting next to me at work,

424
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,260
 he's not a Christian.

425
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,580
 He has all these bad habits in life.

426
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:07,340
 I'm a better man than him, and I'm sorry."

427
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:14,540
 Our pursuit of righteousness will just turn us into another self-righteous person.

428
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:20,660
 So Jesus actually offered the antidote to pride in the following.

429
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,180
 In the next story, he reads that, "When you give a luncheon or dinner, do not invite your

430
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,580
 friends, your brothers or sisters, your relatives, your rich neighbors.

431
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:32,660
 If you do, they may invite you back so you will be repaid.

432
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:38,820
 But when you give a banquet, invite the poor, the cripple, the lame, the blind, and you

433
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:40,780
 will be blessed.

434
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:47,660
 Although they cannot repay you, but you will be repaid at the resurrection of the righteous."

435
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:53,020
 So we got to think about others, those around us.

436
00:29:53,020 --> 00:30:00,460
 If you can give without expecting anything in return, not even how much praise you will

437
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,220
 receive because of that.

438
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:07,960
 If I'm buying someone dinner, and I'm expecting that person to go around, "Oh, you know Chapman

439
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:09,260
 bought me dinner last night.

440
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:11,020
 He's just such a nice person."

441
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,980
 That's what you're getting in return.

442
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,700
 That doesn't count if you do it for nothing in return, and you just focus on meeting the

443
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:25,780
 needs of others around you, serving them wholeheartedly.

444
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,340
 That's humility in God's eyes.

445
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:36,300
 I remember a couple of years ago, before we have this church here in Yuen Long, me, Pastor

446
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,260
 Ivan, Pastor Tim, we were all part of the Wan Chai pastoral staff.

447
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,740
 And so we work in Wan Chai every Sunday.

448
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:48,100
 I remember there was this particular service one Sunday.

449
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:52,140
 Halfway through the service, the preacher has already been preaching, speaking on the

450
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,440
 stage.

451
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,940
 And there was a person walking through the door, slowly moving towards the front of the

452
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:02,140
 stage to the front row.

453
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,180
 And I can assure you, most of the time in Wan Chai, well, like our English services,

454
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:10,060
 the whole church is just very packed.

455
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,700
 There's no seat at all, but he was walking on the front row.

456
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:18,340
 And later I found out he might have a little bit of special needs.

457
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:24,780
 And as the staff on the roster, when I saw that, my first response is, "Oh my gosh, he's

458
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:25,780
 disturbing the service.

459
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:27,220
 I got to do something.

460
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,720
 Maybe I should bring him somewhere else.

461
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,260
 Maybe I should put him to the back."

462
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,700
 I was running all these different scenarios.

463
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,700
 How should I react?

464
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:37,380
 But luckily, or unluckily, I was actually on the balcony.

465
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,660
 I was so far away from that.

466
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:40,900
 So I was just mentally, what should I do?

467
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:44,620
 What would I do if I'm down there in the lower house?

468
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:50,980
 While I was still thinking about all these, that day, Pastor John, our founding pastor,

469
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,220
 he was actually there in the service.

470
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:57,220
 And he was sitting in the front seat, right in the middle on the first row.

471
00:31:57,220 --> 00:32:02,540
 So the next moment, what I saw was, as the guy was walking alongside, I saw that John

472
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:10,500
 actually stood up, gently escorting that man to his seat, and he quietly walked towards

473
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,820
 the back for the rest of the service.

474
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,420
 And I was watching on the balcony.

475
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:19,340
 I was telling myself, "He is the founding pastor.

476
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:26,660
 If there's one man who deserves to remain in his seat, that would be John."

477
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:31,200
 And he taught me a lesson that day.

478
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,900
 I look at John, I saw what he did, and I was telling myself, "Man, I hope one day when

479
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:42,980
 I am his age, I could do the same."

480
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:45,140
 In my heart, it's not filled with entitlement.

481
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:50,100
 Well, I'm somebody, somebody, that somebody else should move away from their seats.

482
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,940
 I should be here.

483
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:54,420
 Somebody should be giving me their seats, not the other way around.

484
00:32:54,420 --> 00:33:02,300
 I hope one day when I reach there, I could still do that.

485
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:08,780
 I think sometimes we do feel we're entitled to some things because of how much effort

486
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,340
 we put into something of our expertise, how good or how much good we've done, and we thought

487
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:18,380
 we're entitled to something.

488
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:22,540
 Humility is not thinking less of yourself, not thinking, "Oh, I don't deserve to be seated

489
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:23,540
 here."

490
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,860
 It's not like that.

491
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,380
 Humility is not thinking less of yourself.

492
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:31,840
 Humility is simply thinking of yourself less.

493
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,700
 Think about others.

494
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:42,980
 I'm wondering today if you have a seat, who can you give that seat to?

495
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:46,380
 Who would you give up that seat for?

496
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:51,780
 Is it only someone whom you think is more superior than you, have a high status than

497
00:33:51,780 --> 00:34:00,140
 you, have a better reputation than you, older than you, look better than you, or you're

498
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:06,220
 just going to give it to someone who is in need?

499
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:12,380
 What do we want to be known for as a church in our city?

500
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:18,580
 The Pharisee loves places of honor at feasts and best seats in the synagogue.

501
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:21,340
 How about us?

502
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:28,100
 Do we or can we do the opposite by giving the seats to other people, the best seats

503
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,580
 to different people?

504
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:38,100
 Can we act in a way that communicates to those around us that we think they are more important?

505
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:45,900
 Can we ask God to bring us to a place where we think of ourselves less and think of others

506
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:48,340
 more?

507
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:53,460
 That's my prayer for myself.

508
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,780
 That's my prayer for my church family.

509
00:34:56,780 --> 00:35:02,820
 I do think that there is a gap between what our faith stands for and what we're known

510
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,900
 for in the city right now.

511
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:07,260
 I do think that gap exists.

512
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:17,420
 My prayer, my desire is to see that the church will have a better reputation here.

513
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:26,260
 But as the evangelist Moody, he says this, "If I take care of my character, my reputation

514
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:29,300
 will take care of itself."

515
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:35,500
 I do think we need to close that gap, but that gap is not reputation.

516
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:41,220
 That gap indeed is character.

517
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:49,500
 What our faith stands for and how we behave, what we're known for, can we close that gap?

518
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:54,980
 And don't do it by our own power and don't come one day, "Oh, I finally closed that gap.

519
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,300
 I've done it."

520
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:00,780
 Let's just think of ourselves less.

521
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:08,580
 Let's think of those around us, those in the city, more in our everyday life.

522
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:20,260
 I care deeply about the reputation of our church and the church in our city, in our

523
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,260
 world.

524
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:22,980
 And we don't need better marketing.

525
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,500
 We don't need better branding.

526
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,820
 We just need to work on our character.

527
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:34,540
 And I need to work on my character.

528
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:40,940
 And I believe as we start to do that, as we invite the Holy Spirit into our hearts, as

529
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:47,500
 we work on our character, I believe our reputation will start to work on itself.

530
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:53,420
 My dream is that somewhere in the future, maybe the next generation, when my daughters

531
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:59,300
 get to go into movies, when their portrayal of Christian characters in those movie, those

532
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:05,780
 characters are not known for being legalistic or self-righteous or hypocritic.

533
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:12,020
 They will be known for how they long to sacrifice for other people.

534
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,780
 They will be known for their service for other people.

535
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:22,980
 I long for the day that this is how the world will see what they will see in us.

536
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:27,220
 And this, we cannot control how other people see us right now.

537
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:32,880
 We cannot control how they perceive us because of the past, but we can start today.

538
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,340
 We can decide how they will see us tomorrow.

539
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:43,220
 And I think as we draw close to a parable series, as God is calling us into his kingdom,

540
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,620
 you understand what it means?

541
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:50,540
 My prayer is that by understanding the parable of Jesus, by understanding his heart a little

542
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:56,580
 bit more, by understanding how he wants to run his kingdom, we will start to manifest

543
00:37:56,580 --> 00:38:00,660
 that kingdom in Yuen Long and in our city.

544
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:05,580
 If you want to be part of that, can I invite you to stand and pray?

545
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:24,340
 Holy Spirit, I thank you.

546
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:30,940
 You always come and pour out God's love into our hearts, come and heal our wounds, come

547
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:37,780
 and embrace us, come and draw near to us so that we could feel secure, we could feel loved.

548
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:41,260
 I thank you for that.

549
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,940
 But Jesus also mentioned that you would come into our hearts and point us into the word

550
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,320
 of God.

551
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:53,580
 You would bring us into truth and you would transform our character so that we look more

552
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,240
 like Jesus.

553
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,660
 And that's what I'm praying for right now, Holy Spirit.

554
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:03,720
 Come, come and fill us.

555
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:10,060
 Come and fill the body of Jesus in this room right now.

556
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:20,440
 God, I don't pray that we, by our effort, we would close that gap between our reputation

557
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:28,340
 and what our faith actually stands for, but I do pray that we can close that gap between

558
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:35,100
 your word and the reality of our heart and our character right now.

559
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:39,740
 I pray that you would come and close that gap, that you would come and grow us.

560
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:47,860
 We pray that we would be a community that really grow big people, people who demonstrate

561
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:56,060
 the character of Jesus, who shows the mercy, who shows the love, who shows the servant

562
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:00,940
 heart of Jesus in our city.

563
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:05,020
 I pray that if there are strongholds in our hearts, if there are things that are hindering

564
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:11,180
 us from moving in that direction, I pray that by the power of resurrection right now, you

565
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:17,220
 would come and destroy those strongholds in our life and you would take every thought

566
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,220
 of us captive right now.

567
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:28,540
 I pray that we could align our hearts with yours today once again, Lord.

568
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,540
 Come and fill us.

569
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:34,620
 Come and fill us up, Lord.

570
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,780
 We need your grace.

571
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,020
 We need your mercy.

572
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:41,780
 We need your encouragement.

573
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:46,520
 We need you to come and be that fire inside of us.

574
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:54,660
 Keep burning inside of us until our hearts fully burn for Jesus and we only live for

575
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,660
 him.

576
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,660
 So come, Lord.

577
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,660
 Lord.
