[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   - Well, good morning, everybody.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   - Good morning.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.460]   - Everyone doing okay?
[00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:05.300]   - Yeah.
[00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:06.140]   - Great.
[00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.200]   I brought some things with me today
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.440]   that I want to show and tell you guys about.
[00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.020]   There are two specific things, okay?
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.740]   These two things are pretty important to me.
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.800]   They've shaped the way that I see life, myself, God.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.400]   They've been with me for a long time.
[00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.340]   Well, one of them is new.
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.700]   The other's been with me for a very long time.
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.000]   But they've really impacted my perspective.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.200]   These two things are surrounded by two stories,
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.720]   two very distinct contexts and situations
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.900]   in which these two things will find their meaning.
[00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.680]   So I'm pretty excited to share them with you.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.760]   One of these things I never, ever share
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.080]   'cause it's quite close to the chest,
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.340]   but it's pretty important.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.460]   So the first thing, I have to roll up my sleeve to show you.
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.380]   I have this scar on my arm.
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.280]   It's not a birthmark.
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.600]   I actually don't have any birthmarks.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.800]   I have just a scar.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.240]   I also took a lovely photo so you guys could see it
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:03.720]   since you're not super close to me.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.680]   This scar is a reminder.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.600]   I was born in Monrovia, Liberia in West Africa.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.960]   In 1990, in the middle of a civil war,
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.060]   my mother, who is a living saint,
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.800]   had to endure one of the most horrific civil wars
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.840]   while pregnant.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.200]   This scar reminds me of God's provision and protection.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.200]   See, my mother had many instances,
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.520]   I was talking to her this morning
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.000]   to make sure I got this story right,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.180]   many instances where she was shot at.
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.000]   There was one moment where she was running for her life,
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.760]   eight months pregnant after laying on the floor,
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.700]   running for her life.
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.400]   And the step that she took, if she hadn't stopped,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.620]   a bullet would have completely went through her stomach,
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.480]   killing her and killing me.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.240]   This was one of many instances
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.680]   where my mother experienced God's provision.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.600]   Multiple times, the village that we were living in,
[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.080]   we were moving from village to village,
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.360]   we'd wake up and find that everyone around us
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.080]   had been killed except for my family.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.520]   A very ridiculously disgusting and horrific place
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.560]   is how I was brought into this world.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.240]   I was brought into this world with no doctors,
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.600]   with no hospitals, outside in the rain, in a bush.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.120]   This scar is from one of those stories.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.460]   And it just reminds me regularly,
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:20.180]   man, God has seen me through.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.080]   I wouldn't physically be here
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.080]   had it not been for the work of God in my life.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.520]   And it's something that I'm so glad I have this scar
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.880]   because I know God has seen me through,
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.200]   I know God is working for me,
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.100]   but this scar is a physical reminder
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:40.240]   that God is doing impossible things for me.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.320]   He's fighting battles that I can't fight for myself.
[00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.680]   That's my first piece of show and tell.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.840]   I have a second piece that I keep in my wallet.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.840]   I've kept it with me since July 6th, 2021.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.880]   This is the little thing that they put on babies
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.280]   when they're born.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.960]   My son was born here in Hong Kong on July 6th at a hospital
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.520]   and his birth was very different than mine.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.840]   He was actually born in a hospital.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.640]   I was born in a field outside a hospital in a bush,
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.000]   very, very different situations.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.360]   He had doctors and midwives.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.280]   My wife was able to get the epidural
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.760]   so that it wouldn't hurt as bad,
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.620]   still painful, but not as bad.
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.820]   Whereas my mother had absolutely nothing.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.680]   She had no doctors.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.200]   My grandmother was the person that delivered me
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.440]   and had no medical experience whatsoever outside.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.160]   My son was born into a very great situation.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.200]   My wife went into labor and it was intense and it was hard,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.360]   but she got to the hospital at two o'clock that afternoon
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.640]   on July 6th and Elias came out at 4.16 p.m.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.300]   So she had a pretty great, she's very grateful for it,
[00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:52.400]   a pretty great labor.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.120]   But I tell you these details in these stories
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.940]   because these two show and tell pieces are very different,
[00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.440]   yet they're connected.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.440]   Like the idea that God would see me through all of this
[00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.680]   and then allow me to have a kid
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.160]   who I would have never expected,
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.920]   my mom who's watching today would have never fathomed
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.480]   that I would live, that I would survive,
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.560]   and that I would be able to have a kid who's healthy,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.840]   who was born in a hospital, who had doctors,
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.920]   who my wife was able to be taken care of.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.000]   It's a ridiculous story of the reach of God
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.400]   across multiple generations.
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.300]   And I keep it with me 'cause it's very important.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.000]   These two little details in my life
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.400]   have produced something in me.
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.200]   They have shaped the way that I see things.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.500]   The context around these stories and these specific times
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.400]   have impacted me so much that I live in response
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.480]   to the revelation that they've created in my life.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:57.140]   These circumstances and experiences
[00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.280]   have shaped how I worship.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.600]   See, God ends up showing us something.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.480]   He showed his faithfulness.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.200]   He showed that he's good.
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.080]   He showed that he can fight battles for me,
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.080]   and I can't help but respond by telling of that goodness,
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.360]   of speaking of what God is.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.200]   And when God works in a miraculous way,
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.920]   when you see the favor of God,
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:27.000]   can you not but share it, but tell it, but speak it?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.860]   This show and tell concept is a very basic,
[00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.100]   but it's one of the most fundamental ways
[00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.880]   in which we worship.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.280]   Show and tell worship is oftentimes rooted
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.360]   in a specific set of circumstances.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.640]   Something happened at a certain time
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.800]   where it was challenging and God showed up,
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.760]   and we respond to that in our worship.
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:48.760]   Show and tell worship isn't arbitrary.
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.920]   It's deeply rooted.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:53.760]   It starts off where we note something about God,
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.000]   we observe something about God,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   and it continues as we respond
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.520]   and speak and tell of that thing.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.200]   This kind of worship is a response to the God that we see.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.960]   We put it in the language that's pretty similar
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.680]   to this sermon series.
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.760]   And Pastor Andrew has been asking us the question
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.320]   throughout this series, what will we see?
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:16.840]   What will we see?
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.640]   God is doing a new thing, but will we see it?
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.080]   See, if our worship can be a response to what God is doing,
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:28.760]   then we have to be able to see the new thing God is doing.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.360]   Will we see it?
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.440]   Seeing that new thing that God is doing,
[00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:35.400]   unfortunately, isn't always easy.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.000]   So the passage that we've been studying,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.960]   we've been rooted around this passage in Isaiah,
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.800]   and the context of what these people's lives were
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.160]   were pretty frustrating.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.040]   They once were a kingdom that was sufficient,
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:51.440]   that was ruling at the height of their level,
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.000]   and they now live exiled from their kingdom,
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.520]   destroyed homes, burnt city, temple, completely ransacked.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:59.680]   They've got nothing.
[00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:02.960]   It's like God is far away while they're in a foreign land.
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.040]   They've heard situations, and they know the stories,
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.080]   they have the scriptures of where God parted the Red Seas,
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.120]   four people, but God hasn't parted their Red Sea yet.
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:15.040]   They're still stuck in exile.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.000]   It feels like they're defeated.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.320]   It feels like God is distant, like God is silent,
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.560]   and they're wondering will we ever see the good days again?
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.200]   And it's in this context,
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:33.200]   it's in this stuck, frustrating exile context
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.640]   that God speaks to the prophet of Isaiah saying,
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:41.440]   guys, behold, I'm about to do something new.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.280]   I'm doing something new, something different than before.
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.600]   Do you perceive it?
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.680]   Can you see it?
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:52.440]   Or better yet, will you see it?
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:54.400]   And Isaiah, throughout all of these verses
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.160]   that we've been studying, has shown us
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.600]   that there's multiple things that prevent us
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.240]   from being able to see that very new thing
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.920]   that God has for his people,
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:05.320]   that very new thing that we're so desperate of.
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:07.880]   We have a hard time seeing for multiple reasons.
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:10.240]   Week one, we talked about how in the past,
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.920]   when God has worked in such a miraculous way,
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.760]   we sometimes limit him in our mind,
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.880]   expecting him to part Red Seas
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.160]   when he's ready to send the Messiah to save all of humanity.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:24.880]   Our limitations can be a barrier between us seeing
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.920]   the very thing that God has for us.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:30.240]   In week two, we looked at how our fasting
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.160]   and our response to God is not just a ritualistic thing.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:37.120]   It's not just about depriving yourself of food
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.760]   or of Instagram or of whatever you choose to fast,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.160]   but instead, God is calling us into a fast of justice,
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.540]   a fast of love where we provide for those around us
[00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:49.200]   a new kind of fast.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:51.560]   And in week three, Pastor Andrew did this weird
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.640]   and disgusting illustration with water
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:59.000]   and with soy sauce and all this nasty stuff.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.160]   And he showed us what our sin looks like,
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.680]   how it ruins our ability to see clearly.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.280]   And he showed us that because we couldn't look
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.680]   through the glass and see clearly.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:09.080]   And he showed us what happens when we deal with our sin
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.080]   and we bring our sin before God,
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:13.640]   which is something that separates us from seeing him.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.760]   The Holy Spirit comes in and the water went
[00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:18.320]   into the little tub thingy and it poured out
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.520]   and the water got cleaner and cleaner and cleaner.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:22.280]   Not perfect, but very, very, very clean
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:24.800]   to the point where we were finally able to see.
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:27.920]   Illustration being that our sin can block us
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.880]   from seeing the truth of who God is.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:35.880]   And then this week, we kind of turn the page a little bit.
[00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.120]   We kind of pivot a little bit.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:40.960]   This week, Isaiah is calling us to see something new,
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.400]   to understand and perceive something a little different.
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:45.060]   So I'm gonna take us straight to the text,
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.880]   looking at Isaiah 42, verses 10 through 13.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:50.080]   And it reads like this.
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:52.160]   Sing to the Lord a new song,
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:54.680]   his praise from the end of the earth.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.620]   You who go down to the sea and all that is in it,
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.600]   you islands and all who live in them.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.440]   Let the wilderness and its towns raise their voice.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.160]   Let the settlements where Kadar lives rejoice.
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:08.800]   Let the people of Selah sing for joy.
[00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.320]   Let them shout from the mountaintops.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:13.000]   Let them give glory to the Lord
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.760]   and proclaim his praise in the islands.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.440]   The Lord will march out like a champion,
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.480]   like a warrior he will stir up zeal.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.400]   With the shout, he will raise the battle cry
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   and will triumph over his enemies.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:31.120]   Isaiah is going to use this passage to show us
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.200]   that God is actually calling his people into something new.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.320]   But it's something new that's somewhat similar
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.920]   to what they are used to.
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:41.040]   It's a new type of singing.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.360]   He's calling them to sing a new song,
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.400]   inviting them into a new worship.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.160]   So he says, he opens it with this.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.900]   Sing to the Lord a new song.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:53.240]   He doesn't say sing a more happy song.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.400]   He says, sing a new song.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.840]   Could have said sing a praise song or more upbeat song,
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.680]   but he says, sing a new song.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.720]   And if our worship can be a response
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.480]   to the situation in the context,
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.680]   perhaps Isaiah is saying that sing of a new circumstance
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.720]   that your God is about to lead you into.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:13.640]   Because there's a new moment of God acting
[00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:16.420]   on the behalf of his people on the horizon.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.320]   If they could just see it,
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:21.760]   if we could just see that God is still acting,
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.880]   that God is acting for us, that he is working for us,
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.680]   it would erupt in us something new.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.560]   A new song would come from our mouth.
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:33.860]   He says, sing to the Lord a new song.
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:38.000]   And this idea of singing is something
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.560]   that we do quite often in church,
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.880]   where we sing songs, it comes from our lips.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:45.320]   And that's what Isaiah is speaking about.
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.080]   The words that we sing, the words that we say,
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:49.880]   the words that come out of our mouths,
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:51.840]   sing of the goodness and the newness
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:54.240]   of what God has for us.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.580]   This idea of singing is just a component
[00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:59.580]   of the show and tell concept of worship.
[00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.140]   It's the telling part of it.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:02.920]   And show and tell, just let me break it down
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.140]   in case it's something you've never experienced.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.000]   Show and tell is this cute little thing
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.740]   that kids do in school or in classes
[00:12:09.740 --> 00:12:11.340]   where they bring a fluffy little bunny
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:13.160]   and they're like, hi, this is my fluffy bunny.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:14.060]   It's really important to me.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:15.180]   And I cuddle with it.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.020]   And they're trying to help their friends
[00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:19.780]   understand and perceive and value
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:22.420]   something that they would have not naturally done.
[00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:24.140]   And in show and tell worship,
[00:12:24.140 --> 00:12:28.140]   God does this showing and we get to do this telling.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:31.820]   It's a delicate balance in showing and telling.
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:32.940]   God has his job.
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:36.140]   Like I shared in my story, God shows his faithfulness.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:39.580]   He shows his goodness and we have a role.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:43.180]   And in our role, we get to respond to that goodness,
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.060]   to that faithfulness, to the things that he's done.
[00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:48.900]   And the response that Isaiah is telling them to give
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:52.220]   is one of their mouth in verse 10.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:55.260]   He says, sing a new song, sing a new song.
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.140]   Songs, words that come from our mouth.
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.500]   And here at the Vine, we do that every Sunday, right?
[00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.940]   We have the normal set of stuff, some announcements.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:05.580]   We do tithing, then we go into a singing time.
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:08.140]   The words that come out of our mouth, sing songs.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.820]   And in those moments on Sundays
[00:13:09.820 --> 00:13:13.580]   when we get a chance to sing songs, they're super important.
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.220]   Because in those moments, our mouths get to confess
[00:13:17.220 --> 00:13:21.220]   and speak of realities that sometimes we forget.
[00:13:21.220 --> 00:13:23.580]   We get a chance together corporately
[00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:27.180]   to declare of God's goodness, of his faithfulness,
[00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:30.480]   that God is loving and kind and full of compassion.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:32.900]   What we're doing are giving testimonies
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:35.940]   of who God has been, the things that he has done.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.860]   God is faithful because he did a certain thing.
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:42.300]   God has stood with us, God has taken care of us,
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.620]   he has carried us through.
[00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:46.100]   We sing these songs about the goodness of God
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:47.580]   and the things that he has done for us,
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.580]   testifying of what God has done.
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:55.340]   This is one of the dimensions of what our worship looks like.
[00:13:55.340 --> 00:13:58.660]   We sing because God has done something and we respond to it.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.900]   And I think this paradigm of us singing and responding
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.680]   to what God has done works.
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:06.260]   It's good for us to respond to God.
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:07.820]   That's a good kind of worship.
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:11.060]   That's the worship that we should be engaging in.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:12.780]   But I think the question we have to ask ourselves
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:14.420]   is what happens when we feel like
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:16.240]   we have nothing to respond to?
[00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:20.140]   What happens when your story isn't like mine?
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:22.820]   What happens when you're still stuck in the moment
[00:14:22.820 --> 00:14:25.700]   where your troubles haven't been overcome yet?
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:27.820]   When you're still facing mountains?
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:31.180]   How do you respond to what you've not seen yet?
[00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:34.520]   It's easy to respond when God has done the big,
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.500]   but when you're still in exile, which these people were,
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.900]   how do you then sing this new song of hope?
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.100]   And what Isaiah is doing here is he's inviting the people
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:49.200]   to understand worship in a new way, a new understanding.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.220]   He's wanting them to understand that worship
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:54.920]   is not only rooted in what God has done before,
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:59.920]   but a worship can exist when we haven't seen God move yet,
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:03.260]   when we haven't seen God speak in a long time.
[00:15:03.260 --> 00:15:05.480]   Isaiah is about to show them that worship can exist
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.100]   when God has been silent.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.660]   Worship can bring something forth,
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.780]   not just respond to something.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.600]   This kind of worship is new.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.340]   This kind of song, it's new.
[00:15:15.340 --> 00:15:18.120]   It's a worship not rooted in who God was,
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.140]   but a worship rooted in who God is and who God will be.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:24.420]   It's prophetic worship.
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:27.740]   Isaiah's saying, look, there's all these reasons.
[00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:30.220]   In the passage, he gives them all these reasons,
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:32.620]   so many reasons to sing a new song.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.620]   It hasn't happened yet.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:35.840]   He's speaking of future things,
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:38.920]   but look, the idea is that God is going to.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:40.200]   God isn't far away.
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.000]   God isn't stuck in yesteryear.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.120]   So he writes it like this.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.000]   The Lord will, key word here, will.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.520]   The Lord will march out like a champion.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.600]   Like a warrior, he will stir up his zeal.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.680]   With a shout, he will raise a battle cry
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:57.080]   and will triumph over his enemies.
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.320]   Isaiah is highlighting a promise.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.600]   What God is going to do is going to be incredible,
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.620]   but beyond that, the hope is built on the fact
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:07.280]   that God will do something.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:11.980]   Verses 14 and 15 hammer this point even further.
[00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:15.180]   It says, I will lay waste to the mountains and hills.
[00:16:15.180 --> 00:16:17.000]   I will turn rivers into islands.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.560]   I will lead the blind by ways they do not know.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.780]   I will guide them.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:25.360]   I will turn darkness into light before them.
[00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:26.660]   These things I will do.
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:28.080]   I will not forsake them.
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:30.920]   This word, this verb, will,
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:32.920]   speaking of something that's going to happen,
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.920]   takes place 15 times over that five verses.
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:42.160]   Like that's the key word, will, will, will, will.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.600]   God isn't just the things he did.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.880]   God will, he will, he will for his people.
[00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:49.600]   Isaiah is saying that God is making a clear statement.
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:51.720]   He is not simply the God of the past.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:52.560]   Please hear this.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.360]   His best days are not behind him.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:01.480]   So sing a new song because God is active,
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:03.320]   because God is at work.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:06.320]   Our living hope is still alive.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:09.280]   He's still doing things now and he's still going to do.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.240]   He will do things in the future.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.880]   So we can sing a new song prophetically
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.580]   of the things that he will do.
[00:17:17.580 --> 00:17:22.080]   So how does that work with us in Hong Kong, not in exile?
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:24.000]   Well, we've been in this conversation,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.520]   in this tension about the past three years.
[00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:27.880]   Has anyone heard that phrase before?
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.240]   The last three years, it should be pretty familiar, right?
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.000]   COVID happened, everything went crazy.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.480]   The last three years has been stressful.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.920]   It's been challenging.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:39.420]   There's been battles and difficulties for everyone.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:42.420]   So I don't want to gloss over it.
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.520]   Like it's not an important aspect of our lives.
[00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.680]   There was, there were challenges.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:52.060]   There were lots of struggles, but while all that is true,
[00:17:52.060 --> 00:17:53.460]   this is, this is the key.
[00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:56.800]   God is calling us to sing a new song,
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:02.520]   a new song over Hong Kong, over his city,
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:05.280]   for his church to sing a new song,
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.280]   a song looking ahead to a God who fights for his people,
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.120]   to a God who is working for his people,
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.100]   a song of hope that he will be our light.
[00:18:16.100 --> 00:18:18.840]   Next year and tomorrow and the next day to come,
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.240]   God will be working for us.
[00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:22.580]   It's not just that the past three years has been challenging
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:24.400]   but there is a God who is still good,
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.720]   who is still on the throne,
[00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:27.500]   and he is still working on the behalf
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.140]   of every single one of us here in this city.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:34.440]   God is for his people.
[00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:37.120]   He will not forsake us.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.760]   He will do these things for us.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:41.980]   So if you're in here and the past three years
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.020]   has been absolutely ridiculous
[00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:45.560]   and you're still stuck in that,
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.840]   can I just speak some hope that there is still a God
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.360]   that's fighting on your behalf
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.800]   and your future is still bright.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.680]   He still has plans for you.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:55.980]   If you're here and you're in broken relationships,
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:58.340]   perhaps you're in broken family dynamics
[00:18:58.340 --> 00:18:59.620]   where things are deeply unhealthy,
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:02.780]   can I tell you that God's best days aren't behind him?
[00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:06.300]   God can still work and move even in your life.
[00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:08.620]   Now he can, now he will.
[00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:13.540]   Because we serve a God of the will,
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.340]   not just a God of the has.
[00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:19.660]   And the hope we have in God is for today
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.260]   and it's for tomorrow.
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:24.380]   See, that's why the worship staff, Emma and Jethro,
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.140]   sang the song that they sang today.
[00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:28.260]   One of the songs that they actually wrote
[00:19:28.260 --> 00:19:29.860]   for us as a congregation,
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.400]   the words to that song are super important.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.700]   It fits perfectly well with this sermon.
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.900]   It says, "Hallelujah, praise the one who was,
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:41.800]   "acknowledging that God has done great things."
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:42.840]   We can testify to that.
[00:19:42.840 --> 00:19:46.620]   But also, "Hallelujah, praise the one who is."
[00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:51.020]   God is still here, still moving, still working today.
[00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.660]   And it ends with, "Hallelujah, he'll forever."
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:56.580]   Forever, that means tomorrow,
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:19:58.180]   that means the next hurdle you face,
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:20:00.540]   that means the next big global thing that comes,
[00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:02.540]   that means the next challenging situation.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.860]   God will forever be with us.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:07.340]   He will forever be our God.
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.580]   Our hope hasn't run out.
[00:20:09.580 --> 00:20:12.980]   Our hope is not stuck in the pre-COVID days.
[00:20:12.980 --> 00:20:15.220]   Our hope is here and now
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:17.980]   because we can sing a new song of hope
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:20.540]   because God is still working.
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:22.140]   - Yeah, right.
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:27.180]   - But for us to sing a new song,
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:30.260]   there has to be a shift, there has to be a bit of a change,
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:33.500]   and a shift in our worship.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.980]   And I wanna be careful,
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:38.080]   I don't wanna say a correction in our worship
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:41.380]   because our other way of worshiping isn't incorrect.
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.500]   Hear this, a shift in our worship
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.080]   'cause God gives us a song for every season.
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.900]   The people of Israel, they had experienced many seasons,
[00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.440]   some highs and some lows, and their songs had changed
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:59.140]   when they were in these moments of deep anguish
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.220]   where they were exiled and they were frustrated
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:02.820]   and they were at their rock bottom
[00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:04.780]   where they felt like it couldn't get any worse.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:06.060]   They had songs for that.
[00:21:06.060 --> 00:21:08.540]   God, they were laments.
[00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:10.500]   And they worshiped God through lamenting,
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.300]   lamenting being such a gift of the scripture,
[00:21:13.300 --> 00:21:15.620]   so much so that we have a whole book
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.260]   titled Lamentations of these songs,
[00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.500]   of these worship moments from Israel to God.
[00:21:21.500 --> 00:21:24.060]   Laments are basically these songs of sorrow
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:28.940]   expressing grief, expressing disappointment,
[00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:31.120]   expressing regret.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:35.140]   Laments have seasons, and we have seasons
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:38.420]   where these lament songs can bring so much comfort,
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:40.060]   and I think I'm not alone when I say
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:42.660]   that it has been a comforting thing for us
[00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.860]   over the past three years.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:47.120]   [sniffles]
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:50.940]   These songs are right for a season,
[00:21:50.940 --> 00:21:54.580]   but these songs are not the song
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.920]   God is calling us to sing in the new season.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.260]   See, he's doing something new.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.260]   Will we see it?
[00:22:02.260 --> 00:22:05.100]   Will we sing of the new he is doing?
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.420]   See, Isaiah is writing and saying
[00:22:06.420 --> 00:22:09.300]   we must shift the way that we worship.
[00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:11.580]   He's saying that God is shifting Israel
[00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.340]   out of laments and into praise,
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.300]   and I believe God is shifting the church in Hong Kong
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:18.700]   out of the lament of the past three years
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:21.380]   and into something bright and beautiful,
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:23.260]   into an expression of God
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.140]   where his presence fills this place,
[00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:26.660]   where there's revival in this city,
[00:22:26.660 --> 00:22:28.480]   where people come to know God,
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:30.580]   where there is goodness in the land.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:33.940]   He has that for us, but we're never gonna see it
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.960]   if we're still singing the old songs,
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:41.140]   if we're not looking for his goodness,
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:42.380]   if we're not looking ahead.
[00:22:42.380 --> 00:22:45.540]   You can't sing the old songs in the new season.
[00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:48.300]   See, God's not shaming our laments.
[00:22:48.300 --> 00:22:49.420]   He's not saying don't lament.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:50.780]   He's not saying get over it,
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:53.280]   but he's saying let me trade you.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:55.660]   You have sorrow, bring it to me.
[00:22:55.660 --> 00:22:56.760]   I'll exchange it.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.900]   Let me trade your shame and your guilt.
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:01.780]   Let me trade your disappointment and your regret for hope,
[00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:05.860]   for something new, for something to build upon.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:07.860]   That is the promise that he's bringing us,
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.780]   and the question is will we see it?
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:14.180]   Will we look even if we can't see?
[00:23:14.180 --> 00:23:16.340]   Will we look with the eyes of our heart?
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:20.720]   Will we look in faith, believing in God himself?
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.520]   Will we see?
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.860]   So worship requires us to shift,
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.140]   shift out of the laments and into praise,
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:34.620]   but that's still not a complete understanding of worship.
[00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:38.020]   Even if we sing the newest songs, right?
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:38.860]   Sing a new song.
[00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:41.420]   This title is a new song.
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:44.940]   If we sing the new songs every week, every Sunday,
[00:23:44.940 --> 00:23:47.020]   if we come in here, we worship our guts out,
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:50.020]   hands in the air, people, hands on the knees,
[00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:52.740]   band going on over and over and singing for 30 minutes,
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:56.060]   45 minutes, an hour, if we do that,
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:57.660]   our worship can still be incomplete.
[00:23:57.660 --> 00:23:58.560]   Did you know that?
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:02.480]   Our worship can still be flat.
[00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.300]   It can still be empty if our worship
[00:24:06.300 --> 00:24:08.660]   just stays in our mouths.
[00:24:08.660 --> 00:24:11.660]   This is a serious risk in churches as a whole,
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.740]   to speak of what God is doing
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.100]   and to think that a new song is acceptable in worship.
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.620]   That error occurs when we relegate worship
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:22.620]   to just the stuff that happens on the stage
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:26.160]   with the band and the piano and the pads and the drums.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:28.900]   That happens when we relegate worship
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.820]   to just the times that we have Emma and Jethro and Kay
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:33.680]   and whoever leading us in worship.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.780]   The moment that the band steps off stage,
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:37.880]   worship isn't over.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:42.200]   Worship doesn't end because the song has ended.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.520]   Actually, I dare say that more worship takes place
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:51.040]   Monday to Saturday, not just here on Sunday.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.200]   Worship that comes from just our mouths
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.480]   can easily become the worship that God rejects.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:24:59.600]   And he would say that, right?
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:02.960]   Jesus would quote Isaiah a couple hundred years later.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.440]   He would say this, "These people honor me with their lips.
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:06.920]   "They honor me with their songs.
[00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.940]   "Their new songs are great.
[00:25:07.940 --> 00:25:08.820]   "They honor me with it.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:11.760]   "They sing the right words, but their hearts,"
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.220]   ah, their hearts, "are far from me."
[00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.440]   So in Isaiah, he would put it like this in verse 15,
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:20.760]   continuing in this story.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.980]   He would say, "Yes, God is gonna be a warrior.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.400]   "He's gonna rescue his people.
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:25.660]   "He's gonna fight for you guys.
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:26.480]   "There is hope.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:27.440]   "You can believe in that.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:28.560]   "You can take that to the bank.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:29.400]   "God is good.
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400]   "He's going to rescue.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.120]   "He's gonna do all these great things."
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.820]   But he ends such a hopeful text
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:37.720]   with this one sentence.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.980]   He says this, "But those who trust in idols,
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:44.840]   "who say to images, 'You are our gods,'
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:47.660]   "will be turned back in utter shame."
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.100]   What's Isaiah saying?
[00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:52.480]   God's gonna do all these great things.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.480]   He's gonna come and he's gonna fight for his people.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.340]   Hurrah, there's hope there.
[00:25:56.340 --> 00:25:58.560]   He's gonna be a warrior.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.760]   He's gonna rescue us.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.640]   But that hope and the boldness and the peace
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:07.340]   that it brings to our reality is only ours.
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:09.560]   It can only be felt and transform us
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.360]   like a new song is meant to do
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:16.280]   if we put our faith in him.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.740]   If our trust is in him,
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.860]   which means that worship must include
[00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.540]   what we do with our faith,
[00:26:22.540 --> 00:26:25.940]   not just what we say with our words.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.520]   True worship is not just about singing.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.340]   True worship is about surrender.
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:33.940]   True worship includes where you put your faith.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.220]   And the temptation when sin is blocking us,
[00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:37.440]   when things are difficult,
[00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:40.020]   is to sing of a new song
[00:26:40.020 --> 00:26:42.460]   and sing of all the hope that God has for us
[00:26:42.460 --> 00:26:45.060]   while putting our faith in lesser gods,
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.780]   even the good things around us,
[00:26:46.780 --> 00:26:50.340]   placing and building our faith on that.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.740]   Worshiping creation,
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.480]   worshiping the things that God has given us
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:56.980]   more than we worship him,
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.560]   which is an easy, slippery slope.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.240]   Isaiah is saying that the worship God is looking for
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:04.960]   is holistic.
[00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.000]   It's gotta be both.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.880]   It's gotta be both what we say and what we do.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.200]   Worship with our heart and our soul.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:13.800]   Yes, our words, our minds, our strength,
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:15.000]   with how we live.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:18.440]   Worship that incorporates our words and our trust
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.720]   because honestly, what's the alternative?
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.160]   Building your hope and putting your faith in something else,
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.840]   in lesser gods and idols,
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:29.760]   in anything other than God
[00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.840]   is literally setting yourself up for failure.
[00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:34.840]   It's a ticking time bomb
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:37.440]   because the reality is the hope that it's meant for us
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.200]   to put in our faith, that we're meant to put in God,
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:44.040]   can never be secure in anything else.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:47.100]   So that means no matter how good your family is,
[00:27:47.100 --> 00:27:50.880]   you can't build your hope on that.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:53.420]   It means no matter how good your job might be now,
[00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:54.720]   you can't build your hope on that.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.480]   Whatever you think you need to reach
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.240]   to reach financial stability,
[00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:00.720]   you can't build your hope on that.
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.920]   A specific political climate,
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:05.480]   you can't build your hope on that.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.320]   You know why?
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.640]   Because those things were never meant to be
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:11.880]   where our hope and our trust is built.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.520]   But Christ alone, the words we say in Christ alone,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:20.280]   my hope, my strength, that's where our hope is.
[00:28:20.280 --> 00:28:23.680]   When we worship completely, yes, we say the words,
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.920]   but then we place our trust in him
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.640]   because only he can satisfy, only he can deliver.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:35.560]   No lesser God can do what only God can do.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:39.160]   So to worship is to put ourselves back in his hands
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:42.400]   and it's to do it daily, to do it regularly.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.000]   It's not a one-time thing.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.700]   Perhaps the most famous passage in the Bible about worship
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.000]   from most worship pastors comes from Romans 12.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.720]   It says this, "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters,
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:56.920]   "in view of God's mercy,
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.320]   "in light of what you've seen of him,
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:01.200]   "offer your bodies as a living sacrifice."
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.480]   Key word here, living.
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.480]   Doesn't mean that you do it one time and it's over.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.080]   Living things has to repeat,
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.560]   it has to be something you do over and over and over again.
[00:29:10.560 --> 00:29:14.360]   True and proper worship, according to this passage by Paul,
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.480]   includes the consistent offering of yourselves,
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:20.040]   of ourselves to God.
[00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:22.320]   It's not something we do once.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   It's a living sacrifice, much like he is our living hope.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:31.960]   It's to offer ourselves to God today and tomorrow.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:35.200]   Every day that we have breath must be how,
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.560]   a day for us to engage in this kind of worship.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.320]   And if this is what true and proper worship is,
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:43.540]   then worship can't end at 1230.
[00:29:43.540 --> 00:29:47.280]   Worship can't end when the band finishes.
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:50.480]   Worship has to be, you're gonna be breathing tomorrow.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.640]   You're gonna be around people,
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.520]   you're gonna be given a chance.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.480]   I think what God is saying, this new song that he has,
[00:29:55.480 --> 00:30:00.120]   don't fall for just half worship
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:02.480]   when he has a whole thing for you.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:05.560]   And the whole includes the Monday through the Saturday,
[00:30:05.560 --> 00:30:07.940]   where you put your trust.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.120]   Where you put your trust matters.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:14.000]   God has a new song for us to sing,
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.360]   a new worship that's meant to build you,
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:19.560]   it's meant to equip you, it's meant to fill you with hope,
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:21.140]   give you a future.
[00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:24.780]   It's meant to be a song for us as a people,
[00:30:24.780 --> 00:30:27.060]   us as a church, us as a city,
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.540]   to see what God is doing.
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:31.180]   If we could just see it, the anticipation in us
[00:30:31.180 --> 00:30:34.500]   would have us going crazy with hope, crazy with joy,
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:37.200]   because God is still working, God is still acting,
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:39.700]   God is still doing, he's still mending hearts,
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.260]   he's still healing relationships,
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.060]   he's still doing above and beyond the things
[00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:45.700]   that we could ever imagine.
[00:30:45.700 --> 00:30:49.220]   The question is, will we see it?
[00:30:49.220 --> 00:30:50.460]   Will we see it?
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:55.580]   I think there are two kinds of people here today.
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:57.980]   Actually, the band can go ahead and come up at this point.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:31:00.140]   There are two of us in the room today.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:02.180]   There's two different groups.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:05.220]   There's one group of us who are, if we're honest,
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.580]   we're really struggling to see God,
[00:31:08.580 --> 00:31:11.140]   because all we see are the mountains around us.
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:13.180]   It sounds like a very easy thing to do
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:15.860]   when you're living in green pastures and everything's okay,
[00:31:15.860 --> 00:31:17.960]   but if you're someone who is dealing
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.740]   with deep financial struggles
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:22.180]   and you don't know what next this year looks like,
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:24.920]   perhaps it becomes very, very more challenging.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:28.280]   Maybe it's because the relationships are still broken,
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.380]   so it's hard to see God.
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:33.500]   You have these circumstances that seem impossible.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:36.860]   Maybe it's a marriage that's literally hanging by a thread.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:38.420]   How do you see God in that?
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:40.900]   Here's the good news.
[00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.800]   This is why this passage is so powerful.
[00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.780]   This is why this series is so powerful.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:47.740]   That might be your current existing reality,
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.100]   but there's a new that God has.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.500]   There's a new song that he wants to sing over us.
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.900]   There's a new song he's calling you to sing.
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:32:00.260]   There's a song of hope because God is your God.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:03.460]   God still fights for you, so if it feels impossible,
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.940]   he's good at those kinds of things.
[00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.820]   That's his specialty.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.180]   The challenging things that you feel
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:11.900]   like you can't find an answer to, God can.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.500]   God can do, and he's calling you to bring your anxiety,
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:17.380]   bring your fear, bring the battles that you can't win,
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:20.420]   and watch him guide you through it.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:25.980]   Maybe you'll never get to see the fullness of that,
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.640]   but he will walk with you, he will be your God,
[00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:32.380]   he will go before you, and he will fight battles
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:33.400]   on your behalf.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:37.140]   There's a second group of us here today
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:40.380]   who God is calling us just to open our eyes.
[00:32:40.380 --> 00:32:42.860]   See, show and tell worship is this idea
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:44.200]   that we tell of what God is doing,
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:46.500]   but we'll never tell of what God is doing for some of us
[00:32:46.500 --> 00:32:47.580]   if we don't look around.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.920]   See, it's not just a future thing of hope,
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.700]   God is doing things now.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.380]   Like in this room, I'm convinced that God has worked
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:56.820]   in crazy ways.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:58.980]   There are stories just like mine,
[00:32:58.980 --> 00:33:02.500]   there are stories all around here of God providing,
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.540]   of God comforting, of God speaking and reminding us,
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.760]   and if we could hear them, if we could look and see them,
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.700]   what faith that would do to our community,
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:14.380]   what faith that would build in us,
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:17.340]   and we'd be reassured again, we'd stand up tall,
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:19.980]   confident as a people, that our God is active,
[00:33:19.980 --> 00:33:21.860]   our God is now.
[00:33:21.860 --> 00:33:22.820]   And so that group of people,
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.380]   he's calling you to open your eyes,
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:28.160]   be in community, talk to one another,
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:30.280]   share of the good that God is doing,
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.420]   because you don't know how your words,
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.060]   your testimony of God's faithfulness in your life
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:38.600]   can bring hope to a dire situation.
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.540]   It's a new song, God has a new for us.
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.740]   He's calling us to see with our hearts,
[00:33:49.740 --> 00:33:50.980]   or to see with our eyes,
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:53.080]   either way he's gonna lead us through.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.120]   He's got something for all of us here,
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:57.980]   but will we align ourselves to that?
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:33:59.300]   Will we see it?
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:01.900]   That's the question, that's the call.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.340]   So why don't we stand and we'll pray together.
[00:34:11.660 --> 00:34:14.340]   God, we thank you for your goodness,
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:16.820]   we thank you for, I mean, the scriptures are just full
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:18.940]   of all the things that you have done.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.060]   You've done so much in the past,
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.660]   even in our lives we have stories of the things you've done,
[00:34:23.660 --> 00:34:26.300]   you've done so much, you've gotten us this far,
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:27.840]   we thank you for that.
[00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:30.380]   But God, if this word is true,
[00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:33.620]   then that means that you are doing things even now.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:36.900]   And so God, give us the strength to hold to that promise
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:39.820]   that our God isn't stuck in yesterday.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:41.260]   Our God isn't the God of the past,
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.500]   but he's a God of today and tomorrow.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.300]   God, give us the strength,
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:49.220]   give us the courage to see your work around us.
[00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:52.120]   God, for those of us who don't have the ability to see,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.240]   will you give us eyes and our hearts, God?
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:57.360]   May we see by your spirit,
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.820]   may you strengthen the areas that are weak.
[00:34:59.820 --> 00:35:03.700]   God, for those of us who just need to know
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:06.820]   of the other testimonies, will you loosen our lips, God?
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:12.100]   May we be a people that speak, that sing of your goodness,
[00:35:12.100 --> 00:35:15.320]   that tell of your goodness, may it inspire one another,
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:17.120]   may others be filled with hope,
[00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:19.620]   hearing about a God that's still active,
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:20.780]   a God that's still working.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.420]   God, we're not stuck in the past three years, God,
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.580]   we declare that new things are coming for this city.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:27.740]   We declare that new things are coming for your people,
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:29.380]   and you're going to lead us forward,
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:31.080]   that you will still be our God,
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.420]   no matter what obstacles come,
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:35.380]   and life can be good because you are good
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.100]   and you are with us.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:39.060]   So God, show us how to hold on to that.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:43.100]   Show us how to hold on to you as we walk forward,
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:45.780]   as we shift our worship, as we shift our words,
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.500]   and as we place our trust in you daily,
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:50.500]   will you be glorified in our lives,
[00:35:50.500 --> 00:35:54.540]   and may we see the new that you have for us.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.760]   It's in Jesus' name, amen.
