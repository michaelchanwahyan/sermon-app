[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640]   Just think about this for a moment.
[00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:07.120]   There are millions of churches around the world in the next 24 hours that are going
[00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.560]   to be declaring those very words that death cannot hold God down.
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:20.400]   That we get to, across the world, join this chorus, this symphony of praise that declares
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.800]   that death is not the full stop.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.080]   That God changes that full stop into a comma and says that there is more to the story.
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.440]   That what is ahead is greater than what has been in the past.
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:35.840]   And I think that is a message that we here in Hong Kong get to bring our own voice to.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.200]   We get to stand in front of all the death that is around us and declare that that is
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.200]   not the end.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.520]   That that is not the final word.
[00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.480]   That that is not the end of the story.
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.480]   That there is hope.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.000]   That there is this eternal idea that Christ, having overcome sin, now sits at the right
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   hand of the Father.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.280]   So when we call on the name of Jesus, we're not calling on some rabbi from the first century
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.240]   who died a painful death.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.760]   We're calling on a God who's present in this moment.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.000]   The one who is Emmanuel, God with us.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.600]   We're calling on the name that is above every name.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.400]   That in doing that, we get to declare something that is radical to the darkness around us.
[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.520]   That there is hope in this moment for life.
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.760]   And not just normal life.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.560]   Not just a life that seems to have all of its ups and downs.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.880]   But as Jesus declares, life and life eternal, abundant life.
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.240]   That God is able to do abundantly more than we could ever ask or imagine.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.160]   That's the God that we're singing to right now.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.600]   That's the one that churches around the world are praising in this moment.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.040]   Could you imagine what the Spirit of God can do on the earth as millions of churches declare
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.280]   in their own way what it means to see a resurrected Savior in 2021.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.720]   If we've ever needed Jesus to walk into our workplaces.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.280]   To walk into our aisles and our seats of government and leadership.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.720]   To walk into the places of our neighborhood that seems the darkest.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.400]   To walk into our families and our marriages and our children.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:13.160]   If there's ever been a moment that we've need Jesus to be present in His resurrected authority
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.920]   and stand over darkness and say, "You do not get the final say.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:20.920]   Surely it's now."
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.040]   And I want to just encourage you wherever you are watching this, wherever you're receiving
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   this.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.800]   That whatever has happened and whatever is going on right now, we certainly don't play
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.920]   down the realities of what we all sit in.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.120]   The struggles that we have, the traumas that we go through, the difficulty of this moment,
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.040]   the pandemic that is still here, the wonderings for our future.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.640]   We all are standing there together.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   But we are not without hope.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.160]   I want to encourage you that as you open up your heart, as you open up your hands, as
[00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.360]   you open up your spirit, that God will meet you in this moment with His resurrection power.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.240]   And He will enable you to see Him afresh and to find that hope new and alive in you today.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.000]   It's our prayer as the Vine Church for you watching this, that you'll find that resurrection
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.760]   hope in you in this moment.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.400]   Let me pray for us, each one of us together.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:25.280]   Father, we just thank you for this thought that we join a symphony of glory and worship
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.280]   across the world in this moment.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.200]   Though we think of the smallest churches and the largest churches, we think of all the
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.280]   different denominations, all the different ways of expressing your glory.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:44.080]   We think of those that express it quietly and those that express it loudly.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.600]   We think of those that, Lord, have very few words and those that seem to be abundant in
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   their words.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.880]   Lord, we come before you as the global body of Christ.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.220]   And Father, we thank you.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.480]   We thank you that you felt like that pain and that separation on the cross was worth
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.300]   it for us.
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.600]   We thank you that you did not turn your back fully on humanity.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.640]   We thank you that through the power of the resurrection of Jesus, you have faced forwards
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.640]   towards humanity.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:25.680]   And we can now see you face to face, that that shroud in the temple has been torn, that
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.120]   your presence now moves here on earth like it is in heaven.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.320]   Lord, we pray for that beauty of heaven on earth.
[00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.000]   We pray for glimpses of it amongst us like we've never experienced before.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.140]   We thank you, Lord, that that is our story, Lord.
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.960]   And we will declare that story from church to church, from place to place, from workplace
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.960]   to workplace and home to home, that you are our hope.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:03.360]   And we thank you for this in Jesus name, everyone says, Amen.
[00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.920]   You know, it's amazing to me that we do get to join together in that hope that we get
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:15.160]   to be a people together declaring God's good work on earth right now.
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.300]   And as we open the scriptures to us today, as we come around this idea of what it is
[00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:27.040]   to see the resurrection of Jesus and to feel that spirit moving in us, I'm going to bring
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.240]   you a special message that we've been working on here at The Vine for a number of months
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:32.240]   now.
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:35.680]   We filmed this a couple of weeks ago, and in a moment you'll get to see why we're not
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.120]   doing it live and why we filmed it.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:43.320]   But it's really a way for us to bring a creative expression around what resurrection hope is
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.280]   all about, particularly in dark times right now.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.480]   So whatever it is that you're dealing with, whatever it is that you and your family are
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:57.280]   going through right now, my prayer as you watch this, my prayer as we open scripture
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:05.240]   together, my prayer as we listen to his hope that you would find renewed hope in you, because
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.960]   we are the people of the resurrection.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:29.640]   Let's take a look at this together.
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.940]   So it's Saturday, and just the day before, Jesus has been murdered on a Roman cross.
[00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.740]   And here are the disciples on Saturday, hiding behind closed doors, overwhelmed by what's
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:43.860]   just happened and filled with fear and grief.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:49.360]   The Bible tells us that when Jesus breathes out his last breath, a darkness descends on
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.520]   the earth, like a blackness covers creation.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.380]   And here are the disciples behind those closed doors, and they're feeling like a darkness
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.760]   has covered them too.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.280]   Imagine what it would have felt like for those disciples.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:08.480]   I mean, they had hoped that Jesus was going to redeem all of Israel.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:11.400]   They believed that Jesus was the one who was going to set them free.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.600]   But they had seen the events of Jerusalem.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.040]   They had seen what had taken place at his trial.
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.480]   And then they'd seen him nailed at that cross.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.840]   And for them, it was kind of like evil had just won again, that evil was making its mark
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.440]   on the people once again.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:29.560]   The disciples thought that there was hope with the Messiah, but that hope had been cut
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   off.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.840]   And it was like this darkness and this blackness of this evil death had now descended upon
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   them.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:39.520]   I mean, they really believed that Jesus was going to set them free.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:46.120]   But now they're facing the reality that once again, the empire had won, and there was nothing
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.240]   that they could do about it.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.320]   A canvas of blackness.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:56.880]   And whilst those disciples are hiding behind those doors, and they're wondering what's
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:05.000]   next, something absolutely glorious happens.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.240]   It's subtle and quiet at first.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:09.400]   No one expects that it happens.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:16.400]   But Jesus, in shedding of his blood on that cross, begins to transform and change everything.
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.320]   That moment that seems to be disregarded by the canvas of blackness around it, actually
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.560]   is the moment when everything in history pivots and change, that in the blood that was shed
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.720]   on the cross, atonement was going to come for everyone's sin, that all of the world
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.320]   would be set free again, because Jesus had done what he'd always said he was going to
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.320]   do.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:43.040]   He was going to give up his life on behalf of his friends.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:48.200]   And that breakthrough moment creates such hope for the world.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:55.040]   The Bible tells us that the wages of sin is death, but the gift of life is eternal life
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.800]   in Christ Jesus.
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.120]   One man's sacrifice for everybody's freedom.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:07.160]   I mean, it's almost like Jesus's blood then covers across everything else, that blackness
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:10.560]   that was there suddenly now finds itself disappearing.
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:16.520]   And instead, here comes his blood, and his blood begins to speak of a louder story.
[00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:22.000]   His blood covers over everything that was black before it, like his blood is the thing
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.400]   that actually is going to bring all of that redemption, all of that hope, everything that
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:31.520]   the disciples had longed for, it is actually going to take place.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.200]   His blood for the redemption of you and me.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:42.480]   Friday and Saturday turn into Sunday, the third day.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:45.000]   And on this day, the women gather towards the tomb.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.680]   They have their anointing oil, wanting to anoint his body.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.320]   And they get to the tomb, and the stone is rolled away.
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:54.480]   And as they enter in, they don't see his body, but they see somebody standing there, and
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.880]   an angel comes to them.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.080]   And he says, "Why are you looking for the living amongst the dead?
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.440]   For he's not here.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:02.040]   He is risen."
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.200]   I mean, there's this proclamation of the resurrection, and the women are beginning to comprehend
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:14.160]   what is just taking place, that if Jesus is risen, then death is not the last say.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.160]   And if death isn't the last say, then perhaps sin is no longer going to be the thing that
[00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:20.480]   will hold us back.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:26.200]   Perhaps in this glorious moment of the resurrection, there now is a new story.
[00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:29.760]   Maybe a new colour gets to go over all the earth.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.280]   Maybe now there is hope.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:35.640]   Now there is something that we can believe in, something that we can hope for, that perhaps
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.400]   the empire and the darkness around us will not win.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.960]   Perhaps indeed everybody can come to a saving knowledge of Jesus.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.840]   The women are filled with hope and begin to tell the story of the resurrection to the
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.600]   men.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:59.320]   And the despondent disciples of Saturday, they become the people of resurrection Sunday.
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.920]   Jesus appears to them, and he begins to show them his hands.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:06.920]   He shows them where he has those scars on his hands and in his side.
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:12.320]   He invites them into his suffering so they could understand his new glory, that he has
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.520]   risen, that he is alive.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.880]   And the disciples begin to realise that, hang on, if Jesus is alive, it means that that
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:23.680]   canvas of blackness, it means that the death that is all around them does not have that
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.000]   final say.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.560]   It means actually that God is not going to wipe away that canvas and start afresh, but
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:33.680]   he's actually going to come and redeem from within that darkness.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.440]   That new hope and new life could begin to rise up.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:43.460]   And the disciples see that the resurrection is not about looking back to an empty tomb.
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:48.560]   The resurrection is about moving forward into the purposes and promises of God in this moment
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.600]   now and in all the moments in the future.
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:57.000]   The disciples begin to understand that resurrection is not just about life after death.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.200]   Resurrection is also about life before death.
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.880]   That what we do right now matters.
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:09.640]   That if Jesus is alive, if death is defeated, if sin is overcome, then no matter how dark
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:14.720]   the world might feel, there is still hope.
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:19.880]   So the disciples begin to believe that they could stand before the darkness around them
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.800]   and begin to paint a new work of art.
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.720]   That God, if he is redeeming from within, then they can be a part of that redemption
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:33.000]   story that as the people of the resurrection, they can begin to bring hope.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.840]   And so we see this amazing thing.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.360]   The disciples begin to go, "Hey, we need to tell people about Jesus.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.260]   We need to paint a new story.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.920]   We want people to see and to know his resurrection power.
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.680]   We want the blood of God to be poured out onto everybody."
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:52.200]   And they begin to celebrate in the glory that that brings.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:58.320]   Not only that, but they know that no matter what might happen with the empire around them,
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:02.600]   they no matter what persecution might come to them, where they were afraid and despondent
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:08.400]   behind doors before, now they can stand before the empire and find joy in the persecution
[00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:12.320]   because they know that the persecution is not the end.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:17.640]   Not only that, but together they begin to say, "Hey, maybe we can share our resources.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.680]   We can begin to live in a completely new way that perhaps together we might be able to
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.360]   celebrate in the beauty of no one in our community ever being without anything."
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:35.760]   And with that, they have the courage to stand before the darkness of empire and speak truth
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:41.640]   to power with love and grace, say, "It is God who is worth more than man.
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:46.520]   And I will obey God no matter what humanity might throw at me.
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:51.840]   Oh, the joy of a resurrected group of disciples."
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.040]   And here's the amazing thing.
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.840]   It wasn't just the disciples that were the people of the resurrection.
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.760]   We, the church today, are also the people of the resurrection.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:06.160]   It is the same too for us.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:11.520]   Paul would write that the same spirit that actually brought Jesus into resurrection,
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:16.040]   that same spirit is alive in us, in me, in you.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:19.960]   We are a resurrection people filled with the Spirit of God.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.720]   And because that is the case, we too can stand before the darkness around us.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:30.080]   And I don't know about you, but there's a lot of darkness in our world still today.
[00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:35.400]   I mean, we've been facing this global pandemic and we still don't know when we might emerge
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:38.360]   fully as a human race from it.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.360]   Right here in this city, we've been dealing with political and social unrest and all that
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:48.320]   that brings to us, all the fear that has been created within us.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.720]   Or take a look at the global conversations that are happening right now with all of the
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:56.440]   racism we're seeing, with the increase in violence around the world, with gender inequality
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.360]   still rife, with injustices everywhere.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.160]   And we can see that the canvas of darkness is broad and wide for us too.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:11.840]   And we might be forgiven for thinking that maybe like the despondent disciples on Saturday,
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.280]   we should just make those walls a little bit higher in our churches and just hide behind
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:19.880]   that and just pray and hope that Jesus would come back soon.
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:25.120]   No, Easter is a proclamation that the walls of our churches must come down.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:30.000]   Easter is the invitation into the reality that we are infused with the resurrection
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Spirit of God.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.800]   And because we are, we can also stand before the darkness around us of our day and begin
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:43.320]   to paint the colours of the resurrection filled by God's leading to be His new work of art
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   in this world.
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:50.600]   A work of art that invites people, that tells people that every moment counts.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:52.800]   Everything we do now matters.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:57.440]   Every kind word we bring, every encouragement we speak out, every act of love as Christians
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:02.080]   that we bring to our neighbours around it, all of it is beginning to paint the colours
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:05.880]   of resurrection hope on the darkness around us.
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:07.440]   So think about this.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:09.640]   Think about where we are in this world.
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:14.000]   Imagine what it would be like for us as a global church to stand before this ongoing
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.320]   pandemic and say, no matter what the worst of the world could throw at us, we're never
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:22.720]   going to be socially distant from the one who can change it all.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   Or imagine what it's like for us to begin to believe that we can take the gospel into
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:33.680]   the darkest of places, the hardest of places, the places that overwhelm us and like those
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:39.320]   disciples not allow persecution or fear to hold us back.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:45.340]   Or how about this, that as Christians we know we are the imago Dei, the beauty of the image
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:51.280]   of God, not just in us Christians but in all humanity, all humans created in His image
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:58.040]   and therefore there is no race, no diversity, no background, no sexuality that is beyond
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:04.640]   the hope of the redemption of Christ and that perhaps like the disciples we might decide
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:10.680]   that it's our time, even amongst the crip of empire and the creeping of totalitarianism
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:17.080]   in our world today, that we might stand up for the gospel, look injustice in its face
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:21.720]   and say justice is on the heart of God and we the people of the resurrection, we can
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.640]   make a difference.
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:30.960]   I mean it's just such a profound thought that Easter doesn't make us look back to an empty
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.040]   tomb but it fills us and it sets us free.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:38.400]   We are the people of the resurrection.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   Now note what I say that the people of the resurrection, not the person of the resurrection.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:49.480]   We don't do this alone, we don't have to paint in our own strength, we get to do it as part
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:56.440]   of a wider community, we get to do it as the body of Christ and because we're the body
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:01.160]   of Christ we get to come together across our age groups and our diversity and our different
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:06.320]   cultures and our backgrounds and we get to take the individual palettes of paint that
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:12.160]   God has given us and we dip our fingers into there and we say we're going to use our gifts
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:17.120]   and all the things that God has given us for His glory, that the unique thing that is in
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:21.760]   my life and the unique sphere of influence around me that we as the body of Christ can
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:28.480]   work together to see God's redemption and history of His salvation come to so many people
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.840]   that we can look into the darkness together and say there is still hope.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:36.000]   So think about this for you.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.040]   Where is it that you might be able to paint the colours of the resurrection on the darkness
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:41.800]   around you now?
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.400]   What is in your hands?
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.320]   What gifts have been placed upon you?
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.960]   Maybe there are personal relationships that you can take to the next level this year to
[00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:53.120]   bring the gospel to people that need it most.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.400]   Maybe God's blessed you with resources, whether that's energy or time or finances, and you
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:02.200]   can use those resources to help those that are vulnerable in your community.
[00:19:02.200 --> 00:19:07.360]   Or maybe there's a justice issue in your neighbourhood or in your city where you can stand up and
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:12.120]   say something about the gospel and how it relates to that justice issue and be a voice
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.320]   for those that need it the most, that you might stand up and speak proudly of what the
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.880]   kingdom of God is doing in this hour.
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:25.040]   See, the beauty of being the people of the resurrection, having that spirit living in
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:32.800]   us, is that it tells us that no one and nothing is beyond God's ability to restore and renew
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:37.400]   and set free.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:42.200]   What an encouraging story that is.
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.960]   You know, just three days before Jesus was killed on that cross, He gathered His disciples
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:52.560]   in the temple courts and He said to them, "Destroy this temple and I will rebuild it
[00:19:52.560 --> 00:19:57.080]   in three days," speaking metaphorically about His body.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:01.600]   And He said to the disciples, "Do you believe this?"
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:05.800]   And I believe that's the question that sits over us as the global church right now, that
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:10.240]   God would say to us, "Do we really believe that He has been raised from the dead?"
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.720]   Because if we do, it means that God is not getting rid of all of this stuff, but He's
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.880]   actually recreating from within.
[00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:20.880]   It means that He's inviting us to reimagine the renewal of all things.
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:25.160]   It means that that spirit that raised Jesus from the dead is alive in us.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:29.840]   And if it's alive in us, then we have something to say to the darkness around us, that we
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:34.920]   can use our gifts and our voice and our energies and our love to begin to spread the gospel
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.400]   in new and profound ways that can truly change things.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:42.400]   We are the people of the resurrection.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:48.640]   We must roll up our sleeves, grab our paint and get our hands messy.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.280]   The question you have to ask yourself is this, "Do you really believe that Jesus has been
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:54.920]   raised from the dead?"
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:58.440]   Because if you do, it's time.
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:19.440]   [Music]
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.880]   Church, it is time.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:27.040]   It's time right now for me to challenge you to respond to what you've just watched and
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.600]   what you've just encountered in the story of the resurrection.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.120]   And I want to speak specifically to us as the Vine Church.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.960]   You know, I think this is such an important moment in Hong Kong's history.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:44.640]   I think this is such an important moment in 2021 and the world in which we are in, where
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:48.120]   there's no longer any time for any bystanders.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:53.120]   There's no longer any time for Christians just to kind of attend church and kind of
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.360]   get on with their normal lives.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:59.680]   I think now more than ever, Christ is looking for a church that's willing to stand up.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.360]   He's looking for a church that's willing to rise up and say, "You know what?
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:10.320]   God has given me in the little ways that he has gifts and ideas and creativity and thoughts.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:16.520]   And in my profession, in my workplace, as a mother to my children, as a leader in the
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:23.200]   place that God has me, whatever it might be and however it might manifest, you carry something."
[00:22:23.200 --> 00:22:26.920]   Just like that palette of paint that is in your hand.
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:34.200]   And this is the moment where Jesus is suffering on that cross and all of that side of things,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:39.640]   where all that pain that he paid for the price of our sin and the power and the beauty of
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.760]   his resurrection.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:46.280]   It was all for, I think, this moment where we can stand in the world right now and take
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:52.680]   that paint that he has given us as the body of Christ and begin to show the resurrection
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:57.880]   work of art on the darkness around us.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.680]   Behind me right now is that exact painting that I made on that day.
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.320]   It's right there.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:10.740]   And it's there to remind me and to remind you that we have some work to do.
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:15.620]   That because this is Easter, we don't just celebrate Jesus's resurrection.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:22.220]   We also challenge ourselves for resurrection in our hearts and our lives today too.
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:30.240]   That if Paul is right, that if this same spirit is in us, then it is our invitation to roll
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:35.760]   up our sleeves, grab that paint, get our hands messy.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.000]   So I want to speak into you right now, wherever it is that you're watching this.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:43.760]   Perhaps your heart's just beating a little bit faster because the Holy Spirit's beginning
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:46.560]   to say to you, "Now is your time.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:52.080]   It's your time to rise up again with the colors of hope that only Christ can bring and
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.120]   begin to speak of life again in the world that's around you."
[00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:58.840]   It'll look different for every single one of us.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:01.560]   And that's the beauty and the power of the body of Christ.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:04.400]   It looks different for you than it would for me.
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:10.280]   But there's some darkness that you are being called by the Spirit of God to stand before
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:16.280]   right now and say, "This darkness doesn't get the final say."
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:20.320]   That spirit is rising up in us as a church right now.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.600]   And I know the things that hold us back from doing it.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:28.300]   Thinking that we're not enough, thinking that we're inadequate, fear perhaps of what others
[00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:33.820]   might think, perhaps just that sense of despondency like we've all been feeling during this pandemic.
[00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:39.660]   There are lots of different excuses that we can have for not being the people of the resurrection
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:40.660]   right now.
[00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:47.040]   But God would stand before the global church and I think bring a clarion call to us today
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:50.240]   and say, "Will you stand up?"
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:51.600]   We don't do it in our own strength.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.400]   We do it by that spirit in us.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.680]   And that's what I want to pray for.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:58.320]   If you're watching this right now, if you're part of the vine, if this is speaking to you,
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:03.280]   I want to pray that the Spirit of God would meet you in this moment and help you to stand
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:07.080]   up in the ways that Christ is calling you to do.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.160]   And if you want to respond to that, I want to invite you to do something, whether you're
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.800]   in your home, whether you're on transport right now, wherever it might be.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:15.720]   But if you're like, "This is me.
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:17.920]   I want to take another stand in 2021.
[00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.880]   I want to paint the colors of resurrection hope on the darkness around me."
[00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:25.800]   I want to encourage you just to open your hands where you are right now.
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.880]   There's nothing special in that per se.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:32.640]   It's like a symbolic way of saying to God, "My heart is open before you."
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:37.760]   And in doing that, I believe that we then welcome the Spirit, that resurrection power
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:39.600]   to be in us again.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:44.220]   So if you'll join me, if that's speaking to you, would you just open your hands as I pray
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:45.220]   for us?
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:51.520]   Father, I pray over every person at the Vine Church right now who's watching this, whose
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:56.660]   hands are open, whose heart is open, who's saying, "Yeah, we don't want to just be a
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:01.260]   church that gathers on a Sunday, has a holy huddle, does our thing, and doesn't have any
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:02.940]   impact in the world around us."
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:08.240]   No, we believe that you're bringing your power on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.000]   We believe that justice sits in your heart.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.240]   We believe that resurrection power is also in us.
[00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:19.320]   And so, Lord, we pray that the walls would come down in our church, Lord.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:25.360]   And we pray that we would be able to walk out the power of the resurrection in our workplaces,
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:30.960]   our families, our schools, in the places that need it the most, Lord.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.480]   And so for every person whose hands are open right now, who's declaring, "This is me.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.800]   This is my journey.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:37.960]   This is my story.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:43.760]   I want to live out the resurrection more in the rest of this year than I have ever
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.000]   done so in my life."
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.440]   Lord, their hands are open.
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.080]   I pray that your Spirit would come.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.360]   I pray it's your Spirit that infuses us.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.120]   It's your Spirit that inspires us.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:59.920]   Would you move upon your people right now in the name of Jesus?
[00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:04.320]   And I want to speak just briefly also to some people here right now.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:06.320]   Perhaps you don't know Jesus.
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:08.920]   Perhaps a friend invited you to watch this broadcast.
[00:27:08.920 --> 00:27:12.360]   Perhaps you're watching it live in the moment or you're watching it at some other time.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:16.200]   And you're watching this and you've heard about Jesus, but you've never had that personal
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.720]   relationship with Him.
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.280]   You've never really understood fully what He's done for you.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.940]   And you've just watched that message and you've just seen something in that creativity.
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:28.680]   And there's something that's come alive for you.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.560]   There's an invitation now for you to also respond.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:37.640]   See, I believe that Christ is at work right now opening up some hearts to this message,
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:43.080]   the message of hope and the message of ESA that comes for us in this time.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.080]   If that's you, we want you to reach out to us and to respond.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:52.040]   You know, here at The Vine, we dedicate ourselves to wanting to help you journey in your relationship
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.640]   with Jesus, whatever that might look like for you.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.880]   And if you're here and you're saying, "Hey, I want to find out more about this.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.480]   I don't fully understand it.
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.760]   I kind of like the painting and the creativity, but I don't fully get it.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:05.480]   But there's something in my heart that's saying, I want to learn more.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:09.000]   I want to know something more about this Jesus."
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.080]   We want to connect with you and we want to tell you a bit more about it.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:15.920]   So the way to do that right now on the screen is a little Connect card.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:18.960]   You can scan that QR code right now.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.240]   That'll take you to a website page where we'll just want you to fill in some of your personal
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.800]   details and we'll have a pastor reach out to you this week.
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:32.000]   He's going to follow up with you on a one-on-one basis to share something of the gospel with
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:35.120]   you to find out what it is that you want to learn about Jesus.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.480]   And we're going to make the time to do that because we so believe in the story that we've
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:41.600]   been talking about and we believe it can really change your life.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:47.120]   We can believe it can really turn you and change you around into new hope this year.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.960]   And so we want to tell you more about that story, tell you what it means to be a Christian,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:55.940]   how you can become a Christian, how you can begin to live that daily lifestyle of worship
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:57.080]   of God.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.080]   We want to do that with you.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:02.920]   So scan that code, fill in that form, take a moment to do it.
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:05.680]   I want to encourage you, please take a moment to do it.
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:09.200]   You're thinking, "Hey, I would love to learn more about Jesus."
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.360]   That's the way to do it.
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:15.040]   We will follow up with you and connect with you and we can't wait to meet you and to tell
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:21.560]   you more about the gospel, this good news of who Jesus is for you personally.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:26.680]   And one of the things that we've created at The Vine is a chance for everybody to respond
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:28.120]   and to learn more.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.320]   There's this amazing course called the Alpha Course.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.680]   It was started so many years ago out of a church in the UK, and we get the great privilege
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.240]   of hosting that course on a regular basis.
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.280]   We're going to be launching Alpha next Sunday.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:43.120]   That's April 11th at 3 p.m.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:48.520]   And Alpha is designed to invite you if you don't know Jesus and you're not too sure,
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:52.240]   but you're like, "I want to find out a little bit more about what Christians believe.
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:57.480]   I want to know a little bit more about what the Bible has to say about God and about life."
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.120]   Alpha is designed to help you with that.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.120]   And so I want to really strongly encourage you to lean into Alpha.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:09.240]   If you're going to fill in that form, maybe also think about connecting with us next Sunday
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.340]   at three o'clock, and it will be a great way for us to help you to understand a little
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:17.200]   bit more about all of this kind of painting stuff.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.440]   It's not just a nice creative sermon.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:26.360]   It actually is a life-changing idea, a life-changing reality of relationship with Jesus.
[00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:30.600]   And so whether it's filling in the form or coming to Alpha next week, we really hope
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.040]   that you'll connect with us.
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:38.480]   And for all of us, we get to now respond to this message in celebration, in song, in joy
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.480]   together.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:44.140]   So let me pray for us as we just take some time to allow what I've been talking about
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:46.440]   in that message to really soak on us.
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:52.280]   Father, as we come into this response in worship, we do so with our hearts opened now to the
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.960]   desire for more resurrection power in us, so we can take the palettes of paints that
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:58.960]   are in our hands.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.200]   And Lords, I pray that as we worship now, you'll speak to everybody watching this about
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:07.920]   what it is that you've gifted them with, that they can contribute to the work of art that
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:09.880]   you're creating in this world.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.040]   And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:14.040]   Everyone says, "Amen."
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.040]   Amen.
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:16.040]   Amen.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:18.620]   (upbeat music)
