1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 And we pray all this in Jesus' name.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,240
 Everyone says, amen, amen, awesome.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,900
 Have a seat, please, have a seat.

4
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,340
 Well, welcome to The Vine,

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,600
 if this is your relatively new time,

6
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:16,340
 or if this is kind of like one of your first times,

7
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:17,960
 we're so grateful you're here.

8
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:19,320
 This is our 11 o'clock service.

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,560
 We have three services on a Sunday, 9, 15, 11, and 2.

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,760
 We're very, very, very full at the 11 o'clock.

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,860
 In fact, we've got a huge overflow happening at the moment,

12
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,120
 and there's probably not a spare.

13
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,420
 But if you do have a seat next to you,

14
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,260
 could you just put your hand up?

15
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,000
 There are some people standing around the sides here.

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,180
 So if you do have a seat next to you,

17
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:38,920
 there's one right at the front over here,

18
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,680
 there's one in the back over here.

19
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,840
 We really appreciate it.

20
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,220
 And we don't want anyone having to stand,

21
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,400
 but we recognize that there's a bunch of people

22
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:46,800
 standing in the upper house and the lower house.

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,640
 So if there's a possible seat next to you,

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,800
 or if somebody just doesn't mind sharing a seat,

25
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,520
 you know, bum on each part of the seat,

26
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,200
 we're a community here together.

27
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,120
 Okay, maybe don't do that.

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,520
 No. (laughs)

29
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,760
 All right, Ellison's giving up his seat.

30
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,160
 Come on, let's hear it for Ellison, what a man.

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,000
 You can sit with Justin.

32
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,520
 Ellison's giving up his seat.

33
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,560
 Okay, we need one person for this seat.

34
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:11,520
 Otherwise, it's gonna look really weird in the video,

35
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,640
 'cause there's gonna be like an empty seat right here.

36
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,320
 Ellison, we need you back in that seat,

37
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,600
 if no one else is gonna sit in that seat.

38
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,940
 My name is Andrew, I'm one of the pastors here.

39
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:19,960
 We're grateful that you're here.

40
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,440
 We've been in this series on the Holy Spirit

41
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,720
 over the last little while,

42
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:25,320
 and then this week and the next week,

43
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,960
 we're gonna be focusing now on the work of the Spirit.

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,440
 And I'm really excited,

45
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,600
 because we wanna do a couple of things with you today.

46
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,120
 I wanna teach you a little bit around

47
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,520
 the work of the Spirit, which I'll do in a moment.

48
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,340
 But the most important thing that's gonna happen today

49
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:39,200
 is we're actually going to pray,

50
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,800
 and we're gonna make space for the work of the Spirit

51
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,360
 for each one of us here.

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,300
 And that's gonna be personal, it'll be corporate,

53
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,000
 but we really wanna make space today.

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,720
 So that's why we've set up a little bit differently.

55
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,960
 That's why we're gonna have time.

56
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,640
 That's why we cut our worship a little bit shorter

57
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,020
 than we normally do, 'cause we wanna emphasize

58
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,580
 the ministry of the Holy Spirit on each one of us today.

59
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:01,060
 That's both Upper House, Lower House, in the overflow.

60
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:03,220
 And if you're joining us online right now,

61
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,380
 we're so grateful you're sitting at home somewhere,

62
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:10,220
 wearing your pajamas maybe, just chilling out at home.

63
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,540
 We're glad that you're here with us as well,

64
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,300
 and we pray that this and what we do today

65
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,220
 will also really reach you and minister to you

66
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,060
 where you're at.

67
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:22,100
 In order to kind of unpack what I wanna do with you guys,

68
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,100
 I wanna start by having you guys do something.

69
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,780
 So I want you to start by thinking about

70
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,820
 when was the last time you experienced

71
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,740
 the personal work of the Holy Spirit for you?

72
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:34,460
 When was the last time you had a personal encounter

73
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,980
 with the Holy Spirit?

74
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:38,260
 For some of you, you're like, just two minutes ago

75
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,980
 during worship, which is great.

76
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,840
 But maybe for many of us, maybe it's another time.

77
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,320
 But have a think, when was the last time

78
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,820
 you had a personal encounter with the Holy Spirit,

79
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,660
 and what was it like?

80
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,820
 Think about that.

81
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,180
 Now, I would hazard a guess that for the majority of us

82
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,620
 in this room, when we pause for a moment to think about,

83
00:02:57,620 --> 00:03:00,360
 okay, when was the last time I had a personal encounter

84
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,620
 with the Holy Spirit?

85
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,740
 The natural tendency is maybe to think about

86
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,680
 some of the dramatic kind of manifestations of the Spirit.

87
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,940
 So we kind of automatically begin to think about,

88
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:12,100
 oh yeah, that time when somebody prayed for me

89
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,180
 and I felt like kind of bolts of lightning through my body,

90
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:17,380
 or somebody prayed for me and I felt all warm inside,

91
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,420
 or actually there was that moment when I was praying

92
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:21,140
 for somebody at the service last weekend,

93
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,380
 and I could see that the Holy Spirit was doing something

94
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,980
 on them and it just felt amazing.

95
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,700
 Or maybe it was a time where you had a headache

96
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:30,140
 and you prayed and suddenly your headache went.

97
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:32,420
 Or maybe you were with someone and they had something

98
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,900
 going on in their lives, and a group of people prayed

99
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,060
 for them and you saw a miracle take place.

100
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,600
 I think when we often think about the work

101
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,060
 of the Holy Spirit, when we think about that

102
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,260
 as an encounter for us, it's easy for us to think about

103
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:48,220
 these dramatic moments where the Spirit does something

104
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:51,660
 external to us that is incredible to see,

105
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,220
 and those are, of course, very much the work of the Spirit.

106
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,300
 But here's a fascinating thing.

107
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,060
 When you open up the New Testament in particular

108
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,620
 and you look at the theology and the teaching

109
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:05,300
 around the Spirit, particularly in the work of Paul

110
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,980
 as he's writing to the church, predominantly what is spoken

111
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,500
 about when the work of the Spirit is spoken about

112
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,340
 is yes, it is the external manifestations.

113
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,500
 I mean, we see those in the ministry of Jesus, of course,

114
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,980
 and the miracles in which he did.

115
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,540
 And then in the early church, we know that there was gifts

116
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,780
 of the Spirit that was poured out, so of course,

117
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:24,540
 that external stuff was at work.

118
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,760
 But Paul, predominantly, when he's speaking about

119
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:31,140
 the Spirit and its work, he talks differently.

120
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:33,740
 He says, actually, the Spirit does its primary work

121
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:38,480
 within us, the slow at times, sometimes imperceptible

122
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:41,260
 changes that happen within us.

123
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,580
 That the Spirit, by its fruit, comes and changes us

124
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,700
 and turns us into people who are more patient,

125
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:51,100
 people who have more joy, people that find more love

126
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:52,820
 coming from us.

127
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,180
 And yes, there are the dramatic moments

128
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,300
 where the Spirit comes and does what only the Spirit

129
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,460
 can do, these miraculous things that I think,

130
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:02,020
 particularly for us charismatic Christians,

131
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,620
 that's kind of something that we long for and look for.

132
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:09,620
 But actually, it's the internal, quiet, step-by-step,

133
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:13,140
 life-transforming work of the Spirit

134
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:16,700
 that the New Testament particularly celebrates.

135
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:18,580
 In fact, it is these two things,

136
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,620
 and I want you to think about this.

137
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:23,100
 It is the external manifestations of the Spirit

138
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,220
 and the internal transformation by the Spirit

139
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,580
 that are the totality of his work.

140
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,220
 Are you following this?

141
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:34,180
 Here's the tendency I think we have as Christians,

142
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,020
 is that when we see that the work of the Spirit

143
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,960
 is both of these things, the problem is, though,

144
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,860
 if you're anything like me, you can have a bias

145
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,900
 towards one of them.

146
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,060
 And that bias might be for a number of reasons.

147
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,520
 There may be one of these sides,

148
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,060
 whether the external manifestation

149
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,980
 or the internal transformation,

150
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,220
 that we naturally find ourselves leaning more towards,

151
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,300
 wanting perhaps more or perhaps more comfortable with

152
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,300
 than the other.

153
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,620
 Perhaps for some of you in this room,

154
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,620
 your theological convictions and your own personal

155
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,080
 convictions lends you to one or the other.

156
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,100
 Maybe for some of us in this room,

157
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:19,960
 your past experience, whether good or bad,

158
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,640
 may actually put you in one camp or the other.

159
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,620
 Maybe for some of you in this room, you just don't care.

160
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,940
 The exits are just over here and here.

161
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:31,660
 But whatever it is, I think we as human beings,

162
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:35,100
 we find ourselves gravitating towards one of these things

163
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,820
 more maybe because of theology,

164
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,100
 maybe because of experience,

165
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,820
 maybe because of our own convictions,

166
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,580
 but we're found in one of these things.

167
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,980
 Here's what I've found.

168
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,420
 I've found that this is seasonal in my life.

169
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,620
 I wonder if you've ever found this.

170
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,160
 I remember in my 20s, which was a while ago,

171
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:52,040
 I remember in my 20s so passionate

172
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,000
 about the physical manifestations of the Holy Spirit,

173
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,740
 man, I wanted to see miracles.

174
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,840
 I wanted to see God do anything.

175
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,520
 I wanted to lay hands on people

176
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,880
 that were texting their friends.

177
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:00,720
 Hi, how are you?

178
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,640
 The Lord Jesus.

179
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,480
 But I wanted to lay hands on people

180
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,560
 and pray for the Spirit, pray for miracles,

181
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,280
 see them set free, and I tell you what,

182
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,380
 in my 20s, I saw incredible things happen.

183
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,300
 In my 30s, though, I went to Bible school.

184
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,500
 And when I got to Bible school,

185
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,860
 it was almost like they did their very best

186
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,900
 to get rid of all of the manifestations of the Spirit,

187
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,080
 and it was all about the internal work

188
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,020
 of the sanctification of the Spirit.

189
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,900
 And I studied scripture, and I learned about

190
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:29,060
 what the internal work of the Spirit does,

191
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,860
 and I remember in my 30s, I was much more focused

192
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,580
 for a season on the internal work

193
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,660
 and the sanctification power of the Holy Spirit.

194
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,580
 In my 40s, I wanted both.

195
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,280
 In my 40s, I was like everywhere.

196
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,680
 You know, I want dramatic things, I want the internal.

197
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,240
 In my 50s now, I can barely keep my eyes open, okay?

198
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,120
 (audience laughing)

199
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,980
 But for me, it's been a seasonal thing.

200
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,920
 I've found myself moving in seasons.

201
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,440
 Perhaps that's the same for you.

202
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,480
 Here's what I wanna say,

203
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,320
 and I think this is really important.

204
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
 You know, here at The Vine,

205
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,840
 if you're new with us, welcome,

206
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
 but here at The Vine, we've been talking about,

207
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,320
 over the last number of months,

208
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,280
 that we're in a season of uncharted waters.

209
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,720
 What we mean by that is that the Lord

210
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,600
 is moving us as a church community

211
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,740
 out of our comfort zones into a place

212
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,000
 where we don't have a map or we don't have a strategy.

213
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,680
 The Holy Spirit is beginning to do things amongst us

214
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,960
 that are taking us by surprise

215
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,400
 and causing us to kinda rethink

216
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,360
 how we do things together as a community.

217
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,400
 It's an incredibly exciting time that we're in.

218
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,560
 And because we are in an uncharted time,

219
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,960
 because we are feeling a little bit

220
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,160
 out of our comfort zones,

221
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,680
 here's what I think the Spirit wants you personally

222
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,400
 to lean into, to recognize which

223
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,360
 of these two sides you have a little bit more

224
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,880
 of a leaning towards, and then intentionally,

225
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,600
 in this time, try to work on the other side.

226
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,680
 Try to open your heart to the other aspects

227
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,880
 of the work of the Spirit.

228
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,200
 'Cause when we're in a season,

229
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,400
 when we're in uncharted waters,

230
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,800
 when we're in a season where it's

231
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:54,800
 a little bit uncomfortable,

232
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,040
 we're out of our comfort zone,

233
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,140
 you're gonna need both of these things

234
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,960
 at work in your life.

235
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,040
 You're gonna need the stability of the Spirit of God

236
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,240
 working in these beautiful manifestations,

237
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:07,520
 working on the internal transformation

238
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,000
 that anchors you in a season

239
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,640
 where we're really relying on Him to lead us.

240
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,520
 We don't have a map, we have a guide, amen?

241
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,960
 And the guide is the Holy Spirit walking with us.

242
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:22,240
 And He wants to manifest His work in your life

243
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:25,500
 through the external and the internal.

244
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,520
 So my challenge for us here this morning

245
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,040
 is to not treat these things like an and/or,

246
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,880
 but to treat them like both/and.

247
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,920
 Now how do we do that?

248
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,060
 Well, I wanna do two things with us.

249
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:41,080
 I wanna first of all, take us a little bit high up

250
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:45,240
 into a broad theological view of how Scripture

251
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,520
 provides for us a picture of the work of the Spirit.

252
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,400
 And I wanna, if you will, not go into the depths

253
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,040
 of the details of it, but I wanna kind of do

254
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,660
 an airline kind of flyover of what Genesis to Revelation

255
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,920
 shares to us about the ongoing work of the Spirit.

256
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
 And then from that place, I wanna then take it

257
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,840
 and make it more personal for you.

258
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,760
 How the bigger picture, if you will, the broad narrative,

259
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:09,080
 actually then begins to speak to you personally

260
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,040
 in your context, and then after that, we're gonna pray.

261
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,720
 And we are going to pray.

262
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,940
 And we're gonna invite you to be brave,

263
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,920
 invite you to have some courage,

264
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,520
 invite you to wrestle with everything

265
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,260
 that I'm gonna be teaching and speaking about

266
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,200
 over the next number of minutes,

267
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,080
 and then come forward and have someone

268
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,980
 lay their hands on you.

269
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:30,680
 And to see the manifestation and the internal work

270
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:35,040
 of the Spirit truly begin to take root in us, amen?

271
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,400
 Can I pray for us?

272
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:39,840
 Father, we are so grateful for each person here

273
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,160
 and for the way you have formed and shaped them.

274
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,160
 We all recognize that we have our personal tastes,

275
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,400
 our biases, the things that we naturally lean towards

276
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,560
 when it comes to your work of the Spirit.

277
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,260
 Lord, I pray that as we open up the passages,

278
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,480
 as we look at the broader picture,

279
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,880
 Father, you would enable us to open our hearts

280
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,640
 and our minds to what else is there for us in this area.

281
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,640
 And we thank you for this in Jesus' name.

282
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,480
 Everyone says.

283
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,720
 I wanna talk to you about the eight movements

284
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,840
 that the Spirit does through Scripture.

285
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,000
 There are eight predominant times

286
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,080
 where the Spirit does something significant

287
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:17,480
 to say something about Himself and about His work.

288
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,280
 And we're gonna look at those eight things

289
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,120
 as a way of fully understanding His work.

290
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,760
 So, the first is found right at the beginning

291
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,800
 of the Bible in Genesis 1, verse two.

292
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,960
 And we explained in the first week of our series here

293
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:32,000
 at the Vine on the Holy Spirit,

294
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,400
 we talked about how the first time we're introduced

295
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:39,280
 to the Spirit is as a Spirit that's hovering over creation.

296
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,760
 I'm gonna show you eight symbols

297
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,720
 to help illustrate these eight movements.

298
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,620
 So, the first one, look at that, isn't that brilliant?

299
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,400
 The Spirit hovering over creation.

300
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,640
 Now, what we see in Genesis 1, 2 is this perfect picture

301
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,200
 of the Spirit hovering over what the Bible describes

302
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,840
 as a formless void, a dark creation.

303
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,440
 And we said in week one that what the Spirit is doing

304
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,720
 in hovering over it is having this desire

305
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,560
 to take something that is formless,

306
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:09,920
 bring it into form, and then move it to fullness.

307
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,800
 This is the creative process that you see

308
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,000
 in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2.

309
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,680
 The Spirit, through the spoken word of God,

310
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:20,680
 takes things that are formless, gives them form,

311
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,520
 and then moves them towards their fullness,

312
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,120
 a place of shalom that God describes as very good.

313
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,400
 And so what we see, the first thing we learn

314
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:31,880
 about the Holy Spirit hovering over a formless,

315
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:34,560
 dark kind of void, and then bringing it

316
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:38,080
 into this beautiful creation, is that the Spirit's intent

317
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:42,740
 always is to take disorder and bring it to order.

318
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:44,320
 The Spirit is at work in that.

319
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,840
 We've been telling you a little bit about that

320
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,920
 over the last number of weeks,

321
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,700
 but that's the first movement of the Spirit.

322
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,960
 Our introduction to the Spirit is one who takes things

323
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:54,920
 that are disordered and moves it to order.

324
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,680
 And then we know what happens next, right?

325
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,480
 In Genesis 3, Adam and Eve decide to sin.

326
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,320
 And in their rebellion against what God had called them

327
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,720
 to do, a division takes place.

328
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,100
 They are actually, as part of that division,

329
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:09,280
 they are thrown out of the garden,

330
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,120
 which really was a biblical way of saying

331
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,240
 out of God's presence.

332
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,320
 So the Spirit was there, hovering over creation,

333
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
 taking things into its perfect order.

334
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:19,440
 Then sin takes place with humanity,

335
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,720
 and suddenly a divide comes between humanity

336
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,960
 and the Spirit of God, from humanity and the triune Godhead.

337
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,840
 And that division then basically becomes

338
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,960
 the movement of the rest of Scripture.

339
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,680
 The rest of Scripture is humanity going,

340
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,760
 how do we get back to that relationship we had

341
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,560
 before sin was a reality?

342
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,480
 And this division and the casting out of humanity

343
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,160
 from the presence of God becomes humanity's big focus.

344
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,700
 This is why, in Genesis 11, they build a tower

345
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,480
 to try to get back up to that presence.

346
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:51,700
 They think if they can just get back up to the heavens

347
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,920
 somewhere, then they can reconcile that Spirit

348
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,240
 and that presence, but that's not how God is going to do it.

349
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:59,880
 In fact, God comes and He breaks down that tower,

350
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,640
 and He basically says, we're gonna do this a different way.

351
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:05,600
 The next movement, therefore, of the Spirit that we see

352
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,260
 takes place in Exodus chapter three.

353
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:13,260
 Moses, walking around, suddenly sees a burning bush.

354
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:16,740
 The Spirit suddenly manifested beautifully

355
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,160
 in this burning bush, and Moses goes over to it,

356
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
 and we know what happens, right?

357
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,000
 As he goes over to the burning bush,

358
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,120
 God calls out from the bush and says,

359
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,920
 Moses, Moses, don't come any further forward,

360
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,240
 for the ground that you're standing on is what?

361
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,880
 Holy ground, holy ground.

362
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,000
 Not that Moses was holy, not that the ground

363
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,840
 was some special kind of ground that was sacred and holy.

364
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:43,120
 No, it was the presence of God, the Spirit of God

365
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,680
 revealed once more towards humanity

366
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,880
 that became this holy space.

367
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:49,620
 And when God says, take off your sandals

368
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:51,240
 and step onto this holy ground,

369
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,120
 what He's saying is, I wanna fill the flesh, Moses,

370
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,280
 I wanna fill your flesh with my Spirit.

371
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,320
 There's gonna be a communing again

372
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,040
 that was like what it was in the garden before.

373
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,640
 We wanna commune now together,

374
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,400
 because God is beginning to change

375
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:08,280
 and draw humanity back to Himself.

376
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,600
 So the starting point is that the Spirit

377
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,980
 is disordered, the order.

378
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,840
 The next thing is that He is holy.

379
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,200
 And that holiness, the holiness of God,

380
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,680
 and the holiness of His Spirit

381
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,400
 becomes the way that humanity understands

382
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,460
 its separation from the Spirit.

383
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:25,680
 The next movement is that God then appears

384
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,480
 by His Spirit on a mountain, Mount Sinai,

385
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,560
 also a part of the Exodus narrative.

386
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:32,800
 And up on the mountain, something very special takes place.

387
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,900
 On the mountain, the law is given, the law is poured out.

388
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,040
 That's the Old Testament.

389
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,680
 First of all, the 10 laws, the 10 commandments,

390
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,520
 then eventually the Levitical law,

391
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:45,440
 all poured out through the power of the presence

392
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,000
 of the Spirit on a mountain, and only one person, Moses,

393
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,520
 is able to go up into that presence

394
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:52,480
 and see God face to face.

395
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,080
 So this one person goes up, sees God face to face,

396
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,920
 the law is given, and the law,

397
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:58,160
 this is the best way to understand it,

398
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,760
 the law is birthed by the Spirit

399
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,800
 to explain to us the character of God.

400
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,260
 Often when we think of the 10 commandments,

401
00:16:05,260 --> 00:16:07,040
 we think the 10 commandments are basically

402
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,100
 a bunch of rules to make us live a boring life, right?

403
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,680
 Like a bunch of rules that we have to kind of adhere to

404
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,360
 or check up on a list just to make ourselves feel better

405
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,080
 or to think that we're gonna be

406
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,400
 in some better relationship with God,

407
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,400
 but actually that's not what the law was about.

408
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,720
 See, the law was actually about kind of communicating

409
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,560
 to humanity who God is.

410
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,280
 So when God says, "You will have no other God before me,"

411
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,940
 he's explaining his character of loyalty and steadfastness.

412
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,880
 When he says, "You will not commit murder,"

413
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:39,840
 what he's saying about himself is, "I am a God of life.

414
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,520
 "I am a God of giving, not a God of taking."

415
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,260
 So each of the laws represents some character of God

416
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,700
 that God is explaining, and it's the Spirit

417
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:51,400
 that births the character of God.

418
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,280
 Are you with us still so far?

419
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,360
 Is this okay?

420
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,680
 Okay, hang with me, hang with me.

421
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,760
 Here's the fourth one.

422
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,360
 Then God instructs him to take the tablets

423
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,280
 and place them in a box,

424
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,860
 quite literally the Ark of the Covenant.

425
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,160
 Now, this is funny because so often as Christians

426
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,140
 we're trying to get the Spirit out of a box,

427
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:11,600
 but here at this moment, God puts the Spirit in a box.

428
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,080
 Now why does he do this?

429
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:17,020
 It's because he wants the Spirit to be with his people.

430
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,960
 But because of sin, there still needs to be a barrier

431
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:23,580
 between God and his holiness and God's people.

432
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,680
 So he's placed within this box,

433
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:29,720
 and his presence now goes forward with his people.

434
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,240
 And because his presence is with his people,

435
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,480
 their character is there, the people are created

436
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,800
 and made holy, not because they were perfectly holy

437
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,260
 themselves, but because God's presence was amongst them.

438
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,040
 But it's in a box because there are boundaries.

439
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:44,020
 And if anybody was to open that box,

440
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,120
 if anyone was to carry that box in the wrong way,

441
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,680
 if anybody was to do something,

442
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,940
 then they would be kind of completely punished

443
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,320
 because that box was a sacred thing

444
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,480
 carrying the presence of God,

445
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,640
 and there was boundaries still between humanity

446
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:56,740
 and his presence.

447
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,620
 But he had drawn nearer, you following?

448
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:03,000
 This becomes even more so when you see the next movement.

449
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,040
 The box then gets placed eventually into the temple.

450
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,140
 So David, Solomon, with the vision that they have

451
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:10,200
 for the temple and the construction of the temple,

452
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:13,880
 then the box placed in the heart of the temple itself.

453
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,920
 And as it's placed in there, it's placed in this place

454
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,560
 called the Holy of Holies.

455
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,400
 And the Holy of Holies was like the inner sanctum

456
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,160
 of where the spirit of God was,

457
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,920
 where the Ten Commandments and the Ark of the Covenant sat.

458
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,880
 And in the Holy of Holies, it was separated,

459
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:30,040
 again, from the people, with a large, thick curtain.

460
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,960
 And once again, only one person could go

461
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,240
 into the presence of God.

462
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,860
 And this was the priest once a year

463
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,400
 who had completely purified himself for that journey

464
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,940
 to go into God's presence.

465
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:41,240
 So there again, God's presence is with his people,

466
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,920
 but there's a boundary still that separates

467
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,960
 the holiness of God and his people themselves.

468
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,760
 As God's people are taken into exile because of their sin,

469
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:54,600
 and Assyria and Babylon come and do that

470
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,840
 and bring them into exile, the temple,

471
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,760
 the first temple is destroyed.

472
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,140
 And when the temple is destroyed,

473
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,280
 here's what happens to Israel.

474
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,640
 They're wondering about the spirit,

475
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,680
 and they say, where is the spirit?

476
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,920
 Where has the spirit gone?

477
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,400
 Because of our brokenness and our sin, we're now in exile.

478
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,580
 The temple's been destroyed.

479
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:12,840
 God's presence has left us.

480
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:15,320
 And when 70 years later, they're actually released back,

481
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,300
 and Zerubbabel brings a group of them back

482
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,340
 to start to rebuild the temple,

483
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:21,000
 they want to rebuild the temple.

484
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,780
 They create the Holy of Holies again.

485
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:25,300
 The presence of God again falls amongst this curtain,

486
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,380
 but there's a change in the thinking of Israel

487
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,460
 at this point.

488
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:30,620
 And they think, look, every single time we try

489
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:33,460
 to restore our relationship with the presence

490
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:35,880
 and the spirit of God, it doesn't seem to work.

491
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,380
 Perhaps only God can do that work.

492
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:42,300
 And so at this period, although they rebuild the temple,

493
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,880
 and God's presence comes back,

494
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,660
 their thinking is slightly different.

495
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,180
 They're like, God will need to step in in the future

496
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,300
 if ever humanity and the spirit

497
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:53,120
 will ever reconcile together again.

498
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,360
 And then comes Jesus.

499
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,220
 Jesus, as we know, is the Messiah, the incarnation,

500
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:02,420
 fully God and fully human.

501
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,260
 And here's what I want you to think about that.

502
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:09,260
 This is the fullness now of the spirit in a human person.

503
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:11,540
 The incarnation is this beautiful idea

504
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,560
 that the spirit is no longer in a bush,

505
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,000
 it's no longer in a mountain, it's no longer in a box,

506
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,720
 it's no longer in a temple, it's now come in a person.

507
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,600
 And it's come in the fullness of a person

508
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,460
 so that the spirit and humanity are now this picture

509
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:25,760
 of reconciliation.

510
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,360
 But note, it's still just one person.

511
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,400
 And Jesus, in living out the fullness of the spirit

512
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:36,260
 within him, does the amazing external manifestations

513
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:39,920
 that we see, commands nature, walks on water,

514
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:42,260
 does the things, heals people, multiplies food,

515
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:45,220
 does crazy stuff through the power of the spirit.

516
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,140
 And as he begins to walk out the kingdom,

517
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,300
 he begins to demonstrate what that kingdom

518
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,300
 could actually look like when the fullness of the spirit

519
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,020
 and humanity come together.

520
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:56,400
 That's the beauty of the incarnation.

521
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,440
 But it's still just one person.

522
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:04,840
 On the death and resurrection, everything changes.

523
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:07,080
 And Jesus, in taking on the weight and the burden of sin

524
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,580
 onto his shoulders, for the wages of sin is death.

525
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,600
 As he takes that into death and is raised again

526
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,720
 to new life on the third day, sin now has been dealt with.

527
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,380
 The very thing that had separated the spirit

528
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:22,280
 from humanity now dealt with.

529
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,900
 This is why, actually, he turns to the disciples

530
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,920
 in his resurrection and says, don't go anywhere,

531
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,320
 wait, because I'm about to send you the thing

532
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,840
 that you truly need.

533
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:35,140
 He's like, I need to actually go from here

534
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,320
 so that you will receive the fullness of this thing

535
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,280
 that I'm about to send to you.

536
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,480
 And so he does, he sends them the Holy Spirit,

537
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,080
 Acts chapter two, and they begin to manifest the beauty

538
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,280
 of the gospel through human languages.

539
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,760
 And many people in Jerusalem at that time

540
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,380
 begin to turn and hear the gospel together

541
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,600
 for the first time.

542
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,760
 It is this beautiful idea that the spirit now

543
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,260
 begins to get poured out on people,

544
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,600
 fulfilling the prophecy of Joel that would say,

545
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,740
 in those days, the spirit would come upon all flesh,

546
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,800
 fulfilling the prophecy of Isaiah, who would say,

547
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,880
 there is a time coming where the spirit of the Lord

548
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,280
 will be upon me so I can preach good news to the poor.

549
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,040
 And these things all begin to come together

550
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,440
 as the disciples themselves experience the fullness

551
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,760
 of the spirit within them, and they realize

552
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:25,440
 that there's no longer any separation anymore.

553
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,880
 This is why Paul, then, when he's writing to the church,

554
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,960
 he writes this most profound theological idea.

555
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,560
 No one in history had ever said this before.

556
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,960
 He says, don't you realize that you are now

557
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,460
 the temple of the Holy Spirit?

558
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:42,680
 He's like, it's not a building anymore.

559
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,500
 Oh, back in the old times, we needed the separation

560
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,620
 because we could not enter the holiness of God

561
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,420
 without sin having been dealt with,

562
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,400
 but now sin has been dealt with, so don't you realize

563
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,120
 that the spirit is now happy to make his home within you?

564
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,800
 Happy to come and have that fullness of the spirit

565
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,240
 and the fullness of humanity, no longer just

566
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,720
 in the incarnation of Christ, but in the church itself,

567
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:06,880
 which is why I love this symbol.

568
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,280
 See all the people with the spirit inside of them there?

569
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,480
 They look like bowling pins.

570
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,220
 They're not bowling pins.

571
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,880
 Those are people filled with the spirit,

572
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,560
 which is why, then, Paul writes to the church,

573
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,360
 and he says, don't you know that the same spirit

574
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,120
 that raised Jesus from the dead is now inside of you?

575
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,160
 He then writes and says, no one is able to say

576
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,280
 Jesus is Lord unless the spirit enables them to say it.

577
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,800
 He's like, the spirit now, there's no barrier,

578
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:32,160
 there's no brokenness, there's no separation.

579
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,640
 We are now all filled with the spirit of God,

580
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,920
 and yes, it's the external manifestations,

581
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,900
 and we give grace for that, but it's also

582
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,600
 the internal transformation that is at work.

583
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:45,440
 I can see the spirit, and I can confess the spirit

584
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,800
 because of the spirit.

585
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:53,000
 So that's how scripture would describe the movement,

586
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,400
 the eight primary movements of the spirit,

587
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,440
 all to communicate that now the fullness

588
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:02,880
 of that spirit is here with us.

589
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,920
 Now, that's a very quick overview,

590
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,640
 but let me give you two important things of it.

591
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:09,000
 The first is, I want you to see through all of this

592
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
 that there is a trajectory of the spirit

593
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:14,120
 desiring to get closer and closer to you.

594
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,280
 Are you with me?

595
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,200
 So from the start, it's like, okay,

596
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,720
 just hovering over everything,

597
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,520
 but then the narrative of scripture,

598
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,200
 if you follow it from Genesis to Revelation,

599
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,880
 is the spirit basically pursuing you.

600
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,880
 The spirit getting closer and closer and closer and closer,

601
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,880
 and when Jesus does the death and the resurrection,

602
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,440
 pays the price for sin, then within us,

603
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:37,500
 the spirit is constantly on your pursuit.

604
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,360
 And this is a beautiful thing,

605
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,300
 because what the scriptures really kind of teach us

606
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:45,360
 about the spirit is that it's for our good.

607
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,400
 It's for our benefit to connect us with Jesus,

608
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,040
 who connects us to the Father.

609
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,640
 And the spirit manifests the person

610
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,440
 and the character of Jesus,

611
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,840
 which is what the spirit has always done

612
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,420
 with the law that was given on Mount Sinai.

613
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,960
 Then in Pentecost, we're celebrating next week,

614
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,600
 the law is now written on the tablets of our heart

615
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,080
 and poured out by the spirit.

616
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,920
 In other words, the character of God

617
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,940
 is now not just written on some stone tablets,

618
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,180
 it's actually written within me.

619
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:15,960
 But I get to see and feel that spirit at work now within me,

620
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:18,280
 and it is a profound thing.

621
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,240
 The brokenness of Andrew

622
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:23,260
 and the fullness of the spirit as one.

623
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:29,440
 And the reason why that's important

624
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,040
 is 'cause when you think about it that way,

625
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,560
 the spirit is always to connect you to Jesus,

626
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,960
 it's always to connect you to the Father,

627
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,640
 it's always for your good.

628
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,720
 Which is really interesting,

629
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,440
 because I've struggled many times in my Christian life

630
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,160
 with fear when it comes to the spirit.

631
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,040
 Anyone else ever felt that way?

632
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,900
 A little bit fearful of the spirit?

633
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,360
 I know I have, I've had season where I'm like,

634
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,720
 I'm not sure if I wanna pray

635
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,200
 and invite the spirit to come more

636
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,720
 'cause I don't wanna bark like a dog.

637
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,560
 Right?

638
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,960
 Like I don't wanna do a weird thing.

639
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,560
 I've seen at times the spirit do weird things to people

640
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,600
 and I don't wanna be doing weird things,

641
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,640
 that's embarrassing.

642
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,500
 So I've held myself back

643
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,040
 from the fullness of the spirit at times out of fear.

644
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,760
 I wonder if that resonates with anyone here.

645
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,280
 But when the scriptures teach us

646
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,160
 that the spirit is always pursuing us,

647
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,120
 when the scriptures teach us

648
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,840
 that the spirit is leading us to Jesus,

649
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,040
 when we know that everything the spirit has for us

650
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,400
 is for our good,

651
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,840
 Paul's like, why wouldn't we welcome it?

652
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,000
 Why wouldn't we eagerly desire the spiritual gifts?

653
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,200
 Why wouldn't we want the spirit to fall on us

654
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,160
 and be a part of us?

655
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,640
 And if you're struggling here today

656
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,480
 with any sense of fear around the Holy Spirit,

657
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,280
 I can't wait to be able to pray with you in a moment.

658
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,160
 'Cause I believe that the Lord

659
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,480
 wants to do something significant

660
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,200
 by breaking off the fear

661
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,120
 that I think we can so easily hold.

662
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,460
 The reality is the fear around the Holy Spirit

663
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:51,400
 is a strategy of the enemy.

664
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,460
 And as we stand together as a community

665
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,400
 and break off that stronghold

666
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,960
 that can easily be upon us,

667
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,440
 I believe we will be freer

668
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:00,880
 for the external manifestations

669
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:03,120
 and the internal transformation

670
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,160
 that the spirit wants to bring.

671
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,540
 Is that okay?

672
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,380
 Okay, that's the first thing.

673
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,320
 Here's the second thing.

674
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,960
 I want you to come have a look at this.

675
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,080
 'Cause I wanna explain now,

676
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,560
 before we go into prayer,

677
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:15,160
 exactly what all of this is saying to us

678
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,120
 about the work of the Spirit in fullness.

679
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,160
 Now, I'm gonna do the work of the Spirit

680
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,120
 in like a little spirit bubble like that,

681
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,640
 but we actually know that it's a person, right?

682
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,720
 The Spirit is a person.

683
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:25,880
 We've talked about that in this series so far.

684
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,720
 But I wanna explain to you

685
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,320
 what we see in this whole eight movements of the Spirit

686
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,800
 and how it begins to show us

687
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,080
 something quite significant

688
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,080
 that's taking place in the world.

689
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,240
 Okay, so there are actually two,

690
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,660
 that now looks like a tree, by the way,

691
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,760
 but it's not a tree, okay?

692
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,340
 Just bear with me.

693
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:44,200
 So what we see is that the Spirit is in the world.

694
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,920
 The Scriptures, in that overview I gave us,

695
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:51,840
 would teach us that the Spirit is actually in the world.

696
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,400
 In fact, the way it's described in Genesis as the ruach,

697
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,400
 it's a Hebrew word which means breath or wind.

698
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,000
 The idea that the Spirit is the breath

699
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,240
 that brings all of creation alive.

700
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,960
 In fact, it is the sustainer of all life.

701
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:13,600
 So the Spirit sustains and brings to life everything,

702
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,080
 holds everything in its heart,

703
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,560
 holds everything in its ability to be able to breathe,

704
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,560
 have its function and have its being.

705
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,360
 The Spirit is in the world

706
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,800
 so that everything might find life.

707
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,920
 Paul would later write in Romans chapter eight,

708
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,800
 Romans eight, this idea of like,

709
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,640
 hey, there's creation itself

710
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,880
 and it's groaning and longing for its own reconciliation,

711
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,160
 its own redemption with the Lord.

712
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,040
 There's this longing in it.

713
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,880
 And we see that the biggest picture of this is,

714
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,600
 as I've already explained, the incarnation,

715
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,080
 the power that there is in humanity and the Spirit

716
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,520
 now in the world together,

717
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:54,040
 manifested in that beautiful way of the external

718
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,240
 and the internal that is at work.

719
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,400
 So the Scriptures teach us that the Spirit is in the world.

720
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,600
 Does that make sense?

721
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,920
 But the Scriptures also show us

722
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:04,960
 that the Spirit is upon the world.

723
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,960
 This is slightly different

724
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,040
 and it's important to understand the differences.

725
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,920
 So the Spirit in the world, the breath sustaining all life,

726
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,120
 the incarnation and its greatest expression,

727
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,200
 but the Spirit is also upon the world.

728
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,400
 We saw that with the hovering element.

729
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:23,080
 We see that in the prophetic words of Joel and Isaiah,

730
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,480
 where they long for, as Joel would say,

731
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:29,120
 that the Spirit in those days will be poured out upon

732
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,520
 all flesh, the idea that the Spirit moves upon.

733
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,920
 But this is seen most dramatically

734
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,840
 actually in the death and resurrection moment

735
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,640
 where the curtain, I can't spell,

736
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,000
 where the curtain in the temple

737
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,520
 is split from top to bottom.

738
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,960
 So in the moment where Jesus gives up his life,

739
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,120
 the curtain splits from top to bottom.

740
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,040
 Now the question we should ask is

741
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,120
 why does the curtain split from top to bottom?

742
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,360
 It splits, yes, so that humanity is now symbolically

743
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,880
 invited in to the presence of God,

744
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,960
 but the split is also there to illustrate

745
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,600
 that this presence now can come out into the world.

746
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,760
 So there is an in towards the Spirit

747
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,560
 by the cutting of the curtain,

748
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,920
 but there also is a releasing of the Spirit

749
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,280
 into the world through the beauty of that as well.

750
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:19,240
 This is really important because if you believe

751
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,120
 that the Spirit is upon the world

752
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,440
 and you believe that the Spirit is in the world,

753
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,200
 that means that when you wake up tomorrow

754
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,520
 and you go into your workplace,

755
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,560
 the Spirit is as much there as it is here right now.

756
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,840
 Are you following this?

757
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,520
 Like this is theologically really important

758
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,280
 so that when you get up and go to work tomorrow,

759
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,280
 you have the same expectations.

760
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,440
 It may not be worship music, it may be a board meeting,

761
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,200
 it may be a classroom, it may be whatever it is for you,

762
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,200
 but you can also think that the Spirit

763
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,960
 is as much at work in this place

764
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,280
 as he was yesterday at the Vine.

765
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:55,640
 And I think God wants to, in this time of uncharted,

766
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:59,040
 make sure that we're expectant in the community

767
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,380
 as much as we are in this community, okay?

768
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,880
 Only me who is excited about that.

769
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,720
 Okay, great.

770
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,640
 Now, this is where I'm gonna finish, notice this.

771
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:11,920
 The same of what the Spirit has done in the world,

772
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,200
 he has also done in us.

773
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,720
 The Spirit is also in you.

774
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:20,560
 You can look at it later, but in 1 Corinthians 12, 3,

775
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:26,400
 in 1 Corinthians 6, 19, Paul basically says the same thing,

776
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,880
 that we are able to say that Jesus is Lord

777
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,040
 because of the work of the Spirit in us.

778
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:34,960
 So the Spirit is in you to bring you to salvation,

779
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:39,760
 first and foremost, and then Paul says it is sanctification,

780
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,600
 the ongoing work of the Spirit to make us more and more

781
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,600
 like his son Christ Jesus, and that is Ephesians 4.

782
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,320
 Now, in this process of sanctification,

783
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,720
 he gives us what's called the fruits of the Spirit,

784
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:59,400
 the Spirit that actually bears fruit inside of us,

785
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:02,960
 Galatians 5, 22, and Ellison is gonna preach

786
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,140
 and teach more on that fruit of the Spirit next week.

787
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:10,040
 So the Spirit is in you for salvation and sanctification.

788
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,320
 Helpful?

789
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,960
 But the Spirit is also at times upon you,

790
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,920
 and the Spirit comes upon you for various different things.

791
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,840
 This is seen predominantly, again,

792
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:26,240
 you can look at 1 Corinthians 12, 1 Corinthians 14,

793
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,200
 where it speaks ideally around the ideas of the gifts,

794
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,760
 the gifts of the Spirit and how the gifts of the Spirit

795
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:36,160
 are at work in us, upon us, using us.

796
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:39,240
 Now, the important thing is that the upon you work

797
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,100
 of the Spirit is to essentially do this thing.

798
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,540
 It's to empower you.

799
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:48,600
 So where the Spirit is in you for salvation

800
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:53,600
 and sanctification, the Spirit comes upon you to empower you.

801
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,160
 And the question is why and what is it empowering?

802
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,120
 Well, the Bible would suggest two areas.

803
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,280
 First of all, kingdom advancement.

804
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,600
 This is what we see in the life of Jesus.

805
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,680
 It's what we see in the life of the church.

806
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,760
 The Spirit pours out upon His people,

807
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,600
 and prophetic words come.

808
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,060
 Prophetic words that help people to understand who God is.

809
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,920
 Prophetic words that maybe changes something

810
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,240
 in someone's life.

811
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,480
 A word of knowledge that actually changes

812
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,800
 somebody's life dramatically.

813
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,160
 Jesus' miracles performed to inaugurate the kingdom.

814
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:28,220
 The church now embracing the miraculous

815
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:32,020
 to show the world signs of the kingdom that is here.

816
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:35,440
 The kingdom advancement empowered by the Spirit

817
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,120
 that is upon us.

818
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,940
 But then also, it speaks about the idea of victory over sin.

819
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:45,600
 Now, of course, in Jesus' death and resurrection,

820
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,040
 sin is defeated.

821
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,040
 But I think we all know that sometimes sin

822
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,760
 has a stronghold in us.

823
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:53,320
 Sometimes sin can become habitual for us,

824
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,000
 and as much as we might try to fight it,

825
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,000
 we realize that there's a weakness to us.

826
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,700
 The Spirit comes upon us at times to bring us

827
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,500
 greater victory over sin,

828
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,480
 particularly where there's strongholds

829
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,840
 or there's habitual sin that we've not been able

830
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:08,680
 to break at any point in time.

831
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:15,000
 So the Spirit is in you, and the Spirit is upon you.

832
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,080
 Is that helpful?

833
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,320
 All right, five of you, good.

834
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,340
 Now, notice this.

835
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,640
 Here's what we actually do.

836
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,740
 We put all of these things into boxes,

837
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,880
 and we find our preferences.

838
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,780
 And so for some of you, like I said earlier,

839
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:33,340
 you're fully comfortable in this space right here,

840
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:36,900
 but this idea kind of freaks you out a little bit.

841
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,300
 Or maybe you're very comfortable in this space

842
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:40,900
 'cause that's how you were brought up.

843
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,460
 Maybe you've been in a church environment

844
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,660
 where that's really clear,

845
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,660
 but this whole sort of fruit of the Spirit

846
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:48,500
 sanctification thing, you're not quite sure about that.

847
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,540
 Maybe, again, you don't believe that God can be

848
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,400
 as powerful in your workplace as He is for 90 minutes

849
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,020
 at the vine on a Sunday.

850
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,180
 We can all have our boxes,

851
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:59,440
 and what I'm trying to say to us today

852
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,020
 is that if we're really gonna embrace

853
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,200
 the work of the Spirit, it needs to be

854
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:06,520
 in all of these areas in our world and in our lives,

855
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,740
 in the world, upon the world, in you, upon you.

856
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,200
 Helpful?

857
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,300
 All right, so that was like the intro.

858
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:21,600
 I'm freaking you out now.

859
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:24,320
 This is the main course, okay?

860
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,160
 Because I've just unpacked a bunch of theological stuff

861
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,560
 for you, which is helpful and interesting, I hope,

862
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:33,700
 but the reality is God does all of this

863
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,940
 so that He can transform and change us,

864
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,940
 culture, society, the world.

865
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,560
 The good news of Jesus Christ is not that a church

866
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,520
 changes anything, but Jesus changes it.

867
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,660
 The good news of Jesus Christ is not that a person

868
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,120
 can heal another person, but that the Spirit of God

869
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:51,480
 can heal someone.

870
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,960
 The good news of Jesus Christ is that it all is about Him,

871
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,640
 and He does all of this, not so,

872
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,760
 and we said this the other week,

873
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:03,120
 not so He can show off, but so that He can act.

874
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:06,780
 So He can take us from a place of brokenness

875
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:09,300
 to greater freedom, so that He can take us

876
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,160
 from a place of darkness to a place of light,

877
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,400
 where He can take the disorder in us

878
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,440
 and bring it into order, and that's what we want to do now.

879
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,220
 We've got 25 minutes, can you believe it?

880
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,000
 I hope you're excited.

881
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,720
 I'm excited.

882
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,960
 We're gonna have a prayer team in the upper house.

883
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,640
 We're gonna have a prayer team here in the lower house.

884
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,920
 We're gonna have some people at the front.

885
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,160
 There's gonna be some people here.

886
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,560
 There's gonna be some people around here,

887
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,120
 and here's what we're gonna do.

888
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:39,580
 If you, no one's gonna be forced to do anything,

889
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:42,900
 but if you would like to receive prayer,

890
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,480
 maybe for you it's like, you know what?

891
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,140
 I've got too much fear.

892
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,840
 I've got too much fear, and it's holding me back

893
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,120
 from this box right here, and I would love someone

894
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,560
 to pray for me and to release that fear.

895
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,840
 Or maybe you're looking for more of the fruit

896
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,640
 to be at work in your life, and you'd like someone

897
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,360
 to stand for you and pray for the fruit to manifest.

898
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,680
 Maybe you want more expectation for your workplace,

899
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,640
 and you want someone to come around you and stand with you.

900
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,360
 Maybe there's some habitual sin that's going on,

901
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,520
 and you're like, you know what?

902
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,160
 I've ignored it for too long.

903
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,160
 I've tried to battle it in my own strength.

904
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,840
 I've built my own Tower of Babel.

905
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,080
 Nothing is working.

906
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,620
 I need the Spirit to break me free.

907
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,960
 I'd love to do that.

908
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,360
 We would love to do that with you today.

909
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,400
 So whatever it might mean for you,

910
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,320
 how is it that you would like to receive prayer?

911
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,160
 And this is what we're gonna do.

912
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,240
 We're just gonna enable a time of prayer.

913
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,520
 There's gonna be some worship happening,

914
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,580
 so if you're not being prayed for,

915
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,920
 if you just wanna worship, maybe reflect

916
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,260
 on what we've taught today, invite the Spirit

917
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,800
 to be with you in worship.

918
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,000
 If you'd like to come forward for prayer in a moment,

919
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,240
 we're gonna do that for you as well.

920
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,000
 So why don't we all stand together?

921
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,480
 And I'm just gonna invite our pastors and prayer leaders

922
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,920
 and elders just to be available,

923
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,820
 whether that's to come to the front here

924
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,880
 or just on the sides in the upper house

925
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,240
 at the front and the back.

926
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:59,840
 I wonder whether we just all open our hands

927
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,760
 if you're comfortable to do so.

928
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,920
 And I'm gonna pray, and then we're gonna invite you

929
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,760
 to respond.

930
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,820
 Father, we are standing before you as your people,

931
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:15,040
 and we're so grateful that we're at the part

932
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,600
 of the biblical story where the Spirit is at work in us,

933
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,680
 where the Spirit, because of Christ's death

934
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:25,500
 and resurrection, is fully here for us.

935
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,560
 And Father, we stand here at the vine

936
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,280
 on the first Sunday of June, 2025,

937
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:37,820
 and we say, come Holy Spirit, come Holy Spirit,

938
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:40,320
 come Holy Spirit.

939
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,080
 We pray you would break fear in the name of Jesus.

940
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:49,080
 We pray you would bring healings in the name of Jesus.

941
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,680
 We pray that the miraculous would be manifested here

942
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,320
 in the name of Jesus.

943
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,440
 We pray for sanctification, salvation,

944
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,240
 the fruit of the Spirit.

945
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,440
 We pray for our workplaces.

946
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,900
 We pray for the places of influence you've given us.

947
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,560
 We pray that the Spirit would be in and upon the world,

948
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:13,420
 in and upon us, and we pray this fervently.

949
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,000
 So I encourage you to be brave.

950
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,220
 If you'd like to receive prayer,

951
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:25,000
 you can just make your way out and come forward,

952
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,400
 both in the upper house, again, here in the overflow,

953
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,360
 you can come on into the room as well,

954
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,640
 and we're just gonna take time to pray

955
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:32,720
 for each one of you personally.

956
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,240
 So anybody who'd like to receive personal prayer,

957
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,500
 please come forward.

958
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,340
 Okay.

959
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:41,920
 (gentle music)

960
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,500
 (gentle music)

961
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,080
 (gentle music)

962
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,660
 (gentle music)

963
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:52,240
 (gentle music)

964
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,820
 (gentle music)

965
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:57,400
 (gentle music)

966
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,400
 [MUSIC]
