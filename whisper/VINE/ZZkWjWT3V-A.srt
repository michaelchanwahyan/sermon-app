1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 as you would have him speak this morning.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,280
 It's in your name we pray, amen.

3
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:05,760
 - Can we thank Promise as always?

4
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:06,740
 Promise, amazing.

5
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,200
 It's so good to be back.

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,280
 Honestly, it's so great to be back.

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,560
 I have been away for four months.

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,920
 If you're new to the Vine, like Promise said,

9
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,660
 it's an honor to meet you today.

10
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,840
 I'm looking forward to getting to know you

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,360
 a little bit more over the next couple of months.

12
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:23,320
 But it's a real privilege to kind of come back.

13
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,720
 I came back last Sunday.

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,440
 I was sitting here in the front last Sunday.

15
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,320
 I didn't have anything to do, which was awesome.

16
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,320
 So I was able just to connect with everybody.

17
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,680
 A lot of you came and said hello

18
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,280
 and gave me hugs and stuff like that,

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,360
 which was such a blessing.

20
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,920
 I really did feel welcomed home,

21
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,080
 which was a wonderful thing.

22
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,800
 But I think more important than that,

23
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,920
 as I sat there throughout the three services

24
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,360
 across last Sunday, as I listened to Ellison

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,920
 preach an incredible word,

26
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,840
 and as I sat under the ministry of our team and worship,

27
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,480
 I realized just how much the church has grown,

28
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,080
 how much the church has flourished

29
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,240
 in the four months that I've been away,

30
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,440
 how the spiritual health of the church

31
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,640
 is deeper and richer and more mature than it has been

32
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:06,720
 since I can honestly remember.

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,000
 And it honestly is such a privilege as a senior leader

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,680
 to step out of your church context for four months,

35
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,520
 come back, and the church is thriving and growing

36
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,760
 and deeper in its relationship with Jesus.

37
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,400
 So I just wanna really honor all of our leaders here,

38
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,800
 the pastoral team, the eldership,

39
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,160
 everybody who has been kind of taking charge

40
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,000
 and looking after everything

41
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,720
 whilst I've been gone.

42
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,920
 It truly is an incredible thing to step back

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,280
 and realize that I don't need to be here.

44
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:38,640
 And it's so funny, like about two weeks before I came back,

45
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,920
 I'm walking in Spain.

46
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,440
 I'll tell you a little bit more about that in a minute.

47
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,280
 I'm walking in Spain,

48
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,240
 I get a phone call from a congregation member,

49
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,960
 and they're like, "Andrew, things are going so well.

50
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,880
 "You don't need to come back."

51
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
 (audience laughing)

52
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,680
 (laughing)

53
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,560
 I was like, "Oh, that's nice."

54
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,320
 (laughing)

55
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,360
 No, no, it was awesome.

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,400
 And it is honestly such a privilege

57
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,240
 to be able to actually say that I don't come back

58
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,840
 'cause you guys need me to come back.

59
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,440
 I come back 'cause this is my home,

60
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,000
 and I am so excited to be back with you,

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,640
 and looking forward, as I've said,

62
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,800
 to getting to know some of you that I don't know.

63
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,320
 My last message that I preached here

64
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,720
 was back on June 30th,

65
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,760
 just a day before I stepped on the sabbatical.

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,840
 I stepped on the sabbatical the very next day,

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,720
 and on that Sunday, I brought a message

68
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,320
 around the prayer of Jabez,

69
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,840
 and I said on that Sunday that actually,

70
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,440
 when we misinterpret or we misunderstand

71
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,360
 the prayer of Jabez, I think so much.

72
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,200
 We often have thought that that's a prayer of prosperity,

73
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,000
 a prayer of blessing, of God expanding us,

74
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,560
 but actually, when you dig into the story,

75
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,600
 you realize that, I said on that Sunday,

76
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
 you realize that Jabez's name,

77
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,200
 his mother calls him Jabez

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,720
 because that name literally sounds in the Hebrew

79
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,800
 like the word he who causes pain,

80
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,480
 and his mother had had this massive child pain

81
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,480
 in giving birth to Jabez,

82
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:58,640
 so she names him the one who caused me pain,

83
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,040
 and I said that Sunday that Jabez has grown up

84
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,600
 with this label placed upon him,

85
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,800
 and this label has shifted him

86
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,800
 and molded him as a man as he's grown up,

87
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,360
 and he's constantly been under the pressure

88
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,120
 of this label that says I am one who causes pain,

89
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,680
 and in his prayer, as well as saying,

90
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,400
 God, would you come and do this for me,

91
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,200
 at the end of the prayer, he says this profound thing.

92
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:25,200
 He says, so that I will no longer be one who causes pain.

93
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,920
 In other words, his prayer is a prayer for liberation

94
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,560
 from the labels that had hurt him and held him back.

95
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,880
 It's a powerful prayer, and I said that Sunday

96
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,600
 that I resonate with that prayer

97
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,640
 because I'm stepping into my sabbatical,

98
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,480
 and I'm realizing that there are labels

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,640
 that I'm carrying with me.

100
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,960
 I realize that there are some things

101
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,640
 that over the last number of years of ministry,

102
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,640
 whether meaning to do it or not,

103
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,000
 some people have said some things that have hurt me,

104
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,920
 said some things that I've had to carry around with me,

105
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,960
 and that maybe I've taken on board too much,

106
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,320
 and I've not been able to shake,

107
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,800
 and it's molded and shaped the way I think

108
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,240
 and the way I act, and I realize

109
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:07,560
 that I had still some deep insecurities inside of me.

110
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,480
 There were labels I was carrying as a pastor

111
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,680
 that I needed to deal with,

112
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,760
 and I knew that sabbatical was my time

113
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,560
 to come before the Lord and try to shift

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,440
 some of those things.

115
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,400
 Prayer of Jabez was my prayer

116
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:24,360
 that I may no longer still think this about me.

117
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,960
 Alongside of that, the reality for me

118
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,280
 is that I'm turning 50 in February,

119
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,760
 just in a few months' time.

120
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:34,320
 You clap.

121
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,160
 You clap, but I realize that I am now

122
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,560
 officially very, very old.

123
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:45,760
 And as I am thinking about turning 50 in February,

124
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,800
 I have to say I'm having these thoughts

125
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,520
 of like, oh my gosh, the average age

126
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:54,400
 here at the Vine over our three services is 29.

127
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
 I am no longer 29.

128
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,600
 I'm a long way away from 29.

129
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,520
 And so I've been wrestling as well

130
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:02,680
 with these sorts of, am I past my use by date?

131
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,440
 Am I no longer relevant for the young people?

132
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,680
 There's a lot of, I can see a lot of young people here.

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,160
 Am I no longer relevant?

134
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,120
 There's some young people over here too, don't worry.

135
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,840
 But am I no longer relevant

136
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,920
 to the young people in this church?

137
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:17,040
 I'm turning 50, I'm old, what am I gonna do?

138
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,160
 And that actually sparked me thinking like,

139
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,320
 well, what am I gonna do for the rest of my life?

140
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,680
 You know, like my life is almost over.

141
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,480
 Like what am I gonna do for the next 15, 20 years?

142
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,080
 How am I going to lead the Vine?

143
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:30,280
 What am I gonna do here?

144
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,560
 What's the next steps for me?

145
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,280
 And I have all of this stuff coming together.

146
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,800
 So as I stepped on sabbatical on July 1,

147
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,040
 I took out my journal, which is my iPhone,

148
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,920
 and I wrote in my iPhone some critical questions

149
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,120
 that I wanted God to answer during my sabbatical.

150
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,920
 Let me read you the actual questions

151
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,920
 I wrote down in my journal.

152
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,880
 How much longer do you want me to be a pastor?

153
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,880
 Because I realized that being a pastor

154
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,640
 is a calling from you, and I can't assume

155
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,080
 that that calling's always gonna be there.

156
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,960
 So how much longer, Lord, do you want me to do this thing

157
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,760
 that you've called me to do?

158
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,120
 Connected to that, I was asking this,

159
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,800
 how much longer should I lead the Vine for?

160
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,040
 'Cause as you guys have experienced in the last four months,

161
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,520
 we have an incredible team of people here.

162
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,200
 We have this embarrassment of riches

163
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
 when it comes to talent and heart and calling

164
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:20,640
 and the work of the spirit amongst us by our pastoral team.

165
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,040
 How much longer should I lead for?

166
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,680
 Maybe it's time for me to hand over,

167
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,120
 'cause I'm turning 50, right?

168
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
 You know, and this is all going in my head.

169
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,560
 So I wrote this.

170
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,440
 When and how should I hand over the church

171
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,120
 to the next generation?

172
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,760
 When should that be?

173
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,320
 When, God, are you going to ask me to do that?

174
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,440
 And that kind of created some thoughts in me

175
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,920
 that weren't necessarily healthy, so I also wrote this.

176
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,040
 I said, what the heck will I do for my living

177
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,840
 if you take the church away from me?

178
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,240
 I'm just being honest.

179
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
 This is what I'm writing in my journal,

180
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,240
 'cause if you call me away or if you raise somebody else up,

181
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,400
 what am I gonna do for my living?

182
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,760
 You've taken away my living from me.

183
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:56,440
 This is my attitude, not very good, I realize,

184
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,160
 which led me to the next question,

185
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,360
 which is why am I still so filled

186
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:04,400
 with insecurity and self-doubts, right?

187
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,120
 And then out of that came perhaps

188
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,240
 the most important question of all that I wrote down.

189
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,920
 I said this, I said, do aliens really exist?

190
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,440
 'Cause I really need to know, Lord.

191
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,480
 No, okay, that wasn't in my journal.

192
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,560
 Let's just rub that one out.

193
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,400
 We're gonna rub that out.

194
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,880
 Rub it out, yep, there you go.

195
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,120
 So that wasn't in my journal, but the rest of them were.

196
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,360
 So you get an idea of kind of the things

197
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,520
 that were on my heart as I was stepping into sabbatical,

198
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,200
 the things that I was seeking God's will for,

199
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,400
 and what I was wanting is to get a revelation from Him

200
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
 in these areas of my life so that I could come back here

201
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,960
 and give you, kind of partake and put that revelation

202
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,560
 into us, and I'm super excited to announce here

203
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,680
 this afternoon, it's an important announcement.

204
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,560
 I'm gonna announce to you that over my sabbatical,

205
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,040
 God did not talk to me about any of those things.

206
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,600
 Not one thing at all.

207
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,720
 None of those things were what God spoke to me about.

208
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,240
 Have you ever had that with God?

209
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,360
 You know, like you show up with a laundry list of things,

210
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,480
 like here's all the things that you need

211
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,000
 to speak to me about, and God's like,

212
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,920
 (laughing)

213
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,360
 as in like those are the important ones.

214
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,840
 No, Andrew, actually, here are the things

215
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,120
 that I need to talk to you about.

216
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,440
 So let's just wipe that away,

217
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,040
 'cause God just wiped that away.

218
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:18,920
 And instead, about two weeks into my sabbatical,

219
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:21,320
 God comes to me and He says, Andrew,

220
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,440
 there are actually only three things

221
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,960
 I wanna talk to you about over the next four months.

222
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,080
 He says, I wanna talk to you about

223
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,480
 your relationship with me, your relationship with yourself,

224
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,360
 and your relationship with your wife.

225
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:38,240
 And He said, nothing else is important.

226
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,040
 And I know you've got all these questions on your heart.

227
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,880
 I know you're asking for me to do so much,

228
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,520
 but Andrew, actually, only three things really matter.

229
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,160
 And if you wanna be a healthy pastor,

230
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,800
 and a healthy leader, and a healthy human being,

231
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,920
 these are the only three things that are on my heart,

232
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:59,840
 you and me, you and yourself, you and your wife, Chris.

233
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,640
 And so over those four months, God began to speak to me

234
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,160
 about how I needed to refresh my relationship with Him,

235
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,880
 which I desperately needed to do.

236
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,880
 I realized that I had become a bit dry,

237
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,280
 and that my relationship with God

238
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:14,320
 was driven more by the job I had,

239
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,080
 rather than the joy I had to be His son.

240
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:19,400
 I realized that there was so much

241
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,840
 of those insecurities within me,

242
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,760
 which meant that my relationship with myself

243
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:25,120
 was not where it should be,

244
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,480
 and I wasn't operating out of a place of confidence

245
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,120
 in being a son of God.

246
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,600
 And instead, other things were getting in the way.

247
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,720
 And I realized, and this was the one

248
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
 that really opened my spirit up,

249
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,880
 and really kinda just changed my heart,

250
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,760
 I realized that my marriage was not where it should be.

251
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,280
 I realized it was because I had been so selfish,

252
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,240
 that there was a selfishness in me,

253
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,680
 which meant that so oftentimes,

254
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:55,120
 my wife got the worst part of me out of my day than the best.

255
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,680
 And I realized that as a typical pastor,

256
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,280
 there was that cliche that I was putting ministry

257
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:03,160
 over the home, and that that needed to change,

258
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,840
 and God was concerned about that.

259
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,080
 One of the things I wrote in my diary about my wife

260
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,640
 is God basically said to me,

261
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,240
 "You do not have any idea the power that there is

262
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,320
 "and the gift that I've given you in Chris."

263
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:18,000
 And so there was a journey for me

264
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,240
 in rediscovering the wonder of my wife.

265
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,040
 I love my wife, and I always have loved my wife,

266
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,680
 but this deepening expression of what it is to be with her.

267
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,840
 And so I was hoping to come back

268
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,640
 with some great revelation for you,

269
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,360
 but what I return with is simply a great relationship,

270
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,560
 great relationship with him and with myself

271
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,920
 and a growing and better relationship with my wife.

272
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,240
 Without sounding too cheesy about it,

273
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,200
 and I don't apologize for it,

274
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,560
 here's the reality, I really, really love Jesus again.

275
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,280
 Like, I really do.

276
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,400
 I feel like my whole life has shifted

277
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,160
 into this new place of peace,

278
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,160
 because there's a vibrancy and a beauty and a wonder

279
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,720
 of a daily falling in love with Jesus again.

280
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,800
 And it's weird, but it's because I spent

281
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,080
 so much time with Jesus.

282
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,400
 I mean, one of the things I did on my sabbatical

283
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,600
 was this thing called the Camino de Santiago.

284
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,960
 The Camino de Santiago is a 34-day walking pilgrimage.

285
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:26,840
 It's 800 kilometers from this place in France

286
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,360
 called Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port

287
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,360
 to Santiago de Compostela in the west coast of Spain.

288
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,520
 And this journey takes about 34 days.

289
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:39,280
 You're walking on average about 25 kilometers a day,

290
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,680
 so that's anywhere from about five to seven hours

291
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,480
 of walking with a big, heavy backpack on every day.

292
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,000
 As you walk, you can be in a place of solitude.

293
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
 Oftentimes, you're walking on your own.

294
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,360
 You may not see another human being for a couple of hours.

295
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,600
 You visit churches throughout the day.

296
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,040
 Sometimes at night, you'll stay in churches.

297
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,360
 The churches will open up their place

298
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,760
 and you can sleep on the floor of the church.

299
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,360
 You're basically doing a pilgrimage

300
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,840
 from one place to another.

301
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,440
 And the reason why the Camino is so famous

302
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,880
 and such a sacred space is because it was first walked

303
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:18,840
 in 812, not 1812, 812, in the ninth century.

304
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,960
 They were actually disciples of the Apostle James

305
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,520
 and they had what they believed

306
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,600
 were the bones of the Apostle James.

307
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,440
 And so they wanted to take those bones to Santiago,

308
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,000
 so they walked the bones from the south of France

309
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,560
 all the way to Santiago.

310
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,860
 And that journey that they did is exactly the same path

311
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:39,880
 that you now walk when you do the Camino Frances in Spain.

312
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,100
 And it was a great privilege to be able to walk every day

313
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,720
 with no other responsibilities other than to spend

314
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,480
 about five, six, seven hours in and out of prayer

315
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,520
 and in the company of Jesus.

316
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,040
 It was such a beautiful thing.

317
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,120
 I don't know if you're anything like me,

318
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:57,080
 but usually when I spend more time with people,

319
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,920
 I actually like them less.

320
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,680
 Is anyone ever like that?

321
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,320
 You know when you spend more time with people

322
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,080
 and you come to discover that actually

323
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,720
 they're not the people that you thought they were, right?

324
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,360
 Or you spend more time with people

325
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,240
 and then you discover that actually your flaws

326
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
 and your brokenness is kind of reflected in them

327
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,120
 and you kind of actually don't like yourself around them,

328
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,280
 right, or maybe you spend time with them

329
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,480
 and you had put them on a pedestal

330
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,700
 and you thought they would be like this

331
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,240
 and yet when you spent more time with them,

332
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,960
 you realize they're not quite the human being

333
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,800
 I thought they were.

334
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,760
 We often, when we spend more time with people,

335
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,060
 don't like them as much.

336
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,100
 It is not like that with Jesus.

337
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,040
 See, when you spend more time with Jesus,

338
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:37,720
 you cannot help but fall more in love with him

339
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,280
 'cause he's all grace and love and kindness and mercy

340
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,840
 and you get to see him in different ways

341
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,440
 and you get to experience his voice in your life

342
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,280
 like never before.

343
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,640
 And even though at times that voice is challenging

344
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,360
 and not always easy to hear,

345
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:53,200
 it's always from a place of love to form and to shape you

346
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,640
 into the person he's created you to be

347
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,160
 and when you spend copious amounts of time with Jesus,

348
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,520
 you're only going to love him more

349
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:03,600
 and so I return to you not with some great revelation

350
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,980
 but simply a love of Christ.

351
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,920
 Now, I know what some of you are probably thinking

352
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,380
 as you sit there.

353
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,000
 You're thinking, well, that's all well and good

354
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,460
 for you, Andrew.

355
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,240
 You had four months off.

356
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,700
 You had a sabbatical.

357
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,020
 Oh, isn't that nice?

358
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,140
 Give me four months off work, put a backpack on me

359
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:27,540
 and send me to Spain and have all that nice food

360
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:30,380
 and all that nice wine, I would love Jesus more too.

361
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:33,800
 (congregation laughing)

362
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,980
 You know what?

363
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,140
 You would be right.

364
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:40,080
 You would love Jesus more.

365
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,860
 And so although I've had this amazing experience

366
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,620
 on this Camino and during my sabbatical

367
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,380
 and I come back to you and say, I love Jesus more,

368
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,260
 you're sitting there like, yeah, that's great for you

369
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,980
 but what about me?

370
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,580
 And I hear that and I think this actually raises

371
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,020
 one of the most important questions

372
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,220
 that we all have to wrestle with.

373
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:01,220
 How do I deepen my love with Jesus in my normal life?

374
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,600
 Like in the normal busyness and stress

375
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,660
 and all the responsibilities I have,

376
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:10,460
 how do I deepen my love for Jesus in the here and the now,

377
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:13,740
 in the craziness of Hong Kong and in the work

378
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:16,140
 that I have to do and the responsibilities that I have

379
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,860
 and the grind that I'm in?

380
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,480
 How do I recapture, refresh something of a passion

381
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,940
 for Jesus in the here and the now?

382
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:28,260
 And that's what is on my heart for you as I do return.

383
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,460
 I wanna share today but also in a number

384
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:34,660
 of one-off messages in 2025, some answers to that question,

385
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,020
 ways in which I think all of us can actually deepen

386
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,780
 and refresh in our relationship with Jesus

387
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,820
 without having to go away for four months

388
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:41,900
 and do a sabbatical.

389
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,600
 I hope at some point you do get a chance

390
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,740
 to do the sabbatical and I highly recommend the Camino

391
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,800
 if you ever do.

392
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,860
 But isn't it the point of Christian discipleship

393
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,580
 that we flourish and grow in Him

394
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:55,040
 in the moments of everyday life?

395
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,100
 So what I wanna do today is share the first

396
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,220
 of these ideas with you.

397
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,880
 And what I wanna share with you today,

398
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,180
 I believe actually has the power to shift so much

399
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,860
 of your thinking about God and who He is in your life.

400
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:13,220
 In fact, so much of perhaps shifting your relationship

401
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,600
 with Him that I think if you put into practice this week

402
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,540
 the things we're about to talk about,

403
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:19,880
 I do genuinely believe that you will have

404
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,340
 a revolutionized relationship with Jesus.

405
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:25,140
 I think what I'm about to talk about is that important.

406
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:28,820
 So I wanna pray, I wanna pray that you open your ears

407
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:31,100
 and my ears will open too to what the Holy Spirit

408
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,760
 wants to say, is that okay?

409
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,600
 Let's pray.

410
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:37,680
 And let us ask that as we come into this moment now,

411
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,320
 that Father, you would open our ears and our eyes

412
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,240
 to see you in new and fresh ways.

413
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,120
 Lord, we long to love you more.

414
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,480
 And Father, we pray that we would be able

415
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,420
 to do this together as a community.

416
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,280
 We thank you for this in Jesus' name.

417
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,380
 To introduce you to this little tip

418
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,180
 or this little way of thinking,

419
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:02,040
 let me tell you a story about what happened to me

420
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,040
 whilst I was on the Camino.

421
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,680
 The Camino, as I said, is 800 kilometers long

422
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,600
 and the majority of the time you're walking

423
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,800
 in rural parts of Spain, beautiful environments.

424
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,000
 And you might come across a couple of villages

425
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,360
 as you're walking throughout the day.

426
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,160
 And like I say, you could walk for hours

427
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:21,440
 without really even seeing another human being.

428
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,580
 But throughout the walk, you actually come

429
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:27,000
 to a number of cities during those 800 kilometers.

430
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,120
 Pamplona, where they do the chasing of the bulls,

431
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:33,760
 a place called Legrono, Burgos, and then one city,

432
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,180
 which is about 500 kilometers into the walk.

433
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,660
 So for me, that was about three weeks into walking.

434
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,120
 It's called Leon.

435
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,040
 And Leon is one of the largest cities

436
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,440
 that you come across during the walk.

437
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:47,400
 There's about 200,000 people that live in Leon.

438
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,840
 And it was interesting 'cause just before Leon,

439
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,480
 I'd been walking for about a week and a half,

440
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,640
 a lot of it on my own, and I'd been

441
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,000
 in a beautiful place of solitude.

442
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,400
 Now, I'm an extrovert with a capital E,

443
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,520
 but it was amazing for me to be in this rural environment,

444
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,160
 spending a lot of time with Jesus.

445
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,960
 And it felt so good that when I entered into Leon that day,

446
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,680
 and there's like 200,000 people living

447
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,680
 in this hustling, bustling city,

448
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,960
 it was very jarring for me.

449
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,540
 And I actually didn't really enjoy it,

450
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,880
 even though I normally love big cities.

451
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,840
 And I was like, I'm so kind of synced in to this thing here

452
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,180
 that this big city now is kind of a little bit annoying.

453
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,720
 And I made the decision that night

454
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,400
 that I was gonna wake up earlier the next day,

455
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,400
 earlier than I normally do,

456
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,840
 and I was just gonna start walking.

457
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,520
 I wanted to get out of Leon

458
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,480
 and get back into those rural moments.

459
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,520
 And so I did, I normally would start walking

460
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,760
 about eight in the morning this day.

461
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,400
 I started walking about seven in the morning.

462
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:42,520
 And as I'm walking, I'm in urban Leon,

463
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:45,600
 so just busy streets, I'm walking along.

464
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,840
 And as I'm walking, I see this man,

465
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,440
 and he's on like an electric scooter.

466
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:52,420
 You know those like little scooters, not the big ones,

467
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,800
 but just like those little electric ones

468
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:54,860
 where you can zip into a city.

469
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:58,900
 So he's riding one of those, and he starts shouting.

470
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,840
 Now, I couldn't tell from where I was

471
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,960
 and where he was at the time what he was shouting,

472
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:07,240
 but it sounded like, "Nasdaq, Nasdaq," like this, okay?

473
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,760
 Which, I don't speak Spanish,

474
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,300
 but I figure he's saying something in Spanish.

475
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,120
 I figure he's saying, "Get out of my way,"

476
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,600
 'cause he was coming pretty quick at me.

477
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,320
 So I kind of moved with my backpack out the way,

478
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,240
 and I kind of stood against the wall like this

479
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,760
 so that he had ample room to zip by me.

480
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,640
 But he zipped right straight up to me.

481
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,120
 He looks me in the eye, and he goes,

482
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:27,640
 "Pastor, Pastor Andrew, Pastor Andrew from the Vine."

483
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:31,320
 (audience laughing)

484
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,980
 And I'm like, "I can never get away!"

485
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,220
 No, I'm just kidding, I didn't say it.

486
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,500
 I was like, "Yes, yes, I am Pastor Andrew."

487
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,140
 I hadn't thought about myself like that for a while,

488
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:42,940
 but "Pastor Andrew from the Vine, yes I am."

489
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,780
 He's like, "Oh, I cannot believe it!"

490
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,980
 Anyway, turns out his name is Emmanuel.

491
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,900
 And Emmanuel was one of our asylum seekers

492
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:55,100
 who was a part of our refugee ministry back in 2018.

493
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:57,780
 Him and his family had come here from West Africa,

494
00:19:57,780 --> 00:19:59,820
 and for four years they had lived in Hong Kong,

495
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,900
 and we had helped them,

496
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,660
 and they had been a part of the Vine community.

497
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:05,780
 They'd been part of our asylum seeker and refugee ministry.

498
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,340
 This is Emmanuel here.

499
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:10,540
 And he was on his way that morning to work,

500
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,540
 because what had happened in 2018

501
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:15,660
 is that him and his family had gotten their refugee status,

502
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:18,740
 and they were moving from Hong Kong to Spain.

503
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,700
 So they left Hong Kong, they went to Spain.

504
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,740
 They decided to settle in this little town in Leon,

505
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,220
 and he has a business there.

506
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,660
 And he's scooting on his way to work.

507
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,940
 And actually, interesting, that morning,

508
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,940
 he was a little bit late leaving his house,

509
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,660
 so he was scootering quite quickly to try to get to work.

510
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,220
 And then as he's scootering down this road

511
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,700
 that he scoots down every single day

512
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,380
 for whatever number of years it had been,

513
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:41,180
 he looks and he's like, "That looks like Pastor Andrew."

514
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,940
 (audience laughing)

515
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,740
 And he comes straight up to me, he's like, "Pastor Andrew!"

516
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,900
 So he's like freaking out, and I'm freaking out,

517
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,260
 and we took a photo, and we prayed for each other,

518
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,980
 and it was like the most amazing thing.

519
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,020
 'Cause I realized if I had decided to have left my hostel

520
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,020
 a minute before or a minute after,

521
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,540
 we would have missed each other.

522
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,500
 If he hadn't been running late for work that day,

523
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,620
 he probably wouldn't have driven down

524
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,580
 that particular street at that particular time.

525
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,700
 I mean, this is one of those moments in life

526
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:09,060
 where you know God is present, amen?

527
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,380
 Like it's like all these things,

528
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:12,380
 all of these complicated things have all come together

529
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,420
 for some reason that I would be walking on that street,

530
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,860
 he would be scootering on that street,

531
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,380
 and we had a great conversation.

532
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,860
 I prayed for him, and he prayed for me,

533
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,260
 and I left there as he said goodbye and scooted off,

534
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,420
 and I kept walking.

535
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:29,220
 I left there thinking like, "Man, isn't God good?

536
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,900
 "That God would orchestrate all of this

537
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:34,460
 "so that I would know that God is with me."

538
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:41,820
 About 10 minutes later, and only the way that God does,

539
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,820
 God kinda comes up alongside of me.

540
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,780
 You ever felt like God's come alongside of you?

541
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,660
 No, okay.

542
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:50,740
 So God comes up alongside of me, and he's like,

543
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:54,060
 "Andrew," he's like, "It's funny, isn't it?"

544
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,540
 I'm like, "What?"

545
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,380
 He's like, "It's funny, isn't it?

546
00:21:56,380 --> 00:22:00,060
 "Because that whole moment with Emmanuel and Leon,"

547
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,100
 he's like, "That's just often how you think

548
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,460
 "about my presence too."

549
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,860
 I'm like, "What do you mean?"

550
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:08,740
 He's like, "Well, you think that half the time

551
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,940
 "me meeting you is like some random encounter.

552
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,260
 "You think you have to orchestrate all this stuff

553
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,900
 "in order for me to be present in your life.

554
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:20,060
 "In fact, you think that my presence in your life

555
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:23,460
 "is so random and so rare that when it does happen,

556
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,380
 "you have to stop and say, 'Oh God,

557
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:28,380
 "'thank you for reminding me that you're with me.'"

558
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,740
 And I felt like God was beginning to unpack something

559
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,420
 that was deeply important for me,

560
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,820
 and I wanna unpack this a little bit for you today,

561
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,020
 'cause I think this will help to shift some things for you.

562
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,900
 I realize that so often my relationship with God

563
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:43,260
 is built on these, what I would call,

564
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,460
 random occurrences or bumping into God.

565
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:49,860
 Like I feel like I have to work really hard

566
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,300
 to feel like I'm in the presence of God sometimes.

567
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,060
 Does any of you ever feel that way?

568
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,580
 In fact, I know that many of you feel that way,

569
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,620
 'cause as I've been leading here for so many years,

570
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,940
 I know that so many of you have shared that with me.

571
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,900
 "Oh, Pastor Andrew, I really struggle

572
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,420
 "to sense the presence of God in my life."

573
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:08,180
 Or, "Pastor Andrew, I wish I sensed God's presence

574
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,580
 "like everybody else at the Vine."

575
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,540
 "Oh, Pastor Andrew, I came to church this week

576
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,780
 "and I was raising my hands and looking around,

577
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,980
 "but I didn't feel like God was with me."

578
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,700
 And so often I think as Christians,

579
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,020
 we can wrestle with this thought

580
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:24,020
 that we're trying as best we can to meet with God

581
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,460
 and have God meet with us,

582
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:30,460
 and we often can feel like He's distant or away from us.

583
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,100
 I wonder for you, does it ever feel like with God

584
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:37,780
 that He's more a random encounter

585
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
 than a constant presence in your life?

586
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:44,300
 Does it ever feel like that way for you?

587
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,260
 That maybe He's more like you bump into Him

588
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,460
 every once in a while in your life,

589
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:52,820
 rather than the reality that He is constantly there with you?

590
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,700
 I know that's how I have felt often,

591
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:00,180
 but I also know that that is not true,

592
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,100
 that God is always present with us at all times

593
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,980
 and in all ways.

594
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,380
 But the reality is as Christians,

595
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,380
 I think we can so often kind of disregard that,

596
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,140
 and we can so often think that He's actually distant from us,

597
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,500
 that He's not near us,

598
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:16,500
 and sometimes even our language can interrupt that.

599
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:19,500
 Even our language can begin to suggest

600
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:22,660
 that He is distant and away from us.

601
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,340
 As God was unpacking this for me,

602
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:27,060
 I was beginning to see that actually even some of the things

603
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,780
 that I say here at the Vine and how I lead sometimes

604
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:33,540
 actually plays into a faulty theology

605
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:36,420
 that we have to somehow invoke God's presence

606
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,460
 in order to meet with Him.

607
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,580
 I wonder if you've ever heard anybody up front at church

608
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,820
 say something like this.

609
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:45,220
 "Lord Jesus, this morning we invite Your presence

610
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,100
 to be with us."

611
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,820
 You ever heard that at church?

612
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,020
 Or perhaps you prayed something similar to that

613
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,940
 in your own heart in private.

614
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,940
 "Oh Lord, would You just come and meet me today?

615
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,220
 I'm nervous about this work,

616
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,860
 and I just invite Your Holy Spirit to come and be with me

617
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,860
 so that I can get through this thing in my job."

618
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,340
 We have this language as Christians at times

619
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:06,620
 of this idea of inviting the presence of God

620
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,860
 or inviting the Holy Spirit into our lives.

621
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:12,780
 And here's the issue with that, I think,

622
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,660
 that although there's language there,

623
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:16,100
 and maybe it's just semantics,

624
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,500
 but when we constantly are thinking

625
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,900
 that we have to invite God,

626
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,260
 what it really communicates

627
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:23,420
 is that we don't think God is there.

628
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,300
 Come on, church.

629
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,660
 I mean, think about it this way, right?

630
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:31,060
 Like the reason why you invite someone

631
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:33,980
 is because they are not currently present.

632
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,860
 This is why we've created these amazing invites for you

633
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,780
 for Christmas Day.

634
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,180
 We want you to write the name of someone on here

635
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,180
 who, guess what, doesn't normally come to the Vine.

636
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:48,140
 And so you can invite them to be here, are you with me?

637
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,500
 But it's funny because our language in church

638
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,180
 so often seems to back up this idea

639
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,700
 that God, I'm inviting you,

640
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,340
 which essentially means before I did that, you weren't here.

641
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:01,860
 Like I have to somehow position myself

642
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,780
 in order to try to get Your Spirit and Your presence to me.

643
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:09,100
 I think the second thing that this issue creates for us

644
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,740
 is that it kind of makes us think

645
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,540
 that God's presence is our determination and not His.

646
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:18,380
 In other words, that I'm responsible in some ways

647
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,500
 for trying to get God's presence

648
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:24,420
 either in my life or in some situation.

649
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,260
 And that puts a huge amount of pressure on us.

650
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:28,740
 And when it feels like for us that God is still distant,

651
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,700
 we think something's either wrong with us

652
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,260
 or we think something's wrong with God.

653
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,340
 And so we try to stir up within ourselves

654
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:38,540
 even more effort to try to create God's presence

655
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:41,740
 to just come 'cause He's obviously not here.

656
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:43,180
 This is what we see actually happen

657
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,420
 in 1 Kings 18, verse 27.

658
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,180
 And I love how Elijah is saying this.

659
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:50,420
 This is the moment where Elijah's up on the mountain

660
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,860
 and he's speaking to the prophets of Baal

661
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,700
 and they're trying to call down God to respond.

662
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,540
 He says this, he says,

663
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,700
 "At noon, Elijah began to taunt them.

664
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,420
 "'Shout louder,' he said.

665
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,700
 "'Surely He is a God.

666
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,420
 "'Perhaps He is in deep thought,

667
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,660
 "'or He's busy, or He's traveling.

668
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:08,300
 "'Maybe He's sleeping and must be awakened.'"

669
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,300
 I love the way that Elijah taunts them in this,

670
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,140
 but I read this and I think, man, I think we do this a lot.

671
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,500
 Like we think if we just shout louder,

672
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,940
 if we just try more, if we just hype things up,

673
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,420
 then God's presence may come and change everything.

674
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,900
 And God's standing to the side saying,

675
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,700
 "Don't you realize that I'm already here in my fullness?

676
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,860
 "Don't you realize that it's actually

677
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,260
 "not about you inviting me,

678
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,660
 "it's actually about me who's invited you?"

679
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:37,620
 The third thing I think it does is it causes us to think

680
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:41,580
 that some places are more sacred than others.

681
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,700
 Because in church, when we gather in a building like this

682
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,060
 and we invite God's presence to come,

683
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,500
 it's amazing, we can all feel Him.

684
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,220
 But when I wake up tomorrow and I go to work,

685
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:51,420
 I realize that He's not in that place.

686
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:54,460
 And I realize that, thank God that God has me there

687
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,500
 because I can bring the presence of God into that place.

688
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,500
 And God's like, "Hmm, I was there a lot longer

689
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,980
 "than you were, and I will be there

690
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,540
 "a lot longer after you left.

691
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,580
 "Because my presence is all here right now in its fullness."

692
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,060
 And actually the job of a Christian

693
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,300
 is not to try to invite God to come and do something.

694
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,420
 Perhaps the job of the Christian is to realize

695
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:19,020
 that God is already at work, already at play,

696
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:21,140
 already doing so much, and our role is not

697
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,420
 about inviting something that isn't there.

698
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,580
 Our role is about walking into something that truly is.

699
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,020
 And that if you can get that shift in your thinking,

700
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,900
 and it's a small, subtle thing,

701
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,180
 but if you can get that shift in your thinking,

702
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:38,660
 you're beginning to redefine your relationship with Him.

703
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,980
 That your encounter with the presence of God

704
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:44,140
 is not reserved for 90 minutes on a Sunday

705
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,780
 or community group during the week,

706
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,660
 or in those moments when you pray,

707
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,340
 but every single moment is alive with the glory of God.

708
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,660
 It's fascinating.

709
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:57,300
 If you study the New Testament,

710
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:00,540
 and if you look at the word inviting when it relates to God,

711
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:04,940
 it only in the New Testament ever shows up in two contexts.

712
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:07,820
 The first context is the invitation of the Holy Spirit

713
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:10,060
 to come at the moment of salvation.

714
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:13,160
 When we invite Jesus to come and be a part of our lives,

715
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,700
 when we invite Jesus to come and forgive us of our sins,

716
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,120
 and to wash us clean, and restore and renew us,

717
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,840
 the New Testament speaks a lot about inviting God

718
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,300
 to be in us and with us in the moment of salvation.

719
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,940
 That's context number one.

720
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,540
 The second context is the one

721
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,700
 that we're gonna be looking at at Advent.

722
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,420
 It's the context of inviting God

723
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,140
 to come at the end of all things,

724
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:36,820
 to make everything right, to come in His second coming,

725
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:39,100
 and establish heaven on earth,

726
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,520
 to restore and make all things new.

727
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,220
 The prayers in the Bible about the Spirit of God coming

728
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,540
 is always in relation to the second coming of Christ.

729
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,660
 And so you have this moment

730
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:52,060
 where they invite God for salvation,

731
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,200
 they're inviting God to come in the second coming,

732
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,460
 but in between, they're not inviting God

733
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,220
 to show up at every church meeting.

734
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,380
 And they're not doing that

735
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,740
 because they have a theology that tells them

736
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:06,860
 that the fullness of Christ is both within me

737
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,860
 and in the world.

738
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,100
 This is the beauty of the New Testament,

739
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,740
 that it teaches that when you come into salvation

740
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,620
 with Christ Jesus, the fullness of God's presence,

741
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,680
 think of this, the fullness of His presence

742
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:19,020
 comes and lives within you.

743
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,340
 Paul speaks about this so much,

744
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,340
 there's passages throughout,

745
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:24,000
 in fact, we've just thrown up a few on the screen here,

746
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,020
 you can look at.

747
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,820
 The idea of being the temple of the Holy Spirit.

748
00:30:27,820 --> 00:30:30,300
 Paul says, don't you realize that the same Spirit

749
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,460
 that raised Jesus from the dead

750
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:34,020
 is the one that's now alive and living in you.

751
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,020
 It's not like you have a half measure.

752
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,060
 It's not like you have a little bit.

753
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,460
 If you believe that Jesus is your Lord and Savior,

754
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,460
 the fullness of Christ is in you.

755
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,220
 The fullness of Him is always in you,

756
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,820
 regardless of where you are,

757
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,300
 regardless of what you're doing,

758
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:52,200
 regardless of how you're acting,

759
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:54,200
 the fullness of His presence is in you.

760
00:30:55,220 --> 00:30:57,020
 For some of you, that should change

761
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,280
 completely your relationship with Him.

762
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:02,700
 Because perhaps you've been feeling like you're distant

763
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,300
 or you're alone and you're feeling like,

764
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,460
 if only I can invite Him to come,

765
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,420
 if only He'll respond to my prayers,

766
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:12,020
 and He's like, I'm already fully in you.

767
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:15,060
 The other thing the New Testament says

768
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:17,140
 is that He's already fully in the world,

769
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,860
 that there is not a place that you could go,

770
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,460
 whether it's the Old Testament or the New Testament,

771
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,620
 the theme is the same.

772
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:25,060
 There's nowhere you can go or run away from His presence.

773
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,380
 He's omnipresent.

774
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:30,260
 He's in everything at all times, everywhere.

775
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,820
 And so the New Testament presents to us

776
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,780
 this picture of the fullness of the Spirit of God in us,

777
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:38,100
 the fullness of the Spirit of God around us.

778
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,100
 And it teaches us that Christ is fully there in person,

779
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:45,060
 when things are going great in your life

780
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,220
 and when things are not.

781
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:50,220
 He is there in person, in the stillness and in the storm.

782
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,840
 He is there in person in your life,

783
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,380
 when you're on your own or when you're with others.

784
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,060
 He is there in person, whether you're in church on a Sunday

785
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,900
 or you're in the office on a Monday.

786
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:04,300
 It does not change.

787
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,940
 And our relationship with Christ, I think,

788
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:10,500
 is so often stilted because we've decided

789
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,700
 that God is in some places and He's not in others,

790
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,820
 and we need to spend more time in the places where He is

791
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,920
 if we wanna grow in relationship with Him.

792
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,880
 And God would say, "Actually, your time in your office

793
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:27,340
 "tomorrow could be the most revolutionary time

794
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:30,620
 "in your experience with me than anything ever before,

795
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:33,420
 "'cause I'm in you fully,

796
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:37,560
 "and I'm around you fully at all times."

797
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:40,120
 So let me be real clear.

798
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,420
 We don't make God show up.

799
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,000
 Think of the arrogance that is there in thinking

800
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,640
 that we somehow control the presence of God.

801
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,220
 God decides in His authority where He is,

802
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,560
 and He's everywhere all the time.

803
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,260
 So here's the really important thing,

804
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:58,220
 and I want you to track with this.

805
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:01,100
 When it comes to the presence of God in your life,

806
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:04,540
 the issue is not inviting something that isn't there.

807
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:09,540
 The issue is in becoming more aware of what already is.

808
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:13,060
 Come on, church, are you following this?

809
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:15,420
 The issue is not in trying to invite something

810
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:17,700
 that isn't there because that puts the onus on you.

811
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,120
 That makes you central,

812
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,380
 and everything else is kind of revolving around you.

813
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,740
 The issue instead is just about becoming more aware

814
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,660
 of everything that already is,

815
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:27,300
 the fullness of His presence in you,

816
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:30,300
 the fullness of His presence around you in everything,

817
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,500
 and as you see it and encounter it,

818
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:34,340
 and you become more aware of it,

819
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,060
 it changes everything for you.

820
00:33:37,060 --> 00:33:41,000
 And suddenly you realize that your life is a joy,

821
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,580
 that your life is something to walk into boldly

822
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,480
 and confidently because you've got Him in you

823
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,180
 and around you at all times,

824
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,980
 regardless of what's happening.

825
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,820
 And because of that, you begin to shift

826
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,860
 how you think you should act and be,

827
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:57,580
 that your role in relationship to Christ

828
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,860
 is not one of delivery.

829
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,380
 Lord, I deliver your Holy Spirit to this moment.

830
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,300
 Your role is one of discovery.

831
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,100
 Lord, I ask that you make me aware

832
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,380
 of all of the amazing things that you're currently doing

833
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:12,680
 with this group of people.

834
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:18,520
 Your role shifts from invitation, come Holy Spirit,

835
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,440
 and it shifts to subjugation.

836
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,480
 I recognize that you are here in your fullness,

837
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,160
 Holy Spirit, and I now come to you.

838
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,640
 Like Pastor Ellison was talking about last week,

839
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,620
 I deny myself, lay down, I pick up my cross,

840
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,800
 and I follow you.

841
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,060
 I come to you.

842
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:39,800
 The joy that there is inside of us

843
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,500
 to know that we are never aligned,

844
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:44,280
 that even though sometimes we may not feel it,

845
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,120
 even though sometimes we don't think it,

846
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:50,680
 God is always present, and that changes everything.

847
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:53,680
 I just sense for some of you, that's gonna free you,

848
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,660
 free you from the chains of performance and religion,

849
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:03,660
 and put you in a different place of relationship.

850
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:06,520
 The question is, how do we do this?

851
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:10,000
 How do we actually become more consciously aware

852
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,680
 of his presence in our lives?

853
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,860
 Well, let me offer you three quick things as I close.

854
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,660
 Here's the first thing, embrace thanksgiving.

855
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,540
 Embrace thanksgiving.

856
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,860
 Psalm 100, verse four says,

857
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:23,340
 "We enter his gates with thanksgiving on our heart.

858
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,780
 "We enter into his presence

859
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,140
 "with this reality of thanking him."

860
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:29,660
 What thanksgiving does is it subverts

861
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,300
 any tendency of pride in us.

862
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:35,040
 Thanksgiving kind of subverts any sense

863
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,060
 of entitlement we might have.

864
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:41,820
 When we walk in a general idea of thanksgiving,

865
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,960
 thanking God for everything that is happening

866
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:47,520
 in and around our lives, it frees us so much,

867
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,840
 and it enables us to begin to see God

868
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,560
 in the things that we never thought

869
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:54,100
 we'd be able to see him in before.

870
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,400
 In the Beatitudes, it says that,

871
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,040
 "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God."

872
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,120
 And I think the number one way that you purify your heart,

873
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,940
 other than, of course, inviting the cleansing of forgiveness

874
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:07,840
 and the repentance of sin, the second beautiful way

875
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,960
 of purifying your heart is acting in thankfulness.

876
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,000
 As you walk in gratitude, man,

877
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,620
 this is annoying my wife, by the way.

878
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,600
 I am so thankful for everything right now.

879
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:18,640
 She's like, "Would you just tone down

880
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,740
 "the thankfulness, please?"

881
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,560
 But I tell you what, somebody cuts me off

882
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,620
 when I'm driving, and I'm like,

883
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:27,320
 "Oh my God, thank you, Lord, so much for that person.

884
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:28,500
 (audience laughing)

885
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,900
 "I had cold pizza yesterday.

886
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,560
 "Thank you, Lord, for cold pizza."

887
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,600
 I'm thankful for the things

888
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,340
 that I would never be thankful for before,

889
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:37,540
 because when you begin to walk in a place

890
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:42,540
 of thankfulness for everything, you will see God,

891
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:45,340
 where you thought you would never see him before.

892
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:47,600
 The second thing is this, be careful,

893
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:50,060
 keep an eye on your language,

894
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:53,040
 because, you see, language shapes culture.

895
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:55,380
 And if amongst ourselves, we are practicing

896
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,780
 the language of invitation to God all the time,

897
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,860
 we're actually kinda communicating something

898
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:03,340
 that we probably don't wanna be communicating.

899
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,280
 And while, of course, it's great to have a heart

900
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,100
 to wanna receive more and to be more in his presence,

901
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,240
 perhaps as we shift our language,

902
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,220
 we'll begin to shift our expectations,

903
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:15,940
 and maybe some of that negative stuff

904
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,980
 that hangs around the invitation language

905
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,580
 about being alone or God being distant

906
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,060
 or having to try to control him in some way,

907
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:25,340
 we might actually begin to walk in more freedom

908
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,460
 than we've ever walked before.

909
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:29,260
 So guard your language.

910
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,460
 The third thing is this, guard your awareness.

911
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:36,140
 Because if this is all about becoming more aware

912
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,040
 to what is already within us and around us,

913
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,460
 then what are the things that still are awareness

914
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,100
 of the presence of God in our lives?

915
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:47,140
 Those are the things we should be wrestling with.

916
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:49,340
 And so I have an exercise that I wanna encourage

917
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:51,100
 all of you to do this week.

918
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,780
 And if you do this, I believe that this will change

919
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:56,780
 how you approach your daily walk with Jesus.

920
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,660
 It's a very simple exercise.

921
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,500
 First of all, you ask yourself,

922
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,620
 "What helps me pay attention to God?"

923
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,420
 Write a list down, the things that help me

924
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,340
 to be connected to him.

925
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,540
 Maybe it's worship music, maybe it's prayer,

926
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:09,440
 maybe it's whatever, walking in the wilderness,

927
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:10,280
 whatever it might be.

928
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,780
 But what is it that helps me to connect with him?

929
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,740
 Second question, what hinders me

930
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,680
 from paying attention to him?

931
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,180
 In other words, what gets in the way?

932
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,180
 What distracts, what pulls me in the opposite direction?

933
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,980
 Your answer to those two questions

934
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:26,040
 will change your relationship with him.

935
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:28,700
 And so if you're willing to do this,

936
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:29,540
 I would also encourage you,

937
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,220
 if you're part of one of our small group communities,

938
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,460
 our community groups here,

939
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:35,700
 take this and bring it into your community group as well.

940
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,780
 And share with them, "Here's my list of things

941
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,500
 "that helps me to connect with Jesus.

942
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,920
 "Here's the things that kinda distract me from that.

943
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,900
 "Could you pray for me?"

944
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:44,660
 Let's talk about these together.

945
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:47,460
 And let's commit each other to recognizing

946
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,020
 that his presence is here.

947
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,460
 Somebody once described the Camino

948
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:56,500
 as an 800 kilometer cathedral.

949
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,060
 And that's how it felt for me.

950
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,280
 As I was walking in the rural areas of Spain,

951
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,140
 I was outdoors, sometimes it was raining,

952
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,740
 sometimes it was sunny, sometimes I was happy,

953
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,360
 sometimes I was a little bit frustrated,

954
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,980
 sometimes I was super tired.

955
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,420
 Other times I had lots of energy.

956
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,460
 All different emotions.

957
00:39:10,460 --> 00:39:12,660
 It didn't matter where my emotional state was.

958
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:14,940
 I always felt like I was in the presence

959
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,980
 of the almighty king.

960
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,220
 It was a beautiful thing.

961
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,300
 Guess what?

962
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,860
 I came back to Hong Kong last week.

963
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:24,020
 On the day I got back, I walked in Causeway Bay.

964
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,000
 And I was like, this is a cathedral also.

965
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,500
 It's a different kind of cathedral

966
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,980
 than the one that I've been walking in Spain.

967
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,840
 But it is no less filled with the wonder and glory of Jesus.

968
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,100
 May you change the way that you think

969
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,440
 about your workplace, about the streets of our city.

970
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,220
 May we change the way we think about the presence of God.

971
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:50,180
 That we might actually be rebirthed,

972
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,900
 a freshness in our relationship with him

973
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:55,600
 because we see him and feel him in all things.

974
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,940
 One of my favorite theologians is the 20th century

975
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,400
 British theologian C.S. Lewis.

976
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,140
 Let me read you how he said this.

977
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,500
 He says this, "We may ignore, but we can nowhere evade

978
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,780
 "the presence of God.

979
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,560
 "The world is crowded with him.

980
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:11,900
 "He walks everywhere incognito.

981
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:15,060
 "And the incognito is not always hard to penetrate.

982
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,380
 "The real labor is to remember to attend.

983
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:23,380
 "In fact, to come and awake, still more to remain awake.

984
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:25,520
 "My desire as I come back as your pastor

985
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,320
 "is that I will honor and serve you

986
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:30,240
 "by remaining awake to this love of Jesus

987
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,160
 "that is now within me.

988
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,420
 "And my prayer for you, as us as a community,

989
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:39,660
 "is that we would awaken more and more to his presence."

990
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,340
 In the name of Jesus, everyone says.

991
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,500
 - Amen. - Amen.

992
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,660
 Would you stand with me, I'd love to pray for you.

993
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,420
 (pages rustling)

994
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:53,100
 And I just wanna invite you just to quieten your heart.

995
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,620
 (gentle music)

996
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,460
 And if this has been a helpful message for you

997
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,200
 this morning, this afternoon,

998
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:01,440
 and if it's something that has resonated with you,

999
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,460
 I just want us, our eyes are closed.

1000
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:05,220
 Here at the Vine, we just do a simple posture

1001
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,780
 of just opening our hands before the Lord.

1002
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,700
 It's just nothing magical in it.

1003
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:11,100
 It's just our way of signaling to the Holy Spirit

1004
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,460
 that we're open for his ministry.

1005
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,060
 By opening our hands, we're not inviting his presence

1006
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,780
 to the room, 'cause of everything

1007
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,580
 we've just been talking about.

1008
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:22,220
 But by opening our hands, we are saying

1009
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,460
 that our hearts are open,

1010
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:26,900
 that we are inviting, if you will,

1011
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,420
 the ministry of the Spirit

1012
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:34,940
 to come and to do some work within us.

1013
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:36,460
 And so if that's for you this morning,

1014
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,540
 this afternoon, just open your hands, let me pray.

1015
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,460
 Father, as we stand before you now,

1016
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,460
 we just quieten ourselves down.

1017
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,060
 I wanna encourage each one of you now in this moment

1018
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,900
 just to take,

1019
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:51,620
 take some silence,

1020
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:56,740
 and just begin to think about the fullness

1021
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:58,340
 of Christ's presence within you.

1022
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,500
 Not one of you in this room,

1023
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,260
 if you believe in Jesus, are alone.

1024
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:05,860
 It's a lie of the enemy

1025
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:09,500
 to make you feel like you are distant from him.

1026
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:13,300
 (gentle music)

1027
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,380
 He is here in his fullness in you in this moment.

1028
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,540
 So just take a moment for some of you

1029
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,740
 just to reflect on that.

1030
00:42:20,740 --> 00:42:26,460
 Not only that, but he's in his fullness around you

1031
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:29,420
 in this moment, in all moments.

1032
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:31,460
 He is everywhere.

1033
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:34,900
 And he's inviting you

1034
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:40,660
 to be awakened more and more to his activity

1035
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,460
 that is at work around your life.

1036
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:47,980
 So as you're just taking a moment in calm

1037
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:51,460
 just to recognize his presence in you,

1038
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:54,900
 to recognize his presence around you,

1039
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:59,100
 I wonder whether you just begin to be thankful.

1040
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,380
 Just begin to offer thanksgiving in your heart.

1041
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:09,300
 Just thank him that the promises of Scripture are true,

1042
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:12,620
 that you are a temple of the Holy Spirit.

1043
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,500
 Thank him that the same Spirit

1044
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,700
 that raised Jesus from the dead is in you.

1045
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:23,180
 Thank him that you are fully in Christ as Christ is in you.

1046
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:30,380
 And then begin to thank him that he loves your colleagues

1047
00:43:30,380 --> 00:43:34,380
 and your office and your place of employment

1048
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:37,940
 and your apartment building and your family

1049
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:40,780
 and the streets and neighborhoods of the city.

1050
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:44,740
 He loves these places and is present in those places

1051
00:43:44,740 --> 00:43:46,980
 in profoundly important ways.

1052
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:52,100
 Just begin to thank him that he is there.

1053
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:58,940
 And then in that place of gratitude,

1054
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,220
 I wanna pray that you would receive

1055
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,620
 what he has for you tonight.

1056
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:09,500
 So Holy Spirit, have your way.

1057
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:14,300
 Don't feel like you need to rush this moment.

1058
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:20,980
 Just allow the joy of the Lord

1059
00:44:20,980 --> 00:44:23,060
 to be rebirthed in some of you.

1060
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:24,580
 I felt this in one of the earlier services,

1061
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:26,420
 but I feel it again now.

1062
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,540
 For some of you, it's been a while

1063
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:31,540
 since you felt any joy in your relationship with Christ.

1064
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:35,340
 One of the great fruits of the Spirit is joy,

1065
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:38,260
 love, peace and joy.

1066
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,100
 I love joy and peace.

1067
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:42,300
 And so joy is this incredible fruit of the Spirit

1068
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,540
 that's available for you.

1069
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:47,140
 So Lord, I wanna pray for a rebirthing of joy

1070
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:51,100
 as some people here take that step of reshifting

1071
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,220
 how they think about you and your presence.

1072
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,660
 As they become more awoken to the reality

1073
00:44:56,660 --> 00:44:58,460
 of your presence in their lives,

1074
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,500
 Lord, I pray that joy would come in the name of Jesus.

1075
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:04,740
 That joy would be a great breakthrough.

1076
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:09,500
 So just, Lord, would you be at work?

1077
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:12,460
 So just allow the Spirit of God

1078
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:14,340
 to do whatever he wants to do

1079
00:45:14,340 --> 00:45:16,020
 as we respond together in worship.

1080
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,620
 (gentle music)

1081
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:21,220
 (gentle music)

1082
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,800
 (gentle music)

1083
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,800
