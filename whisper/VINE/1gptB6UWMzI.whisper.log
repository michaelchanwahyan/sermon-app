[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   We thank you for this, Jesus.
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.960]   We pray this in your sweet, beautiful, majestic,
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.240]   powerful, glorious name.
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.680]   And the church says, amen.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.520]   Thank you, church.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.600]   Thank you, worship team.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:14.060]   Man, that is a beautiful song.
[00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.920]   I love that song so much.
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.360]   Man.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.720]   Well, good morning.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.120]   If you're joining us online, good morning as well.
[00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.480]   It's good to see everybody back.
[00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.400]   We've enjoyed another week of black rainstorms
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:28.400]   and crazy weather.
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.280]   And what's going on?
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.480]   Seriously, it's craziness in the weather,
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.600]   but I'm glad everybody is here this morning.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.160]   See some old familiar faces, which is good as well, right?
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.120]   And so, yeah, really good to see friends
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.300]   and family gathered together this Sunday.
[00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.680]   And if you've been walking with us through this summer,
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.880]   we've come to the end of our sermon series
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.720]   in the book of James.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.920]   And the hope and the prayer is that we've been changed
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.700]   and moved and challenged to consider our faith seriously.
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.980]   Right, that we've not just been walking through a letter,
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.860]   but we've been letting the words through Scripture
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.800]   penetrate our hearts.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.200]   It's a reminder that this life that we claim to live,
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.640]   that faith that we came to have,
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.140]   there is no room in Scripture for nominal Christianity.
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.160]   There's no room for saying, I am a Christian
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:21.040]   and coming here on Sunday and worshiping
[00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.880]   with our hands up, all that kind of stuff,
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.540]   without actually living it out.
[00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.280]   Because if we do that, it's just noise.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   It's just a distraction.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.800]   It's almost craziness, right?
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.820]   There's a lot better places you could spend on a Sunday
[00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.960]   than coming here to this church, if you're not about that.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.520]   But James lets us know, right, that real and pure religion,
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.300]   that following Christ must make a difference
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.400]   in the way we live our lives.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.460]   It has to transform everything that we do.
[00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.940]   It's a transformative kind of faith
[00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.760]   that Jesus calls us to have.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.500]   It's an active kind of faith, right,
[00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.000]   that moves us into deeds and actions and not just words.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.880]   It's a countercultural kind of faith
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.600]   where we're not friends with the world,
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.960]   but we are standing in our friendship with the Lord.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.520]   Otherwise, like I said, all this is just noise.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.560]   Actually, I got some really cool feedback lately.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.880]   One of our teenagers, as he's been walking
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.840]   through the book of James, he's been listening,
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.520]   he's been reading the book of James,
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.160]   I hope by himself as well, he noticed.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.760]   So in response to what he felt like God's
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.980]   speaking to his heart, he said he was walking
[00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.900]   down the road one day and he saw someone in need
[00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.180]   and so he stopped to give some money
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.580]   to this person that was in need.
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.060]   And as a result, the person behind him
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.380]   saw what he was doing and they too stopped
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.580]   and gave a little bit of money.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.980]   And the person in front of him turned around
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.420]   and saw what he was doing and also gave
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.780]   that person a little bit of money.
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.020]   Right, just a small act of kindness, right,
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.380]   set off a chain reaction in the people around him.
[00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.460]   You see what difference it makes when we actually
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.700]   put some actions behind this faith that we claim to have.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.300]   It's amazing, it's beautiful.
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.540]   But there's one more reason why I felt
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.180]   or we felt like it was important for us
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.440]   to go through this book of James and embrace its challenges.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.580]   And that is because there is an urgency to our faith.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.680]   You see, if you read through the entire letter of James
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.240]   in one sitting, which I highly recommend you do,
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:25.480]   right, you'll notice that throughout the letter
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.300]   there is a pressing, there's a desperation
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.240]   to remind everyone that time is short.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.140]   Right, that Jesus is returning soon just as he promised.
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.320]   Right, which is why James is strong in his tone, right.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.100]   We've held no punches back throughout this series.
[00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.540]   He is strong in his tone, it's challenging,
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.040]   but yet there's a deep and tender pastoral heart
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.400]   for the hearers of this letter.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   And the urgency and the reminder that we cannot wait
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.480]   to act upon this.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.460]   Our faith in Jesus must start making an impact right now.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:11.460]   So once again, read with me as we come to the closing words
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.680]   of this letter, yes, it's gonna continue to be challenging,
[00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.720]   but at the same time, I hope you know that it's filled
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.960]   by love and the passion and the recognition
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.520]   that there is no time to waste,
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.800]   that our time for our faith to make an impact
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.180]   is indeed right now.
[00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:32.040]   James chapter five, chapter first one.
[00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.640]   Now, now listen, now listen, you rich people,
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.000]   weep and wail because of the misery that is coming on you.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.600]   Your wealth has rotted, moths have eaten your clothes,
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.320]   your gold and silver are corroded.
[00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.400]   The corrosion will testify against you
[00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.480]   and eat your flesh like fire.
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.720]   You have hoarded wealth in the last days.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.360]   Look, the wages you failed to pay the workers
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.240]   who mowed your fields are crying out against you.
[00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.660]   The cries of the harvesters have reached the ears
[00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:04.120]   of the Lord Almighty.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.080]   You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.920]   You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.560]   You have condemned and murdered the innocent one
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.180]   who was not opposing you.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.560]   Told you it was not easy.
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.720]   Have you guys ever heard the saying,
[00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.280]   it's a bit funny but I've heard it around,
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.000]   money doesn't solve all your problems
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.440]   but I sure wouldn't mind crying in a laberghini, right?
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.840]   So, I've never been, if you have a laberghini out there,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.440]   okay, good for you, it'll be fun
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:35.040]   to ride around in one sometime.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.360]   But there is a sense of irony in that saying, right?
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.800]   Because we don't usually associate rich people
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.920]   with things like weeping and wailing and misery, right?
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.240]   Because we feel like they have resources,
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.840]   they have everything they need, so why are you sad?
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.560]   But when we look throughout scripture,
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.360]   throughout the Bible, there is a consistent warning,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.440]   maybe one of the most consistent warnings,
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.580]   which goes something along the lines of,
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.040]   be careful of how much you focus on money.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:10.080]   Because God knows it's so easy for our heart
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.520]   and our desires to be drawn to money.
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.800]   And how quickly the love of money has to rob our ability
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.480]   of having affections for the Lord and the people around us.
[00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.120]   And once our distraction to money becomes,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.840]   once money becomes an idol, the risk there
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.520]   is that we start to do all kinds of unjust
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:33.020]   and blasphemous acts to the Lord and to each other.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:36.800]   This is what we talked about in James chapter two.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.200]   When those who have, those who have the resources
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:41.880]   refuse to pay any kind of attention to those who are in need
[00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:43.960]   instead of just a good, pat you on the back,
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:46.800]   okay, see you later, you go off on your way,
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.300]   but I have the resources, I'm not gonna help you.
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.560]   The love of money is truly the root
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:57.760]   of all kinds of evil, scripture tells us.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.520]   So why then are the rich suddenly weeping and wailing?
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.320]   Right, it's because they're suddenly seeing
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:07.080]   their riches disappear before their very eyes.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.760]   Your wealth has rotted, James says.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.600]   Moths have eaten your clothes.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.880]   Gold and silver are being corroded.
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:15.560]   The corrosion will testify you
[00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:18.280]   and eat your flesh like fire.
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.720]   You have hoarded wealth in the last days.
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:25.620]   You see, the foolish thing about dedicating ourselves
[00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:30.620]   to material wealth is because material wealth will not last.
[00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.140]   In the context of James, wealth was often tied
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.500]   to the abundance of produce from farming, right?
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.000]   But what happens when you hoard food?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.840]   We've done this before, right?
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:43.760]   You go to the supermarket, ooh, avocados are on sale, right?
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.120]   You get like 15 of them and they just sit
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.320]   below your microwave and just wilt and die
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.120]   before you have a chance to eat them, right?
[00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.140]   When you hoard food, it starts to stink and rot
[00:07:53.140 --> 00:07:55.560]   and it becomes useless.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.120]   The clothes too, right?
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:58.760]   We know when Hong Kong winter is coming,
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.760]   November 5th seems to be the magic date
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:03.440]   when everybody busts out those winter coats, right?
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:05.840]   An entire bus and empty out all the streets,
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:07.520]   suddenly starts smelling like mothballs, okay?
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.280]   Because they've been in storage, okay?
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:13.480]   So mothball becomes the scent of the month, okay?
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:14.920]   But even your clothes, right?
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.720]   No matter how fine they are, no matter what brand they are,
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.240]   one day your clothes are gonna become worthless.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.560]   The moth will eat them, those little silver bugs
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:28.000]   that we get in Hong Kong will chew through them.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.880]   They will become worthless.
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:33.120]   James is saying even gold and silver,
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:36.960]   two metals that are associated with being incorrodible,
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:39.120]   always holding their value, right?
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:44.000]   Even one day, gold and silver are gonna become worthless.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.680]   They will corrode and disappear.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.880]   And as we look towards the last days,
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.880]   we have to keep this in mind.
[00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:53.200]   And make no mistake, church,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:57.320]   this is, these are the last days that we're living in.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.360]   Ever since Jesus died and resurrected
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.680]   and ascended to heaven, He assured us,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.880]   His promise to us that one day I am going to return.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.920]   And when He returns, yes, it's coming back to love
[00:09:09.920 --> 00:09:12.040]   and to restore and to redeem,
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:15.160]   to defeat the enemy once and for all, amen?
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.360]   To make all things new,
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.520]   to judge, to put an end to all injustice.
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.760]   He's coming, scripture tells us,
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:24.480]   to judge the living and the dead
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.320]   and to gather those who are faithful to Him
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.160]   and welcome them into His kingdom.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:33.360]   Now, when we talk about this topic, though,
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:35.160]   it sounds like one of those things
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:39.120]   that's always threatened, but it's never going to happen.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:42.160]   Right, you know like, if you go to the big department stores
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.200]   like Wing On, right, there's always,
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.120]   they're always doing a final promotional sale, right?
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.440]   So you go and buy something, it's like,
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.480]   [speaking in foreign language]
[00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.760]   Right, and stuff, you know?
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:52.960]   And then next week you go,
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:56.040]   and then it's suddenly like a super big final sale, okay?
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:58.280]   So you think, okay, this is my last chance, okay?
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.680]   And then you go a few weeks later,
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.720]   it's the last super big, super promotional sale, right?
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:04.960]   And so, it just keeps going on and on and on.
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.800]   It's just a marketing tactic, right?
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.320]   It never actually ends, right?
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:10.960]   And you realize it's just a big scam.
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.560]   They just want you to buy stuff.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.520]   But church, this is not the case.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.800]   This is not what we're talking about here, right?
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.680]   The return of Jesus is not a scam, right?
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.080]   It's not some made up story aimed to keep us on our toes.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.320]   Jesus said it Himself, "Keep watch.
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.960]   "You do not know on what day or hour even
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.560]   "the Lord will come."
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.640]   And just as Pastor Carlos said last week,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:38.320]   God's economy is not our economy.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.080]   God's timing is not our timing.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.440]   And so, therefore, we are called to live
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:49.160]   as if Jesus will really return at any moment.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:53.760]   And in these last days before Jesus comes back,
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:56.280]   in the time where Jesus has already begun the work
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:59.760]   of inaugurating His kingdom here on earth,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:02.680]   to making things new, to redeeming His creation,
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.760]   hoarding wealth is the exact opposite
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.760]   of what He has called us to do with our resources.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:12.160]   When Jesus came back, didn't He flip
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.080]   this entire approach on its head?
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.000]   Instead, didn't He say, "Blessed are the poor,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.360]   "for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.480]   Didn't Jesus teach us, as hard as it is for us to hear,
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:30.560]   it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
[00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.440]   than it is for someone who is rich
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:34.200]   to enter the kingdom of God?
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:37.480]   Wasn't Jesus' words to the rich young ruler,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.360]   "If you want to be perfect, go, sell all your possessions,
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:44.400]   "give it to the poor, you will have treasure in heaven,
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.200]   "and then come follow me."
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:51.520]   So hoarding wealth doesn't make sense,
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:55.280]   but there's something even worse going on here.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:59.160]   It's not just that the rich have hoarded all this wealth.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:01.280]   The bigger problem is they have done it
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:05.080]   on the backs, on the expense of other people.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.600]   First Paul says this, "Look, the wages you have failed
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.500]   "to pay the workers who mowed your fields
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.620]   "are crying out against you.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:15.320]   "The cries of harvesters have reached
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.460]   "the ears of the Lord Almighty.
[00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:20.320]   "You have lived on earth in luxury and self-indulgence.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:22.740]   "You have fattened yourselves in the day of slaughter.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.000]   "You have condemned and murdered the innocent one
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.300]   "who was not opposing you."
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.320]   All this wealth that these people have
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:36.320]   has been created through dishonest and unjust practices.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:38.800]   Right, and the law, the Levitical law
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:42.400]   had rules addressing this kind of behavior.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.580]   Deuteronomy 24 says this, "Pay them their wages,
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.620]   "pay the workers their wages, each day before sunset,
[00:12:48.620 --> 00:12:51.520]   "because they are poor and they're counting on it.
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:54.740]   "Otherwise, they may cry to the Lord against you,
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:57.200]   "and you will be guilty of sin."
[00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.940]   So James is concerned about the attitude
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:03.720]   and the fact that the rich are not using their resources
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:07.880]   to help others just as the Lord has instructed us to do.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.160]   But rather, they would live selfishly,
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.680]   in luxury, in self-indulgence.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:17.400]   And James is condemning the fact that we are hoarding wealth
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.240]   where we should use it to help those who are in need.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:23.780]   And like I said just now, this is one of the dangers.
[00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:27.480]   When we make money and resources and idol,
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   the danger is we dehumanize image bearers of God,
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.200]   of God's people and His children.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:39.600]   And while we're enjoying luxury and self-indulgence,
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.920]   people aren't even being given what they are due.
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.940]   And our eyes and ears become so dull
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:48.100]   that we're blinded and muted for seeing and hearing
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:49.900]   those who are crying out.
[00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.160]   But God sees it all.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.920]   Now we enjoy this thinking, we're set,
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.980]   things are good for me, I don't have a worry in the world.
[00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:03.800]   And when we live like this, James says,
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:08.280]   it's like we're fattening ourselves just to be slaughtered.
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.160]   It's almost like a comical picture.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:14.280]   We are sacrificing ourselves to this worldly God
[00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:17.400]   of luxury and comfort.
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.800]   We're like the fattened calf, we're like Wagyu beef.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:22.120]   You know how Wagyu beef, they feed the cows,
[00:14:22.120 --> 00:14:24.400]   all kinds of stuff, fatten it up.
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:26.320]   The end result of that cow,
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:27.960]   while he's enjoying all that stuff,
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:30.020]   right, oh, this is great, you know, I'm being massaged,
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.760]   I'm being fed all this good food.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.020]   In the end, what's the end of that cow?
[00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:35.360]   To be slaughtered, right?
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.380]   And this is exactly what we're doing, James says,
[00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.240]   when we just indulge in ourselves
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:43.020]   and ignore the cries of those around us.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.440]   The fate that awaits is slaughter.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:48.240]   It's death.
[00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:54.340]   Church, if we make our goal in life,
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:56.640]   if what we want to do with our time in this world
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:00.000]   is just enjoy as many luxuries as possible,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.380]   whilst at the same time ignoring the cries
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:04.760]   of those who are in need,
[00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:10.300]   Scripture likens it to murdering innocent people.
[00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:15.000]   And we are condemning ourselves.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:17.120]   And we sit around thinking, you know, there's time for that.
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.720]   I'm gonna get to that one day, right?
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:20.660]   Right now, you know, I'm here for a good time,
[00:15:20.660 --> 00:15:23.200]   not for a long time, so I'm just gonna focus on me
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:24.960]   and do everything what I want to do
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:31.220]   when Jesus could literally return at any moment.
[00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:37.920]   Brothers and sisters, part of our pure faith
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.900]   means that we cannot live like this.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:46.260]   We cannot live like we don't want that day to come
[00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.520]   because we've made life so comfortable for ourselves.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:50.960]   And in living like the Scripture says,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:54.680]   we are greedy, we are undressed, we are ungodly,
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:56.600]   and it will catch up with us.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.300]   We are condemning ourselves.
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.760]   We're preparing our flesh to be eaten like fire.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.360]   But instead, as followers of Jesus,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:08.280]   we should be hastening the day.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:09.920]   We should be crying out to the Lord
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:11.720]   to return to make things right.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.920]   We should be crying out for His justice,
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:16.020]   praying for the restoration of creation,
[00:16:16.020 --> 00:16:19.160]   joining in in God's work in restoring and repairing
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.280]   and redeeming humans to Himself.
[00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.760]   We look forward to the day when sin is no more,
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:31.160]   which means we are tirelessly trying to ensure
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:36.160]   that we are preparing the way for Jesus' arrival.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.560]   We are preaching the Gospel.
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.440]   We are reaching out to those in need.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:43.720]   We are speaking out to those who are facing injustice.
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.640]   This is the mission we have at hand.
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:50.720]   And we cannot sit idly by,
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.460]   especially when there are people out there
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.120]   being oppressed and suffering from injustice.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:01.660]   God's economy is not our economy.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:06.520]   Jesus came to turn the entire system upside down.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.560]   Karl Barth says it this way.
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:11.080]   Instead of striving for higher position,
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:13.280]   more power and more influence,
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:16.120]   Jesus moves from the heights to the depths,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.760]   from victory to defeat, from riches to poverty,
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.240]   from triumphs to suffering, from life to death.
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.280]   Jesus came to say, "Blessed are the poor."
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.560]   And His ears are always tuned to hear the voices
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:33.780]   of those crying out for justice.
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:37.280]   So we're reminded today, church,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.620]   that we're here on God's time.
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.760]   Just because it hasn't happened yet,
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.440]   don't think that it's not going to.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:47.600]   And Jesus is returning.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.680]   James reminds us of that.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.840]   And so to end this letter,
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.840]   he gives us some instructions on how he wants us to live.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.960]   Taking care of the poor, the widow and the orphans,
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.380]   doing God's work of justice.
[00:17:59.380 --> 00:18:02.300]   But there's two more things he wants us to embrace
[00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:04.180]   as we look into these last days.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:09.140]   The two things are this, patience and prayer.
[00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.720]   Patience and prayer.
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:13.520]   Let's look at patience for a minute.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.780]   Firstly, James calls us to be patient in the Lord.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:20.420]   Now again, in our modern day lives,
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.800]   it's almost like the entire idea of patience
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.160]   is trying to be erased from our vocabulary.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:28.420]   We don't like waiting for stuff.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.580]   Everything is marketed towards the idea
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:33.280]   that the faster, the more convenient it is,
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:34.640]   the better for us, right?
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.480]   [speaking in foreign language]
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.640]   Right, that's a Hong Kong motto.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:39.120]   Everything is on demand.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.560]   You can order anything you want at any time
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.540]   with the touch of a button.
[00:18:42.540 --> 00:18:45.840]   You can have food, clothes, anything you want delivered
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.200]   right to your doorstep almost immediately.
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:52.240]   Now, I'll be a hypocrite to say
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.720]   I don't enjoy the conveniences of modern life.
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.820]   It's great sometimes to have those things available to us.
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:02.880]   But again, the danger is that this way of living
[00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:07.400]   robs us and dulls us of how God wants us to respond
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:09.640]   to how he wants us to live.
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.340]   And we forget the value in waiting
[00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.360]   and having patience in the Lord.
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.800]   Waiting on the Lord will always lead
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:22.940]   to something of great value.
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:27.340]   Every time we wait on the Lord, it's not time wasted.
[00:19:27.340 --> 00:19:30.620]   It's not doing nothing, but it's trusting
[00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:32.620]   that God is doing something
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.780]   and that one day it's going to bear fruit, right?
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:39.420]   This is why patience is part of the fruit of the Spirit
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.680]   that scripture encourages us to grow in.
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.720]   That's why patience is a key component of love.
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.380]   And when we are patiently waiting on our Lord,
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:54.060]   it's a sign of the hope and the faith that we have in Jesus.
[00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:58.260]   James uses a illustration from agriculture
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.740]   to highlight this to us.
[00:20:00.740 --> 00:20:03.580]   He says this, "See how the farmer waits for the land
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:06.700]   "to yield its valuable crop, patiently waiting
[00:20:06.700 --> 00:20:08.880]   "for the autumn and spring rains.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.720]   "You too, be patient and stand firm
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:14.520]   "because the Lord's coming is near."
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:18.940]   Again, we go to our wet markets, we go to Welcome,
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:21.780]   we go to Park and Shop, wherever we like to do our shopping,
[00:20:21.780 --> 00:20:24.100]   right, and we see the rows and rows of fruits
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:26.820]   and vegetables, the meat, everything is right there
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:28.460]   ready for us just to take to the counter,
[00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.140]   check out, and take home.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:33.340]   But next time we go, be mindful.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.180]   The way that produce got there wasn't just magic, right?
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:39.580]   It wasn't just someone just made them appear.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:43.140]   It's gone through the time of growing, of tilling,
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:45.980]   there was a farmer or a process, right,
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.940]   that all that stuff had to go through
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.060]   in order for it to end up on our supermarket shelves.
[00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:57.880]   And there was a person who planted seed and waited,
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:59.500]   and it seemed like nothing was happening
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:03.280]   until that plant begins to break through the soil.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.420]   And this is the same for us.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:07.380]   Whilst we're waiting, while God is calling us
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:10.120]   to be patient, we're like a farmer.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.540]   We're hard at work, planting seeds, tilling the ground,
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:17.100]   knowing that God is the one who's gonna do the growing,
[00:21:17.100 --> 00:21:19.900]   and that in due time, we will reap a harvest
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.180]   to collect in God's name.
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:25.540]   So we are patient in the Lord.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.020]   But James also tells us this.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:32.160]   As we do that, we need to be patient with each other.
[00:21:33.300 --> 00:21:36.180]   Don't grumble against one another, he says,
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:39.340]   brothers and sisters, or you will be judged.
[00:21:39.340 --> 00:21:42.180]   The judge is standing at the door.
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:46.500]   Another danger we face as a community
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:48.680]   as we wait for God to return
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.860]   is that we start to get impatient.
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:54.500]   And when we get impatient, it's easy to start complaining
[00:21:54.500 --> 00:21:57.320]   and grumbling and attacking each other.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:00.500]   Remember what Andrew said a couple of weeks ago
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.660]   when we need to, the fact that we need to watch our tongues?
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:06.700]   When we get impatient and grumble,
[00:22:06.700 --> 00:22:10.660]   we tend then to speak words that are unkind, right?
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.060]   Words of death rather than words of life.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.940]   And in these last days, this is what Jesus
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:18.900]   is looking after for, he's especially concerned
[00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:21.940]   about his people and his church.
[00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.300]   But when we grumble against each other,
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.280]   when we fight and we quarrel,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.340]   we cannot be the unified body of Christ
[00:22:29.340 --> 00:22:30.900]   that he has called us to be.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.620]   We cannot be the hands and feet that he has called us to be.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.800]   When we're busy attacking each other,
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.860]   how can we be that voice that speaks out
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:43.320]   for the innocent and those who are suffering injustice?
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.100]   When we're so caught up with the splinter
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.720]   in each other's eyes, how can we see the evil
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:49.420]   that is happening around us?
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:53.660]   This is why James reminds us, right?
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:56.420]   Don't think just because we're not like those rich oppressors
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:58.020]   that he was talking about at the beginning,
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.860]   that God isn't coming to judge us either.
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:04.420]   We should be speaking and acting as if Jesus
[00:23:04.420 --> 00:23:06.520]   was right at the gates, right at the door.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.180]   Maybe even imagining him putting his ear against the door,
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:11.700]   seeing what's happening inside.
[00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:15.380]   Any time to open the door, and when he does enter,
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:18.360]   how is he gonna find his church?
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.700]   How is he gonna find his people?
[00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:25.420]   Fighting and grumbling or steadfastly and patiently
[00:23:25.420 --> 00:23:27.740]   doing the work that he has called us to do.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:33.580]   And finally, James calls us to also be patient in suffering
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:40.100]   because the call to patience here isn't the kind of patience
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:42.740]   just enough just to wait for a few extra minutes
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:44.020]   for a coffee to be made.
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:46.620]   The patience that God is looking for
[00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:49.020]   is the steadfast kind of patience
[00:23:49.020 --> 00:23:52.540]   that even when things aren't going our way,
[00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:55.940]   we hold on to his promises.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:58.340]   Even in the toughest of situations.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:03.060]   And to make his point, James asks us to consider the prophets
[00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:07.000]   consider the prophets and the things they had to go through.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.140]   Now I both love and I'm terrified by the fact
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.500]   that James tells us that we need to be patient in suffering
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:15.940]   and then he turns us to the prophets.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.820]   And even though he doesn't mention any prophet
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.020]   in particular by name, if you read through the Old Testament
[00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:23.780]   and the things the prophets had to go through, right?
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:27.860]   They had to suffer through all kinds of stuff in God's name.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:31.300]   And in fact, it was often God himself
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.700]   who calls his prophets into seasons
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.860]   of perseverance and suffering.
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.140]   Look at Jeremiah for a second.
[00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:42.980]   Jeremiah was a man of God, but this man of God
[00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:47.340]   endured constant persecution, ridicule, and death threats
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:49.380]   all through his ministry.
[00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:51.100]   Everybody mocked him.
[00:24:51.100 --> 00:24:53.460]   Everyone was trying to convince him to shut up,
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.140]   just denounce God, stop talking about it.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:59.820]   But even when he himself tried to shut up,
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:01.420]   he said this, these were his words.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:05.460]   His word in my heart is like a fire,
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.860]   a fire shut up in my bones.
[00:25:07.860 --> 00:25:10.260]   I'm weary of holding it in.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:12.460]   Indeed, I cannot.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:15.460]   Right, this quote sounds cool and we like it, you know.
[00:25:15.460 --> 00:25:17.000]   But you know, this was Jeremiah speaking
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.820]   out of a place of desperation.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:20.660]   This was Jeremiah saying,
[00:25:20.660 --> 00:25:22.580]   "Yeah, I'd rather be doing anything else."
[00:25:22.580 --> 00:25:24.740]   You know the amount of stuff I've been through
[00:25:24.740 --> 00:25:25.860]   as I speak God's name.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:28.300]   I would rather be doing anything else
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.740]   than speak God's word that he tells me to.
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:33.640]   But yet he chooses to anyway.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:37.780]   And he patiently suffers and endures
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:41.980]   even though he knows the positions it's gonna land him in.
[00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.700]   Take Ezekiel, right, doing something
[00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.380]   that made no sense to anyone.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.140]   God told him to lay on his side for 390 days
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.940]   in an illustration to God calling him
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:56.060]   to demonstrate how many days Israel
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:57.340]   had been lost in their sin, right.
[00:25:57.340 --> 00:25:59.340]   Lying down on his side, 390 days,
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.060]   just lying there like that, right.
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:04.560]   I don't know if you'd be patient enough to suffer that.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:09.460]   Take Hosea, who had to patiently endure his wife
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:13.540]   running off to other men time and time and time again.
[00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.100]   Yet God kept telling him, "You have to keep loving her.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:17.880]   "You have to keep pursuing her.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:21.100]   "Never, do not leave her side."
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.860]   God uses us in patient suffering.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:30.700]   So if you're suffering for Jesus right now,
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.460]   take heart, you are not alone.
[00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:37.240]   You are never alone.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:40.700]   And in the meanwhile, know that your character
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:44.340]   is being forged through these seasons of difficulty.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.540]   God uses it to transform us.
[00:26:47.540 --> 00:26:49.660]   Back in chapter one of James, he says this,
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.960]   "Blessed is the one who perseveres under trial
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.520]   "because he has stood the test.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:59.300]   "That is the person who will receive the crown of life
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:02.700]   "that the Lord has promised to those who love him."
[00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:08.180]   As we remember these things, as we practice patience
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:11.420]   in the Lord with each other in our suffering,
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.780]   remember this too, that the Lord is full
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:18.760]   of compassion and mercy.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:21.480]   See, as we look through these things,
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:25.240]   it might seem like God is this angry and fiery judge,
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:28.040]   itching to come back so he can show everybody what's up.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.680]   That's not his heart, really.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.320]   And time and time again, more often than not,
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.440]   scripture reminds us that God is full of mercy.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.740]   He is full of compassion, that his love is everlasting,
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:45.140]   that his blessings go beyond a thousand generations,
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:49.800]   that he sacrificed his son in order to show us his love.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:53.780]   And ultimately, his nature is not to punish and to slaughter
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.020]   even though that is a consequence,
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:59.500]   but it is to bless and to love.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:02.900]   So when we're patient in the Lord,
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:09.400]   the result is always to come into his blessings in our life.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.420]   Now, those might come in all sorts of ways.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:14.100]   I'm not saying prosperity gospel here.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:16.020]   Don't hear me wrong, okay?
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.900]   But what I'm telling you is this,
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:21.020]   in all the suffering that we have to go through
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:25.060]   in the name of Jesus, if we persevere,
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:29.100]   if we keep our faith in him, he will restore you,
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:32.300]   he will come through for you in his will,
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.420]   in his way, and in his time.
[00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:38.340]   So we hold on to patience, church.
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:45.780]   And one thing we cling on to in this journey of patience
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:46.620]   is prayer.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.860]   We have to have prayer.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:53.280]   Prayer is like one of those immovable building blocks
[00:28:53.280 --> 00:28:55.620]   of our relationship with Jesus.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.180]   Prayer is one of those amazing privileges
[00:28:58.180 --> 00:29:00.740]   that we get as the children of God.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:04.340]   But if we're honest, prayer is also a bit of a mystery,
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:09.340]   because it's hard to fully understand how it works.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:11.260]   When you try to explain prayer to someone
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.540]   without any kind of faith at all,
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:17.100]   it might sound like some sort of ramblings of a mad person.
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.780]   People might think you're crazy.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:19.860]   You're talking, what are you,
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:22.060]   talking to a magical sky fairy?
[00:29:22.060 --> 00:29:24.660]   You just whisper your wishes into the air,
[00:29:24.660 --> 00:29:27.480]   and you're just hoping that something's gonna happen.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.340]   Somehow it's gonna make a difference.
[00:29:29.340 --> 00:29:32.560]   Well, even in secular culture, so that's one side of it.
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:33.800]   But on the other side of it,
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.900]   for people who don't have a faith in Jesus,
[00:29:35.900 --> 00:29:37.820]   maybe sometimes prayer seems like
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.180]   some sort of cosmic slot machine.
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.140]   So you launch a prayer into the sky,
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:45.220]   and it's like pulling a wheel and pulling a handle
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:47.020]   to see if you come up with a jackpot.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.320]   Ding, ding, ding, yes, my prayer's got answered this time.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.460]   Or you just throw a prayer.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.220]   Bon Jovi has a whole song about it.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:54.700]   You're living on a prayer.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.180]   You see what happens.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:57.460]   I'm just gonna say these words,
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.280]   but I don't know who it really is going to.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.520]   I'm just gonna hope for the best.
[00:30:03.940 --> 00:30:08.140]   James gives us no room to doubt the power of prayer
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:10.100]   and the absolute essential role
[00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.420]   that plays in our relationship with Jesus.
[00:30:13.420 --> 00:30:18.260]   And we have to pray in all circumstances, in all situations.
[00:30:18.260 --> 00:30:21.660]   He says, "As if are you in trouble?
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:23.920]   "Is there anyone among you in trouble?
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:25.720]   "Let them pray.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:29.540]   "If you are happy, let them sing songs of praise.
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:31.280]   "If anyone among you is sick,
[00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.820]   "let them call the elders of the church to pray over them,
[00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:36.540]   "and anoint them with oil in the name of the Lord.
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.380]   "And the prayer offered in faith
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.960]   "will make the sick person well.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:43.040]   "The Lord will raise them up.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:46.220]   "If they have sinned, they will be forgiven."
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:49.340]   Right, what a beautiful contrast this is
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:52.840]   from the type of community we started the message with.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.460]   Right, in the beginning, we saw people out for themselves,
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.140]   living in indulgence, you know,
[00:30:57.140 --> 00:30:59.280]   and being unjust to each other.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.220]   But James is letting us know that when we're able
[00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:04.680]   to put the material things aside,
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:08.300]   when our focus and our heart's desire is made right,
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.820]   not to abuse and take advantage of each other,
[00:31:10.820 --> 00:31:13.780]   but rather, now the focus becomes on ministering
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.180]   to each other, to loving each other,
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.620]   to praying for each other, to making sure
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:21.060]   that we're taking care of the sick,
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.420]   of offering prayers of faith.
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:26.900]   This is the kind of church Jesus is looking for.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:29.380]   This is what it looks like when heaven meets earth.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:33.340]   This is what it means to bring hope to this world.
[00:31:33.340 --> 00:31:35.380]   Because when we pray church,
[00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:37.340]   we are not talking into thin air.
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:41.780]   Prayer's not a cosmic slot machine.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:44.520]   When we pray church, we are giving our petitions
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.900]   to the King of Kings, the all-powerful,
[00:31:47.900 --> 00:31:52.460]   all-merciful, all-loving God who loves everybody,
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:55.940]   the one who is able to do all things.
[00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:59.580]   This is precisely why prayer works,
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.540]   because God is who he says he is,
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.580]   because he is close to us.
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:07.860]   And this is why when we pray, we can have one foot
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:11.580]   in the mess and the craziness and the suffering
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.740]   that we all have to face in life,
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.180]   but the other foot knowing full well God is who he says he is
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:20.180]   and that he is good, he is merciful, he is just,
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:23.660]   he is there for us in our time of need.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:27.980]   We stand firm on his promises when we pray,
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.980]   no matter what we are facing.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:33.740]   If we're in trouble, we can pray.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.800]   If we're happy, we can pray.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.180]   We sing these songs, we pray this way
[00:32:39.180 --> 00:32:42.500]   because we know who God is.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:47.540]   But there's one more component about prayer
[00:32:47.540 --> 00:32:49.740]   that makes it even more beautiful.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.420]   And it's the reason why we're sitting gathered
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:55.300]   here today, it's the reason, it should be the reason
[00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:57.820]   why you're coming every single Sunday
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:32:58.820]   to a gathering like this.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.460]   It should be the reason why you're gathering
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:03.380]   in your community groups or your friendship groups.
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:06.800]   It's because prayer isn't just you and the Lord.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.900]   Prayer is something that God wants us to do
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:13.700]   as a community, together, as brothers and sisters,
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.220]   as family, right?
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.860]   And this is one of the wonderful things
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:20.960]   about knowing Jesus and being part of his family
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.760]   is that we can count on other people
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.860]   to pray for us as well.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:29.660]   James says here, if you're sick, call the elders,
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:33.240]   the faithful, the righteous people to pray for you.
[00:33:33.240 --> 00:33:35.460]   And let me tell you, church, that our elders
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.660]   here at the Vine are faithful and righteous people.
[00:33:38.660 --> 00:33:42.900]   The colleagues I have the honor to work with
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.160]   are faithful and righteous people.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:48.200]   So this is a part of the Bible we can take literally.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:50.660]   If you are sick, if you are in need,
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:53.840]   call us, we're here for you, we want to pray for you,
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:56.000]   we want to hear what you're going through.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.940]   Come and pray in faith with us
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:02.760]   and we will pray and we will ask God in faith,
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:04.680]   we will bring your petitions before God
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:07.140]   and allow his will to be done.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:11.720]   But I also want us to hear this as well
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:13.640]   and really hear this, right?
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:15.480]   Praying for each other in this way
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.860]   is not just reserved for the leaders and the elders
[00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:20.160]   and the pastors of this church.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:23.720]   But every single person who has a faith in Jesus
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:26.300]   has the right, has the access, I would even say
[00:34:26.300 --> 00:34:30.440]   has the responsibility to do this for each other.
[00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:33.320]   But we saw a beautiful example of this
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:36.000]   last week at the 11 a.m. service
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:39.400]   when Linda came forward in faith to receive prayer
[00:34:39.400 --> 00:34:43.840]   and in response, we as a church prayed in faith
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:44.880]   for her healing.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.600]   Right, I don't know about you, but to me,
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.200]   that was a beautiful reflection of what the church is for.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   I looked on it like last week what happened
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:56.000]   was not planned at all.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.720]   Right, during the 9 a.m. service, I was worshiping
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.960]   and I was praying and I heard the Lord say to me,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:03.500]   you need to give people the opportunity
[00:35:03.500 --> 00:35:04.920]   to come forward and receive prayer
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:06.280]   'cause there's someone out there
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:07.660]   who is in need of prayer right now.
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.260]   So it was just a simple response of obedience
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:15.640]   to call for prayer from the church to someone in the church.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.600]   And it was beautiful.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:24.220]   It was amazing moment in the life of our family.
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.880]   Now could you imagine, church,
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:29.880]   how much more would things change
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.440]   if everyone in this room was dedicated
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:35.480]   to praying for each other, even outside of this space
[00:35:35.480 --> 00:35:38.320]   on Sunday, that constantly we're practicing
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:40.560]   our faith in this way, praying for healing,
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.920]   praying for miracles, praying for God's power
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.000]   to break through, praying for our city,
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.400]   praying for our families, praying for the world.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:51.240]   The effect of this would be universe shaking, church.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:54.080]   And this is what James is talking about.
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:55.960]   He gives us a little example of Elijah,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.760]   a man of faith, who prayed that it wouldn't rain
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:36:00.960]   and it didn't rain, and then he prayed for rain
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.240]   and then it rained.
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:07.400]   James tells us this, you see, prayer really works.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.440]   There is an effect.
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:10.160]   We're not talking to nobody.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.080]   We're talking to our all-powerful, loving Creator
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.600]   in heaven, we are talking to our Savior
[00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.000]   when we join voices in prayer
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.720]   and make our petitions known to Him.
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.000]   And it's not just physical healing.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.920]   It's also for the healing of souls.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:33.440]   Prayer has the ability to change our destiny,
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:36.400]   our situations right here on this earth,
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.180]   but also in the life to come as well.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:43.220]   And there's a kind of healing that takes place
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:48.220]   when we pray because it's able to save us from our sin.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:54.840]   See, above all things, sin is the most destructive force
[00:36:54.840 --> 00:36:58.880]   in our lives, and we've all experienced this.
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:01.040]   We go against God's will.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.840]   We take things into our own hands.
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:06.520]   We go when God says stop.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.200]   We let the lust of our eyes and the desires of our flesh
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:11.160]   get the better of us.
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:15.780]   We use our words to tear down instead of build up,
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:18.300]   and we fight, we quarrel, we gossip.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.700]   We become friends with the world,
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.360]   and we turn our backs to God.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:26.340]   We have envy and selfish ambition.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:28.140]   We show favoritism to people.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:30.080]   We ignore the needs of the poor.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:34.880]   Sin will 100% absolutely tear you apart,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:36.760]   tear your relationship with God apart,
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:39.180]   and tear your relationship with other people apart.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.600]   That is the destructive power of sin.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:43.980]   So what do we do?
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.480]   We pray, and we confess.
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.760]   James says it this way.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:52.640]   Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.800]   so that you may be healed.
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:58.120]   And confession is one of those things
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:38:01.140]   that's become a bit lost because it's scary.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.160]   It is a bit scary.
[00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:05.520]   It's hard to confess sin, right?
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:07.960]   And when we do it, we feel like there's a certain shame
[00:38:07.960 --> 00:38:10.240]   that comes because we don't want people
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:12.840]   to see the mess we're in.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:16.140]   And so we hide, and we don't allow other people to know.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:21.440]   But I think all of us in this room have also felt this too.
[00:38:21.440 --> 00:38:24.080]   Every time we hide our sin, right,
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.560]   we are actually playing directly
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:27.760]   into what the enemy wants us to do with it.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:30.920]   And when we don't deal with sin,
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:33.900]   we give it the opportunity to grow, right?
[00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.520]   It's like a mold that just festers in the dark,
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:38.680]   and the longer you don't deal with it,
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:42.080]   the more it will grow and destroy your relationship
[00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.800]   with God and others.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:48.120]   Paul describes it as like a web that so easily entangles us
[00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.800]   that it was like we're covered in these webs.
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:52.180]   The more we try to struggle ourselves to get out of it,
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.960]   the bigger the mess we find ourselves in.
[00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.280]   That is what sin does to us.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:01.100]   And James lets us know here, there is a way out.
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:02.960]   One of the ways we deal with it,
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:06.300]   the way to deal with sin is through confession.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:09.780]   Yes, it's scary.
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:10.740]   It's hard to do.
[00:39:10.740 --> 00:39:12.960]   And I've been in those situations
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:15.020]   where I know I've messed up,
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:16.680]   and I know I need to open my mouth
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.840]   and admit what I've done wrong,
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.000]   confess my sin to those who I've sinned against.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:24.440]   And I've been in small groups too,
[00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.800]   where there's been a group of us people
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.160]   that have been walking together,
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.440]   and one of the brothers has come up,
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.440]   and he's confessed things that he's been losing himself to,
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.600]   sin that he's been wrestling with.
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.360]   And yes, there are consequences.
[00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:39.360]   This is not like a magic eraser.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.120]   Everything makes better immediately
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:42.920]   when we confess our sin.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:45.160]   There are consequences to deal with,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.700]   because sin is messy,
[00:39:47.700 --> 00:39:49.840]   and it does take time to figure things out
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:51.200]   and pick up the pieces.
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:39:54.660]   But know this too, church.
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:57.320]   The end result when we confess
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:01.480]   is always a step towards restoration and healing.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:07.120]   And I believe some of us are sitting in this room today,
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:10.500]   and you are suffering greatly because of your sin.
[00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.040]   And you feel like you're in anguish
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:16.980]   because of where your sin has led you to.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:20.780]   And you're sick and tired of the power
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.940]   that sin has over you.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:27.120]   Listen to these words.
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.760]   God can free you if you would allow yourself
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:32.560]   to embrace confession,
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:36.280]   come alongside a brother and sister,
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.680]   confess your sin with us together in front of the Lord
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.200]   so that you can be healed.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.800]   Now I'm not saying everybody come up
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:46.280]   and grab the microphone right now
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.480]   and air all your dirty laundry here.
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.800]   That's not the point.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:54.080]   But it is being honest about where you are.
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:56.560]   It is asking God to help you,
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.320]   and it is inviting someone who you trust,
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.720]   someone else who loves the Lord to come alongside you,
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:05.040]   to tell them what you're struggling,
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:06.600]   tell them what you're going through.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:10.800]   I've had this addiction that I can't get rid of.
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:12.440]   I've hurt people in this way.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.080]   I've been dishonest with my family.
[00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:16.760]   I've been dishonest in my practices and business.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:18.540]   Whatever the sin is,
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:22.720]   what would it be like if we had a community
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:25.200]   that was able, honest enough with each other,
[00:41:25.200 --> 00:41:27.880]   that loves the Lord enough, that loves each other enough
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:30.280]   that we could confess these things freely
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.160]   within our community so that we can find healing?
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.120]   And in fact, I do believe this is something
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:39.080]   that the Lord has been growing us in
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:41.120]   as a church of the vine,
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:42.640]   especially throughout this year.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.640]   We've seen beautiful moments of people gathering together
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:47.700]   to pray for those who are hurting,
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.000]   to pray for those who are lost in sin.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.200]   We have had moments when sin has been confessed
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.680]   and people have found healing and restoration
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:57.420]   as a part of that process.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:02.100]   So this is the task at Hand Church.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.940]   Are we willing to do these things?
[00:42:04.940 --> 00:42:06.960]   In the light of Jesus returning,
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.600]   he has called us to be an active,
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:14.320]   a steadfast, a patient community of faith
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:20.860]   that looks forward to Jesus coming back.
[00:42:22.100 --> 00:42:26.480]   And is tirelessly working to welcome him when he does.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:30.600]   This is the power of God at work
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.680]   in our lives and in the church.
[00:42:32.680 --> 00:42:37.960]   So the question is, after these five weeks,
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.700]   how should we respond?
[00:42:39.700 --> 00:42:42.140]   And time is short.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.900]   We have no time to lose.
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:49.000]   And James has called us to a genuine, active,
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.520]   righteous, loyal, and prayer-filled faith.
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:55.980]   Will we respond to this church?
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.780]   If you would close your eyes for a second
[00:42:59.780 --> 00:43:02.980]   and just allow the Lord to speak to you right now.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:11.780]   You know, and over the past five weeks,
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:14.100]   perhaps God has used different parts
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:17.140]   of this series to talk to you.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:19.440]   Maybe it was in a moment of worship.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:22.500]   Maybe it was in the prayer line.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:26.540]   Maybe it was through one of the messages that we've heard.
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:42.140]   And the Lord loves us too much not to leave us
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.940]   with instructions and his desires for us.
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:48.520]   (gentle music)
[00:43:48.520 --> 00:43:56.300]   And so Jesus, I pray that as a community,
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:59.940]   that we would encourage each other in this way always.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:05.480]   That you would keep our minds and our hearts fixed on you.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:11.500]   That we would always be a voice that cries out
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:13.340]   on behalf of those who have no voice.
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.920]   (gentle music)
[00:44:15.920 --> 00:44:20.620]   That we would always be steadfast in our faith.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:26.340]   Not double-minded, not hot and cold,
[00:44:26.340 --> 00:44:34.500]   but fully focused and sold out completely
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:37.700]   to your love at work in our lives.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.860]   That the way we speak of each other
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.060]   would always be honoring and uplifting.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:51.500]   That our loyalty to you is true,
[00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:55.000]   even when we face the temptations of this world.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:02.420]   And that we are patiently waiting,
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:06.860]   actively working towards building your kingdom
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:07.820]   here on this earth.
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.460]   Jesus, we know you hear our prayer.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:16.300]   And so Father, help us in this journey.
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.560]   And until we see you again face to face, Lord,
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:22.760]   guide us and lead us in your love.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:27.420]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:30.000]   (gentle music)
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.580]   (gentle music)
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:42.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
