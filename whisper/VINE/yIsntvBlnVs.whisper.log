[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Well, good morning church, and if you're joining us online in Overflow, good morning to you
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:06.760]   as well.
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.760]   I'm going to have a question.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.800]   When you daydream, what do you dream about?
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.680]   Like when you're sitting at your desk pretending to work, you know, and like you're staring
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.000]   at the screen, but really your mind's somewhere else.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.120]   What are some things that you find yourself thinking about?
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.560]   You know, imaginations, things that you wish would happen to you.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.360]   I'm about to give you a little bit more insight into the strange and wonderful mind of Alison.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.440]   I'm only doing this because this is a safe place, I hope.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.560]   And if you didn't already think I was weird, maybe now you'll know.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:46.240]   Most of my daydreams involve some sort of breaking out of obscurity and into the limelight.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:47.240]   It's kind of weird.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.760]   For example, I used to do a lot of running.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.880]   So I used to imagine myself like running the Hong Kong marathon.
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:57.280]   And then I'm running the Hong Kong marathon, I'm running, and suddenly I break through
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.360]   the pack.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.440]   And then on TV it's like, "Whoa, who is this guy?
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.600]   He's so super fast."
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.120]   You know, I'm like leading the race and I set a world record pace, right?
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.880]   And everyone's like, "Whoa, out of nowhere comes this guy.
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.880]   His name's Alison, right?
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.800]   And he's such an amazing runner."
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.800]   Something like that.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.960]   Or maybe I'm at a concert, you know, and we're like at a John Legend concert, right?
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.640]   And then he's playing on the piano and suddenly he's lost his voice and he falls sick.
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.120]   He's like, "I'm going to need someone to close out the show."
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:26.000]   Okay, it's like, "You, sir, you look like you're a good singer."
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.720]   Okay, "Say less, John Legend."
[00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.120]   Okay, and I get on the piano and I start playing.
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.640]   I don't even play the piano, right?
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.120]   And then everyone's like, "Whoa, wow, this guy's even better."
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   Right?
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.480]   Like, "Our ticket was well worth the money."
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.480]   Something like that.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:38.480]   Okay.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.480]   Okay, last one.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.480]   Okay, I promise you.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.480]   I'm walking down the road, right?
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.600]   And suddenly I come across a dangerous situation, right?
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.740]   And there's these bad guys that have kidnapped a bunch of children.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.480]   And I happen to be in the right place at the right time.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.760]   And because I've been training martial arts and hand-to-hand combat secretly, right, like
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.640]   Liam Neeson in Taken, I say to them, "I have a very particular set of skills.
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.360]   Skills I've acquired over a very long career.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.000]   Skills that make me a nightmare for people like you.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.880]   Let these kids go now and that'll be the end of it.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.240]   But if you don't, I will find you and I will kill you."
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.240]   Right?
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.680]   And then, like, you know, I go and I take down all the bad guys and save the day.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.640]   And I was like, "Yeah, what a hero."
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   Okay?
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640]   Pray for me, right?
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.680]   So, there are things that go through my mind when I'm wondering.
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.680]   We come to the story of Elijah today in our Encounter with God series.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.120]   And the reason I told you those things is because this is sort of how Elijah burst onto
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.120]   the scene.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.160]   He is a man sort of appearing out of obscurity, appearing out of nowhere.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.160]   We're not really given much about his background or who he is.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:46.400]   But it's not long before we find out that this isn't just any old person or any normal
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.400]   prophet.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.520]   And we find that Elijah is a guy that you really don't want to mess with.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:59.200]   No, he's not perfect, but he is a powerful prophet, able to do amazing things, a force
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.140]   to be reckoned with.
[00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.400]   But it's not because he has any sort of special skills or he's particularly intimidating or
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.700]   anything like that.
[00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.120]   But rather, it's because God is working through him.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.760]   It's because he has these amazing encounters with God and God keeps speaking to him, working
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.760]   through him.
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.680]   And through these encounters, he hears and obeys what God calls him to do.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.480]   And throughout history, Elijah, especially for the Jewish people, Elijah is regarded
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.800]   as one of the greatest prophets of all time.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.400]   And today he is still honored and revered and respected.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.520]   In Jewish culture, during the Passover meal, the door is left open at one stage in anticipation
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.680]   that perhaps Elijah would return.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.520]   He is the most mentioned prophet in the New Testament.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:52.120]   In fact, Elijah was so amazing, he was so great that he didn't, one of the few people,
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.200]   one of two people in scripture, maybe even in all history, that didn't experience death.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.400]   He was taken up to heaven in chariots of fire, never having experienced what it means to
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   die.
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.280]   So today, as we look at Elijah, we're going to look at a few ways that this prophet encountered
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.320]   God, how it shaped him, how it molded him, how it equipped him to do what God had called
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.160]   him to do, and what this means for us today as followers of Jesus in today's age.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.000]   So we're going to look at the Bible and see what it has to say.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.800]   1 Kings 17, 1.
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.640]   Again, this is all we know about Elijah right at the beginning.
[00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:36.240]   Now Elijah, the Tishbite from Tishbe in Gilead said to Ahab, "As the Lord, the God of Israel
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.600]   lives whom I serve, there will neither be dew nor rain in the next few years, except
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.520]   at my word."
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.000]   Now before we get into the details, I'm going to give you a little bit of context.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.520]   It might be helpful to see the state of Israel at this moment.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.160]   So after entering into the promised land, we talked about Joshua a few weeks ago.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.320]   Remember entering into the promised land?
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:02.080]   They've established themselves as a kingdom, right?
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.180]   They have these kings, and under King David, Israel becomes the most powerful and prosperous
[00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.240]   and dominant nation in the whole entire world.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.840]   Things are good, and God is faithful to the covenant that he's made with his people.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.800]   This will be a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   You'll be prosperous.
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.920]   Everything you need will be provided for.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.040]   God is blessing his people.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:30.320]   And King David dies, and his son Solomon takes over the throne, and this continues.
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.520]   This is like the golden age in Israel's history.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.360]   Solomon is a king known for his wisdom, his amazing wisdom, which was given to him by
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.400]   God, but also for the riches that even nations and leaders from faraway places would come
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:51.560]   and marvel at just how powerful Israel had become under God's blessing.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.400]   That is, of course, until Solomon's heart turns towards idols.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.000]   We're told towards the end of his life, the women, the people that he marries, the many
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:09.600]   women that he marries, have turned his heart away from God towards these idols.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.200]   And this violates the commitment that Israel had made with God.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:19.040]   The first two commandments say this, "You shall have no other gods before me."
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.760]   Second, "You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above,
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.400]   on the earth beneath, or in the waters below; you shall not bow down to them or worship
[00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.160]   them."
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.120]   So there's a consequence to their sin.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:38.520]   And as a consequence, God says the kingdom of Israel is no longer going to be unified
[00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.400]   and peaceful as it once was, but it's going to be torn in two.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:47.840]   And the peace and prosperity we see comes to an end.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.680]   And from then on, we see Israel with a long and complicated history of going through different
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.560]   kings, different leaders.
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.560]   Sadly, most of it involves them constantly being enticed to worship idols and false gods,
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:04.800]   which leads to them being invaded by other countries, taken away into exile.
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.360]   They've turned away from the government that they first had with God and started doing
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:14.000]   evil in the sight of the Lord.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.420]   So God sends prophets and messengers constantly to his people.
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:23.540]   And these prophets warn people, write messages of correction, messages of consequences in
[00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.300]   order to let people know, "Hey, we're going in the wrong direction.
[00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.420]   Remember who God is.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.840]   Remember the God that brought you out of Egypt.
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.380]   Remember who he is to us.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.300]   Turn your hearts back towards him."
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.320]   These are always an invitation to say, "Come back towards me.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.560]   This is your rightful place, not with these other gods and idols that you've turned to,
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.860]   but with me, the one true God."
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:51.100]   And I'm emphasizing this because when we look at these stories in the Old Testament sometimes,
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:54.400]   God seems like a grumpy, heartless old man, right?
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.780]   Someone who's only interested in punishing his people for the bad thing that they've
[00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.300]   done.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:04.980]   But when we look a little bit deeper, we see the motivation behind God's actions.
[00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:10.580]   And his heart is never just to punish for the sake of punishing, but he corrects, he
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:11.580]   leads people back.
[00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:16.840]   And yes, there are consequences, but it's always out of love.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:21.620]   And God's heart is that none of his people should perish.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:24.980]   And we actually see God is a merciful God.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:29.580]   And he's not just angry at the way that Israels have turned their hearts away from him, but
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.340]   actually his heart is broken when we turn away from him.
[00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:38.820]   He doesn't want his people, his children to be worshiping idols because he wants them
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:40.400]   close to him.
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.460]   He wants them safe.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:46.180]   He knows that the only place, the best place for them to be, the way they were designed
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:51.060]   to live is in close relationship to the creator.
[00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:57.220]   Again, not because he's some great control freak, but because this is truly the way God
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:09:05.240]   has called us and designed us and created us to live in steadfast, in relationship,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.300]   in obedience to him.
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:13.220]   So God has to let us know, I want you close to me.
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.540]   And every time you break that promise, every time you turn away from me, there are going
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:24.460]   to be consequences, real and serious consequences that you'll have to face in your habitual
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:26.940]   sin.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:32.820]   And it's in a moment like this that in Israel's history that Elijah appears to us.
[00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:37.600]   Like I said, out of nowhere, he brings up this prophet and speaks a word over the nation
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.220]   of Israel.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:42.340]   And the current king is a guy called Ahab.
[00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:48.220]   And like some other kings before him, Ahab had allowed idol worship to run rampant.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.140]   He had married a woman called Jezebel, and Jezebel was a worshiper of the god called
[00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:54.500]   Baal.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.500]   And Baal was known as an evil king, one of these Canaanite, God, sorry, one of these
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:04.700]   Canaanite idols that enticed people to do bad and evil things.
[00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:11.660]   She herself is so against God that she orders the prophets of Yahweh to be put to death.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.180]   All this to say it's not a good time to be a follower of God at this time.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:23.900]   And so when Elijah steps onto the scene, he has a strong and direct word to King Ahab.
[00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:24.900]   This is a big deal.
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.060]   It's sort of like a turning point.
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:32.660]   It's hoping to be a turning point once again in the history of Israel.
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.460]   Elijah comes up to the king and says, "As the Lord God of Israel lives," like we said
[00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:43.020]   just now, "whom I serve, there will be neither dew nor rain in the next few years except
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:46.100]   at my word."
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.900]   Now again, like I said before, this sounds kind of harsh.
[00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:54.060]   You're going to withhold rain, you're going to make there be a famine, and there's going
[00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:58.700]   to be a drought just because people aren't following you?
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.180]   But in reality, this is a warning.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.180]   There's a consequence.
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.860]   The Israelites have already known about the consequences of idolatry.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:11.540]   Back when God was giving the law to the Israelites, he told them, "This land that I'm bringing
[00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.980]   you into, this is the promised land.
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:15.700]   It will be flowing with milk and honey.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:16.700]   There will be fruitful.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.700]   There will be rain.
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:19.220]   The ground will produce grain.
[00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:25.340]   There's going to be wine and olive oil, all these things for you if you would love the
[00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:31.140]   Lord your God and serve him with your whole heart and with all your soul.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:36.060]   But if you do not, the warning was that God would shut up the heavens so that it will
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:39.980]   not rain and the ground would yield no produce."
[00:11:39.980 --> 00:11:44.620]   Deuteronomy chapter 11 if you want to check it out for yourself.
[00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:49.660]   And as the Israelites are stuck in this cycle, the theological term for this is apostasy.
[00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.020]   And under King Ahab, like we said, it's particularly bad.
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:56.100]   Taking a liking to worshipping Baal.
[00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:59.220]   And Baal was supposed to be the god of thunder, of lightning.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:02.020]   He was supposed to be the one in control over the weather.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.260]   Baal was seen as the god of fertility.
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:09.340]   He was supposed to be the god who provided for people through controlling the weather
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.380]   and being able to make the seasons come and go, making the land produce, all that kind
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:15.940]   of stuff.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.260]   That was supposed to be his role.
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:22.900]   Now we have to ask ourselves the question though, why?
[00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:28.100]   Why were the Israelites so into Baal worship?
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.820]   You would think after all that they'd been through, the way that God had brought them
[00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:37.700]   out of slavery, out of Egypt, into the promised land, the different things that they had experienced
[00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:42.440]   and seen firsthand, the power of God at work, the stories that had been passed down through
[00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:47.960]   the generations, they would have been a little bit more loyal to him.
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:52.780]   The attractiveness of Baal worship laid in the fact that people could worship Baal on
[00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:54.780]   their own terms.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:59.620]   They could fulfill the desires, the dark evil desires through worshiping Baal.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:04.940]   Baal was an encourager of heavy drinking, of sexual license.
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:10.500]   The temple prostitutes, both male and female, were a very popular part of what it meant
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.820]   to worship Baal.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:15.260]   In other words, they could live in sin.
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:16.620]   They could live in immorality.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:22.460]   They could do whatever they wanted and still call that worship.
[00:13:22.460 --> 00:13:28.020]   This is the root of our adolatory church, when we put our own desires above how God
[00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.180]   has called us to live.
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:38.540]   So as we're sitting here, we have to ask ourselves today, where are the idols in our lives?
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:44.340]   Where have we given up our knowledge of God and how he has called us to live just to satisfy
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:49.100]   our own wants and desires?
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:54.700]   We might not be literally worshiping idols and images of Baal today, but if there's anything,
[00:13:54.700 --> 00:14:00.540]   anything at all that has taken your focus away from God and onto yourself and pleasing
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:08.140]   yourself, that is an idol, just like Baal was for the Israelites.
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.900]   Some of us are in this time right now, we're facing dry scenes in our life, wondering why
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:19.020]   we aren't seeing fruit and progress, knowing all the while that we haven't given our hearts
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:25.100]   wholly to God, that we've been following these idols instead of fixing and following in the
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:28.660]   footsteps of Jesus.
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:36.380]   And so when Elijah pronounces this challenge, this statement, it wasn't just to King Ahab,
[00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:39.340]   it was to Baal himself.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:41.900]   This was God was saying, you know what?
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:43.020]   I am the one.
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:46.700]   I am truly the one who's in charge of creation.
[00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:50.380]   I'm the one who created the world in the first place.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.380]   You might think Baal has control over the weather.
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.100]   No, that's me.
[00:14:54.100 --> 00:14:56.500]   I am the most high God.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:57.540]   I am the provider.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.060]   I am the I am.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:03.020]   I am the creator and idols have no power over me.
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:08.540]   I am the only and one true God.
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.700]   And it's a challenge for us and a reminder for us today as well.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.260]   If we want to see God work in our lives, if we want to bear fruit, if we want life, then
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.540]   we must put down our idols in order to follow God wholeheartedly.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:28.340]   And we're about to see through these encounters that Elijah has with God, three main encounters.
[00:15:28.340 --> 00:15:33.220]   Each encounter gets increasingly more dramatic and ends up with one of the most awesome displays
[00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:38.940]   of power that we see in the Old Testament, displays of his power and his presence.
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:44.340]   All this to prove that there is only one God.
[00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:48.180]   Even Elijah's name himself testifies to this fact.
[00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:52.300]   Elijah means Yahweh is my God.
[00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:56.740]   And I hope that this statement is one that we'll be able to walk away with today as we
[00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:00.340]   look at this passage, these passages together.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:03.460]   So let's look at these encounters because I think they're going to give us a really
[00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:09.980]   clear picture of who God is and why he is the only true God.
[00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:13.780]   First encounter involves a brook and some ravens.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:15.020]   Let me explain.
[00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:19.620]   So immediately after dropping the mic on a hare, so to speak, and announcing this drought,
[00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:23.140]   Elijah is commanded to go and hide in a ravine.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:28.780]   And whilst he's in hiding, whilst he's in this ravine, God provides for him in a miraculous
[00:16:28.780 --> 00:16:29.780]   way.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:34.180]   He's out in the wilderness and sort of like a homage, if you read through the Old Testament,
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.260]   you see these patterns of how God works, right?
[00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:41.780]   How God looked after his people in Israel, he continues to do the same for Elijah by
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:47.140]   feeding him in the desert, by providing him food and water, even though there's a drought
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:49.180]   and famine going on.
[00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:50.420]   It's an amazing little story.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:51.420]   This is what God says.
[00:16:51.420 --> 00:16:56.660]   "Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah, 'Leave here, turn eastward and hide in Kareth
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.140]   ravine east of the Jordan.
[00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:03.420]   You will drink from the brook that I have directed the ravens to supply you with food
[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:04.420]   there.'
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:06.140]   So he did what the Lord had told him.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:09.620]   He went to the Kareth ravine east of the Jordan and stayed there.
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:13.740]   The ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning and meat and bread in the evening,
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:16.980]   and he drank from the brook."
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:22.300]   So as we saw with the person of Joshua, Elijah has this spirit, has this mindset that is
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:27.740]   fixed on obeying God, to trust him at all times, even when it didn't make sense.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:29.540]   Go and hide in the desert?
[00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:30.540]   How am I going to survive?
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.500]   How am I going to live?
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:39.500]   But notice, every time God asks for our obedience, he always shows us his power and ability to
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:46.500]   protect us and to provide for us and to guide us, if we follow his guidance.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.380]   We see this in the middle of a drought, God leads Elijah to water.
[00:17:51.380 --> 00:18:00.940]   When everyone is feeling the effects of famine, God brings meat and food to Elijah.
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:06.180]   This is God displaying that in fact, he is the one in control over everything.
[00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:13.300]   Over his creation, he provides these ravens to bring Elijah bread and meat twice a day.
[00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:17.660]   This is a clear picture of God's rich providence.
[00:18:17.660 --> 00:18:22.900]   You have to understand that back in that time, getting to eat meat twice a day was a rich
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:23.900]   fare, right?
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.300]   It would have been a privilege even in the best of times.
[00:18:27.300 --> 00:18:33.460]   And here God is providing above and beyond all this to say, God will always unfailingly
[00:18:33.460 --> 00:18:38.540]   take care of those who rely on him.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:41.620]   And this is a word and a reminder for us.
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:48.980]   Be confident church that if God has called you to it in his way, he will see you through
[00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:52.180]   if you trust and obey.
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:57.420]   And we continue to see God work through Elijah in this way.
[00:18:57.420 --> 00:19:00.500]   God then moves Elijah on to his next encounter.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:05.580]   We're told that the water in the brook dries up, so it's time to move on.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.860]   And God says to him, go at once to Zarephath in the region of Sidon and stay there.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:16.300]   I have directed a widow there to supply you with food.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.460]   So Elijah continues on his journey.
[00:19:18.460 --> 00:19:22.220]   Like I said, this is a journey that Elijah is taking that's going to culminate in this
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.180]   amazing encounter with God.
[00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:30.140]   This next step he has to take though is actually taking him directly into the heart of Baal's
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.820]   territory, of his home turf.
[00:19:33.820 --> 00:19:39.780]   God is surely and slowly moving Elijah into a direct confrontation with Baal.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:44.820]   And so surely enough, Elijah gets to his destination and he meets a woman, a widow and her son
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:50.020]   struggling on, struggling to survive through this drought and this famine.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:53.860]   And Elijah asks her for water and some food.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.980]   Now it's strange because she's really in no position to help Elijah.
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:03.220]   So she says to him, as surely as the Lord your God lives, she replied, I don't have
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:04.900]   any bread.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:09.660]   Only a handful of flour in a jar and a little olive oil in a jug.
[00:20:09.660 --> 00:20:14.620]   I'm gathering a few sticks to take home and make a meal for myself and my son that we
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:19.180]   may eat it and die.
[00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.180]   Notice her response.
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:25.020]   This woman does not yet have a belief in God.
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:27.300]   She acknowledges she kind of knows who God is.
[00:20:27.300 --> 00:20:32.140]   She's probably heard stories about him, but she says, it's the Lord, your God, Elijah,
[00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:34.940]   your God, not my God.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:39.620]   She was probably a Baal worshiper herself, but it seems as though she's already given
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:43.620]   up hope and she's waiting for death.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.940]   Her so-called God who was supposed to look after her, who was supposed to be able to
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:53.740]   provide her with food and all these things has failed and all is lost.
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:59.900]   Life as she knows it at this moment is over.
[00:20:59.900 --> 00:21:04.940]   And but this made me think, maybe for some of us here today, we're feeling a little bit
[00:21:04.940 --> 00:21:07.060]   like this woman.
[00:21:07.060 --> 00:21:11.460]   And we're sitting here today, we've heard about God, we've heard about who he is, but
[00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:16.700]   you would not say yet you had a relationship with God, even though you've heard about him.
[00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:21.720]   And you might not literally be starving to death, but maybe in your spirit, in your outlook
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:28.260]   on life and your hope, it's felt like you've been a season of drought and famine.
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:32.180]   And the things that you've been putting your faith in have failed you.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:36.340]   And it feels like life has lost all meaning and there's really nothing else now to live
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.940]   for.
[00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.260]   Maybe this is a word for you.
[00:21:41.260 --> 00:21:45.580]   As these words of Elijah spoke to this widow brought her hope, I pray that if this is you
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:51.100]   today, you resonate with these words and it will bring you hope as well.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:56.780]   Elijah says to her, do not be afraid.
[00:21:56.780 --> 00:21:59.020]   Do not be afraid.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:22:00.780]   This is the word of life.
[00:22:00.780 --> 00:22:04.740]   He's about to tell her God's going to take care of this.
[00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:09.820]   So he says to her, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel says, the jar of flour will
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:16.000]   not be used up and the jug of oil will not run dry until the day the Lord sends rain
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.360]   on the land.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.860]   And this is exactly what happens.
[00:22:20.860 --> 00:22:24.240]   She thought she only had a little left, but God sustains it.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.480]   The jar of flour does not get used up.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.620]   The jug of oil does not run dry in keeping word with the words that are spoken by Elijah
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:38.940]   through the, sorry, through Elijah by the Lord.
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.900]   If we're in a season today, church, where it feels like the hope, your hope has run
[00:22:42.900 --> 00:22:44.500]   dry.
[00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:49.420]   If you're in a season where you feel like you're done trusting in other things, maybe
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:56.100]   the answer for you today is to turn to God, to hear him say, do not be afraid, to hear
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:01.100]   him say, I will give you hope and life again.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.260]   You might feel like I've run out of bread.
[00:23:03.260 --> 00:23:08.260]   The things that have been sustaining my life have run out.
[00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:12.960]   But Jesus says, I am the bread of life.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.460]   You might think I only have a little handful left.
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:21.540]   There's not much I'm, I'm hanging on by a thread here, but God says he will bring you
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:25.340]   to a place of abundance.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:29.140]   It may seem like there's only this tiny little bit of oil left, and once I use it up, that's
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.140]   it.
[00:23:30.140 --> 00:23:32.980]   I don't know what else I'm going to hope in.
[00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:39.100]   God says, put your trust in me and your cup will overflow.
[00:23:39.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   God is the only one who's able to sustain your faith.
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:48.380]   He's the only source where if, as long as you put your hope in him, your hope will never
[00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:50.260]   run dry.
[00:23:50.260 --> 00:23:55.060]   We see that even the worst of times, as we read on in this story, right?
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:24:01.220]   God provides for herself, for her son and for herself for a while, but things get worse.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:05.780]   Her son dies whilst Elijah is staying with them.
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:08.340]   But again, look how God wants to display his power.
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:11.820]   Even in the face of death, God remains sovereign.
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.260]   This is God really proving I am the true God.
[00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:17.320]   I am the only God of life.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.900]   And this woman's son dies and she laments.
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:20.980]   Why did you come here?
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:22.660]   Just to kill my son?
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:28.060]   And so Elijah again prays, oh my Lord, let this boy's life return to him.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:33.220]   And through Elijah's prayer, God brings the boy back to life.
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.980]   And all this is going to show this is God's way of reaching this woman, of encountering
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:42.500]   this woman, to let her know that he is the true God.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.340]   And she declares it with herself with her mouth.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:49.860]   Now I know that you are a man of God and the word of the Lord from your mouth is the truth.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:53.020]   Church, let me say this again.
[00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:58.620]   If you feel as though hope in your life is lost today, if you feel that hope in your
[00:24:58.620 --> 00:25:05.420]   life even is dead today, if you want to know the true God who is the source of all life
[00:25:05.420 --> 00:25:08.940]   and all hope, cry out to him.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:10.100]   Call on him.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:16.540]   He is the only one who is able to give you life.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:21.140]   And so after helping out this widow and her son, making sure that they're going to be
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:28.220]   okay and taken care of, finally now it's time for Elijah to go and confront the evil King
[00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:32.380]   Ahab face to face.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:36.060]   It's been a long time, the Bible told us, since they had last met.
[00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:41.060]   After a long time, three years, in the third year, the word of the Lord came to Elijah.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:45.940]   Go and present yourself to Ahab and I will send rain on the land.
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:50.620]   So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab.
[00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:52.100]   Now a little bit more about Ahab.
[00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:55.380]   It's clear by now to us, to the reader, if you've been reading through the story, that
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:00.100]   Ahab is not the kind of King, not the kind of leader that was fit to lead the people
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.540]   of God, to lead the nation of Israel.
[00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:08.500]   If you read a little bit more in the passage 1 Kings 18, it tells us, yes, the land was
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.580]   in time of severe famine and drought, but instead of looking after his people, King
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:18.140]   Ahab is still more interested in looking after his own things.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:23.060]   Ahab orders people to go out and look for resources, but not because he wants to help
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:24.300]   his people.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.300]   He says, well, let's go out, look for grass, look for water, so that the horses and the
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:34.700]   mules will be kept alive and we don't have to kill any of our own animals.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.700]   This is strange, right?
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.940]   Because if Ahab was a good leader, he would have been out making sure that people like
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:44.340]   the people Elijah just helped, the widows and the orphans he had just encountered, will
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.540]   be taken care of.
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:51.940]   This was the call of the Israelite King to look after the widows and the orphans.
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:56.460]   But yet he's far more concerned and worried about his own possessions.
[00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:57.780]   He is more interested in self-preservation.
[00:26:57.780 --> 00:27:05.300]   Again, this just goes to prove, right, whatever we worship will end up dictating how we live
[00:27:05.300 --> 00:27:06.940]   our lives.
[00:27:06.940 --> 00:27:12.460]   As Jesus put it, where our treasure is, there your heart will be also.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:17.580]   And as I was reading this part, I felt like God was reminding me to ask ourselves the
[00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:23.180]   question where are our priorities?
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.940]   Where do our priorities lie?
[00:27:25.940 --> 00:27:31.500]   Do we have our hearts set on the things of God or on the things of man?
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:36.080]   Because whenever we're chasing idols and things that are not of God, our priorities are going
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:38.580]   to be messed up.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:43.300]   And a good way to check to see if we're giving in to the idols in our lives is to look at
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:45.540]   our priorities.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.500]   We do a heart check and a mind check.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.940]   Ask ourselves the tough questions.
[00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.140]   What are we holding as important?
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:57.740]   Where do we find ourselves putting our resources, our time, our money?
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.140]   What is our mind filled with?
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.620]   What are these goals that we're trying to hit?
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:08.140]   Because if they're not the things that are on God's heart, then maybe it's time for us
[00:28:08.140 --> 00:28:12.520]   to start making some changes.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:19.420]   Maybe it's time for us to realign our priorities, to make sure that our hearts are set aligned
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.420]   with what God has on his heart.
[00:28:22.420 --> 00:28:26.580]   Ahab is not able to see this.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:31.800]   Instead when Elijah comes to him, he sees Elijah as, okay, here's someone that I can
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.580]   blame for all my problems.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:43.500]   As Ahab and Elijah meet, Ahab says to him, "Is that you, you troubler of Israel?"
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:50.260]   Now I'm not sure, but have you ever been called a troublemaker?
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.340]   Well let me ask it this way.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:55.740]   When you hear the term troublemaker, who comes to mind?
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.740]   Don't look at them right now, okay?
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:59.820]   I mean I can see a few, a corner of my eye right now.
[00:28:59.820 --> 00:29:08.380]   I'm not going to call you out, Justin, all right?
[00:29:08.380 --> 00:29:12.620]   I used to be called a troublemaker a lot actually, believe it or not, when I was at school.
[00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:17.220]   One of the questions I would hate being asked, and I was asked almost, maybe not every day,
[00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:22.460]   but every other day, the teachers would say, "Ellison, tell me what you've done wrong today.
[00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.700]   What trouble have you got into?"
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:29.460]   And I never knew how to answer because on any day I've done multiple things wrong, all
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.460]   right?
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.580]   So I wouldn't want to say something that the teacher didn't already know and get myself
[00:29:33.580 --> 00:29:36.420]   into even more trouble, right?
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.340]   Something they didn't already know about.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:44.420]   But Ahab, when Ahab calls Elijah a troublemaker, this was an accusation.
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:45.420]   It was an insult.
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:50.340]   Like I said, he was putting the blame on Elijah for the drought and the famine that they were
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:51.340]   facing.
[00:29:51.340 --> 00:29:55.420]   This was Ahab's way of saying, "This is your fault, Elijah.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.780]   You've gone and you've angered Baal.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:04.140]   And because you've angered Baal, this is why this famine, this is why this drought is happening.
[00:30:04.140 --> 00:30:08.620]   This is why there's been no rain, because you've insulted Baal."
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.660]   And again, this just shows how stubborn and how far away Ahab's heart had become from
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:16.780]   God, how far away he had turned.
[00:30:16.780 --> 00:30:20.140]   It's been three years that they've been facing this drought.
[00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:24.220]   And any time in this three years, Ahab knew the law.
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:26.100]   He knew why this was happening.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.580]   He could have repented at any moment.
[00:30:28.580 --> 00:30:32.520]   He could have turned his heart back toward God.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:37.300]   He knew full well, I think, that this famine, this drought was due to the idol worship that
[00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:44.220]   he and he had led other people to participate in, and yet he refuses to repent and to change.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:48.580]   Instead, he tries to shift the blame onto Elijah.
[00:30:48.580 --> 00:30:52.300]   He points fingers.
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.240]   This is easy thing to do, church.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:59.900]   And it's also cowardly.
[00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:03.980]   People who are stuck in sin, who refuse to change, who refuse to take ownership, will
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:09.460]   always blame everyone and everything else but themselves.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:14.540]   But again, this just goes to show, for those of us who are obediently following God, if
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.940]   we're standing the light, if we're doing God's will, and if we're being called a troublemaker
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:24.420]   by those doing evil, you know you're doing something right.
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:27.180]   The prophets were often called troublemakers, actually.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.820]   Not just Elijah, but the other prophets as well.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:34.420]   They were called troublemakers because they went against the status quo of the time.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.220]   They weren't afraid to speak the words of truth and call out sin in people.
[00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:42.660]   They were called troublemakers because they asked the tough questions.
[00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:44.460]   How are you looking after people?
[00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:48.300]   What are you doing to fulfill this role that God has given to you?
[00:31:48.300 --> 00:31:53.320]   They were called troublemakers because they revealed and spoke the truth.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:58.060]   The disciples were called troublemakers at one point because of their love for Jesus.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:32:04.500]   Paul and his friends were called troublemakers because they would not shut up about the gospel.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:09.860]   Even Jesus himself was being called a rebel and a subverter because he declared the truth
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:13.860]   about who he was.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:20.020]   In our fight against idolatry, in our fight against evil, we have to be ready, church.
[00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:25.300]   Anytime we stand up against idolatry, anytime we stand up against injustice, anytime we
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:29.980]   stand up to the principalities and power of this world, anytime we speak the truth over
[00:32:29.980 --> 00:32:37.260]   lies, we must be ready to be met with resistance and be labeled as troublemakers of this world.
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:40.580]   But take heart.
[00:32:40.580 --> 00:32:42.860]   We're not the troublemakers.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:47.940]   We're the ones who are calling people to turn their hearts back towards God.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.260]   And so at this point, God says enough is enough.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:55.980]   I'm about to show you that actually Ahab is the real troublemaker here.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:00.020]   And so Elijah challenged him to a showdown.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:06.660]   Elijah says, "I have not made trouble for Israel," Elijah replied, "but you and your
[00:33:06.660 --> 00:33:11.100]   father's family have because you have abandoned the Lord's commands and have followed the
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:12.100]   bowels."
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:19.820]   "Now summon people from all over Israel and meet me on Mount Carmel and bring the 450
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:25.500]   prophets of Baal and the 450 prophets of Asherah who eat at Jezebel's table."
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:31.900]   So Ahab sent word throughout all Israel and assembled the prophets on Mount Carmel.
[00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:34.980]   This is like the fight of the century being set up here.
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.020]   In Ahab's mind, he probably thought, "Well, okay, this is going to be an easy victory
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:40.380]   for me.
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:48.060]   900 prophets of idols, 900 prophets of Baal versus just one prophet of Yahweh."
[00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:52.140]   On paper, this was not a fair fight.
[00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:57.820]   And to Ahab, this was an opportunity to shut this troublemaker up, to put this prophet
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.440]   of God to shame.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:04.820]   With the whole of Israel watching, "I'm going to humiliate Elijah before these assembled
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.820]   people.
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:09.980]   He's going to know that he's wrong and then we're going to kill him."
[00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.340]   That was probably the plan going on in his mind.
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:19.060]   But as we're about to see, there's going to be a rude awakening for Ahab.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:22.900]   You see Elijah, though, he's not fazed at all.
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:26.780]   He's not worried about the fact that he's going up against 900 of these prophets of
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:27.900]   Baal.
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.700]   It's almost like he knows what's about to happen.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:37.220]   And in the midst of all this, I don't want us to miss this, his main concern is still
[00:34:37.220 --> 00:34:40.500]   for God's people.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.740]   He has the heart of God towards his people.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:47.660]   His main concern is a final warning for them to wake them up, to help them change their
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:49.820]   hearts and their minds.
[00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:54.400]   Elijah went before the people and said, "How long will you waver between two opinions?
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.860]   If the Lord is God, follow him.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:00.120]   But if Baal is God, follow him."
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:04.460]   But the people said nothing.
[00:35:04.460 --> 00:35:08.260]   It's a significant challenge that Elijah lays down to the people.
[00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:13.680]   Again, as we've already mentioned, the main problem that Israel had was constantly slipping
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:21.100]   into apostasy, following God in one instance and then giving up on him in the next.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:24.980]   And it's a pattern that, if we're honest with ourselves, maybe we find ourselves falling
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:28.180]   into today as well.
[00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.160]   We know who God is, for those of us who do.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:36.020]   But at times, right, Baal worship, idol worship is still very enticing.
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:40.040]   We have seen God work in our lives, but at times, our hearts are still drawn towards
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.540]   these idols that we hold.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:46.160]   And Elijah's questions to the Israelites still stands to us today.
[00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:49.400]   How long will we waver?
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:54.180]   Because there's no such thing as being a Christian, yet still putting our faith in things that
[00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:56.740]   are not of God.
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:02.300]   We cannot claim to be a Christian, but still find spirituality and spiritual hope in other
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:08.740]   sources like feng shui or tarot cards or horoscopes and things like that.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:14.660]   We cannot claim to be following Jesus, but yet prioritize our business, our status, things
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:19.920]   of this world over how he has called us to live.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:23.740]   So Elijah tells them, "You have to get off the fence.
[00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:26.620]   Make up your mind."
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:31.820]   Other parts of the Bible says this, "No one can be a slave of two masters."
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:37.300]   Jesus tells us if we're not for him, then we're against him.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:43.060]   Revelation 3.16 says, "So because you are lukewarm, neither hot or cold, I'm about to
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:47.300]   spit you out of my mouth."
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:50.980]   But the people said nothing.
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:57.420]   Church, let's not be a people who say nothing.
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.900]   God is not looking for a church that is silent.
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.780]   God is not looking for those whose faith tosses and turns.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.460]   God is not looking for people whose faith is hidden while there's injustice in this
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:13.020]   world, whilst there are still people who don't know the love of Jesus.
[00:37:13.020 --> 00:37:18.140]   And I pray as this body of Christ, as this community, we will never be a people that
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:23.900]   stay silent, that we will never be a church that is afraid to cause trouble for the evildoers
[00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:25.540]   of this world.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:30.220]   And I pray that as a church, we'll be loud and bold and active in our faith because we
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:36.160]   know that the God we serve is the most high or powerful God.
[00:37:36.160 --> 00:37:40.060]   And we're about to see Elijah prove it.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:47.340]   Elijah said to them, "I am only one of the Lord's prophets left, but Baal has 450 prophets.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:48.940]   Get two bulls first.
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.900]   Let Baal's prophets choose one for themselves and let them cut it into pieces and put it
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:55.580]   on the wood, but not set fire to it.
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:59.780]   I will prepare the other bull and put it on the wood, but not set fire to it.
[00:37:59.780 --> 00:38:03.780]   Then you call upon the name of your God and I will call the name of the Lord.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:07.740]   The God who answers by fire, he is God."
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   Then all the people said, "What you say is good."
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:15.980]   Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "Choose one of the bulls and prepare it first, since
[00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:17.900]   there are so many of you.
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.200]   Call upon the name of your God, but do not light the fire."
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.940]   So they took the bull given them and prepared it.
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.460]   Then they called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:32.540]   "Baal, answer us," they shouted.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:37.540]   Things are made as hard for Yahweh as possible.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.380]   Elijah is one against 400.
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:42.100]   Baal's people get the first choice of the bull.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:48.260]   The whole thing is set up to try and tip the scales against Elijah.
[00:38:48.260 --> 00:38:52.540]   The Baals, they make the first move, so it's like if you're playing a game of badminton
[00:38:52.540 --> 00:38:53.540]   or tennis or something.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:56.140]   If you serve first, it's always your advantage.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:39:01.040]   All the advantage was given to the prophets and the worshipers of Baal.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:07.700]   Everything was done to tip the balance against them, to make this not into a fair fight.
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:09.340]   But check this out.
[00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:11.820]   There was no response.
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:15.340]   No one answered.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.180]   And they danced around at the altar they had made.
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:20.140]   At noon, Elijah began to taunt them.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.660]   "Shout louder," he said.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:23.100]   "Surely he's God.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:26.660]   Maybe he's in deep thought or busy or traveling."
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.140]   Some translation says maybe he's on the toilet, right?
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.580]   Maybe he's sleeping and must be awakened.
[00:39:32.580 --> 00:39:36.540]   They shouted louder and slashed themselves with swords and spears as was their custom
[00:39:36.540 --> 00:39:38.740]   until their blood flowed.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.980]   Midday passed and they continued their frantic prophesying until the time of evening sacrifice,
[00:39:43.980 --> 00:39:45.620]   but there was no response.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.740]   No one answered.
[00:39:46.740 --> 00:39:48.340]   No one paid attention.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.340]   How ironic.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:55.980]   Now, if Baal worship wasn't such an evil practice, you would almost feel sorry for them as what's
[00:39:55.980 --> 00:39:57.680]   happening here.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:03.700]   They tried to humiliate Elijah, but they're the ones being humiliated right now.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:05.900]   These prophets put up every trick in the book.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:12.500]   All these tactics were things that were supposed to entice a reaction from Baal.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:17.580]   The self-mutilation, the frantic prophesying were supposed to be tactics to get Baal's
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:19.300]   attention.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:23.820]   But in the end, it's absolutely useless.
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:28.260]   But this made me think in the same way for us.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:33.220]   The efforts that we put into pleasing and chasing our idols, all the effort we put into
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:38.980]   the things of this world will always amount to nothing.
[00:40:38.980 --> 00:40:43.740]   This is why every time we chase idols, we always end up feeling empty inside.
[00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:46.180]   It never works.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:49.900]   This is why the things of this world will never satisfy us no matter how much of it
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:50.900]   we have.
[00:40:50.900 --> 00:40:52.540]   We always want more of it.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:55.060]   We're never satisfied.
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:59.580]   So why are we running around making so much effort, in some cases even hurting ourselves,
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:03.300]   to try and please these idols, to try and get most of these things we can, to things
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:08.700]   that will never fully be able to respond and to satisfy us?
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:12.140]   The things of this world, church, will never satisfy.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:17.300]   They will never be able to answer our prayers.
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:20.540]   Contrast this to Elijah's response.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:22.460]   He repairs the altar.
[00:41:22.460 --> 00:41:24.300]   He arranges the wood.
[00:41:24.300 --> 00:41:28.020]   He puts his sacrifice, drenches the whole thing in water.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:32.620]   We're told it's drenched in water, and he says a prayer.
[00:41:32.620 --> 00:41:40.500]   Elijah says, "Lord, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known today that you
[00:41:40.500 --> 00:41:47.300]   are God in Israel and that I am your servant and have done all these things at your command.
[00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:48.300]   Answer me, Lord.
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:53.460]   Answer me so that these people will know that you, God, are God and that you are turning
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:58.860]   your hearts, turning their hearts back again."
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:03.780]   It's a soft prayer compared to the franticness of the prophets of Baal.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:10.060]   But there's a really beautiful thing about this prayer that really reveals Elijah's pastoral
[00:42:10.060 --> 00:42:14.380]   heart and God's heart for his people.
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:19.620]   Because yet, yes, he is frustrated that people have turned to idol worship.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:24.540]   The double-mindedness of these people has gone against the will of God.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:26.260]   But notice the prayer.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.540]   The prayer is not yet, "Punish these people.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:29.860]   Kill them right now, God.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:30.860]   They deserve death.
[00:42:30.860 --> 00:42:32.300]   Look how they've turned away from you."
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:33.780]   That's not what Elijah says.
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:38.820]   Rather, it's for them to have their eyes opened, to have their hearts restored.
[00:42:38.820 --> 00:42:44.240]   Let them know you are God so they can turn their hearts back to you.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:49.220]   Like I said in the beginning, this is always God's heart for his people.
[00:42:49.220 --> 00:42:54.700]   For them to be back to him again, for them to be back close to him so that he can love
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:59.980]   on them and he can provide for them and take care of them in the best way that he knows
[00:42:59.980 --> 00:43:02.780]   how.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:08.380]   God responds so that his children will turn their hearts back to him.
[00:43:08.380 --> 00:43:14.540]   God responds in a way for everyone to see who he is.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:18.580]   And when God responds, there is no hoax.
[00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.860]   There is no deception.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:30.180]   It's a powerful and direct answer, a true display of his power.
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:35.460]   Then the fire of the Lord fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, the
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:36.700]   soil.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:42.700]   Think about how powerful that fire would have to be to burn up stones, to lick up the water
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.380]   in the trench.
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:50.540]   When the people saw this, they felt prostrate and cried, "The Lord, he is God.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:54.220]   The Lord, he is God."
[00:43:54.220 --> 00:44:00.780]   The story ends with a powerful and dramatic encounter with God through God's fire, the
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:06.640]   all-consuming fire, the holy fire, the fire that leaves people with no doubt that God
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.580]   is the only true God.
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:17.220]   The fire that leaves people with no choice but to bow down and worship him.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:23.740]   We spent the past few weeks in this series talking about wanting to encounter God.
[00:44:23.740 --> 00:44:27.900]   But if we really want a true encounter with God that's going to be lasting and changes
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:35.660]   our lives and changes our hearts, we have to get rid of the idols in our lives, church.
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:40.460]   We have to get away everything that's distracted us from him, who he's called us to be, how
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:46.100]   he's called us to live, so that him and him alone sits at the highest priority out of
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:50.540]   everything that we live for.
[00:44:50.540 --> 00:44:54.300]   So we're going to take a moment right now, church, to pray.
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:45:01.700]   And I'm going to pray and ask God to show us where the idols in our lives might be.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:08.700]   And it might be a scary thing to do, but I'm going to ask also for God to come and to burn
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:14.300]   away everything else that doesn't belong in our hearts and our minds, to remove these
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:17.980]   idols that we might have turned our heart towards.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:22.540]   And we'll find that God's heart is one of mercy and grace and love.
[00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:29.460]   He's not seeking to punish us, but he's seeking to turn our hearts back towards him because
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:35.660]   that's the best place for us to be.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:40.900]   So get yourselves comfortable in whatever way you normally talk to God, church.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:47.380]   Maybe you want to close your eyes if that helps you focus or something like that.
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:52.360]   Just do a bit of a heart check right now.
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:58.220]   Have there been things that have taken priority over God in your lives?
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:02.900]   Have there been things that you've turned to for your source of hope and life instead
[00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:05.900]   of Jesus?
[00:46:05.900 --> 00:46:10.900]   It's a deep question.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:18.380]   Sometimes these things are kind of subtle.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:37.180]   But as you pray, just allow the Holy Spirit to bring them up.
[00:46:37.180 --> 00:46:43.700]   One thing that as I was thinking between these services and talking to someone, one of the
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:53.340]   things that we so often fall victim to as an idol in our society is the praise of man.
[00:46:53.340 --> 00:47:03.540]   And we want to do things and perform and reach certain goals because we want other people
[00:47:03.540 --> 00:47:05.940]   to see, "Oh yeah, that person is good.
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:06.940]   That person is great."
[00:47:06.940 --> 00:47:19.820]   Or we're trying to please other people's expectations.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:30.180]   Jesus reminds us, "My opinion of you is the most important."
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:39.380]   It's more important to please God rather than man.
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:45.100]   Whatever it is, church, just continue to allow God to speak to you about it.
[00:47:45.100 --> 00:47:52.940]   And when he does, just confess it to him and tell him about it.
[00:47:52.940 --> 00:47:58.380]   And then just imagine that fire like Elijah came, come down and burn it away.
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:03.820]   God's holiness, God's presence.
[00:48:03.820 --> 00:48:08.700]   And for him to turn your heart back towards him again.
[00:48:08.700 --> 00:48:10.260]   So Father, we pray for our hearts.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.900]   We pray for our minds.
[00:48:13.900 --> 00:48:19.820]   Burn everything else away till there's a pure and true desire just for you and you alone.
