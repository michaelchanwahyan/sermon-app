[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:16.800]   - Imagine with me for a moment, a church.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.840]   This is not a church in the singular,
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.760]   on its own and distinct,
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.480]   but a church in the plural,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.720]   united across a nation, joined in purpose,
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.480]   focused on building up God's kingdom, one life at a time.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.040]   It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA,
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.600]   the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.000]   and that celebrates in the freedom and grace
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.820]   that such a story brings.
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.900]   This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,
[00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.640]   but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.080]   desiring for God's kingdom to take root
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.980]   and bear fruit in local soil.
[00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.200]   A church that sees salvation as holistic,
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.020]   transforming God's people for God's work
[00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.040]   and equipping a generation to represent God's heart
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.840]   to the poor, the weak, the oppressed and the persecuted.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.760]   Imagine this church committed to seeing the family
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.080]   as integral to all that it's called to be and do,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.480]   involving intentional, committed
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.360]   and authentic relationships across all levels.
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.240]   It is the sort of place where both the young
[00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.640]   and the old feel cared for, supported and equipped.
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.960]   A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.240]   come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.920]   that honors and embraces a richness in diversity
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.180]   that marks us as the body of Christ.
[00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.720]   It is a church that is willing to innovate
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.240]   and express faith creatively,
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.440]   reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.800]   as glory to him.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.120]   A place where people gather hungry for the presence of God
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.060]   and passionate to see this invade all aspects
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.960]   of their lives, where they seek to develop
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.680]   an intelligent spiritual faith,
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.100]   rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.
[00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.120]   A church that does not make its Sunday services
[00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.420]   the exclamation mark of its existence,
[00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.640]   but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence,
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.240]   a time of service, love and engagement
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.320]   that inspires and emboldens all equally
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.500]   for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.640]   A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.960]   This is our city.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.460]   This is our church.
[00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.760]   This is our home.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.080]   - Good morning church.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.040]   How's everybody doing?
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.480]   Yeah, give me a wave is good.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.240]   All right, it's all right, okay.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.600]   Thank you for coming to the Vine Yuen Long.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.280]   So good to see you here.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.820]   And it's been, it's really cold outside, isn't it?
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.500]   It's so cold outside and it's cold inside,
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.040]   but you guys still made it to the 1130.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.680]   So give everybody a round of applause.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.760]   The person next to you, well done for being here on time.
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.400]   I struggled to wake up this morning.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.040]   It was too cold.
[00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.400]   But then I was like, ah, I know I'll feel good.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.280]   I know I wanna be here and encounter God today.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.760]   So I hope you feel the same.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.280]   And now I would like to invite all of you
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.040]   to stand please and hello.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:43.740]   In Psalm 63, it says,
[00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.920]   you God are my God.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.960]   Earnestly I seek you.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.400]   I thirst for you.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.280]   My whole being longs for you
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.420]   in a dry and parched land where there's no water.
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.480]   I'm not sure if you have time to kind of have a reflection
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.280]   in the, in 2023, how it's been like.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.040]   Was it a difficult year?
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.000]   Or are you struggling in any areas in your life right now?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.200]   And you struggle to come here and worship,
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.340]   but you still made the decision to come here today.
[00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.280]   And we worship not just in our highs,
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.000]   but we worship in our lows.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.980]   We worship when our life is dry,
[00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.680]   but we wanna thirst for God's love and his presence.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.740]   And in Psalm 63, continue to say,
[00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.360]   I have seen you in the century
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.840]   and beheld your power and your glory
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.840]   because your love is better than life.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.760]   My lips will glorify you.
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.340]   I'll praise you as long as I live.
[00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:47.480]   And in your name, I'll lift up my hands.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:50.760]   Everybody, let us prepare our hearts
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.280]   and encounter God in the spirit.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:55.480]   And Jesus, we welcome you.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.720]   And may you just touch our hearts and speak with us.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.220]   May you just overwhelm this place, Lord.
[00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.920]   And we are here to worship you.
[00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.800]   In Nehemiah 8, 10, it says,
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.980]   "The joy of the Lord is your strength."
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:08.980]   So with that in the mind,
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.980]   let's just raise our voices and worship with joy.
[00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.820]   One, two.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.900]   (upbeat music)

[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:42.960]   with something called liturgy.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.040]   It's a tradition that's been passed down
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.000]   for years in the church.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.960]   This month it's Advent,
[00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:54.400]   and every week we'll have someone come up
[00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:57.360]   and read some scripture and light the candles.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.160]   And today it's the last Sunday of Advent.
[00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:05.200]   These candles represent what Jesus brings to us
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.200]   as he comes on earth, hope, love, joy, and peace.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.960]   And today I would like to invite Edith and Lovely.
[00:18:15.960 --> 00:18:17.320]   Please come on up.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.200]   They will lead us into reading scripture
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:20.360]   and we can respond,
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:23.280]   and they will light the last candle for us today.
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:33.000]   Jesus said, "I am the light of the world.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   "The one who follows me will not walk in darkness,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.320]   "but have the light of life."
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:40.720]   We light this candle as a sign
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:43.220]   of the coming light of Christ.
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:45.800]   (gentle music)
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:54.520]   Arise, shine, for your light has come,
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:56.960]   and the glory of the Lord rises upon you.
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.320]   See, darkness covers the earth,
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:01.920]   and thick darkness is over the peoples,
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:03.800]   but the Lord rises upon you,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.640]   and his glory appears over you.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.560]   Nations will come to your light,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.500]   and kings to the brightness of your dome.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:15.600]   Come, Lord Jesus, our light and fire.
[00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:19.520]   Until that day, let us walk in the light of the Lord.
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:21.320]   Amen.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:22.160]   Amen.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.440]   Thank you.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:25.440]   Let's give them a hand.
[00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.040]   Thank you, Lovely and Edith.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:29.560]   And thank you for our worship team as well,
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.760]   for the lovely worship.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:34.680]   Yeah, let us have a prayer.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.040]   Ooh, you wanna join?
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:37.440]   Yeah, okay.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:38.280]   Let us pray.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:43.840]   Father, we thank you so much for the love you have for us.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.320]   You sent your only son on earth to die for us, for our sin.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:55.220]   You're here to give us hope, joy, peace, and love.
[00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:59.080]   In the world that we're in, in the chaos,
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:00.920]   in the mess that we're in,
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.780]   you're the light in the darkness.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.640]   And you said you're not the only light.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:08.760]   You want us to be the followers of Jesus,
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.920]   also be the light in the world, Lord.
[00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:13.520]   As we prepare to enter Christmas tomorrow,
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.360]   prepare our hearts, Lord, to welcome you, to celebrate you.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   Thank you, Jesus.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.560]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:24.240]   Thank you.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:25.720]   All right, well, I take this time,
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.320]   I wanna welcome everybody.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.240]   Welcome to the Vine Yuen Long again.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.480]   My name is Francesca.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.600]   I'm part of the Vine Yuen Long here.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.560]   I want to give a warm welcome to any first comer,
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:38.200]   any newcomers here today.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:39.640]   Please raise your hand, don't be shy.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.120]   Yay, welcome.
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:43.640]   We have quite a few newcomers.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.040]   All right, welcome to the Vine Yuen Long.
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:49.000]   So great to have you guys here on this very special day.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.020]   So, brothers and sisters who are sitting next to you guys,
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:54.520]   please give them a warm welcome for us,
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.240]   and maybe you can tell them a bit more about us
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.160]   and what we do and our gatherings and all that.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:04.080]   And yeah, so welcome all of you.
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:07.000]   Now, as you see, we have many children here.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.600]   So they're now going to this time of K4C.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.120]   They're gonna have their own worship time
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.360]   and studying the Bible.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.920]   So let us reach our hands
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:17.240]   and just bless all these beautiful children.
[00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:22.120]   Father, thank you so much for,
[00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.240]   you've blessed us with all these beautiful children
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.360]   in our church, Lord, and you love them so much.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.220]   And you love them more than any of us can love them.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:36.240]   And Jesus, I just pray that in the time of K4C
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:38.240]   that they will all encounter you,
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.900]   they will experience your love,
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:43.600]   and that they will grow and that they will learn
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.500]   and build their foundation in who you are and the truth.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:53.160]   Jesus, we also pray and bless all the K4C teachers.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:56.500]   You bless them and just be with them and equip them
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.720]   so that they have a wonderful time with the kids
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.720]   and that they also feel fulfilled
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:02.160]   after the time of K4C.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:05.520]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.400]   All right, so we have zero to two years old.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:12.680]   Parents, you can accompany your kids to over there
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:13.760]   in this room, playroom.
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.760]   And also we have age three to five and six to 12.
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.640]   You can go over to my left side to June.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.120]   And now this is a great opportunity for you
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.560]   to say hello to your friends and neighbors.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.320]   We wanna encourage you to say hello to someone
[00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:28.680]   that you haven't met yet.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:30.400]   So maybe if you don't know what to say,
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.900]   no worry, I got you covered.
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:33.600]   You can maybe ask them,
[00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:36.440]   what do you like to do in Christmas?
[00:22:36.440 --> 00:22:37.980]   All right, let's go.

[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.960]   Okay, now we would like to mix a few announcement
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.280]   before we get into the sermon today.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.480]   First of all, what day is tomorrow?
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.800]   Christmas, yes, Christmas tomorrow.
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.060]   And we have two Christmas services tomorrow,
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:49.120]   which is 9.30 and 11.30, same Cantonese and English.
[00:24:49.120 --> 00:24:52.160]   You're more than welcome to join both services
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.800]   to extend the celebrations.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:56.200]   Why not, right?
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.440]   Now, tomorrow the service is slightly different
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.560]   than what we're doing today,
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:02.320]   'cause it's a special Christmas service.
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.240]   It will be slightly shorter and it's family oriented.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:08.720]   So we welcome all the kids to join us in the service.
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:11.440]   Therefore, there will be no K4C tomorrow, okay?
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.000]   So parents, there's no K4C tomorrow.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.600]   And in the service tomorrow,
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.560]   we have a special event.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:24.400]   We have this drama, it's called the Nativity Play
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:26.360]   that our kids in our church have prepared
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.680]   in the last few weeks.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:29.640]   They have put in a lot of effort
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:31.480]   and a lot of time to prepare for it.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:33.480]   So we welcome all of you to come.
[00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:35.480]   And this is a great opportunity
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:38.360]   for you to invite friends to join us,
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.240]   especially those who don't know Jesus yet.
[00:25:40.240 --> 00:25:42.120]   And kids, you know, invite them and say,
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:43.560]   "Hey, come join us for a play."
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.260]   It'll be a great opportunity tomorrow.
[00:25:45.260 --> 00:25:46.520]   So that'll be that.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.600]   And after the Christmas service is tomorrow,
[00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:50.440]   what do we have?
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.120]   Cookies!
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.400]   Yes, we have, people are like, "Cookies, what?"
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:57.760]   We have the cookies feast.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:59.760]   So it's like a party we wanna have
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:01.040]   right after each service.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.480]   So we do have a bit of time.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.520]   People will bring in cookies and cupcakes.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:09.560]   Some are gonna bake some homemade breads.
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.200]   It's really for us to, you know,
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   spend time with one another and celebrate,
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.140]   not just come here and go.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.720]   So if you're interested,
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.800]   so for those who are gonna bring something,
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.320]   you don't wanna raise your hands.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:21.280]   No worries.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:22.480]   Yeah, oh, that's quite a bit.
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.860]   We're gonna have a lot of food tomorrow.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.400]   For those you haven't raised your hand, don't worry.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:27.240]   You can come eat,
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.880]   or you can also bring in something that you wanna,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:31.640]   you like and you can share with us.
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:34.060]   But we kinda wanna know who's gonna bring what.
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:36.920]   So if you can, after the service,
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:37.760]   can you look for Chairman?
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.080]   Chairman, where are you?
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.280]   Chairman's right there.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:43.200]   So look for him afterwards and tell him,
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.020]   "Oh, actually, I wanna bring this as well."
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.320]   So that he can have some idea in mind
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.580]   what we have tomorrow.
[00:26:48.580 --> 00:26:50.040]   All right, thank you.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.240]   And now we're gonna get into the time of offering.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.000]   Now, offering, it's an act of worship
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.120]   and how we respond to the love of God.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:01.840]   It's an act of faith and it's an act of trust
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.840]   and our love to God.
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.220]   So if this is your first time here,
[00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:10.360]   or you're not sure the meaning of offering,
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:11.260]   please don't feel pressure.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.080]   You can just pass the bucket to the person next to you.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.940]   Yeah, and also we have different methods
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.520]   that you can do your offering as well.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:24.660]   So I'll just let the bucket pass around
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:25.900]   for a little while first.
[00:27:25.900 --> 00:27:29.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:34.560]   ♪ Soon it will be Christmas day ♪
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.780]   ♪ It's almost here ♪

[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:51.540]   Let us pray.
[00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:55.580]   Father God,
[00:27:57.540 --> 00:28:00.260]   you're our life and you're our provider.
[00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:05.100]   And Lord, we just come before you with these offering.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:06.300]   May you just bless it.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.700]   And so that it will turn into blessings
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:15.220]   to different ministries and to other people's life.
[00:28:15.220 --> 00:28:19.440]   And Lord, as we do our offering,
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.680]   it's like we say, Lord, we trust you.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.540]   And we love you, Lord.
[00:28:26.540 --> 00:28:29.300]   And yeah, may you bless it.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.260]   And then you will bless it 10 folds more
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.940]   as we offer to you, Lord.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.140]   And thank you, Jesus.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:38.820]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:43.380]   All right, now we're gonna invite our speaker of today.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:46.500]   And we have Pastor Tim.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:49.100]   Let's give him a big warm welcome.
[00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.620]   All right, all right.
[00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:53.220]   I feel like I wanna stand a bit, so I'm not too sure.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:55.180]   (laughing)
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:28:57.540]   So just, you know, some of you might know,
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.660]   actually, Pastor Ivan was sick yesterday,
[00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:03.100]   and Pastor Tim was also sick for the past couple days.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:06.620]   And it's like, you know, when we wanna do things for God
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:08.740]   and then, you know, the enemy's trying to stop you,
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.580]   but then guess what?
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.060]   Look at him, he looks amazing.
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.540]   And Ivan looks amazing too, where are you, Ivan?
[00:29:13.540 --> 00:29:14.380]   He's somewhere.
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:15.840]   Let's see if he's amazing.
[00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:21.620]   Because they were covering a lot of prayers yesterday
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.520]   so that they can be here today to share the word of God.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.240]   So yeah, I'm glad to see you here.
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.300]   Thank you.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.840]   All right, let us reach our hands and pray for him,
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:30.680]   shall we?
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:34.400]   Jesus, we thank you so much for Tim
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.900]   and how you created him and the heart he has for you.
[00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:43.680]   And Lord, even though he's been struggling with sickness
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.260]   and, you know, the flu that's been around,
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.320]   but Lord, he's here today because he's here
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:50.640]   to share a word and glorify you, Lord.
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.680]   We just pray for your protection over him and his family.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.080]   We pray that you give him strength as he share
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.280]   and that you open all of our hearts to receive the message
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.240]   that you wanna speak to us today.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.920]   And Jesus, we thank you.
[00:30:02.920 --> 00:30:03.880]   Jesus, in we pray.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.520]   Amen, thank you, Francesca.
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.040]   It's so good to see you all.
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:14.120]   Now, I wanna share with you about an experience
[00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.520]   I had about 10 years ago.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.680]   I took a Christmas Bible quiz
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.420]   and I got a really low score.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:26.140]   So this was a little bit traumatizing for me.
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:28.060]   So I had a lot of sleepless nights.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:30.780]   I woke up, there was tears in my eyes thinking of,
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:31.860]   no, not really.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:34.540]   But my score was, I was really shocked
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:37.660]   at how much details of the Christmas story I got wrong.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:41.020]   So I thought it would be fun this morning
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.700]   to do a little Christmas Bible quiz.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.300]   So are you ready for that?
[00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.700]   Come on.
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.220]   I told you I got a bad score.
[00:30:50.220 --> 00:30:52.700]   So you're set up for success.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.740]   Okay, so here's the first question.
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:58.700]   Jesus was born in a stable, true or false?
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.180]   If you think it's true, raise your hand.
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:05.420]   Okay, the answer is false.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:08.900]   The Bible actually doesn't say where Jesus was born.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:10.700]   So that's the first one.
[00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:12.260]   All right, second one.
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:14.580]   There were three wise men who brought gifts
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:18.060]   of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, true or false?
[00:31:18.060 --> 00:31:18.900]   True?
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.300]   False.
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:23.980]   Okay, so that is also false
[00:31:23.980 --> 00:31:26.740]   because it doesn't mention that there was three wise men.
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.900]   Good job, that one, you did good.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.740]   That was good.
[00:31:29.740 --> 00:31:32.300]   The next one.
[00:31:32.300 --> 00:31:35.820]   What animal did Mary ride on
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:38.540]   during the journey from Nazareth to Bethlehem?
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:39.920]   Was it a donkey?
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:44.320]   Was it a mule, a horse, or does the Bible does not say?
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.780]   So if you think it was a donkey, raise your hand.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.820]   If you think it was a mule,
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.300]   if you think it was a horse,
[00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.620]   I'm the only one who thinks it's a horse, okay,
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:31:59.080]   or the Bible does not say?
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:03.460]   The Bible does not say.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:06.140]   It actually doesn't, Mary probably walked.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:09.340]   See, I'm serious.
[00:32:09.340 --> 00:32:13.860]   But a Christmas place always have a donkey
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:15.780]   or a mule in there, right?
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:17.380]   Okay, and here's the fourth one, last one.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.540]   Here's the last one.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:21.540]   Where did the Magi from the East meet Jesus?
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:25.340]   Was it in a cave, in a manger, in a house,
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:26.860]   or the Bible does not say?
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.520]   So the first one is cave.
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:32.700]   Okay, the second one is the manger.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:33.780]   Okay, we got a few.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:35.900]   The house.
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:40.500]   And then the last one, the Bible does not say.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:46.280]   Okay, so the Magi met Jesus in a house.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:49.720]   (congregation exclaims)
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.560]   Because they actually came almost two years
[00:32:52.560 --> 00:32:54.200]   after Jesus was born.
[00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:58.340]   And so Joseph and Mary were living in a house,
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:01.120]   Matthew 2, 11, you can look it up.
[00:33:01.120 --> 00:33:03.440]   So what is, so, okay, I'm curious.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.000]   Who got two or more right?
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.180]   How about three or more?
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:12.080]   What about four out of four?
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:15.240]   Okay, we have one person.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.480]   Congratulations.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:20.720]   We have a Bible scholar among us.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:22.240]   This is great.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:25.480]   So why am I doing this Christmas quiz?
[00:33:25.480 --> 00:33:28.680]   Well, what I wanted to highlight through my own experience,
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.000]   but also I think through our experience
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   right now here together is that our knowledge
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.980]   from Christmas about Jesus,
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.960]   it comes from pop culture, from Christmas plays,
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:44.080]   from tradition, but not really from the Bible account.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:50.720]   And so what happens over time is that these traditions,
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:55.920]   they have made Jesus into someone he is not really.
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:59.560]   They made him meek and mild.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:02.080]   He's baby Jesus.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:07.080]   And it's like, I call it the tamed Jesus.
[00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.620]   It's not the Jesus of scripture.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.960]   Where all the rough edges,
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.960]   all the things that might challenge us,
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:18.480]   what do you call it, sanded off.
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.200]   And so it's this Jesus that we hear
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.880]   and learn about in pop culture,
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:24.940]   but it's not really who Jesus is.
[00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:28.800]   And what I wanna do with you today
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:32.940]   is I wanna take you to some of the birth narratives
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:37.100]   of Jesus where we can get a glimpse of the real Jesus,
[00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.840]   the untamed Jesus,
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:43.840]   the Jesus that has the power to change people's lives,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.220]   that Jesus has the power to turn our lives around,
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:53.060]   and the Jesus that speaks authoritatively
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.940]   yet lovingly into our lives and has something to say to us.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:35:02.100]   And so we're continuing in our message today.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:05.980]   The message series, Christmas.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:08.040]   I hope you've been enjoying it.
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:09.080]   Have you been enjoying it?
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:09.920]   Has it been good?
[00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:10.800]   Yes, okay.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.000]   I think it's been great.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.800]   I've been enjoying it.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:17.240]   And our topic for today is of signs and swords.
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   And so to explain who this untamed Jesus is,
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.200]   the real Jesus,
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:26.640]   I wanna take you to the Gospel of Luke chapter two,
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:30.200]   and starting in verse 25, it says this.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.040]   Now there was a man in Jerusalem called Simeon
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:34.880]   who was righteous and devout.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.440]   He was waiting for the consolation of Israel,
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.600]   and the Holy Spirit was on him.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.680]   It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:46.280]   that he would not die before he had seen the Lord's Messiah.
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:52.640]   Now Luke introduces Simeon as a devout man,
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.120]   and we see this devotion because Simeon is waiting
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.440]   for the consolation of Israel.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.280]   Now what is that?
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.600]   What is the consolation of Israel?
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:04.560]   Well, in the Old Testament,
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.640]   prophet spoke of a time where things in Israel
[00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:10.400]   will be set right,
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:13.120]   where things in Israel will be restored,
[00:36:13.120 --> 00:36:17.040]   where God will bring wholeness to Israel.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.360]   So it's also talking about the Messiah,
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:22.560]   that the Messiah would come,
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:26.560]   the anointed king to set things in order.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:28.760]   And Simeon's devotion is shown
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.040]   that he is patiently waiting for that.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:33.280]   He hasn't given up on that.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.240]   He's an old man at this point in time,
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:36.960]   but he's patiently waiting.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:43.720]   And when we think about wanting things to happen,
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.120]   I don't know about you,
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.160]   but we live in this like immediacy culture, right?
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.480]   Where we want things to happen right away.
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.200]   We don't wanna wait.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.440]   But a lot of times when it comes to the things of God,
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.280]   actually we have to be patient and wait on God's timing.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:01.320]   And so you see Simeon doing this here.
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.280]   Now, another thing we learn about Simeon
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.080]   is that the Holy Spirit was upon him,
[00:37:06.080 --> 00:37:07.880]   which is in the Old Testament,
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:08.880]   of course, we're in the New Testament,
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:11.440]   but it's a way of describing prophets.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:14.160]   So we should understand Simeon as a prophet.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:16.760]   And what we're about to read are some prophetic things
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:17.880]   that Simeon is saying.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:21.720]   But let's continue.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.720]   So verse 27 says this,
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:27.520]   "Moved by the Spirit, he went into the temple courts.
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:31.040]   "When the parents brought the child Jesus
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:34.160]   "to do for him what the custom of the law required."
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:40.800]   So Simeon had been brought by the Spirit into the temple.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.200]   So he's being led by God.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.480]   Jesus' parents are also shown as being devout,
[00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:48.840]   Joseph and Mary,
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.440]   because they're going to the temple,
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.360]   whether it's the eighth day, the naming of Jesus,
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.960]   or whether it's the 40th day
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.160]   of dedicating the firstborn son to God.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:37:59.880]   They're being obedient to God
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:01.360]   by bringing him to the temple.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:04.040]   Let's continue.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:09.880]   So in verse 28 through 33, it says this,
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:13.800]   "Simeon took him by his arms and praised God, saying,
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.720]   "Sovereign Lord, as you have promised,
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.320]   "you may now dismiss your servant in peace.
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.960]   "From my eyes I've seen your salvation,
[00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:27.560]   "which you have prepared in the sight of all nations,
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:30.160]   "a light for revelation to the Gentiles
[00:38:30.160 --> 00:38:33.400]   "and the glory of your people Israel.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:36.080]   "The child's father and mother marveled
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:38.080]   "at what was said about him."
[00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:43.640]   So Simeon takes Jesus in his arms.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.440]   I always wonder in that scene,
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.880]   like, does he explain anything,
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.360]   or do they just let him grab the baby?
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:52.280]   You know, how does that all play out?
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.480]   But he takes Jesus in his arms,
[00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:57.160]   and then he starts to speak prophetically
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.440]   over the identity of who Jesus is.
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:05.440]   And he talks about that Jesus will bring salvation.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.680]   You know, he is the consolation of Israel.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.960]   He is the one who will restore things,
[00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.240]   renew things, and put things into right order.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.320]   And he is not just doing that for Israel,
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.860]   but he's doing that for all people.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:26.820]   And so then we're told that Mary and Joseph,
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.740]   when they hear that, they're marveling.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:31.780]   This is music to their ears.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.820]   I mean, what incredible words spoken over your child.
[00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:37.380]   Amazing.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:39.940]   But now you're wondering,
[00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:41.780]   he talked about untamed Jesus.
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:46.780]   Like, so far, things seem the way we probably know them.
[00:39:46.780 --> 00:39:50.500]   But now we're gonna get into the part
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.300]   that a lot of times is skipped,
[00:39:53.300 --> 00:39:55.420]   or not talked much about,
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:57.980]   and this is the second prophecy of Simeon.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:40:04.340]   And that's where we see a more true picture
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:08.860]   of who Jesus is, and how people relate to Jesus.
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:11.300]   So let's look at that.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:15.260]   So up until now, Mary, this was music to her ears,
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:17.660]   but the next words are actually hard.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:19.740]   Verse 34, let's continue.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:21.300]   It says, "Then Simeon blessed them
[00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.980]   "and said to Mary, his mother,
[00:40:22.980 --> 00:40:25.140]   "'This child is destined,
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.700]   "'the cause of falling and the rising of many in Israel,
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:34.140]   "'and to be a sign that people will be spoken against,
[00:40:34.140 --> 00:40:36.940]   "'so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed,
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.740]   "'and a sword will pierce your own soul too.'"
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:44.780]   Wow, what just happened?
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:47.580]   This was like positive news beforehand, right?
[00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:51.460]   And then now suddenly there's some heavy words spoken
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:54.740]   over Jesus, and over Mary as well.
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:58.020]   We're not told how Mary responds,
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.580]   but we can only imagine that's a lot of the process
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:03.540]   and the take in, and try to understand and make sense of.
[00:41:03.540 --> 00:41:07.940]   So let's unpack the second prophecy.
[00:41:07.940 --> 00:41:10.300]   Let's take a closer look at what this is talking about
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:11.220]   and what it means.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:15.380]   Just to give the big picture,
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.100]   basically this is about the rejection,
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.100]   how people will reject Jesus.
[00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:24.060]   How there will be some who accept him,
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:27.460]   but how a lot will reject the salvation that he will bring.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.900]   But let's look a little bit at it in more detail.
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.500]   So we're told that Jesus' destiny calls the falling
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:37.700]   and the rising of many, and that he will be a sign
[00:41:37.700 --> 00:41:41.100]   that will be spoken against so that the thoughts
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:42.900]   of many hearts will be revealed.
[00:41:44.660 --> 00:41:47.780]   So whereas the falling and the rising speaks of,
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:50.380]   you know, the falling is rejection,
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.380]   the rising is accepting Jesus,
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:57.260]   but then the second part, that be a sign
[00:41:57.260 --> 00:41:59.780]   that will be spoken against is just rejection.
[00:41:59.780 --> 00:42:04.180]   But it also shows how we relate to Jesus,
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:10.100]   how we treat him reveals what's in our hearts,
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:13.260]   and how we relate to God, 'cause Jesus is God with us.
[00:42:14.580 --> 00:42:16.940]   Now I wanna especially focus on unpacking the imagery
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:19.340]   of falling and rising, which often is used
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:24.140]   in the New Testament to describe responses to Jesus.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.820]   So Simeon is drawing on this familiar image
[00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:29.380]   that you find throughout the Old Testament,
[00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:31.980]   and also the New Testament as well.
[00:42:31.980 --> 00:42:36.980]   And it's that of a cornerstone that some accept
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:42.660]   and they receive salvation, and some reject,
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:44.460]   and it's their stumbling stone.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.780]   So in Isaiah 8, verse 14, it says this.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:54.220]   He will be a holy place for both Israel and Judah.
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:57.100]   He will be a stone that causes people to stumble,
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:59.540]   and a rock that makes them fall.
[00:42:59.540 --> 00:43:01.020]   And for the people of Jerusalem,
[00:43:01.020 --> 00:43:03.060]   he will be a trap and a snare.
[00:43:03.060 --> 00:43:06.620]   Isaiah 28, 16 says this.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:09.260]   So this is what the sovereign Lord says.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:12.220]   See I lay a stone in Zion, a tested stone,
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:15.780]   a precious cornerstone for a sure foundation.
[00:43:15.780 --> 00:43:19.820]   The one who relies on it will never be stricken with panic.
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:23.460]   And then Psalm 118, verse 22.
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.620]   The stone the builders rejected
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.900]   has become the cornerstone.
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:33.140]   So the falling and rising response
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:36.500]   to people reacting to Jesus differently.
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:42.960]   Those who are falling, they are rejecting who Jesus is,
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:48.240]   and they're not receiving him.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.720]   And they ultimately fall,
[00:43:49.720 --> 00:43:51.880]   and there is experience of judgment.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.960]   And those who are rising are open to Jesus,
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.960]   you know, accept him, place their faith in the cornerstone,
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:02.000]   and experience salvation.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:06.400]   Now the reality is we go between rising and falling
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.520]   a lot of times.
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:12.840]   So for example, Apostle Paul, he was falling.
[00:44:12.840 --> 00:44:16.240]   He was persecuting Christians.
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:17.240]   He was going after them.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.360]   He was even involved, you know,
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.560]   whether actively or just as a bystander,
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:24.880]   in that way supporting of people being,
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.720]   Christians being killed.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:28.700]   Stephen, in Acts.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:33.880]   But then he had a Jesus encounter
[00:44:33.880 --> 00:44:35.620]   on the road to Damascus.
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:38.820]   And he was blinded,
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:43.820]   but God got his attention.
[00:44:43.820 --> 00:44:47.340]   And he went from falling to rising
[00:44:47.340 --> 00:44:49.300]   and to being open and accepting Jesus,
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:52.980]   being one of the great proclaimers,
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.700]   you know, in early Christian movement of Jesus,
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.420]   and establishing churches and planting churches.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.660]   And so for us, there might also be seasons
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.300]   where we have been open to Jesus,
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.140]   but never really reach a conclusion about him.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.540]   And then where we were rejecting Jesus for a season,
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:12.940]   and maybe we're open again.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:16.620]   So we move between this rising and falling.
[00:45:16.620 --> 00:45:26.260]   But Jesus, he has come to stake out the claim
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:30.700]   that he is King of Kings, Lord of Lords.
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:34.080]   Jesus polarizes his contemporaries.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:37.440]   There were those who wanted to kill him,
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.000]   and they eventually did,
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.360]   they nailed him to the cross.
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.960]   And there are those who believe that Jesus is the Messiah,
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:47.640]   the Son of God, and who received him as that.
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:51.240]   Now what you see in the Bible,
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:52.860]   what you don't see in the Bible,
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.320]   is people simply saying, oh, he was a good teacher.
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.580]   He was a nice guy.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:02.200]   There is not such a mild response to Jesus.
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.200]   Now people react strongly one way or the other to him,
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.960]   'cause Jesus did not leave that option open
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:11.880]   to just treat him as, oh, he's a nice guy,
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.600]   with the things that he said, the things that he proclaimed.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:19.840]   So he was polarizing, of course, with a purpose,
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.840]   not just not to antagonize, but because he had come,
[00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:27.400]   you know, was on a rescue mission to save and deliver.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.560]   And a lot of times when we need rescuing,
[00:46:29.560 --> 00:46:31.280]   we actually need a shaking up,
[00:46:31.280 --> 00:46:32.880]   otherwise we don't get it.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:35.600]   So Jesus came to shake things up
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:37.840]   and to be very clear about who he is.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:45.080]   The only way to, or if Simeon's prophetic bird is correct,
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:48.980]   if Jesus came to polarize people to cause some to rise
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.840]   and some to fall, why is it that most people today
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:54.640]   don't seem to be rising and falling?
[00:46:54.640 --> 00:47:00.440]   Why don't people today have the polarized response to Jesus?
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.440]   Well, I think for one, if people never have heard of Jesus,
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:06.560]   obviously, how can you have response to it?
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:10.520]   But part of it is what I brought up earlier,
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.280]   where we have tamed Jesus.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:17.280]   We have a wrong image of who Jesus is, not the real Jesus.
[00:47:17.280 --> 00:47:22.360]   And that Jesus is fiction.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.520]   You know, they have become to believe in a version of Jesus,
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:28.640]   one that, you know, Christmas plays and traditions
[00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.000]   and pop culture give us.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:35.040]   People only want to believe that Jesus was a nice guy,
[00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.480]   a good teacher, and a man with moral principles.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:43.320]   We try to make Jesus into something we can manage
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:47.560]   that fits neatly into our lives,
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.080]   so that we can be in control
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.120]   and just call him when we need him,
[00:47:53.120 --> 00:47:55.600]   but not deal with Jesus at another point in time.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.560]   So we don't really want to deal with Jesus' claims
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.040]   about his identity.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.720]   We want Jesus on our terms.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:05.160]   This is true for Christians as well,
[00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:07.840]   whether you're a Christian or not a Christian.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:10.640]   Everybody does this at one point or another.
[00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:17.120]   But there is no historical evidence of a Jesus
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.040]   that was just a good teacher.
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:23.320]   The Bible gives us a different picture.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:25.360]   Now, there's a famous Oxford scholar
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:28.160]   from the 20th century called C.S. Lewis,
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:30.360]   and he has a quote that I want to read to you.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.000]   "I'm trying here to prevent anyone saying
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   "the really foolish thing that people often say about him.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:41.760]   "I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher,
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:44.240]   "but I don't accept his claims to be God.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:47.680]   "That is the one thing we must not say.
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:50.600]   "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:53.920]   "that Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher.
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:57.440]   "He would either be a lunatic on the level of the man
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.360]   "who thinks he's a poached egg,
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:02.480]   "or else he would be the devil of hell.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.840]   "You must make your choice.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.040]   "Either this man was and is the son of God,
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:10.800]   "or else a madman or something worse.
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:14.840]   "You can't shut him up for a fool.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.560]   "You can't spit on him and kill him as a demon,
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.680]   "or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:26.000]   "But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.720]   "about his being a great human teacher.
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.200]   "He has not left that open to us.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.840]   "He did not intend to."
[00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:39.120]   And so I wonder if some of us today,
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:43.040]   if we've been preferring this tamed Jesus
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:46.120]   that C.S. Lewis just talked about is not an option,
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.520]   where we keep Jesus at arm length in our life,
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.720]   at arm length in our life,
[00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:54.760]   because we don't really want him to break into lives,
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.480]   to speak into our lives.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:50:10.880]   But Jesus, this Jesus is an idol.
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:12.440]   You know, this is not a real thing.
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.440]   We create Jesus basically in our own image,
[00:50:14.440 --> 00:50:16.000]   the way we want Jesus to be.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.880]   But it's not the Jesus of Scripture,
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:22.440]   not the one who fiercely loves us,
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:24.280]   who lays down his life for us,
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:28.120]   who is worth sacrificing for, giving our lives for.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.960]   But the real Jesus, the untamed Jesus
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.800]   that Simeon Prophetic spoke of
[00:50:33.800 --> 00:50:36.600]   causes the falling and rising of people.
[00:50:36.600 --> 00:50:39.480]   He has the power to transform your life.
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:43.040]   He is a son of God, King of kings and Lord of lords.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.000]   The real Jesus influences our decisions,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.040]   choices of friends and behavior,
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.640]   and stirs in us a desire to live sacrificially,
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:55.040]   to contribute to the well-being
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:58.520]   and flourishing of those around us.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:51:00.160]   That's what real Jesus does.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:05.160]   He speaks powerfully into our lives.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:11.780]   The real Jesus is worthy of our adoration,
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:14.840]   worship, obedience, and sacrifice.
[00:51:15.840 --> 00:51:18.160]   He's not a nice to have.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:20.920]   He's essential.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:22.500]   He's King of kings.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:27.000]   He deserves our worship.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:31.600]   So accepting Jesus into our lives
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:34.760]   is not a guarantee of perfect days ahead
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.080]   and an easy road in life.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:42.000]   Now sometimes we give the impression as pastors
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.840]   that if you become a Jesus follower,
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:45.680]   you will never have a problem again.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:50.040]   Now Jesus blesses us incredibly,
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.840]   and he loves us perfectly,
[00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:56.360]   but it does not mean that there is not challenges
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.100]   that we face or that he allows for us to go through.
[00:51:59.100 --> 00:52:02.440]   Now as a Christian,
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.360]   we often find ourselves at a crossroad.
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:07.980]   Do we choose comfort and convenience,
[00:52:07.980 --> 00:52:11.440]   or do we choose obedience to Jesus?
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.040]   When you obey Jesus, there might be a cost,
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:17.200]   the loss of money, the loss of a job,
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:21.240]   the loss of previous plans, the loss of reputation,
[00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.220]   the loss of a relationship.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:29.480]   And Jesus, even today, he speaks challenging things to us,
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:33.240]   calling us to difficult tasks
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:35.640]   like mediating a conflict
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.640]   that you'd rather not get involved in,
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:40.760]   forgiving someone who has hurt you,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.000]   loving our enemies,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:50.240]   standing up for something that is not right
[00:52:50.240 --> 00:52:52.840]   in your company, your organization,
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:55.800]   and being willing to potentially lose your job,
[00:52:55.800 --> 00:53:01.120]   leading into a conflict and working towards reconciliation.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:07.200]   In a previous role in a church when I was a senior pastor,
[00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:09.140]   I had a leaders meeting,
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.840]   and somebody just started laying into me,
[00:53:13.840 --> 00:53:18.840]   "Your sermons suck, your preaching sucks,
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.040]   "you're not inspiring, the way you handled it."
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:28.040]   I mean, just went off for 10 minutes,
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.840]   and it was so hard, I got a little bit defensive
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:32.560]   because it was so strong.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:33.800]   I tried not to be,
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:37.280]   but then other people started getting defensive for me.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:43.200]   And my human reaction, the comfortable reaction,
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.000]   would be, "Well, if it's so bad, why don't you just leave?"
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.040]   But of course that's not what Jesus asked me to do.
[00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:54.840]   He asked me to lean in, to go to the person,
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:57.400]   to understand what's on the person's heart,
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:54:00.280]   to communicate that how this person communicated
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:02.040]   was not a way that I could receive it
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:05.200]   or anyone could receive it, and do that hard work.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:07.320]   And that was very difficult.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:11.040]   So Jesus, he calls us to do difficult things,
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.600]   but they are always good.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.440]   When he asks us to do something difficult,
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.980]   God is always working through that in us and through it.
[00:54:18.980 --> 00:54:25.000]   Maybe that also means standing up for someone
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.280]   when no one else does.
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:31.480]   Giving sacrificially of your time to a person in need,
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:33.200]   even if it's really difficult.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.000]   If Jesus is just at arm's length and a nice to have,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.360]   why would you do that?
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:42.760]   But if Jesus is your Lord and he asks you to do it,
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.200]   we say, "Yes, Lord."
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:53.560]   Or waiting on God to do something that he has promised us
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:58.080]   and waiting on his timing and not on our own timing.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:01.560]   'Cause a lot of times, I mean, I'm the same way.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:03.720]   I want things to happen right now.
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:06.280]   But sometimes God asks us to wait patiently,
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:08.040]   to trust him, to rely on him,
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:12.840]   and to just keep coming to him with whatever is going on
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.740]   and asking him for grace and strength.
[00:55:14.740 --> 00:55:18.400]   And he gives us the grace and strength.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:25.320]   Now, in the early 2000s, I was attending a church.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.280]   I was working at Morgan Stanley.
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:30.080]   I was a businessman at the time.
[00:55:31.160 --> 00:55:34.200]   And there was three services in a row
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:36.640]   where they had missionaries share, and it was so powerful.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:40.160]   And I was so moved after every Sunday.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.800]   I had like tears flowing down my eyes,
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:45.240]   which was not my normal response to a sermon at that time.
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.520]   So after the second Sunday, I was like,
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.480]   "Is God trying to tell me something?"
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.320]   And then on the third Sunday,
[00:55:51.320 --> 00:55:56.240]   I realized that God was calling me to do something else,
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:58.180]   that there was a change of plans,
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:01.640]   and that I needed to act right away.
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:05.120]   So that night, I went into my office,
[00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:07.240]   I cleared out my office.
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:08.960]   And then the next day,
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:12.520]   I went with jeans and a t-shirt to my boss,
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:15.360]   and I told him that God had called me
[00:56:15.360 --> 00:56:21.360]   to do something for him, and that I had to quit my job.
[00:56:21.360 --> 00:56:27.660]   To my surprise, my boss commended my courage for doing that.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:29.560]   He also told me not to show up
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.760]   at a different investment firm anytime soon,
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:37.200]   because they invested a lot of resources in me,
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.360]   you know, with licenses and all that stuff.
[00:56:39.360 --> 00:56:43.880]   Now, this was not what I had planned.
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:44.960]   This was not my plan.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.620]   I never planned to be a pastor.
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:49.720]   Or at that time, I just knew God wanted me,
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.120]   I didn't even know exactly what.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:56.340]   And then suddenly I found myself in this mess,
[00:56:56.340 --> 00:56:58.440]   'cause I quit my job.
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:56:59.700]   I don't know exactly what I'm doing.
[00:56:59.700 --> 00:57:02.800]   I told my parents, ooh.
[00:57:02.800 --> 00:57:06.560]   Yeah, my parents, you make a big mistake.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:07.960]   Why didn't you stay there?
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:11.160]   I knew, that's why I didn't ask my parents beforehand,
[00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:12.720]   because I knew what they would say.
[00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.880]   (audience laughing)
[00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.000]   But my prayer was that they would come around,
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.760]   that they would understand,
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.960]   that they could see that God had called me.
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:23.280]   And then I ended up, in the meantime,
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:26.380]   as I was applying to different roles and things,
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:28.460]   I took a job at an old company
[00:57:28.460 --> 00:57:30.640]   that I worked for in a lot lower position.
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:34.460]   And I even wondered, God, did I make a mistake?
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:37.020]   Did I hear you wrongly?
[00:57:37.020 --> 00:57:41.500]   But I ended up joining Mercy Ships, a medical mission ship.
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:44.580]   I did a discipleship training school with them
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:46.420]   for five months in West Africa.
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:48.920]   They do life-saving surgeries,
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.900]   bringing hope and healing through their practical work,
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:53.820]   but also through sharing the gospel.
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.380]   I helped out in the finance department
[00:57:55.380 --> 00:57:56.780]   and also had that schooling.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:00.620]   And for me, even though it was messy,
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:02.180]   when Jesus calls us to do things,
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.620]   a lot of times they're messy.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:08.820]   There's a season where stuff gets stirred up,
[00:58:08.820 --> 00:58:10.700]   but it is always good.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:13.960]   God always has a good reason and a good purpose for it.
[00:58:13.960 --> 00:58:17.220]   And for me, this is like my key turning point,
[00:58:17.220 --> 00:58:20.260]   where Jesus set me on a different trajectory,
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:24.140]   because he had different plans for my life
[00:58:24.140 --> 00:58:26.540]   than I had come up with on my own.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:28.540]   I wanted to be successful in business.
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.100]   My father was successful.
[00:58:30.100 --> 00:58:32.220]   I wanted to be like him in this way.
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.620]   But Jesus had a different plan for me.
[00:58:34.620 --> 00:58:36.900]   So this is what happens when the real Jesus
[00:58:36.900 --> 00:58:39.460]   enters your life and is Lord of your life.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:41.460]   He speaks into your life.
[00:58:41.460 --> 00:58:43.580]   He calls you to obedience.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:48.060]   And Jesus comes into our lives and turns things upside down.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:53.060]   This is messy, but it always is designed to bring life.
[00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:57.560]   Jesus is working out his good purposes in us and through us.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:59:02.900]   I'll just think also when the Holy Spirit
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:04.340]   confronts us in sin,
[00:59:04.340 --> 00:59:09.780]   when he asks us to stop watching pornography
[00:59:09.780 --> 00:59:14.180]   or to stop cheating on our taxes or whatever it is.
[00:59:14.180 --> 00:59:18.180]   You know, it's not nice to be confronted in those things.
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:20.620]   And it always is messy.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:24.500]   But when we repent and we do what Jesus asks us to do,
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.640]   he brings wholeness.
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:27.480]   He brings life.
[00:59:27.480 --> 00:59:28.580]   He does something good.
[00:59:28.580 --> 00:59:35.220]   But that only happens when Jesus is Lord of your life,
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.120]   when you give him that space to speak that way
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.700]   into your life.
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:41.620]   But a lot of times we love keeping Jesus at arm's length
[00:59:41.620 --> 00:59:43.180]   'cause we wanna be in control.
[00:59:43.180 --> 00:59:46.020]   (breathes deeply)
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:51.980]   Now, receiving difficult tasks,
[00:59:51.980 --> 00:59:53.380]   you know, to stand up in your company
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:56.260]   for something that's wrong or that changed a career
[00:59:56.260 --> 01:00:00.340]   or to lean into a difficult conversation
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:02.840]   with somebody who has not treated you very nicely.
[01:00:02.840 --> 01:00:06.420]   You know, that's uneasy to get that sort of news
[01:00:06.420 --> 01:00:07.300]   and direction.
[01:00:07.300 --> 01:00:11.040]   And involves not just joy,
[01:00:11.040 --> 01:00:13.420]   but there are also some pain in there.
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:16.700]   Just imagine how Mary must have felt
[01:00:16.700 --> 01:00:21.360]   when Simeon was speaking those prophetic words over her
[01:00:21.360 --> 01:00:22.540]   and in Jesus.
[01:00:22.540 --> 01:00:28.400]   He said, "And a sword will pierce your own soul too."
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.160]   That is Simeon's prophetic word over Mary.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.320]   Now, what does that mean?
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:38.680]   Well, it's not a physical sword, but a metaphorical sword
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:44.140]   where she will experience pain
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:47.300]   because her son Jesus is being rejected
[01:00:47.300 --> 01:00:48.900]   and because she sees him suffer.
[01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:52.660]   You know, that's not an easy burden to carry.
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:56.780]   But at the same time, Simeon also had revealed,
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:58.180]   and in other settings as well,
[01:00:58.180 --> 01:01:03.180]   that Jesus was the consolation of Israel,
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:06.060]   the Messiah who would bring salvation to all people.
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.160]   So even though there is suffering,
[01:01:09.160 --> 01:01:13.500]   there's also joy in knowing what God is doing.
[01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:15.500]   And if God calls you to do something,
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:17.940]   he gives you the grace and the strength to do it.
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:20.940]   He never asks you to do something that you cannot do.
[01:01:20.940 --> 01:01:22.660]   He doesn't set you up for failure.
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:27.780]   He gave Mary the grace and the strength to do it.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:30.140]   He gave me the grace and strength to do it,
[01:01:30.140 --> 01:01:32.180]   to go through a messy transition.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:35.080]   And God will give you the grace and the strength
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.980]   to go through it when you're obedient,
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:38.100]   when he's leading you.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.260]   He will provide for you.
[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.180]   And it is always for the good.
[01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:48.860]   You know, God has good plans and a good purpose for you.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:52.660]   But if we block him out of our lives
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:54.740]   or keep him so far away,
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.840]   you know, we're keeping Jesus
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:01:58.580]   from doing that work in our lives.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:09.160]   I wanna right now invite the worship team to come up.
[01:02:09.160 --> 01:02:14.580]   Now, some of us, you know,
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:17.600]   we have been keeping Jesus at arm's length.
[01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:23.920]   We have bought into whether we purposefully wanted to,
[01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.460]   into this tamed Jesus that we can control,
[01:02:28.460 --> 01:02:30.940]   that is only a nice to have when we need him.
[01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:32.920]   We call him like a magic genie.
[01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:37.320]   You know, help us and give us what we need.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:41.240]   But we have not surrendered all areas
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:42.840]   of our lives to Jesus.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:47.020]   But Jesus deserves our all.
[01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:50.040]   He wants your whole heart.
[01:02:50.040 --> 01:02:52.440]   He doesn't just want a little part of your life.
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:57.760]   He wants, he wants all of your heart.
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:04.200]   And whatever Jesus does is always for the good.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.440]   And so my question is,
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:10.440]   are you giving him room to speak into your life,
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:13.880]   to speak words of encouragement,
[01:03:13.880 --> 01:03:16.640]   to speak words of direction,
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.740]   to speak words of correction as well?
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:24.760]   You know, are you giving Jesus that space in your life?
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:29.720]   And when we give Jesus that space in our lives,
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.080]   this is the real Jesus,
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:33.160]   the one who turns our lives around,
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:36.600]   who takes our broken lives, our messy lives,
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:38.840]   and who turns them into something beautiful,
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.360]   who lets us know that he loves us,
[01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.320]   that he has perfect plans for us,
[01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:47.040]   and who works them out in our lives
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.640]   in a way we can't even imagine or dream of.
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:53.520]   But that doesn't mean that every part is always easy.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.000]   It does get messy.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.920]   So what I wanna do, I wanna invite you all to stand.
[01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.560]   And if you, whether it's for the first time
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:08.440]   or today again,
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:12.200]   want to make yourselves available to Jesus and say,
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:14.160]   Jesus, I don't wanna cut you out of my life
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.040]   or certain parts of my life.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:16.520]   I want all of you.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.000]   I want you to speak into my life.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.120]   I want you to mess things up
[01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.880]   where things need to be shaken up,
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:25.640]   where you have something better than what is there.
[01:04:25.640 --> 01:04:27.520]   Then I wanna encourage you to stretch out your hands,
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.960]   and I would just love to pray over you.
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:30.960]   So you stretch out your hands
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:34.120]   as a symbol of just wanting to receive from Jesus right now.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:40.640]   Jesus, I thank you so much that you love us so much
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.560]   that you don't just let us be,
[01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:47.920]   but that you have come here to reveal who you are
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:51.240]   so that we can know that you love us,
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.000]   you have come to shake us up in areas
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.360]   where we're living in brokenness
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:57.520]   or we're heading in directions
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.720]   where you have something else for us.
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:01.080]   I wanna pray right now
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.200]   for those who are stretching out their hands
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:07.960]   that you, yeah, as a surrendering you, Lord,
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.360]   we know that honors you.
[01:05:09.360 --> 01:05:11.240]   Will you meet them?
[01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:15.720]   Will you speak words of life, of encouragement,
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:18.640]   of goodness and direction, correction,
[01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:21.760]   whatever it is that they need, that we need, Lord.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:24.040]   Will you speak those words to us?
[01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.200]   And will you shake things up?
[01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:29.280]   And will you bring what is good, what is life,
[01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.840]   what is beautiful?
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:33.960]   'Cause you are working, you are stirring, you're moving.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   And Lord, I ask that you forgive us
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:38.320]   where we've cut you out of our lives.
[01:05:38.320 --> 01:05:40.120]   Also pray for those who've been struggling
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:42.840]   with strongholds for a long time,
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.440]   or rather just seem to not be getting out of patterns
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:46.280]   of brokenness.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.360]   Lord, I pray that in your power and by your name, Jesus,
[01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:51.000]   you break chains right now,
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.280]   that you break those addictions,
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.000]   that you break those areas
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.520]   where we just keep living in sin,
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.720]   that you bring us into your beautiful life,
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:04.160]   into your holiness, into your righteousness.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:07.320]   So we thank you, we love you, and we worship you.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:09.720]   And I pray all this in your name, Jesus, amen.
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:23.760]   Sing this out.

[01:10:25.280 --> 01:10:28.680]   that not only we'll get into celebrations,

[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:46.200]   Help us to be the light in the world, Lord.
[01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:50.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, together we say, amen.
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.600]   Thank you, let's give a hand to God
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:57.360]   and for everyone for being here today.
