1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Amen.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,000
 Thank you.

4
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,000
 Hello, church.

5
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:05,000
 Hello.

6
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,000
 Hello.

7
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,740
 If you're watching online as well, so pleased that you're joining us.

8
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,160
 It's great that every week we have this contingent that join us online.

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,880
 And so I just want to also give a shout out to Michael.

10
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,540
 Michael is part of our community and he is in hospital at the moment.

11
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,080
 And he has been in hospital for a long, long time battling a horrendous disease, but he

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,300
 is battling it and he's not doing it alone.

13
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:35,120
 We as a community continue to pray for you and Heather and Ben and Nathan.

14
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,180
 Isn't it beautiful that as a community, we are able to come together in those special

15
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,920
 moments and pray.

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,360
 That's what being the body of Christ is all about.

17
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,280
 And I love the fact that, you know, Ellison takes a massive chance.

18
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,040
 I mean, really, what if nobody had come forward?

19
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,580
 That would have been okay as well, right?

20
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,760
 Because sometimes, you know, we're battling things and there's no way we're coming out

21
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,720
 front, but really honor the fact that we are a community that are willing to lean in and

22
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
 pray for each other.

23
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,760
 And you know, we have been looking at the book of James these number of weeks, and really

24
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,480
 that reminds us once again, that our faith cannot just be something that is in our mind,

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,360
 but it has to be within our action.

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,560
 That is all about the book of James.

27
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,440
 James is very clear about that.

28
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,480
 We have to have a radical faith.

29
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,080
 We have to have an obedience to God, and it's a challenge.

30
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,200
 And I think, you know, when I read the book of James, sometimes I'm like, "Oh, he's pretty

31
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,200
 direct.

32
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,680
 He's got some hard words to say to us."

33
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,780
 But you know, he has an expectation.

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:53,200
 He expects us, if we are going to choose to follow Jesus, he expects us to live differently.

35
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:59,600
 And as he was talking to his readers, you know, he was calling them out in this.

36
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,040
 So we're looking through chapter four today.

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,560
 We're looking through verses one to 10, and we are going to be encouraged to really submit

38
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,960
 to God in all areas of our lives, but also encouraged to know that, you know, when we

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:23,120
 fall short of that, which we do, that we are reassured that we have incredible grace from

40
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,120
 God.

41
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,360
 There's this clear instruction from James that you cannot be friends with the world

42
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,080
 and God, but at the same time, there's this beautiful invitation to draw close to God

43
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,520
 and a promise that he draws close to us.

44
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,800
 And we'll know what victory means over things in our life that try to draw us away from

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
 God.

46
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,120
 Now I think we can sometimes read the letter of James and kind of see it as a telling off,

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:04,760
 but rather I hope through these number of weeks, we actually see just how much God truly

48
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,800
 loves us through the letter of James.

49
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:16,680
 So let's dive in straight, directly, as ever with James chapter four.

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,240
 What causes fights and quarrels among you?

51
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:23,000
 Don't they come from the desires that battle within you?

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,960
 You desire, but you do not have, so you kill.

53
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:31,760
 You covet, but you cannot get what you want, so you quarrel and fight.

54
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
 You do not have because you do not ask God.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,440
 When you ask, you do not receive because you ask with wrong motives that you may spend

56
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,960
 what you get on your pleasures.

57
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:46,080
 You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world means enmity against

58
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,080
 God?

59
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,080
 Therefore, anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.

60
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,760
 Or do you think scripture says without reason that he jealously longs for the spirit he

61
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,400
 has caused to dwell in us?

62
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,680
 Ooh, James.

63
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,920
 So let's stop there for a moment to try and understand, okay, what is James saying and

64
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
 why?

65
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,920
 Remember, James is talking to the believers, those that have chosen to follow the way,

66
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:20,640
 those that have chosen to follow Jesus, and many have been scattered all over Asia Minor

67
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,640
 and beyond.

68
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:28,240
 So they're not only facing persecution for their new faith, but they were clearly facing

69
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,680
 some external challenges amongst themselves.

70
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,800
 There's infighting and disagreements driven by a selfish ambition.

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:46,960
 So James was addressing what he saw as an outward expression of inward struggles.

72
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,440
 He refers to the battles within, their motives and how they were affecting their relationship

73
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,200
 with God, but also with each other.

74
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:03,920
 And I believe that these outward expressions of an inward struggle are relevant for us

75
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:06,560
 today.

76
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:14,800
 Now I imagine that the majority of us in this room are Christians, you chose to follow Jesus,

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,240
 but there will be some that maybe are on a journey of discovery, maybe in this room or

78
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:25,080
 watching online, where you're asking the question, who is Jesus?

79
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:32,760
 And I want to encourage you that this inward and outward struggle is relevant to you too.

80
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,280
 And I hope that this message will stir something within you as you continue to journey in the

81
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:44,440
 discovery of knowing who Jesus is.

82
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:50,200
 So when we make a decision to follow Jesus, we are choosing to say goodbye to the old

83
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:54,680
 way of life, embrace a different way of living.

84
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,960
 But if we're honest, sometimes that's really hard.

85
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,280
 How often do we find ourselves acting out in ways that align more with the world than

86
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,280
 they do with the values of Jesus?

87
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:14,000
 And it can sometimes feel like we're being pulled in two different directions.

88
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,480
 That tension James is talking about is related to our relationship with the world and our

89
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,880
 relationship with God.

90
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,840
 Now when I talk about the world, I'm not talking about the people, I'm talking about the systems,

91
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,840
 the values, the desires that drive our decisions and our actions.

92
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,920
 And as James mentions later in this chapter, we're also talking about spiritual forces,

93
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:46,080
 those that are working against us and working against God.

94
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,680
 So this idea of being pulled this way and that way is captured really well by the apostle

95
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,640
 Paul in his letter to the Romans.

96
00:06:53,640 --> 00:07:00,320
 He says this, "I do not understand what I do, but what I want to do I do not do, but

97
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:03,040
 what I hate I do."

98
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,040
 You know, I love that.

99
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,600
 Am I the only one that loves that?

100
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,160
 I mean, I'm so glad that that verse is in the Bible and it was the apostle Paul who

101
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,960
 said it.

102
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:20,080
 Our natural inclination tends to be towards the things of the world that cause and can

103
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,320
 lead us into sin.

104
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:27,640
 And this idea that we cannot be friends with the world and friends with God is captured

105
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,760
 throughout scripture.

106
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:40,520
 You see, the world, its systems, the spiritual forces around us are in opposition to God.

107
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,320
 And Jesus himself taught clearly.

108
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,000
 He said, "No one can serve two masters.

109
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,640
 Either you will hate the one and love the other.

110
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:52,200
 You'll be devoted to one and despise the other.

111
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:57,960
 But you cannot serve both God and mammon, money and materials."

112
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,440
 And then he said, "If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first.

113
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,400
 If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own.

114
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,360
 As it is, you do not belong to the world.

115
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:16,880
 But I have chosen you out of the world, and that is why the world hates you."

116
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:21,600
 And he prayed, Jesus prayed to his father and he said, "I have given them," followers

117
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:26,800
 of Jesus at that time, "and for us now, your word.

118
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,560
 And the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the

119
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,560
 world.

120
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:38,240
 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world, but that you protect them from

121
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,120
 the evil one.

122
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,880
 They are not of the world, even as I am not of it."

123
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,320
 And John says, "Do not love the world or anything in the world.

124
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,720
 If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in them."

125
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,680
 So I think it's pretty clear, right?

126
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,480
 The theologian and scholar N.T.

127
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,060
 Wright puts it this way, "Christianity is a way of seeing the world.

128
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:13,880
 It is a way of being in the world and a way of acting in the world grounded in the story

129
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,320
 of Jesus."

130
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,960
 So as Christians, our way in the world must be different.

131
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:29,280
 Gossiping about our colleagues over yum cha with friends as believers, we choose not to.

132
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:35,880
 The last elderly person on the bus with no seat, as believers, we give up our seat for

133
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,240
 them.

134
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:42,920
 Invited to a boys or girls weekend away where we know there will be strip bars as part of

135
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,960
 the entertainment, as believers, we choose not to go or we choose to go but we hold strong

136
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,480
 boundaries while we are away so we do not join activities that do not honor God and

137
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,600
 do not honor others.

138
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,880
 A colleague has a large hospital bill and they're struggling to pay, and you know that

139
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:13,520
 as believers, we anonymously give generously because we can.

140
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,680
 Our tax bill is due, yikes.

141
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:23,520
 As believers, we pay without trying to distort the numbers.

142
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:31,540
 A colleague is promoted over you, even though you're better qualified, more experienced.

143
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:40,340
 As believers, we refuse to allow disappointment to take root, cause bitterness, and instead,

144
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,280
 we congratulate them.

145
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:49,900
 And I'm sure you can think of multiple other experiences, examples within your own context.

146
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:55,260
 When our faith is deep, grounded in scripture and our relationship with God, we'll find

147
00:10:55,260 --> 00:11:04,300
 ourselves naturally wanting to act differently, different to how the world would act.

148
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:08,220
 We don't do this simply because we want to be different, because it's our faith that

149
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:14,140
 grounds us, it's our morals, it's our choices, our actions are different.

150
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:20,340
 They flow because we've surrendered to Jesus and it is the convicting transformative work

151
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:24,500
 of the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives.

152
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:31,540
 When we choose to follow Jesus, we must live differently.

153
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,620
 Let me give you an example of when I first got married.

154
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:42,740
 For the first few months of being a newlywed, I was really awful.

155
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:46,340
 Now, you don't believe that, do you?

156
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,820
 How could I be awful?

157
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:51,860
 Like, I'm like the nicest person.

158
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,260
 Well, I wasn't.

159
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:56,140
 I was awful.

160
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:00,060
 I wasn't treating Richard very well at all.

161
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:06,100
 And to be honest, I was really struggling because I was used to being very independent

162
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,620
 and suddenly, you know, I had somebody else to think of.

163
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:16,980
 I was working, Richard was about to go back to study, so he had a little bit more time,

164
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:23,340
 but I spent most of my time actually hanging out with my work colleagues.

165
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:27,940
 And to be honest, you wouldn't even really know that I was married.

166
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:35,060
 When I went home, I was moody, bad-tempered, just not nice to be around.

167
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:40,380
 It got to the stage where close friends of ours confronted me on this.

168
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:48,020
 Now, we've been married for 33 years.

169
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:55,340
 But I still remember when I was confronted, when they said to me about my behavior and

170
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,140
 how I was treating Richard.

171
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,460
 And so I made that decision.

172
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:01,460
 You know what?

173
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,460
 That's right.

174
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:10,060
 I chose to then invest more into my relationship with Richard, focusing on my marriage, stop

175
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,900
 acting as though I was single.

176
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,820
 In a similar way, when we choose to make a decision to follow Jesus, we are making a

177
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:23,680
 decision not to follow the old ways of our life.

178
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,060
 We want to live differently.

179
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:32,620
 It's intentional, but it's about surrendering to God and working on our relationship with

180
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,620
 God.

181
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,460
 And I'm sure if you were to ask Richard, he would agree, I'm much nicer to live with now.

182
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,460
 Is that right?

183
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,460
 Yes.

184
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:43,700
 Give me the thumbs up.

185
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,100
 So why is this so important?

186
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,580
 And why is it so hard sometimes?

187
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:53,820
 I think first of all, we've really got to grasp how much God loves us.

188
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:58,380
 Now we hear this a lot in church, but we really need our revelation of what that actually

189
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:05,940
 means because when we actually grasp how much God's love is unconditional, not dependent

190
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:11,820
 on what you do, but simply because of who God is.

191
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:20,060
 When you appreciate how James uses language associated with marriage to help us see that,

192
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:28,560
 when he calls the people adulterous, he does this to emphasize how God sees his relationship

193
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,100
 to his people.

194
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:32,700
 It's a metaphor we see reflected through scripture.

195
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:36,940
 It's this marital relationship between God and us.

196
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:43,940
 And I think we would agree that for a marriage to work, it must be built on mutual trust,

197
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:49,060
 commitment, loyalty, and love for each other.

198
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:54,460
 If one partner is not able to do that, when there is a lack of trust, one-sided commitment,

199
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,940
 disloyalty, the marriage breaks down.

200
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:05,820
 I recently read that the exclusivity of marriage is the essence of marriage.

201
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:09,100
 And I think that is so true.

202
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,900
 And so God reminds us again and again that he is faithful to us even when we are not

203
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:23,140
 faithful to him, but there is a righteous jealousy over us and he will not accept our

204
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:29,020
 allegiance, our fidelity, our attachment to other things.

205
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:37,900
 Exodus tells us, "You shall worship no other God for the Lord whose name is jealous is

206
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:40,540
 a jealous God."

207
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,140
 And the Hebrew for jealous is kanah.

208
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:50,820
 And throughout scripture, we see God as kanah for his glory, jealous for his glory, kanah

209
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,220
 for his people.

210
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,020
 Why?

211
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:02,580
 Because of his absolute holiness and love, absolute, and the expectation of exclusive

212
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:06,380
 worship from his creation.

213
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,140
 He loves you too much.

214
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,940
 He knows what is best for you.

215
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,340
 He knows that if we follow the way of the world, as broken as it is, we will never be

216
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,220
 truly satisfied.

217
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,380
 We will continue to strive endlessly.

218
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,460
 We will continue to try to achieve driven by ambition to be successful, to be wealthy,

219
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:34,420
 to be rich, to be happy, maybe even to do some good, but all on our own strengths.

220
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:39,900
 Just ask anyone who's achieved great wealth or highly successful or achieved most of their

221
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,620
 goals, have they stopped striving?

222
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:43,820
 Stopped gaining more?

223
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:47,060
 Are they satisfied?

224
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,780
 Usually not.

225
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:56,380
 The world will never give us what we think we need because from the very beginning, Genesis

226
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:04,700
 1 and 2, we were created to be in perfect relationship with God, with each other and

227
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,860
 creation.

228
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:09,780
 And then we all know what happened in Genesis 3, right?

229
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:16,020
 When sin entered and our world is fractured.

230
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,780
 Because of God's love for us, he'll not accept our friendship.

231
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,660
 He'll not accept our friendship with the value systems of the world because they're in opposition

232
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:30,060
 to him and they are destructive to us.

233
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,500
 So we're also facing that spiritual oppression.

234
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:38,660
 We know, again, scripture talks about powers and principalities that are working against

235
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:41,740
 God, but they're working against us as well.

236
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:48,260
 So don't be surprised when you find yourself being pulled in two different directions.

237
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:56,520
 But we have a way to overcome this internal struggle which changes our external behaviors

238
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,320
 as you choose friendship over God, over friendship with the world.

239
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,260
 The good news and the encouragement to us is that James is very clear on how to do that.

240
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:13,860
 How we can choose God over the world when in surrender, in humility and in trust, when

241
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:20,540
 we come to God, when we recognize and acknowledge who he is and how much we need him.

242
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:24,100
 When we draw close to him, we'll know his presence.

243
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,220
 We'll know victory in our life over the enemy.

244
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,260
 From verse 6, let's see what James says.

245
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:35,260
 But he gives us more grace.

246
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,940
 That is why scripture says God opposes the proud but shows favor to the humble.

247
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:44,300
 Submit yourselves then to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.

248
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,540
 Come near to God and he will come near to you.

249
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,780
 Wash your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.

250
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:55,820
 Grieve, mourn, and wail, change your laughter to mourning and your joy to gloom.

251
00:18:55,820 --> 00:19:01,420
 Humble yourself before the Lord, he will lift you up.

252
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:06,980
 It will be impossible to choose God without God's grace in our life and the power of the

253
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,320
 Holy Spirit in us.

254
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:16,820
 But God promises he gives us grace and we'll have his favor when we simply admit we need

255
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:20,500
 him and turn towards him.

256
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,200
 James makes it very clear.

257
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:26,180
 We draw near to God and he draws near to us.

258
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:30,780
 But don't think that this means God is like over there in the distance and we've got to

259
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:33,260
 do the work to get to him.

260
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,580
 God actually has never left us.

261
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:40,380
 He's here right by our side.

262
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:43,860
 He's been there the whole time.

263
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:49,500
 The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on him in truth.

264
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,680
 Never will I leave you, never will I forsake you.

265
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:00,460
 And behold, I am with you always to the end of the age.

266
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:08,380
 So James is emphasizing this posture of humility that we need to have when we realize we have

267
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,380
 to draw close to God.

268
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:11,380
 He's there.

269
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:18,420
 And it's interesting because if you contrast this with the Old Testament, think about Moses.

270
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:22,180
 When Moses was drawing near to God and God said, "Stop.

271
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:24,240
 Don't come any closer.

272
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,060
 Take off your sandals.

273
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,300
 The ground is holy."

274
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,420
 Not the holy priest, the high priest who was the only one that could go into the holy of

275
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:42,540
 holies to speak on behalf of the people when he went to God.

276
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:44,740
 The only one.

277
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:48,220
 And yet we have an intimacy with God now.

278
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,300
 Why?

279
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,660
 Why is it different?

280
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,540
 It's Jesus.

281
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,900
 It's the death and resurrection of Jesus.

282
00:20:55,900 --> 00:21:03,340
 It's his blood that allows us to be in an intimate relationship with our God, the God

283
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,540
 who created heaven and earth.

284
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:13,060
 Like we heard last week with Andrew, the God who spoke and the world was.

285
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:18,820
 That's the God that calls us into friendship.

286
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:25,420
 So in that intimacy, James tells us and his readers that when we have God's presence,

287
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:35,140
 we also have the power to face every situation and to face those situations where the enemy

288
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,660
 is trying to attack us.

289
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:43,060
 Resist the devil and he will flee from you.

290
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:47,580
 Now I know maybe some of us in the room are thinking, "Hmm, how do you resist the devil

291
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
 and he will flee?

292
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:49,900
 What does that actually look like?

293
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:51,860
 We can't see anything here.

294
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,380
 There's no little minions running around that we can slap.

295
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,420
 So what does it actually mean?

296
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:06,900
 Let me give you an example of one occasion recently where I resisted the devil and he

297
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
 fled.

298
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,780
 I had to think what the grammar for flew was then.

299
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:16,700
 Flew, flewed, fled.

300
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:22,860
 So I was traveling to work on the bus and I overheard a conversation between two people

301
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:29,300
 and just so that you're aware, I wasn't eavesdropping.

302
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,300
 They were talking in English.

303
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:34,860
 They were talking quite loud and I just happened to be sat there minding my own business as

304
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,940
 I'm traveling to work.

305
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:43,300
 Anyway, they're talking about money and they're discussing it quite openly.

306
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:50,740
 They're talking about how they were set up for retirement, how much money they were making,

307
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:56,660
 how they were able to be really smart because they were using their...the money was making

308
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:59,340
 them money.

309
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:03,380
 And so I'm sat there listening to them talk about this and I'm not kidding you.

310
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:08,140
 I mean, I was just happily sat there going to work, not thinking about anything, but

311
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:11,580
 a thought came into my mind.

312
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:18,140
 Out of nowhere said to me, "You do not have enough.

313
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:21,260
 You will never have enough.

314
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,980
 You're too late.

315
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:27,380
 You've wasted your life and you've certainly not been smart.

316
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,380
 You should have done better."

317
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,540
 Now, I'm not kidding you.

318
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:35,380
 Generally, I'm not an anxious person.

319
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:42,740
 Only physically, I felt such stress.

320
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,020
 My heart was beating faster.

321
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,860
 I felt a weight on me.

322
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:49,140
 I felt sad.

323
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:56,380
 I felt so sad as I began to think, "Oh my goodness, I don't have enough.

324
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,380
 Hong Kong's an expensive city.

325
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:01,300
 What about my future?"

326
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:09,220
 And then, because I like to take action, I put in my head a plan of action of how I was

327
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,700
 going to deal with this.

328
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,900
 So my action involved, "Okay, I've got to work out how do I make extra money on the

329
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,420
 side?

330
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:23,580
 How does Richard make extra money on the side?

331
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:29,900
 And what do we need to cut and sort of start saving on in order that we can save a little

332
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,340
 bit more for the future?"

333
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,980
 So all of this is going on within my head.

334
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:42,300
 I'm just sat on the bus, but it's like this, "Foom."

335
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,580
 And as I was just trying to work all this out in my head, I had another very strong

336
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,660
 voice.

337
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:57,140
 It said to me, "The world's economy is not your economy."

338
00:24:57,140 --> 00:25:04,900
 And then a little bit more gentler voice, "God's economy is different."

339
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,300
 And I knew immediately then that was the Holy Spirit.

340
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,180
 But listen, I had a choice.

341
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:18,140
 I could have stayed with my train of thought that was spiraling into fear, anxiety, and

342
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:23,420
 planning action, which I don't think Richard would have been very happy about.

343
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:26,980
 Or I could have decided, "You know what?

344
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:28,900
 I am not going to accept this.

345
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,940
 Where did this even come from?

346
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:34,180
 I was just happy on the bus going to work."

347
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:37,080
 So I decided that I refused to accept those words.

348
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:42,080
 I told myself there and then, "I do have enough.

349
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,900
 God has always been faithful and he always will be faithful."

350
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:52,060
 And immediately, I'm not kidding you, I didn't feel sad.

351
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:59,660
 I felt physically so much better and just the heaviness just lifted and I just felt,

352
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:03,580
 "Oh, okay, let's carry on the bus ride then."

353
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,620
 But this is an example of what it means.

354
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:09,860
 You know, the enemy, he thinks he's so smart.

355
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:13,820
 He just throws all these little lies at you.

356
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:19,140
 The problem is sometimes we don't resist them and so they stay.

357
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:28,340
 We begin to see or act when those are just lies of the enemy.

358
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:35,420
 We have to be able to resist the devil because it says he will flee, not he may be, could,

359
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,420
 depends on his day.

360
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,620
 No, he will flee.

361
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:48,180
 To live genuinely as believers of Jesus, we recognize there is a choice to make in who

362
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:51,740
 and what we are aligned to, the world or God.

363
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,740
 Cannot be both.

364
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:58,940
 The inward struggles and the external behaviors we have to overcome, we can if we choose friendship

365
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:01,180
 with God.

366
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:06,780
 We draw close to him and that is key to the victory in living in a world where there's

367
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:13,140
 a lot of tension, in a world where we're being pulled away.

368
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:15,260
 But it's proactive to draw close.

369
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,260
 It's not a one-off thing.

370
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:23,900
 It's an intentional, habitual, drawing close day after day after day for the rest of our

371
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:26,700
 lives while we're here on earth.

372
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:34,420
 So in the context of Hong Kong and our very busy lives here, what are some of the ways

373
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:37,100
 that we can draw close to God?

374
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,840
 Well I can tell you what it's not.

375
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,420
 It's not spiritual activity.

376
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:43,660
 Can I hear an amen?

377
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:48,940
 Does anybody want spiritual activity for the sake of spiritual activity?

378
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,380
 No.

379
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,480
 It is not your daily Bible reading.

380
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,420
 It is not in the activity of going to church.

381
00:27:56,420 --> 00:28:04,940
 It is not bringing God a list of prayer requests or even listening to beautiful worship music.

382
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,580
 Now don't get me wrong.

383
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:14,420
 These are all good disciplines and we should do them, but they are a means to enter into

384
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,540
 his presence.

385
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:23,860
 They are a means in order to commune with God, to have a friendship with them.

386
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,580
 So of course we do all of these things.

387
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:34,420
 Absolutely read your Bible, come to church, worship, but ask yourself this, did I meet

388
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,300
 with God?

389
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:41,020
 When you leave the service, did you really meet with God when you were here?

390
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,420
 Did you commune with God?

391
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,220
 Is God a friendship?

392
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,700
 Is there a friendship there?

393
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:48,500
 Because that's what God wants.

394
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:52,100
 It's not tasks ticked off a list.

395
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:56,020
 True friendship is about a true relationship with each other.

396
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,140
 It's the same with God.

397
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,540
 I think in this service especially, some of you really struggle with this idea of friendship

398
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:03,540
 with God.

399
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:05,540
 That is so alien to you.

400
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:10,900
 You can't understand how do you have a friendship with God?

401
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:16,660
 Well I really encourage you to pursue this because it will change how you view God when

402
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:23,660
 you realize his pursuit of you is to be in friendship.

403
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:29,740
 It can seem challenging at times to have a conversation with God rather than just bring

404
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,680
 him your prayer list.

405
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:36,260
 But it's being intentional about creating that intimacy with him.

406
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:41,640
 So as I close I want to bring a take home application.

407
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:48,140
 One practical way that I personally have found helps me draw closer to God.

408
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,460
 And it's through the idea of contemplative prayer.

409
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:57,160
 Now this sounds really simple, but it's very difficult.

410
00:29:57,160 --> 00:30:02,420
 But if you can commit to some regular rhythm in your life, in your relationship with God,

411
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:07,420
 it will deepen your friendship and intimacy.

412
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:13,780
 And contemplative prayer is about being silently focused on God.

413
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:18,620
 It's letting go of every thought and other distraction that is around you.

414
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:22,740
 And let me tell you that is so difficult.

415
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:26,580
 And I challenge you to try this because it is not easy.

416
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:30,980
 And the fact that it's not easy should surprise us.

417
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:36,700
 Because in this, my version of a practice of the 14th century from the book of Privy

418
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,600
 Counseling, they say you should set aside a certain amount of time.

419
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,380
 Now I would say first of all you've got to get a timer.

420
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:48,460
 Because if you don't use a timer, after three minutes you're going to be like, "Okay, what's

421
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,460
 time then?

422
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,460
 Did we, did I?"

423
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,760
 So set a timer first of all for 20 to 30 minutes.

424
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:01,220
 Find a quiet space without distraction or disturbance.

425
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:07,740
 Then believe and accept God's gracious love towards you.

426
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:14,580
 Imagine for a moment you're resting on him as a sick child would rest on a comforting

427
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:18,100
 parent or guardian.

428
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,900
 Next don't allow yourself to analyze yourself or God.

429
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:29,340
 This is hugely important because we know our minds play tricks on us or try to distract

430
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:36,420
 us or tell us what we haven't done, how unworthy we are, and questions whether or not God really,

431
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,420
 really does love.

432
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,420
 All of this goes in our mind.

433
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,260
 You've got to push it away.

434
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,340
 Push it away so there are no distractions whatsoever.

435
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,180
 You push it away and you'll be encouraged by the simple truth.

436
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:55,860
 You are known, you are loved, and you are accepted just as you are in that present moment.

437
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:59,860
 And if it helps, you repeat, "I am loved.

438
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,340
 I am loved.

439
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,340
 I am loved."

440
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:06,580
 You see, many of us don't really believe that.

441
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,540
 We say it, but we can't sit in it.

442
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:16,900
 If you could sit 20 or 30 minutes and you are telling yourself how much you are loved

443
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:24,260
 in the presence of God, that will do huge wonders for your confidence, that's for sure.

444
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:30,340
 But to be able to do that isn't easy because we're so busy-minded.

445
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:36,380
 But the most important thing is once that timer goes off, you've had that meditative

446
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:45,100
 time with God, intimacy with Him, and it's only 20 minutes of your time.

447
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:47,180
 It is life-giving.

448
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:51,580
 I found it hugely freeing for me because it gave me permission not to think about, "Oh,

449
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,740
 I must do this, I must do that.

450
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:56,980
 Well, I better ask for this and I better talk about this with God."

451
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:00,020
 Instead, there was nothing.

452
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:02,800
 It was just me and God.

453
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:08,020
 If you're a parent, you know what it's like when a child climbs up onto your lap and they

454
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,940
 just sit there.

455
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:14,580
 They're not talking, wriggling, whining, anything.

456
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:20,060
 They're just there in your presence and it's a beautiful thing.

457
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:26,940
 And that's how God is and wants us to be with Him.

458
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:35,460
 So as you leave today, I challenge you all to ask this question daily, "Am I choosing

459
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:39,500
 friendship with God or the world?"

460
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:46,260
 And then create within your routine those regular rhythms where you're choosing to seek

461
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,780
 God because you are close to Him, because you have a friendship with Him.

462
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:59,980
 And victory comes over those internal struggles and then those behaviors when we submit and

463
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,260
 draw close and He's with us.

464
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,200
 I would love to be able to pray for us now.

465
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,820
 So if you would be able to stand.

466
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:19,100
 When I was preparing this message, one of the pictures that I got was that we were here

467
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,940
 and many of us had scales on our eyes.

468
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:26,260
 The scales were on our eyes because for a number of different reasons.

469
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:32,500
 One is for some of us, we don't really know what it is that we are doing that is in the

470
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,500
 world.

471
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:37,980
 We've been doing things that are choosing friendship with the world more than friendship

472
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:42,900
 with God for so long, we don't even know what that is.

473
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:48,900
 And the picture that I got was of scales falling off.

474
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:51,580
 We need to be a community of believers.

475
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:57,980
 We need to be a body of Christ that chooses friendship with God, not friendship with the

476
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:00,340
 world.

477
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:05,300
 We need help to see where we've chosen the world.

478
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:12,420
 And so maybe that's you and while we sing in a response song, I believe the scales will

479
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:15,100
 come off and God will show you.

480
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:19,300
 He will draw you into a place of seeing where you need to let go of the things of the world

481
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:26,460
 that are holding you, that are causing behaviors that you know are not good for you, not good

482
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,820
 for your families.

483
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:34,580
 And then the other side was this sense that the enemy, he does not want you to even think

484
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:42,820
 that he does send words and ideas in your head that would cause you to feel anything

485
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:46,080
 but not good about yourself.

486
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,580
 He doesn't want you to believe that he does that.

487
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:55,340
 And I believe that the scales need to come off here, that we would spiritually, supernaturally

488
00:35:55,340 --> 00:36:01,580
 be able to discern when the enemy is attacking because it's very clear in scripture.

489
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:08,620
 We have the power as believers of Jesus, the spirit is within us to resist the enemy and

490
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:10,580
 he will flee.

491
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:14,720
 And too many of us, we're not resisting.

492
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:24,540
 So as we pray and as we worship, may our eyes be open to truly see so that we can enter

493
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:33,460
 into this world, not in the world, not of the world, but because we know that God is

494
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,460
 with us.

495
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,020
 So let me pray.

496
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:46,420
 Father, I thank you.

497
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:51,020
 I thank you for everyone here today and everyone watching online.

498
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,220
 Lord, we need help.

499
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:59,060
 We thank you that you've given us help by your spirit.

500
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:02,140
 Help us to choose friends with you over friends of the world.

501
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:08,060
 And I pray for those that are struggling in this area, would their eyes be open to see

502
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:10,460
 right now.

503
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:19,040
 I pray, Father God, may our posture as believers be one of humility and repentance as we recognize

504
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:22,260
 we need you in our lives.

505
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,220
 We can't do it on our own.

506
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,820
 We are not self-sufficient.

507
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:29,060
 We can't be.

508
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:35,320
 And I pray, Father, that we would be reminded that the enemy has no power over us.

509
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:39,420
 We resist and he will flee because we belong to you.

510
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:44,420
 And I pray for those in this room that have scales over their eyes and have believed the

511
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:50,780
 lies of the enemy for so long, the narrative over them is distorted.

512
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:57,780
 I pray, Father God, you remove those scales so they can truly see how much they are known,

513
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:03,700
 they are seen, they are loved, and they are accepted.

514
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:10,100
 And Father, we pray this, that may we be truly lifted up in your love.

515
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,500
 In Jesus' name, amen.

516
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:22,500
