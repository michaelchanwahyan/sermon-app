1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
 Amen, amen.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,000
 Thanks, Tim.

3
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,920
 You know, as we come into this, oh, thank you, that's nice.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,280
 As we come into this final week of this first series of the year, I want to bring a word

5
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:17,440
 to you that's both kind of very personal, but also one that I hope and pray will be

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,680
 quite prophetic for us.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,280
 It's personal because the topic we're going to be speaking about together here today is

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,080
 one that I've had to wrestle very deeply with.

9
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,360
 It's one that's caused a lot of frustration in my own life, one that's caused me actually

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,720
 quite a bit of pain and hardship, but equally is one where I felt the restoration and the

11
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:41,700
 work of the Holy Spirit, perhaps in some of the most profound ways.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,680
 But I also hope that the message is prophetic because the topic that we are going to talk

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,000
 about I truly believe has the power to really liberate us, set us free from many of the

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:59,920
 things that hold us down and kind of wear us down and kind of come upon us and restrict

15
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,680
 us from perhaps moving forward in the ways that God wants us to move forward.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,080
 And as I was praying for you and myself as I was putting this together today, I really

17
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:14,680
 felt a strong sense that many of us in this room were carrying burdens, were carrying

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,600
 anxieties, were carrying frustrations, if anything like me, just stuff that is deep

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,560
 down inside and as you're stepping into this new year, you're kind of carrying these things

20
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,560
 with you and those things kind of weigh us down.

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,400
 And I really felt like what the Lord wants to do today is to liberate you from the impact

22
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,400
 of them.

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,000
 Now, I want you to hear my words really clearly here.

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,360
 I did not say necessarily liberate you from them, but liberate you from the impact of

25
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,560
 them because the reality is so often the circumstances and situations that we struggle with in life

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,080
 â€“ we pray for those things to change, but they don't always change.

27
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:59,000
 Quite often we might find ourselves in really tough moments in life.

28
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,720
 We might have those desperate prayers, "God, release me from this really hard situation."

29
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,200
 And for whatever reason, it seems like God doesn't release us from that situation.

30
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:12,240
 And so it would be wrong for me to stand here and say God is going to release you from whatever

31
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:16,960
 situation or circumstance that you're perhaps struggling with as you enter into this new

32
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,960
 year.

33
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:23,520
 But what I can promise you is that God always has a heart not always to change our circumstances,

34
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,600
 but always to change us.

35
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:31,680
 And although we may remain in our circumstances, God always wants to liberate us from their

36
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,080
 impact.

37
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,100
 And so that's what I want to kind of share a little bit about with you today.

38
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:40,680
 And so if you're coming into this service, coming into this year, struggling with some

39
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,320
 of those burdens, anxieties and things there, I hope that what we look at over the next

40
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,240
 30 minutes will be liberating for you.

41
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,800
 Now, to frame this, I want to tell you a little bit about what happened for me on my sabbatical

42
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,880
 last year.

43
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,480
 So here at The Vine, we have a sabbatical policy for all of our staff.

44
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:01,840
 And when our staff work for a complete seven years of full-time work here, on the completion

45
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,600
 of their seventh year, they're eligible for sabbatical and everybody gets it.

46
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,480
 And so I got my first sabbatical back in 2019.

47
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,080
 And then our policy is that every five years after your first one, you get it again.

48
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,400
 So I had it last year.

49
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,800
 I had four months off from work.

50
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,800
 And I have to tell you, I was desperately in need of the break.

51
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:25,520
 If you can imagine what's happened in Hong Kong since 2019, all the way through to 2024,

52
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:30,600
 protests, social movement, everything that was involved with that, the NSL getting that

53
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,680
 pass and all the impact that that had in our city.

54
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,560
 Then COVID came and you can imagine what it was like to lead a relatively large church

55
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,160
 here in Hong Kong through all of those pretty big crises that have taken place over the

56
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,460
 last five years.

57
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:51,520
 So the fact that I was exhausted spiritually, physically, desperately in need of a break,

58
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:57,020
 wanting to get away, was the reality of just the burden and the things that I had held

59
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:01,360
 on behalf of all of the community that I was trying to serve and the weight of that and

60
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,480
 just needing some space to better deal with some of that stuff.

61
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,660
 And I know that when I'm kind of dealing with burdens and anxieties, the thing that manifests

62
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:12,300
 most of my life is insecurity.

63
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:17,360
 And I was feeling myself more insecure around my leadership, more insecure around being

64
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:21,760
 a pastor, more insecure about being a husband to my wife, a father to my daughter Mia, and

65
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,960
 I was wrestling with all of those insecurities as well.

66
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,200
 That doesn't make me a healthy leader.

67
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:32,040
 So I knew that I needed to have some sort of break to connect with the Holy Spirit on

68
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,040
 those things.

69
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,680
 The other thing that was going on is that I realized that in just a few months' time

70
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,400
 I was going to turn 50 years old.

71
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,240
 Oh my goodness.

72
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:48,200
 I suddenly realized that I was old and that I was going to die soon.

73
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,400
 And I was, you're like, "50's nothing."

74
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,520
 50 felt like a lot for me, okay?

75
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,320
 And I was struggling with turning 50.

76
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,240
 I was like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so old."

77
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,800
 And like the average age of people across both the Vine Yuen Long and the Vine Wan Chai,

78
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,040
 do you know what the average age of the people who come to the Vine is?

79
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,220
 29 years old.

80
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,280
 And so I was wrestling, who's older than 29 here?

81
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,280
 No, don't do that.

82
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,280
 That's fine.

83
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,080
 But I was wrestling with this anxiety of like, "Oh my gosh, maybe I'm past my use-by date.

84
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,840
 Maybe I'm not relevant for the young people anymore.

85
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
 Maybe I'm trying to be cool for the young people, but they don't think I'm cool anymore."

86
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,160
 And all of this was going on in my mind.

87
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,160
 Insecurities, needing a break, feeling 50 and old.

88
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,080
 So I went on the sabbatical, first day of sabbatical, and I took out my journal, which

89
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,800
 also happens to be my phone.

90
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,760
 I took out my phone, and in my phone on the notes app, I wrote down a bunch of questions

91
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,920
 that I was going to pray about and bring to God.

92
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:45,720
 I want to read you some of these things from my journal.

93
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:50,420
 So the first question was this, "How much longer do you want me to be a pastor?"

94
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:54,440
 So I was wrestling with the idea of maybe I shouldn't be doing this for that much longer.

95
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,440
 "I'm 50 years old.

96
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,440
 I'm old.

97
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,520
 Maybe it's time for me to hand over to the next generation."

98
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,160
 So one of my other questions was this, "How much longer should I lead the Vine for?

99
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,480
 Maybe there's some young person that should take on the reins of leadership.

100
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,840
 Maybe that's the right thing."

101
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,800
 I was asking questions like this, "When and how should I hand over the church to the next

102
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,800
 generation?

103
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,920
 Those incredible young people that God has blessed me with."

104
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,000
 Now that raised a really challenging further question, which was this one.

105
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,680
 Notice this, "What the heck will I do for my living if you take the church away from

106
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,000
 me?"

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,640
 That was an honest question, because I was like, "This is how I make my living.

108
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,040
 I don't do it for the money.

109
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,520
 I just want you to hear me, okay?

110
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,720
 I don't do it for the money.

111
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,040
 I do it because I love people, and I love the job I have, and I love being a pastor

112
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,040
 and all that."

113
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,680
 But I'm like, "If God, you call me out from being a pastor, how can I provide for myself?

114
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,080
 How the heck, excuse my language, but will I do for a living if I'm no longer doing this?"

115
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,800
 And then the final question, the most important one that I was wrestling with, "Why am I still

116
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:54,440
 so filled with insecurity and self-doubt?"

117
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,920
 Some of those things that were really working on me.

118
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,120
 And then there was one more, one that I really was wrestling with.

119
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:02,400
 It was this one, "Do aliens really exist?"

120
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,480
 I needed the Holy Spirit to speak to me on that topic.

121
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,600
 Okay, that one was not true.

122
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:13,480
 But the rest of them were in my journal, okay?

123
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,440
 And I was wrestling with these questions, and I was bringing them into my sabbatical.

124
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:23,040
 And about a month into my sabbatical, God came, and I'd been praying and praying and

125
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,160
 praying on these sort of things, and I heard nothing at all.

126
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:31,440
 And God came, and He's like, "Andrew, those things are not on my heart for you at all.

127
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,000
 You want to know what's on my heart for you, Andrew?"

128
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
 And I was like, "Yes, I do."

129
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,680
 He's like, "It's just three things, your relationship with me, your relationship with yourself,

130
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,400
 and your relationship with your wife.

131
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,840
 Those are the only three things that actually I really care about for you in this time.

132
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:52,180
 And your sabbatical is going to be about strengthening your relationship with me, about believing

133
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,680
 and knowing and understanding who you are in a greater level than you've ever done before.

134
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:01,880
 And most importantly, you're going to restore and renew the love and the relationship that

135
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,160
 you have with your wife.

136
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,480
 Those three things are all that matters."

137
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:12,900
 I wonder if you've ever had a situation in your own personal prayer life where you've

138
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:17,200
 sat in the tension between all the things that you want to pray about and the things

139
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,520
 that actually God wants to talk to you about.

140
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,880
 Have you ever been in a situation where it feels like you're praying and you're praying

141
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:27,440
 and you've got some important things that are sitting on your heart, but it doesn't

142
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,640
 seem like God is responding to that.

143
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:36,560
 It doesn't seem like God is moving or answering anything that perhaps you have.

144
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,440
 And that's kind of a frustrating place to be, isn't it?

145
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,840
 And sometimes as Christians, I think when it feels like God is not answering the things

146
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,020
 that we desperately want Him to answer, we can feel like He's upset at us.

147
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,020
 He's angry at us.

148
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,680
 We can feel like He's distant from us.

149
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,120
 And we kind of go through the list of all the problems that might be there between us

150
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,800
 or between Him, because it doesn't seem like He's responding in the way that we want Him

151
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,800
 to respond.

152
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,120
 Anyone else ever felt that way?

153
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,400
 Or is it just me?

154
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,080
 Okay, we all feel that way, don't we?

155
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,960
 You see, I think there's a tension at times between the thing that are on our heart to

156
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:14,840
 pray about and the things that are actually on God's heart to speak to us about, that

157
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,280
 He wants us to know about.

158
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:22,600
 There's a tension sometimes, because often I think those two things are different.

159
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:27,280
 Everything that I want God to reveal to me and answer to me and actually the things that

160
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:31,040
 are on His heart, just your relationship with me, your relationship with yourself and your

161
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,160
 relationship with your wife.

162
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,040
 If you've ever felt this tension, you're actually in really good company, because here's the

163
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,560
 crazy thing.

164
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,100
 Jesus, the Son of God, also felt that tension.

165
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:50,520
 The Son of the living God in His prayer life also felt that tension.

166
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:56,760
 The tension between having things on His heart that He wanted, that He desired, that He was

167
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,160
 looking for, and the reality that God at times had different things that God was going to

168
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,160
 do.

169
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:08,200
 So if Jesus has struggled with this at times, that should be great comfort for all of us

170
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:12,960
 as well in the tension that we feel in the reality of our prayer lives.

171
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:18,240
 And perhaps if we could take a look at how Jesus navigates this tension, it might help

172
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,560
 us to navigate it too.

173
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:26,040
 And perhaps the breakthrough of all of those anxieties and concerns and burdens and worries

174
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:31,820
 that I mentioned at the start could be liberated as we see what Jesus does in walking this

175
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,480
 beautiful way of praying and yet submitting.

176
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:37,840
 And so I want to show you this.

177
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,440
 This is in one of the most famous moments of Jesus' life.

178
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,600
 It's right at the end of His life.

179
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,640
 It's about a week before He goes to the cross.

180
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,320
 And He's just shared in the meal with His disciples in the upper room.

181
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
 He's in Jerusalem.

182
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,320
 He's had this crazy meal with them where He's taken the wine and the bread and He's created

183
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,040
 this idea of communion that the church would continue from that point on.

184
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,800
 He's taken the water and the towel and He's washed His servants' feet and He's blessed

185
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
 them.

186
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,000
 They then gone out to the Garden of Gethsemane, otherwise known as the Mount of Olives, which

187
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,840
 sits up on the hill in Jerusalem, still there today.

188
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,200
 And He goes there with His disciples and this is what happens.

189
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,720
 Let me read this to you.

190
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,520
 Jesus went out as usual to the Mount of Olives and His disciples followed Him.

191
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:25,520
 On reaching the place, He said to them, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."

192
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,120
 He withdrew about a stone's throw.

193
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,680
 Beyond them knelt down and prayed, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me.

194
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,560
 Yet not my will, but your will be done."

195
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,320
 An angel from heaven appeared to Him and strengthened Him.

196
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:45,240
 And being in anguish, He prayed more earnestly and His sweat was like drops of blood falling

197
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,860
 to the ground.

198
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:50,360
 When He rose from prayer, He went back to the disciples and He found them asleep, typical

199
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,640
 disciples, exhausted from sorrow.

200
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,280
 "Why are you sleeping?"

201
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,280
 He asked them.

202
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:59,160
 "Get up and pray so that you will not fall into temptation."

203
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,960
 It's a really significant moment in Jesus' life here.

204
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,400
 Right after this, He's about to get betrayed by one of His very own disciples.

205
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:11,680
 A kiss brings betrayal as the army comes to arrest Him.

206
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,280
 He then goes to trial.

207
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:16,280
 On that trial, He's accused of things that He did not do.

208
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:21,080
 Out of that trial, He's sentenced to death on a Roman cross, the most painful thing that

209
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,360
 will ever happen.

210
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:28,680
 And He's standing or He's kneeling in this moment and He's praying and He's praying honestly

211
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:33,720
 and fervently that God would change His situation.

212
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:37,400
 Now I want you to really understand the history and the context of this.

213
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:41,800
 A few years ago, I had the privilege of actually traveling to Jerusalem and I traveled to Jerusalem

214
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:47,400
 with a film crew and we actually made a film series around the life of Jesus.

215
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,560
 And as part of that series, we went up to the Mount of Olives to where this very place

216
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,600
 is that Jesus would have knelt down in this moment.

217
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,600
 And I reflected a little bit in that place on what I think is happening here in this

218
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,600
 prayer.

219
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,640
 So I want to show you just a short extract from that film.

220
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,640
 Let's have a look.

221
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:10,480
 The Mount of Olives is a mountain ridge east of and adjacent to Jerusalem's Old City, named

222
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,960
 for the olive groves that cover its slopes.

223
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:19,240
 For 3,000 years, it has been used primarily as a cemetery and currently holds around 150,000

224
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:32,360
 graves, making this soil soaked in the history of the people of this land.

225
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,080
 It is here that Jesus added his own input into that history.

226
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:42,080
 This is the very mountain ridge that he walked over as he entered into Jerusalem on the praises

227
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,420
 of his people.

228
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,040
 He would have taught his disciples amongst the trees here.

229
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,400
 Under their shade, he would have rested and prayed.

230
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:56,240
 But most importantly of all, this is the place where a betrayer's kiss would kickstart the

231
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:10,120
 events that would ultimately lead to his death on a cross.

232
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,920
 Luke's narrative of the death of Jesus is designed to ask the one central question that

233
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,640
 his whole gospel has been chipping away at.

234
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:20,400
 Who do you think Jesus is?

235
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:25,440
 Mirroring the creation story itself, it begins in a garden, this garden.

236
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,080
 It's here that the disciples with Jesus have retreated after they finished the Passover

237
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,760
 meal in the upper room.

238
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:36,000
 And they've come here to sit around these trees and pray.

239
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,760
 And as Jesus is praying, he's completely overcome with what is ahead of him.

240
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:42,960
 He understands he's about to be arrested.

241
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,840
 He knows he's going to trial.

242
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,320
 He knows that he's going to take the weight of the sin of the world upon his shoulders.

243
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,400
 And in the anguish of the moment, he offers one of the most powerful and most humble prayers

244
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,480
 that we have in all of scripture.

245
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:04,000
 He says before his father, "Father, if you can, take this cup from me.

246
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:19,620
 But not my will, but your will be done."

247
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,720
 Take this cup, your will be done.

248
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,560
 Fear and faith side by side.

249
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:30,780
 These two themes will sit over the rest of the narrative of Jesus's death.

250
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:34,220
 And Luke is doing a beautiful play on imagery here.

251
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:40,100
 Because like Adam and Eve in their garden, Jesus faces huge temptation and anguish in

252
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,640
 his garden.

253
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:47,760
 But unlike Adam and Eve, Jesus overcomes those temptations through obedient submission to

254
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,880
 his father.

255
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,160
 And this concept of submission speaks to the very roots of what it is to be a follower

256
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,400
 of Jesus.

257
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,640
 And submission then becomes the key to what discipleship is all about.

258
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,520
 In fact, it becomes the central idea of the cross and the resurrection.

259
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:14,120
 And to understand that more, I need to take you to another hill in Jerusalem.

260
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:18,200
 Well I'm not going to take you to another hill in Jerusalem right now.

261
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,880
 But I hope that just gives you some of the imagery of where Jesus is having this moment

262
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,880
 with his disciples.

263
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:28,760
 It was exactly in that place that I was just sitting under one of those olive trees in

264
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:29,760
 the film.

265
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,480
 And I want you to get a sense of what Jesus does here.

266
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,000
 At the beginning of his prayer, he prays this.

267
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,280
 He says, "Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me."

268
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,240
 Well, of course, what he's talking about there is all the events that are about to happen.

269
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:50,320
 The arrest, the trial, the execution, the painful execution on Roman cross, the reality

270
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,880
 that he needs to go to the cross to pay the price for our sin and the weight of that on

271
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,960
 his shoulders.

272
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,600
 And I love what he does here.

273
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,000
 This is one of the most beautiful moments of Jesus' humanity that we have in all of

274
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
 Scripture.

275
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,040
 He actually comes to his father and he says, "Father."

276
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:09,760
 And there's intimacy in his expression of using that word.

277
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:12,600
 He's saying, "Father, we know each other so well.

278
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,600
 I'm your son.

279
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,960
 You are literally my father.

280
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:22,240
 If there's any other way, if there's any way that you can take this reality of the burden

281
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,400
 and the anxiety and the fear that I'm feeling for having to go to the cross and take the

282
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,720
 whole world's sin on my shoulder, if there's any other way, I ask you, I plead you, I'm

283
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,200
 asking you to change the situation."

284
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:39,760
 When he says, "Take this cup from me," in the Old Testament, the cup always represented

285
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,520
 the wrath of God.

286
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,800
 This idea of God's judgment for the sin of the world.

287
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:48,360
 So what he's saying is, "Take your wrath from me."

288
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:52,040
 Like I don't want to sit under the reality of having to take the whole world's sin on

289
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,040
 my shoulders.

290
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:56,800
 If there's any way for us to change that, would you please change it?

291
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:02,360
 And what I love about this part of the prayer is that Jesus is demonstrating to us that

292
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:06,400
 there is always space to express your heart and your emotions to him.

293
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,560
 You see, there's always place for us to come to God and say, "This isn't right.

294
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,880
 This is hard.

295
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,960
 This is not working for me.

296
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
 This is difficult.

297
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,800
 I want something different.

298
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,400
 I want to change in my circumstance.

299
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
 I want everything to..."

300
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,880
 See, the beautiful thing about the relationship that we have with our Father is that he creates

301
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,400
 space for us to lament.

302
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,840
 He creates space for us to ask for the impossible.

303
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:36,480
 He creates space for us that when the world seems to be really hard and our circumstances

304
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,320
 seem to be really tough, he makes space for us to ask him to step in and do the impossible.

305
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:50,040
 I love that Jesus here is asking his Father to do something for him, which seems really

306
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,040
 simple.

307
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:55,520
 But think about this for a second, because if Jesus, as the Son of God, understands what

308
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,440
 has to happen, why is he doing this?

309
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,960
 Because I think it's this beautiful moment of human expression of the pain and the anguish

310
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:08,000
 that he's wrestling with, but he's demonstrating that it's always okay to bring your needs

311
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,440
 to your Father.

312
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,680
 Even if your Father doesn't do those needs, it's still right and healthy for you to bring

313
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,680
 your needs to him.

314
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,640
 He cries out in anguish.

315
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,200
 He cries out and he asks.

316
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,200
 Notice what he asks for.

317
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,520
 He says, "If you can take this cup from me..."

318
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,520
 Sorry, he doesn't say that.

319
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,520
 Let me say it properly.

320
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,920
 He's saying, "If you're willing, take this cup from me."

321
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:39,320
 In other words, even in Jesus's great fear and his great anxiety, he still has faith.

322
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:43,680
 I know that in the times of my life when things are not going well and I've got anxiety and

323
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,120
 fear, I feel my faith levels often drop down.

324
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,720
 Maybe yours do too.

325
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:52,600
 But notice, in this great moment of Jesus's anguish, he's so much in anguish that he sweats

326
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
 blood.

327
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:58,200
 So this is a real thing that he's going through with real emotions he's struggling with.

328
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,800
 Even in there, he says, "You could change my circumstance.

329
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,160
 I believe that you could.

330
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,360
 I believe that you could move in power and change this circumstance."

331
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:10,240
 He says, "Take this cup from me because if you're willing, it's possible.

332
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,280
 You could speak to the mountain and if you want the mountain to move, the mountain will

333
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,280
 move."

334
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:17,760
 So even though he's under great pain, he's expressing great faith.

335
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,440
 Do you see that?

336
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:24,320
 And there's something about that space that is created in all of us when we're facing

337
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,640
 hard times and we pray those prayers of God stepping in, there is a place for us to not

338
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:32,000
 only express the pain but also express the faith.

339
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,960
 "Lord, I believe that you can do this."

340
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,280
 A few years ago, I had my own Garden of Gethsemane moments.

341
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:45,000
 Maybe you've had some of yours over the years as well.

342
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:49,280
 In mine, at the age of 30, my wife and I had decided that the Lord was calling us into

343
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,360
 full-time ministry in different ways for me to become a pastor, for her to go into counseling

344
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,520
 and become a therapist.

345
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,400
 And so we quit our jobs here in Hong Kong.

346
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,400
 I was in the finance world.

347
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,760
 Chris was in the childcare world.

348
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,640
 And we quit our jobs and we moved to New Zealand together, which is where Chris is from.

349
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,340
 We went to seminary, this place called Laidlaw College in Auckland, New Zealand.

350
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,420
 And as we went there, we felt the Lord say very specifically to us, "It's time to start

351
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:15,720
 for a family," which is something that we had had on our hearts for many years.

352
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,160
 We got married at the age of 23 and 22.

353
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,200
 We were now 30.

354
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,800
 We had waited a while, but this was the time to start our family.

355
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,800
 And I'm going to cut a very long story short, but we started to try for our family.

356
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,720
 We quickly discovered that we weren't able to get pregnant.

357
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,120
 We did a whole bunch of tests and procedures.

358
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,840
 It was discovered that I'm actually infertile.

359
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,800
 And I have this condition called azuspermia.

360
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:42,800
 Now, azuspermia literally means that I have no spermia at all, no sperm.

361
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,720
 We're friends here, so I'm just going to get very honest with you.

362
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,840
 So I have azuspermia, which means that I have no sperm at all.

363
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:58,020
 Now, a man is determined to be infertile if he has less than 40 million sperm in an ejaculation.

364
00:21:58,020 --> 00:22:01,960
 Less than 40 million and you're determined to be infertile medically.

365
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,180
 I have none whatsoever.

366
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,360
 And so we discovered this.

367
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,880
 Now, here was the tension in my life.

368
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,440
 Number one, I felt like God had said to Chris and I, "Now's the time to start a family."

369
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,840
 I had always carried in my heart a desire to want to father children.

370
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:22,360
 Chris and I had spoken for years about, "Oh, I hope they have your hair and oh, your nose."

371
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,560
 And you know, all that talk that you have about biological children happening.

372
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,640
 And so we had prayed about it.

373
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,660
 I had felt God had spoken to me about it.

374
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:34,000
 And now I discovered that God had created me in a way that I could never do it myself.

375
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,120
 Are you with me?

376
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:42,440
 This was a Garden of Gethsemane moment for me because I was upset at God for what he

377
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,680
 had done.

378
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,880
 I was upset that he had asked me or given me a heart for children and then made me in

379
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,640
 such a way that I could never do it.

380
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:54,000
 I was feeling shame because I'd always wanted to give Chris the gift of having a child.

381
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,000
 So I was wrestling with shame.

382
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,680
 And so I came to God in the desperation of that moment.

383
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,160
 And here was my prayer.

384
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,040
 And this will sound funny, but this was absolutely my prayer.

385
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,160
 My prayer was this, "Father, give me one sperm.

386
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:11,920
 I don't need 200 million sperm like every other man in the world.

387
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:15,960
 I just need one sperm, one that can do the job.

388
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,160
 That's all I'm asking for.

389
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,480
 I need one sperm."

390
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,520
 And I actually got all of my friends and mentors to fast and pray.

391
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,600
 I remember reaching out to Nigel and Jill.

392
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,800
 Nigel at the time would visit Auckland for business and we'd connect together.

393
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,840
 I remember reaching out to them and other people in our church community at the time

394
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,860
 and say, "Would you fast with us?

395
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,400
 Fast and pray because we're believing for a miracle."

396
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,800
 See, I had the anguish and the shame.

397
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:41,560
 I was carrying the anxiety of what was happening.

398
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,400
 But this was my, "Lord, if you're willing, take the cup from me" moment.

399
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:48,240
 This was me saying, "Lord, if you're willing, one sperm."

400
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,120
 I'm not trying to be greedy here.

401
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:54,240
 I'm just asking for one that swims really well and does the job that it's required to

402
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,240
 do.

403
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,240
 That's all I'm asking.

404
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,160
 But this is what I'm asking for and I'm expressing.

405
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:02,200
 You've created the space for me to express this desire to you.

406
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,840
 Lord, give me one sperm.

407
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:10,800
 Some of you in this room, you're perhaps in a Garden of Gethsemane moment in whatever

408
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:15,320
 is going on in your life right now and that resonates with you.

409
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:18,520
 It's weird because sometimes as Christians, when we get into these kind of situations,

410
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,700
 we actually reduce our prayer life rather than increase it.

411
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:27,340
 We actually hold back from praying some of those bold prayers, some of those prayers

412
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:32,200
 for God to step in and do something miraculous, knowing that you cannot change your situation

413
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,800
 and you're asking God.

414
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,600
 Sometimes weirdly, we step back from that.

415
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,800
 Maybe we're fearful that God may not reply.

416
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:42,920
 Maybe we're worried that he's not listening to us.

417
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:47,040
 Maybe we judge ourselves and we think that we're not worthy to receive a miracle that

418
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,320
 would be needed.

419
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,480
 And so as Christians, sometimes we can hold back from praying the desperate prayers for

420
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,400
 God to step in and do what only he can do.

421
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,520
 Are you with me?

422
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,240
 And what's beautiful about Jesus here is that he's having a real moment of anguish himself,

423
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:05,680
 but he does not hold back from going to his father and saying, "I don't know what you

424
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:10,480
 want to do here, but if you are able to do this, this is what I'm asking for and I have

425
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,240
 the faith that you can do it."

426
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,880
 And I feel like for some of you, as we end this series, that's what God's looking for

427
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
 you.

428
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:23,880
 He's looking for the faith in you to believe that he can actually come and do the things

429
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,360
 that you're longing for him to do.

430
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:33,400
 Some of you have been shy and it's time for you to move into a place of greater boldness.

431
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,960
 But I want you to see also then what Jesus does next, because it's really quite beautiful

432
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,880
 how he marries this together.

433
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,760
 He's just plead out in faith that God would change his circumstance, but then he says

434
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,880
 straight away, "Yet not my will, but yours be done."

435
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,480
 It's very famous, isn't it?

436
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:54,800
 But I want you to sit in the process that Jesus is demonstrating for us here.

437
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,080
 He goes, "Yet not my will, but yours be done."

438
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:03,960
 Which doesn't contradict the first part of this prayer and I want you to see this.

439
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:09,400
 See it was absolutely right for Jesus to say, "Take this cup from me."

440
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,200
 But notice, if all he ever did was say, "Take the cup, take the cup, take the cup," and

441
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,720
 not move to the second part of the prayer, here's what might happen for Jesus.

442
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,160
 He might start to not like his father anymore.

443
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,280
 He might start to wrestle with the reality of, "Well, why isn't God replying to me?

444
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,680
 Why doesn't God do what I ask?

445
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,520
 Why does God feel so distant?"

446
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:33,120
 And Jesus understands that he's sitting in a tension where if all he does is say, "Give

447
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,360
 me, give me, give me," he's basically praying me-centric prayers all the time.

448
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,200
 And Jesus understands that there's nothing wrong with the expression of what we want

449
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:47,640
 God to do in our lives, but if that's all we're doing, then essentially we're just me-centric

450
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,640
 in our prayers.

451
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,680
 You follow that?

452
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:55,760
 So he marries it with this second part where he says, "Yet not my will, your will be done."

453
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,600
 That's basically Jesus saying, "I have some me-centered things that I believe you could

454
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,680
 do, but ultimately I want a God-centric world.

455
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,520
 I want ultimately God to be the one who will make the decision.

456
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,280
 I want ultimately God's will to come.

457
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,360
 Your will be done."

458
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:18,800
 Which is a really interesting phrase because this is not the first time that Jesus has

459
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,200
 said this phrase.

460
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,360
 To understand what Jesus is saying in the second half of the prayer here, you actually

461
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,520
 have to rewind the story about four months prior to this moment.

462
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,280
 Four months prior to this moment, the disciples come to Jesus and they say, "Rabbi, teach

463
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:36,120
 us how to pray because we've noticed that your prayers are different from what we see

464
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,520
 in the temple.

465
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,840
 We notice that your prayers are free prayers."

466
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:44,400
 You see, prayers in the first century in Judaism at that time were all written prayers.

467
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,560
 And he noticed that Jesus didn't pray written prayers.

468
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,760
 He didn't pray the Psalms like the other Jewish people were in the day.

469
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:56,280
 No, this Jesus, this rabbi, had the courage and boldness to pray directly to the Father.

470
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:00,380
 And so they come to him and say, "Teach us how to pray like that."

471
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:03,860
 And Jesus teaches them what we've come to call the Lord's Prayer.

472
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,080
 Everybody knows the Lord's Prayer.

473
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:09,480
 Whether they're Christian or not, people kind of know the Lord's Prayer.

474
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,960
 But you have to also understand that the Lord's Prayer has a context as well.

475
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,440
 The Lord's Prayer's context is the Exodus of the Old Testament.

476
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,440
 We don't have time to look at this today, but it's a fascinating Bible study to do at

477
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,440
 some point.

478
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:25,160
 But the whole of the Lord's Prayer is connected to the story of the Exodus of the Old Testament.

479
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,440
 You know when it says, "Give us today our daily bread?"

480
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,840
 Manna, right?

481
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,560
 So the whole thing, the language, the way it's written, the whole thing connects back

482
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:37,040
 to the most profound moment of God's deliverance and power in the Old Testament for the Jewish

483
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,320
 people.

484
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,800
 What Jesus is saying in the Lord's Prayer is, "Pray to the God of the Exodus.

485
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:48,840
 Know that your God is a liberating God, that your God has the power to change circumstances

486
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,840
 and scenarios.

487
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,840
 Know that He's ultimately in control of everything in the universe.

488
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:57,680
 If you're going to pray at all, you're praying to the God of the Exodus, the one who steps

489
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:01,760
 into the slavery of this world and liberates His people from it."

490
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,760
 And so I want to just show you what He prays in Matthew 6 when He does the Lord's Prayer.

491
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,200
 Matthew 6, verses 9 and 10.

492
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,760
 "Do not belay them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him."

493
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,040
 Notice that, your Father knows what you need before you ask Him.

494
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,080
 So then this is how you should pray.

495
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,280
 "Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.

496
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:28,120
 Your kingdom come, your will be done on earth as it is in heaven."

497
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,640
 When Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane is facing His great moment of anguish, sweating

498
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,800
 blood, He's actually leaning back on the Lord's Prayer, the thing He taught His disciples.

499
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:42,160
 "Your kingdom come, your will be done."

500
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:47,160
 In other words, the heart of prayer for the Christian is not me-centric, it has to be

501
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,480
 God-centric.

502
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:53,520
 It has to be this prayer that's asking for God to come and do what only God can do.

503
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,160
 Asking God to come and bring His kingdom on earth.

504
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:02,040
 When we pray for God's kingdom to come, we're basically prophetically saying that my kingdom

505
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,760
 is not what I want.

506
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:05,760
 Notice this, church.

507
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,760
 Follow the logic here.

508
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:11,680
 See, when we take the Lord's Prayer seriously and we say, "Your kingdom come, your will

509
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,800
 be done," what we're saying is not, "I don't have emotions and feelings."

510
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,800
 No, we have emotions and feelings that we can express to God.

511
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:23,240
 But in that prayer, we're saying, "Ultimately, what we want in this world is God's reign,

512
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:26,280
 His power, His work, His life."

513
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:31,760
 The prayer of the Lord's Prayer is a release from the brokenness of our own will, and it's

514
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,880
 a placing of ourselves into the power of God's will.

515
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:42,680
 It's us saying, "I recognize that in my sin and my brokenness, my will, my desires are

516
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:46,120
 not always the ones that God wants.

517
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:51,520
 And while it's good for me to express what's on my heart before Him, ultimately, if I don't

518
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:59,160
 then submit myself in trust and love to Him, I'm just going to be a bull of frustration

519
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:04,760
 rather than a person of faith, working on behalf of the kingdom in the here and now.

520
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:13,080
 I need to move at some point from the "take this cup from me" to the "but your will be

521
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
 done."

522
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,160
 Are you following?

523
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:18,480
 And Jesus, what He's doing in the Garden of Gethsemane is He's processing this.

524
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,080
 He's showing us the process that if we don't let go, we're going to end up frustrated and

525
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,080
 weighed down.

526
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,720
 But if we can move from an expression to a place of trust, then God can actually begin

527
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,800
 to do what only God can do.

528
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:41,340
 About three months into me praying, "God, give me one sperm," and asking many people

529
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:47,760
 to fast and pray, God comes to me about three months in and He speaks to me very clearly.

530
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,400
 And it was one of those moments where you know when God steps in and says something

531
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:53,000
 and it's not what you thought you were going to hear, it's not what you were hoping to

532
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,440
 hear, but you know it's Him as soon as He says it.

533
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:58,920
 I want to read you what I wrote in my journal that time.

534
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:01,400
 "Andrew, let me teach you something about prayer.

535
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,400
 Your prayer should not be, 'God, give me one sperm.'

536
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:08,520
 Your prayer should be, 'God, make me into a man who's content whether I have children

537
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:11,120
 or not.'"

538
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,380
 That was about as far away from what I was feeling or thinking as possible.

539
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,140
 But I want you to hear God's heart here.

540
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,520
 He wasn't saying I wasn't going to have children.

541
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:26,600
 He was saying, "Andrew, I don't want you so frustrated over here with this me-centric

542
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,740
 give me, give me, give me."

543
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,160
 But actually, here's what I want to do.

544
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:35,840
 I want to come and I want to form and shape you into a person who's not dependent on whether

545
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,000
 your happiness and your joy is based on some circumstance in your life.

546
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,760
 I want you to be so liberated from the realities of tough and hard circumstances in life that

547
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:50,920
 you're able to be content whether you are still without children or whether I give you

548
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,000
 children, whether that happens or not, that's in my hands.

549
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,000
 But here's what I want for you.

550
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,320
 I want to make you into a person who's not dependent on whether your prayers get answered

551
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:02,880
 in the ways that you want them to be answered.

552
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,040
 Because I tell you what, you're going to pray much more powerfully.

553
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,400
 You're going to lead much more powerfully.

554
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:13,360
 You're going to speak much more powerfully if you're content with your will be done in

555
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,220
 your life.

556
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:21,160
 And so this call on me when I was at Bible school was to realize that although I wanted

557
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,600
 kids and I wanted God to heal me and I wanted the miracle and I didn't stop praying the

558
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:31,400
 miracle, I kept praying the miracle but I added something on after the miracle prayer.

559
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:36,120
 I kept praying God give me one sperm but then I said but Lord make me into a person who's

560
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,760
 content whether you move in a miracle or not.

561
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,500
 Because ultimately I'm here to serve you.

562
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:48,880
 What Jesus is doing in the Garden of Gethsemane is exactly the same thing.

563
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,960
 He's showing us that it's right to have the take the cup from me prayers but we are to

564
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:57,760
 marry those with the your will be done prayers.

565
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:03,440
 And when you bring the two of those together in prayer, that's a bold prayer.

566
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,280
 That's a courageous prayer.

567
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:09,480
 That's a prayer that actually changes things in my mind.

568
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:12,680
 And like I said at the beginning of the sermon, not necessarily changes our circumstance or

569
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:18,360
 situation, newsflash, I never fathered my own biological children to this day.

570
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,220
 Now if God gave me the miracle, I would probably have a problem with it.

571
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,280
 Back those days I wanted the miracle.

572
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,560
 Now probably less so as I turn 50.

573
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,280
 But we have an amazing 14 year old girl Mia who we adopted and we've got a family and

574
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:31,280
 it's amazing.

575
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
 It's not how I thought it was going to happen.

576
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,280
 God has provided not in the miracle per se that I was specifically asking for but in

577
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:42,320
 the realities of him knowing what was on my heart and what was on his heart.

578
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:48,880
 Your will be done is always going to bring your life into greater flourishing than this

579
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,440
 is what I demand.

580
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,600
 Are you following this?

581
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:59,000
 And when we kind of walk in this space, we get this glorious idea that we are to be called

582
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,800
 from a give me type prayer life to a make me type prayer life.

583
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,760
 And it's fascinating because you can do a study in scripture and you can see a lot of

584
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:14,160
 people in scripture move in this direction from give me to make me.

585
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:18,680
 One of the most profound examples is the parable of the prodigal son.

586
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,160
 That's a very famous parable for all of us.

587
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,720
 What happens at the beginning of the parable of the prodigal son?

588
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:28,260
 The son, the young son comes to his father and says, "Give me my inheritance now."

589
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,200
 It's a me-centric prayer that he had.

590
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,400
 Give me my inheritance now.

591
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,040
 But out of the place of going give me, he then goes through all the things he goes through.

592
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,680
 He goes through all the challenges of his life.

593
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,360
 He goes through all the things that turns his world upside down.

594
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:45,280
 Off the back of that, he then comes back to his father and notice what his prayer is when

595
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,660
 he meets his father for that first time after going away and squandering all his money.

596
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:53,200
 He comes back and he says, "Make me like one of your hired servants."

597
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,720
 In other words, I would rather serve in your household than be rebellious outside of it.

598
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:02,720
 He goes from a give me to a make me heart.

599
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,560
 And Jesus, as he's sweating blood on the Mount of Olives, he's wrestling with this and he

600
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:13,280
 shows us the beauty of going from a give me, make me, "Lord, take this cup, but your will

601
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,280
 be done."

602
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:20,680
 "Make me into a man," I think he's praying, "that is going to be able to walk to the cross.

603
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,000
 And although it's going to be hard, and although it's going to be painful, and although I'm

604
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,780
 going to feel all those emotions, but I'm going to be able to go there in the confidence

605
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:34,780
 of a person who's been set free because I'm no longer in the temptation of trying to make

606
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:37,860
 my future what I think is best.

607
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:44,040
 But I've released myself into the contentment of a future based in you."

608
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:50,280
 You see, this is why Jesus, it's quite interesting in this passage, twice he says to the disciples,

609
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:54,760
 he says, "Pray that you will not fall into temptation."

610
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:58,200
 What is Jesus saying there when he says to them, "Pray so that you don't fall into temptation."

611
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,440
 Here's what I think he's saying, "The temptation to try to control everything ourselves.

612
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,600
 The temptation to try to stay on that one side and think we know what's best.

613
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:15,300
 The temptation to only ever pray those give me kind of prayers."

614
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,400
 Jesus says, "Be careful that you don't fall into that temptation."

615
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,260
 And then he goes away and he admits that he is also struggling under that temptation with

616
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:24,260
 his God.

617
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:29,300
 "Take this cup from me," but then he moves beyond it, "Your will be done."

618
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:33,100
 And then he goes back to his disciples and says again, "Be careful you don't fall under

619
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,460
 that temptation."

620
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:37,540
 And here's what I sense is on God's heart as we finish this series at the beginning

621
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:38,540
 of the year.

622
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,980
 He's saying to you, "Don't fall under that temptation."

623
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
 It's absolutely right.

624
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,980
 Don't hear me wrong.

625
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,580
 I'm not saying stop those prayers.

626
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:48,740
 Remember, Jesus prayed the prayers, "Take this cup from me."

627
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:52,460
 There's nothing wrong with expressing our heart and demanding God and believing for

628
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,460
 a miracle.

629
00:37:53,460 --> 00:37:55,360
 Those prayers should be prayed for us.

630
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:58,180
 But if that's all we're doing, we've missed the point.

631
00:37:58,180 --> 00:38:02,400
 We pray the prayers and then we come to him and say, "But ultimately it's your will.

632
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,740
 In my brokenness, this is what I see.

633
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,800
 This is what I want.

634
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,780
 But God, I'm submitting 100% of my heart to you."

635
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:10,300
 That breaks control.

636
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,780
 That breaks anxiety.

637
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,140
 That breaks concern.

638
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,340
 That breaks burden.

639
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:20,840
 Because even though if our circumstances don't change, something has changed in us.

640
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,100
 Something has liberated us.

641
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:32,340
 And it may still be really hard, but suddenly the anxiety, the pain, the frustration has

642
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,560
 gone and what has been in its place now is a liberated love.

643
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,240
 A peace that can only come from the hand of God.

644
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,140
 A place of saying, "Your will be done.

645
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:46,480
 And if this continues, then I trust."

646
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:52,400
 What Jesus does here is he basically shows us that we let go of control through an embrace

647
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,920
 of trust.

648
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:58,860
 That's what the "Your will be done" prayer is all about.

649
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:02,240
 And so for you at the start of this year, that's the journey I think is here in this

650
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,860
 moment for you.

651
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:10,320
 As we finish a series on being bold in prayer, this is the call that I think Jesus models

652
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,840
 for us.

653
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:18,280
 The space to ask and to plead and to believe that God can change the circumstance, but

654
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:24,320
 the desire that even if he doesn't do that, you will still serve him, love him, look to

655
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,880
 him, be faithful to him and trust that he has it all in his hands.

656
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:31,320
 Like the three that went into the fire, I think God's going to deliver us from this

657
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
 fire.

658
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:38,160
 But even if he doesn't, we're not bowing down to the God you want us to bow down to.

659
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,080
 Your will be done.

660
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,320
 So if you're carrying frustrations, if you're carrying anxieties, if you're starting this

661
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,440
 year with some pretty big prayers and you found yourself getting drained because you're

662
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,040
 doing all the "give me" prayers, but it doesn't seem like God is answering, maybe the invitation

663
00:39:54,040 --> 00:40:00,520
 here is to shift, to hold in your heart those prayers, but to add the "make me" bit.

664
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,240
 Make me into a person that can stand up to this trial.

665
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,560
 Make me into the person who's going to serve your will no matter what you do.

666
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,600
 I want that too.

667
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,000
 And I want to pray for that for you in this moment.

668
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,440
 So I wonder whether we could just close our eyes and as we close our eyes, we invite the

669
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,280
 Holy Spirit just to come.

670
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:25,360
 Lord, we thank you that your presence has been here throughout this service so beautifully,

671
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,360
 so tenderly.

672
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:32,640
 And Lord, I know that there are many people here in this room that, Lord, that their prayer

673
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,960
 life has perhaps been in this place of frustration.

674
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,280
 Perhaps there's something big that's happening and they're desperately in need of your word,

675
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,120
 your voice, your help.

676
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:51,080
 Just like Jesus who says, "Take this cup from me," they're crying out and asking you, God,

677
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,080
 to do the impossible.

678
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,280
 Father, we want to pray for anyone in this room right now where that's their case.

679
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:04,800
 We want to ask, Lord, that you would come alongside of them now.

680
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,000
 That you would come alongside of them now by your grace and your beauty and you would

681
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:15,800
 meet them just in the anguish, the sweating of blood of their garden of Gethsemane, whatever

682
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,500
 that might be.

683
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:25,280
 And Father, as you meet them there, I want to pray that the whisper of your love and

684
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,800
 your grace and your shalom, your peace, your liberation would come.

685
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:35,960
 Lord, we pray to the God of the Exodus in this moment, the one who has the power to

686
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:38,720
 liberate and to set free.

687
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:42,840
 And Father, we pray that for each person here that they would come under now in this moment,

688
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,800
 the God of the Exodus.

689
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,880
 And Father, I believe that you want to take some people here in this room from a give

690
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,200
 me to make me moment.

691
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:57,340
 I believe that as they walk out of here in a few moments time, they're going to walk

692
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:03,480
 out of here different to how they came in, liberated from the burden, the anxiety.

693
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:07,680
 And Lord, you may or may not change the circumstance, but in this moment, I believe you want to

694
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,440
 change them.

695
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,440
 So if this has been helpful to you in some way here this morning, here's what I'd love

696
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,600
 for us to do is just very calmly and easily just to open your hands where you're sat.

697
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:25,960
 You know, here at the Vine, we do this posture a lot when we want to respond to what it is

698
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,200
 that the Holy Spirit is ministering to us.

699
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:33,480
 By opening our hands, it's just a simple way of us saying, "Holy Spirit, would you come?

700
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,400
 Father, this is for me.

701
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:42,360
 Lord, I want to receive in this moment."

702
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:45,760
 And this won't be per se for everybody, but there'll be some people here where you're

703
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:50,760
 knowing this is a word for me in season right at the start of the year.

704
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,000
 And I need to go from a give me to a make me.

705
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,080
 I want to be liberated.

706
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,600
 I want to feel thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

707
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,920
 Lord, give me the trust.

708
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,320
 Give me the faith.

709
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:12,000
 And that's you just want to encourage you just to open your hands as our eyes are closed.

710
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,100
 And I want to just invite the Holy Spirit to come and minister to every person whose

711
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,100
 hands are open.

712
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:21,440
 Thank you, Lord, that you love them so much.

713
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,760
 And so whilst you're sat there with your hands open, if that's you, in a moment, I want to

714
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,200
 encourage the people around you whose hands are not open, and they're going to start to

715
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,200
 pray for you.

716
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,520
 You know, there's power like we did with June earlier with the laying on of hands and the

717
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,760
 stretching out of hands.

718
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,760
 And I believe that many of you in this room will want to be prayed for a minister to now.

719
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,280
 And so as well as the people standing around you, if there are pastors, leaders here, they

720
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:48,360
 can also go and pray for people as well.

721
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,320
 Maybe we can just begin to do that.

722
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:54,040
 So if you want to receive prayer, perhaps for anything that the Holy Spirit has been

723
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,560
 speaking to you about, just open your hands.

724
00:43:55,560 --> 00:44:00,640
 And then if your hands are not open, then in a moment you can look around you and maybe

725
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:03,600
 see if there's somebody around you that's got their hands open and you can begin to

726
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:10,960
 pray for them and just begin to invite the Holy Spirit to minister to them, to strengthen

727
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,360
 them, to meet them in their place of anguish or challenge and to bring a liberation through

728
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,800
 God's grace.

729
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:22,800
 So let's do that now.

730
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:26,480
 We're going to just take some time to do this in our service.

731
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,760
 So hands open if you'd like prayer.

732
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:33,720
 Otherwise, please be thinking about who you can be praying for in this moment.

733
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:37,080
