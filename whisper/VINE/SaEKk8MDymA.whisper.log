[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   ♪ You sink or swim, I'm the one ♪
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.040]   - Cool, we're back.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   I just have a couple of announcements for all of us.
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.400]   Oh, my throat is not doing too well today.
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.120]   Just a couple of announcements for us this week.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.840]   There are a few things we want to bring to your attention.
[00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.520]   There are things that we,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.840]   there's different events we want to see you at.
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.600]   First one, it's our prayer meeting.
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.720]   So anybody has been to a church prayer meeting before?
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.000]   It happens every month.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.780]   It's happening again this Tuesday evening.
[00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.320]   And this month we have a special theme.
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.860]   It's about the good news in Christ alone.
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.720]   As you know, we're going through the book of Galatians
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.720]   in a sermon series,
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.580]   and we would have a bit of time,
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.280]   spending some time in the Word,
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.960]   and allow the Word to lead us into a time of prayer as well.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   Of course, there will be a facilitator,
[00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.640]   and I believe that will be Deborah this month.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.720]   And so I do want to invite you all
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.560]   to come and join us in prayer.
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.560]   And next week, there's going to be bring your own lunch.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.080]   It's a monthly event.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:14.240]   We do this every month to what's like end of month,
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.160]   or maybe the fourth week of the month.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.520]   It's a great opportunity for us to not just meet people
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.360]   whom we always sit next to,
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.800]   but you will see different people in the church.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.000]   A couple weeks ago, maybe two weeks ago,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.080]   we had a volunteer appreciation event,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.140]   and I saw everyone.
[00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.040]   I'm like, "Yes, I know this person, I know that person."
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.400]   But when I was there, I saw two people.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.600]   They just talked to each other
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.280]   and started to introduce themselves and say,
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.280]   "Hi, my name is A."
[00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:41.280]   "Oh, yes, my name."
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.600]   I'm like, "You two don't know each other?
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.320]   "Oh, that's new for me."
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.680]   And I just realized, yes, as a church, it's growing.
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.560]   We have more people here,
[00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.520]   and so we do want to stay in touch with all of you.
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.520]   But at the same time, we do also want to build this moment
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.360]   for us to connect with each other,
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.160]   with people whom you don't normally sit with at the service,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.120]   you don't normally talk to.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.760]   Yes, of course, you don't talk to people at the service,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.640]   right?
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.480]   You don't, right?
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.600]   Yeah, 'cause we don't talk to people at the service.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.860]   Anyway, but anyway, yes, that's our heart.
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.080]   We do want to connect all of us,
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.260]   because church is not a 90-minute service on a Sunday.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.000]   It's not just you sitting here listening to someone
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.520]   or just following the lyrics on the screen.
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.840]   Church is a community.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.400]   It's the people of God.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.040]   And if we don't get to know one another,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.160]   how can we become a community, right?
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.220]   So our heart is to build up this community
[00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.640]   for us to get to know one another
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.360]   so we can support one another,
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.700]   we can pray with one another,
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.040]   and we could just simply talk to,
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.860]   have lunch with one another.
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.200]   That's what we want to do.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.200]   So next Sunday after the English service,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.120]   and you can just go and grab some lunch and come back.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.960]   If you could stay and help us set this place up,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.700]   that's amazing as well.
[00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.440]   Bring your own lunch next Sunday.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.440]   We do also have a very exciting event coming up.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.040]   If there are any young people in your family,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.560]   any young people, like you know any young people,
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.000]   or if you feel you're still very young,
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.680]   okay, we do have an age limit though, yes.
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.240]   We're launching, anyway,
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.020]   we're launching a youth ministry event.
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.160]   This is gonna be the first one.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.520]   It's on, is that a date?
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.160]   No, there's no date here, okay.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.920]   But because we want you to pay attention
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.960]   to the announcement, so I'm gonna tell you the date.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.200]   It's on the 30th of June.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.160]   That will be the last Sunday of this month,
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.880]   and you, okay, maybe not every one of you,
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.080]   but if you're under 18, maybe 12 to 18, around this age,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.120]   we do want to invite you to come along.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.520]   And if you have any teenagers around you,
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.800]   we would love you to invite them
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.440]   to come to this meeting as well.
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.880]   We're starting a youth group.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.840]   We do want to have fun with our young people,
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.280]   and we do want to experience the love of God with them.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.280]   So yes, if you are a teenager, you can sign up directly.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.620]   If you're not a teenager, but you know some teenager,
[00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.160]   you can also sign up for them.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.840]   And we do want you to sign up,
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.120]   because you know, there are a lot of people
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.840]   who want to volunteer, but we do want to keep the ratio
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.580]   between volunteers and young people
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.720]   to an appropriate ratio, you know?
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.280]   You don't want to overwhelm young people
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.160]   with like 15 adults standing here, and you know.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.620]   So the only way the adults could join,
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.080]   it's when we have enough teenagers there.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.440]   So a lot of adults, they actually want to join in
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.400]   to volunteer.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.600]   If you could register in advance,
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.440]   then we know we have enough numbers of young people,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.720]   then we can say, yes, loving adults,
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.360]   you're welcome to join us,
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.480]   and you can have pizzas with us as well.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.120]   I guess that's why they come, right?
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.900]   So yes, please, if you know you could attend,
[00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.380]   please do sign up in advance.
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.900]   We'd love to see the young people there.
[00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.860]   And so sign up for the young people around you as well.
[00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.820]   Okay, that's all for this week.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.300]   We're gonna enter into another round of worship
[00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.780]   through our offering today.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:10.100]   Our welcome team, they will be passing on the buckets
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.940]   at the moment.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.280]   If you are giving by cash or checks,
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.180]   and these are just physical ways,
[00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.780]   you can put it in the buckets.
[00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.760]   If you are scanning,
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.420]   QR codes using digital ways, they are all on the screen.
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.420]   I was told the Alipay QR code may not be working.
[00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:31.980]   If you can use other means, that would be great.
[00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.940]   If not, you may have to try,
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.060]   and if it doesn't work,
[00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.880]   you have to give us some time to try and fix it.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.520]   We just spotted it like minutes ago.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.460]   But yeah, shall we pray for our offering?
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.440]   Let's do that.
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:51.120]   Father, we just wanna thank you for your love,
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.240]   your generosity in our lives,
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:56.360]   and we wanna thank you for being there,
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.160]   showing up in our lives,
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.840]   and we wanna thank you for the sacrificial love
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.920]   that is witnessed on the cross of Jesus.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:08.120]   And so today, Father, we come before you with thanksgiving,
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.000]   with a heart of gratitude.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.280]   We also pray that the things that we sow into the bucket,
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.800]   or we sow into the church community,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.760]   we pray that these resources will be multiplied,
[00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:21.960]   and it will be able to bless those around us
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.720]   in this community, in this city,
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.920]   and we pray all that in Jesus' name.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:28.760]   Everybody say, amen.
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.120]   Amen.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.320]   It's my honor and pleasure to introduce our speaker today.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.480]   She comes from Wan Chai.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.960]   You may have met her before.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:40.040]   She comes occasionally.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:43.720]   Let's welcome Pastor Jennifer onto the stage.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:44.560]   - Hi.
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:45.400]   (audience applauding)
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.800]   - It's good to see you all again.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.880]   - Yes. - After three months,
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.680]   I think. - Three months.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.400]   It's been so long. - Yeah.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.040]   - Were you at the Chinese or English last time?
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:55.160]   - Cantonese. - Cantonese.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.480]   So it's been even longer for our English congregation.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.600]   So if you don't know yet,
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.960]   Pastor Jennifer, she's one of the pastors in Wan Chai.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.960]   If you don't know yet,
[00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:08.600]   we do have a church also called The Vine in Wan Chai.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.640]   They planted us.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.840]   So we, yes, we're one church,
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:13.440]   but in two different locations,
[00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:17.480]   and that's why we can invite our Wan Chai pastors
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.680]   to come and preach occasionally.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:22.440]   So why don't we stretch our hands to Pastor Jennifer?
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.960]   Let's pray for her.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.880]   Father, we thank you for Pastor Jennifer,
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:26.720]   for who she is,
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   for her heart to bring your word to your people.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.720]   And so today, Father, we just pray
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:36.560]   that you would speak through her loud and clear.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:39.240]   You would bring forth this message
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.800]   through not just her lips,
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.440]   but also through who she is, her whole being.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.200]   And we pray that you would anoint our ears
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.880]   to listen to this message,
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.120]   to follow your word.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:49.840]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.680]   - Amen. - Amen.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.960]   - Thank you, Chapman.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:55.360]   Good to see you all, and happy Father's Day.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:00.360]   And I hope you guys will enjoy celebrating Father's Day.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:03.240]   So why don't I just start off
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.400]   with telling a little bit about my father.
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.160]   So if I have to describe my dad,
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:12.320]   he has always been a very handy person.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.880]   He likes assembling things at home.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.200]   He likes fixing things.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:17.400]   Sometimes when I leave home,
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.160]   go to work and go back home,
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:20.680]   something is fixed in my room,
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.560]   and that's amazing, right?
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:27.560]   So growing up, he has been helping me a lot in that area.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.880]   But on the other hand,
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:33.760]   when he sees me doing things like that,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.800]   maybe screwing things at home,
[00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.640]   maybe opening a can or opening a coconut,
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.320]   he will say, "Why are you so foolish
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:46.200]   "that you are doing it in a wrong way,
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.120]   "wasting all your energy to do that?
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:50.320]   "Let me do it."
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.560]   And then I'm like, "Okay, sure."
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:56.400]   And I'm a happy fool since at the end he would help me
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.600]   and I don't need to do that stuff.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.240]   But it's not always a happy experience
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:05.000]   to be called foolish, right?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.720]   I wonder how would you feel
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.200]   when someone call you foolish in any occasion?
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.840]   And why am I starting off like this?
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   Because as we continue to read Galatians together,
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:22.640]   in chapter three is our today's passage,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.080]   Paul starts off with calling the Galatians foolish.
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:30.720]   And like when Paul,
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:32.840]   like last time we went,
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.520]   Tim went through the chapter two with us
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:39.440]   and like saying that we die to a new way to live.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.600]   And Paul continues to explain
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:44.560]   what's the new way to live by the Holy Spirit.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.000]   So Paul was calling them foolish
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.600]   because they neglect the Holy Spirit
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.720]   and make a confrontation to them.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:56.200]   So this is the passage that we're going through.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.720]   So let's take a deeper look
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.000]   into first one to five in chapter three.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   So, "You foolish Galatians who has bewitched you.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.160]   "It was before your eyes
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:14.160]   "that Jesus Christ was publicly exhibited and as crucified.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:18.600]   "The only thing I want to learn from you is this.
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:22.880]   "Did you receive the Spirit by doing the works of law
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:26.520]   "or by believing what you heard?
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.080]   "Are you so foolish?
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:31.560]   "Having started with the Spirit,
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.360]   "are you now ending with the flesh?
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.840]   "Did you experience so much for nothing?
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.560]   "If it really was for nothing,
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.360]   "well then, does God supply you with the Spirit
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.640]   "and work miracles among you
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.800]   "by your doing the works of law
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:52.360]   "or by your believing what you heard?"
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:55.800]   So we see that Paul is asking the Galatians
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.320]   many questions in one go
[00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.960]   and then like, oh, we're in trouble
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.480]   if someone speaks to us like that.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.480]   But as we know that when Paul is writing a letter,
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:10.760]   he is always addressing some issues in a church.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:15.120]   So in this passage, we see from the questions that he asks,
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:18.040]   Paul is addressing the issue of legalism.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.560]   He is arguing against a belief that the Spirit
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:26.000]   is received by doing the works of law.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.120]   And so that we know that there were teachings
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:33.520]   in Galatians perhaps that Christians need
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.800]   to observe the Jewish law
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.840]   and maybe they need to get circumcised as well.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:42.280]   So to address this belief,
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:45.440]   Paul is asking the Christians in Galatia
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.480]   to recall the experience.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.840]   Like actually, how did you receive the Spirit
[00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.000]   in the beginning?
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.720]   Maybe that's the questions for us too.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.040]   How did we receive at the beginning?
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:01.040]   And so we see that Paul assumes that we should know
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:06.640]   that we receive the Holy Spirit by our believing in Jesus,
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.360]   not by the works of law, right?
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   And which is very critical to both Galatians and to us all.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.640]   We must understand that the Spirit,
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:21.500]   the Holy Spirit is given to all the believers
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.480]   from the day we believe in Jesus
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.720]   instead of what we have done.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.480]   In other words, we can never earn the Holy Spirit.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.620]   It is by the grace of God that we receive Him.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.400]   And it is the intention of God
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.120]   to send the Holy Spirit to us as well
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.880]   as what Jesus said in John,
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.000]   the Holy Spirit, he called him as a helper
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.720]   which is sent to us.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.880]   As we start living as Christians,
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.120]   like when we recall our very first experience
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:56.040]   as a Christian, we don't know what to do, right?
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:58.660]   We don't know as Christians how we should act,
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:02.100]   how we should pray, how we should have our relationship
[00:13:02.100 --> 00:13:04.320]   with Jesus and with other people.
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.560]   So that's why God sent us a helper to do that,
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.840]   to give us guidance.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:14.340]   Maybe like when we start this new way of living,
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:17.560]   the Holy Spirit does not only give us guidance
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:20.100]   and also the strength, the energy,
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.560]   whatever we need when we are in this spiritual journey.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:26.340]   So isn't it amazing, right?
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.460]   Having the Holy Spirit with us.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.380]   And so this is why in verse four,
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:33.420]   Paul asked whether they are foolish
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:35.700]   because we already have the Spirit, right?
[00:13:35.700 --> 00:13:37.860]   Are you still doing the works of flaw?
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:42.860]   And this is also the meaning of like finishing by the flesh,
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.860]   which means we are using our energy,
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:48.380]   our strength to try to please God
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:53.260]   and try to follow the law, the Jewish law to do our work.
[00:13:53.260 --> 00:13:58.260]   And so, Paul is speaking against those
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:04.640]   who try to operate their faith through the works of law.
[00:14:04.640 --> 00:14:09.100]   This was what happened before God sent the Holy Spirit
[00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.900]   and the Jewish people,
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.780]   they needed to follow the laws as a community.
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:18.860]   Indeed, the law give us guidance on how we live,
[00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:21.460]   but we need to operate with our own strength.
[00:14:21.460 --> 00:14:24.220]   Like the law is there, but we need to use our strength,
[00:14:24.220 --> 00:14:26.500]   use our understanding to understand them
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.540]   and use our strength to follow them as well.
[00:14:29.540 --> 00:14:33.980]   And we see here, like comparing to the new way
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:36.540]   that we have received the Holy Spirit,
[00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.300]   the Holy Spirit will give us the guidance
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:42.880]   and give us the strength to follow the will of God.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.140]   The old way is we see the laws,
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.580]   but we use our own strength to follow it.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.260]   This is the comparison that Paul is trying to do.
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:55.500]   So we might wonder what is wrong,
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:57.300]   like by observing the law,
[00:14:57.300 --> 00:15:00.860]   the law is given by God himself, right?
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:07.340]   So I would say, indeed, the law is written and given by God,
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:12.180]   but the law is not God himself.
[00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:15.160]   But the Holy Spirit is.
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   And there's always limitation in legal writing or in law
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.560]   because they are limited by the context and culture.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:26.360]   Just imagine back in those days,
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.320]   they won't know what is aviation law.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.640]   They won't know what is IT or internet security.
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:36.320]   That is a limitation in the law
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.600]   because we can't understand the law
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.940]   without culture and without situation.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:45.160]   So maybe it's a little bit vague to understand that.
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:48.200]   So let me share an example
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.960]   when I worked in the legal industry.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.960]   So before I started working as a staff at the fine,
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:58.880]   I was a paralegal in our company.
[00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.000]   So that means I worked for a legal department.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:06.120]   Most of my colleagues, they don't have a legal background.
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:09.720]   So only myself and the lawyer, we have the legal background
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:12.560]   and we kind of oversee the legal issues
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.320]   of the whole company.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.320]   So apart from reviewing all the contracts we need to do,
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.000]   one of the major duty of us
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.640]   were to review the internal policies
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.440]   and to train my colleagues on this knowledge
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:34.600]   and why they need to follow that policies.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:38.560]   So my company has a Asian background.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.020]   I won't say which region so that you can't guess.
[00:16:41.020 --> 00:16:47.120]   But yeah, and then I was reviewing and writing the policy
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:49.760]   for privacy and personal data.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:52.720]   And then I need to do a training with them as well.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:57.720]   So as Asians, sometimes we might not be super sensitive
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:01.960]   about respecting people's personal life
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:04.480]   or maybe we ask questions about family
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:07.240]   without noticing that they might not feel comfortable
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.240]   with sharing with that.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.400]   That was the situation of my company among my colleagues.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:13.840]   So that's why I needed to write that policy
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.640]   and try to educate them.
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.320]   So when I was doing the training with them,
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:22.800]   I share like, oh, we need to respect other people's privacy.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:26.680]   So if people are not very comfortable with sharing,
[00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:29.640]   like try not to ask them too personal questions
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:32.240]   or don't expect that they must answer you,
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:35.000]   your question regarding their privacy.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.280]   And also you need to know that you also have a right
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.560]   not to tell other people about your privacy as well.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:46.280]   I think I was like doing my best to explain that to them
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.920]   and try to make it very clear with all the examples.
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:51.400]   And then after the training, I asked them like,
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:53.720]   so what's about the new policy?
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:57.920]   And then they said, so I can never ask people's privacy.
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:17:58.760]   Right?
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.600]   And I'm like, oh gosh, why?
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.920]   But I really learned a lot how people,
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.080]   how human learn about this stuff,
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.920]   because not everyone is a professional on legal knowledge
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:16.920]   that I need to explain it in a way that other people can,
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.080]   like they people can understand.
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:23.480]   And then I realized like, it's a very much a human tendency
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:27.560]   that we reduce something as a concept
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:29.520]   to something that what we should do
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.200]   or what we should not do.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:35.600]   It is way easier for people to understand like that.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:40.120]   And this can happen to our faith as Christians as well.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:43.840]   Sometimes we might just reduce God's wills
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.120]   to some laws or rules and be satisfied
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.640]   with following instructions in our faith journey.
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:54.400]   And which is why Paul is trying to write this letter
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.760]   to the Galatians.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:19:00.800]   So going back to Paul's argument,
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.240]   the law itself is not bad.
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   However, if our faith is operated through observing the law,
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:09.960]   we are going backward.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.200]   We are going back to the old way.
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:15.840]   And this is the issues that concerns him.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:19.960]   So how do we not continue our faith with our flesh
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.680]   is somewhat like the important questions
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:25.080]   that we need to explore today.
[00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:27.920]   I would say first thing, we need to acknowledge
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.920]   that our faith is never about just obeying the laws
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:36.280]   or living a restricted life.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.120]   And, but it is a relationship with God.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.640]   We live a life which is centered by God.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.880]   And we do not maintain any type of relationship
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.280]   just by following instructions or laws, right?
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:54.680]   Instead, we need to understand the person.
[00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:57.800]   We need to understand God's.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:01.360]   Thinking God's will and God's heart for us,
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:05.720]   which was the original purpose of the law.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:09.360]   It allows us to understand God a little bit
[00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.640]   and what pleases him.
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:15.640]   Like what is it look like to be living as a God's people,
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.040]   as a community together.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:24.040]   But let's bear in mind that God did not give his spirit
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.720]   before Jesus resurrected.
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:30.080]   So it only happened after the resurrection of Jesus.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:35.000]   Imagine that like there was no law at all given by Moses.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.560]   God just tell them like, you need to love me
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:41.440]   with all your heart or your mind and love your neighbor.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.360]   And this very ambiguous, right?
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.360]   Just by hearing that maybe there are
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:50.960]   1 million different interpretations on this commandment,
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.320]   how to love God.
[00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:55.680]   So there was a purpose of the laws
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.320]   to give us a little bit more details
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.640]   in a more concrete way that how we exactly,
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.120]   what we can do to love God and love our neighbor
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:09.120]   as a community of God's people.
[00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.400]   So, but now we have, and the Galatians
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.520]   have received the spirit.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:20.040]   And the spirit is God himself.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:23.720]   So receiving the spirit means that he himself
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.920]   can give us the guidance, he himself can teach us
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.840]   on how exactly we can understand his will
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.560]   according to each person's journey, right?
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.840]   Each person will understand him in a different way,
[00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:38.000]   interact him with a different way.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.600]   So why would the Christians ignore the Holy Spirit
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:44.800]   and try to please him with our own effort
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:49.800]   to observe the laws and with our own strength?
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:54.840]   So Paul gives us a little bit more explanation
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.720]   on this area.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:00.760]   So let's continue to read the passage
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:03.520]   from verse six to verse 14.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:09.000]   Just as Abraham believed God,
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:12.560]   and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.960]   So you see, those who believe
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.800]   are the descendants of Abraham.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.520]   And the scripture, for seeing that God would justify
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:26.960]   the Gentiles by faith, declared the gospel beforehand
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:30.400]   to Abraham, saying, "All the Gentiles
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:33.080]   "shall be blessed in you."
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:35.520]   For this reason, those who believe
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:39.240]   are blessed with Abraham who believed.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:44.160]   For all who rely on the works of law are under a curse,
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:47.520]   for it is written, "Cursed is everyone
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:51.040]   "who does not observe and obey all the things
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:53.320]   "written in the book of the law."
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:58.360]   Now it is evident that no one is justified
[00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:02.880]   before God by the law, for the one who is righteous
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:05.120]   will live by faith.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.520]   But the law does not rest on faith.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:11.520]   On the contrary, whoever does the works of law
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   will live by them.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.720]   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.360]   by becoming a curse for us.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:22.440]   For it is written, "Cursed is everyone
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.640]   "who hangs on a tree."
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:27.360]   In order that in Christ Jesus,
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:30.960]   the blessing of Abraham might come to Gentiles
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.920]   so that we might receive the promise
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:36.120]   of the spirit through faith.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:38.160]   It is a little bit long and complicated,
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:40.600]   but I will try to make it simple for us all
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.040]   to understand this passage.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.640]   So Paul quoted Deuteronomy and tried to
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.560]   associate relying on the works of law
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:51.120]   with being cursed.
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:53.440]   So this is the first thing he was trying to say.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.920]   But why would Paul say so?
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.120]   He himself was a Pharisee, so he was like,
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.960]   study the laws as well.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:02.720]   And I think there are two reasons.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.800]   Firstly, if we are familiar with the law,
[00:24:06.800 --> 00:24:09.360]   with the Mosaic law, Jewish law,
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:12.920]   we know that it would be impossible
[00:24:12.920 --> 00:24:16.680]   to obey all the things written in the book of law, right?
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.640]   I think we all agree that it is impossible
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:23.520]   to just observe all the laws written in the Bible.
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.520]   And so if we rely our faith on doing the works of law,
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:32.680]   we will never be righteous before God.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:35.040]   And we are still in the condition
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:37.640]   that we are not redeemed yet.
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.680]   And secondly, and which is more importantly,
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:43.480]   if we rely on the works of law,
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:47.160]   behind that it is a mindset that we believe
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.120]   that we are sufficient before God by obeying his law.
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:54.960]   And we believe that we are capable
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:24:58.480]   to be righteous with our own effort.
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:02.760]   Eventually, pride will be developed in this mindset,
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   which is why Paul says, ending with the flesh in verse three.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:13.520]   But the reality is we can never be righteous before God
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.280]   with our own effort as humans.
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:21.160]   And again, Paul is comparing this mindset with the faith
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.360]   and used Abraham as an example in the scripture.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:28.840]   So Paul says, Abraham believed God
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.920]   and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:36.640]   So Abraham is not righteous or blameless
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.240]   from what he has done.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.800]   When we read Genesis, we will see that Abraham
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:45.520]   has done something immoral as well.
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.520]   He had lied to the Pharaoh that Sarah is his sister
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:53.520]   so that he can preserve his life.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:56.560]   And also from his family dynamic,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.560]   he has done things that make the situation very complicated
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.720]   and both Sarah and Hagar and also the two sons suffered.
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:10.920]   But God does not reckon him righteous
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:15.480]   because he handled everything perfectly, blamelessly,
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:17.760]   but it is his faith.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:21.720]   We see that whenever God speaks to Abraham,
[00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:26.720]   he is willing to obey and he is willing to do the commands
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.360]   that God has given him,
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.640]   like even though he might not understand
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:36.280]   why he needs to do that, including sacrificing Isaac.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:39.640]   So we see that this is how faith operates.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:43.480]   It's not about being perfect or blameless before God,
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.640]   but it is our faith just to follow God
[00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.960]   whenever he speaks to us and obey him
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:53.960]   whenever he give us the guidance
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:56.400]   or the direction that we need to follow.
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:27:02.520]   So, and now we are also justified by God, just like Abraham.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:07.160]   And we are called to be the descendants of Abraham
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.520]   and be blessed with Abraham.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.480]   Now we may wonder what does it mean by being blessed?
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.080]   So let's look at Isaiah chapter 43, verse three,
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.160]   and it will give a little bit ideas
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.960]   on what it means to be blessed.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:28.320]   So first three of Isaiah chapter 44,
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.800]   for I will pour water on the thirsty land
[00:27:31.800 --> 00:27:34.520]   and streams of the dry ground.
[00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:38.560]   I will pour out my spirit on your offspring
[00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:41.120]   and my blessing on your descendants.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:45.320]   So from Isaiah, we see that scriptures
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.840]   actually links Abraham's blessings
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:51.880]   and the pouring out of the spirit.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.600]   So which means the promise has already come.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.480]   And before the promise has come,
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:05.200]   Jesus, no, before Jesus has redeemed us,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.920]   we are cursed by the law, but now the promise has come.
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:13.520]   We are blessed and also we have received the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:15.240]   So why would a redeemed person
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.040]   would want to go back to the cursed life?
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.360]   He has made the Holy Spirit
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   for whoever believes him to receive.
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.280]   And receiving the Holy Spirit means
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.520]   he is teaching us what is right, what is wrong himself.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.080]   And he is teaching us to how to live a life
[00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:37.080]   that glorifies him as well.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.160]   This is very important as we continue in our faith journey.
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   So indeed, no, as we continue to operate our life
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.520]   by doing the works of law,
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:55.120]   we are not continuing our faith journey
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:58.000]   without faith in Jesus.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Instead, we need to today live under the conviction
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:04.240]   of the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:06.400]   This is the new way that we live.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:11.480]   But I mean, it might seem a little bit distant to us.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.640]   For us today in Hong Kong, we might not observe the...
[00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:17.320]   I think most of us won't, right?
[00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:18.640]   We do not, right?
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.680]   We eat pork, right?
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:27.240]   And we will not believe that we can be blameless before God
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.080]   just by observing the laws of Hong Kong, right?
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:32.960]   Because it is not written by God.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.720]   So we might not be super, like,
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.720]   find it relevant to ourself to observe the law,
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.960]   comparing with our faith.
[00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:47.800]   But the works of law can appear differently to us today.
[00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:53.960]   Legalism and pride of believing we are sufficient
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.520]   before God can appear other than the works of law.
[00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:01.360]   For example, maybe following the Christian's customs
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.160]   or traditions, or following people's expectations
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.280]   on how we define a good Christian,
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:12.720]   or like just to maintain our faith
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.640]   by our spiritual discipline.
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:17.880]   These could be the works of law looks like today.
[00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:21.400]   For example, when we come to Sunday service
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.400]   or CG every week, we pray and do our devotion every day
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:28.640]   or doing our tithe every month.
[00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:31.960]   These are the things that we do as Christians, right?
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.600]   And these things also form us as a Christian community
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:39.640]   and are the importance for us to do.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:43.440]   But it will be an issue that we believe
[00:30:43.440 --> 00:30:47.440]   doing all those things equals to our faith.
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:53.000]   As I said before, our faith is not just only doing things
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.800]   or following some instructions by our pastors
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.000]   or by the law, by the Bible.
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   It is like by our conviction, by the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.280]   And if we are just following, like,
[00:31:10.280 --> 00:31:13.480]   the human definitions of a good Christian,
[00:31:13.480 --> 00:31:17.720]   we can start feeling that we are sufficient before God.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:22.720]   We are like good children of God
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:25.000]   by just doing these things.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.400]   And we start to feel good because what we do
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:31.560]   matches the category of what a Christian looks like
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.080]   and forget that we need the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.560]   in us and among us.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.440]   It almost feel like maybe we have a to-do list
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.280]   as a Christians.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:43.840]   We checked when we go to Sunday service.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:46.440]   We checked when we pray tonight.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:51.440]   But if we are just doing that to maintain our image
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:55.360]   as a Christian, we are turning away
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:59.160]   from living under the Holy Spirit's conviction
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.800]   and to fulfill just the items on our to-do list.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:05.520]   And again, I'm not saying that if the Holy Spirit in us,
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:06.720]   we don't need to pray at all.
[00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:08.560]   We don't need to go to a Sunday service.
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.840]   Not like that.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.480]   But more of our perspective of seeing them
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.880]   and how we position them.
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:20.280]   All the things we do will help us to know the heart of God
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:24.440]   and also to help us to grow spiritually in Him
[00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:26.520]   and be more like Jesus.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:29.240]   But ultimately, it is the Holy Spirit and God
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.480]   who make us grow and bring changes in our lives.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:36.960]   So as we grow to get to know Jesus better,
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.640]   we know our faith is more than just doing
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.040]   the spiritual things in our life.
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.840]   But whatever we do, we do them for Jesus.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:49.080]   And our whole life is oriented to Jesus.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:51.760]   This is the ideal world of our faith.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.480]   But sometimes we might feel that we need to use
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.280]   our own strength because I'm too busy.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.200]   I don't know what I'm even doing in my work and family.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   And I just need to use my own strength
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.160]   to continue to follow Jesus.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   And forgetting about being convicted by the Holy Spirit,
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:14.840]   forgetting about our daily conversation
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:16.280]   and relationship with Him.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.920]   And I have those days too.
[00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:21.520]   I have busy days that I might just forget.
[00:33:21.520 --> 00:33:24.320]   And using our strength to just push through
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.880]   in my faith as well.
[00:33:26.880 --> 00:33:29.640]   And I want to share my story.
[00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:33.040]   A few years ago when I was still in seminary.
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:36.480]   So I might have shared my story that I got rejected
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:39.560]   by seminary to do a full-time program.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.520]   And then it was the time that I felt very lost
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.160]   and I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:49.080]   And I don't want to continue my part-time study
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:52.000]   as I got rejected by my seminary already.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.160]   But since I am still going to church,
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:33:56.840]   I need to be accountable.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:33:59.560]   I need to explain to my pastors and my peers
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:01.520]   that what am I doing.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:04.520]   So I've decided I just continue my study
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:07.960]   because I want to maintain my image as a good Christian.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:09.120]   So that's what I did.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.240]   Even though I was struggling,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.040]   I still go to school every week.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:16.160]   I try to follow what the professors were saying.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.400]   But I was really struggling.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:23.400]   So I couldn't really start writing one of my papers
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.560]   in my course.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.960]   So I have two choices at that time.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:31.440]   I can either ask my professor
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:34.320]   to give me an extension of the deadline
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.560]   or I drop the course.
[00:34:36.560 --> 00:34:37.400]   So I was struggling.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.640]   I would just, like, according to my profession,
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.200]   I was still in law at that time,
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.640]   I would just drop it because I've missed the deadline.
[00:34:43.640 --> 00:34:46.120]   There's no way for me to make me feel good
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:48.960]   to continue and ask for an extension.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:51.800]   But the Holy Spirit convicted me the other way.
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.160]   So I unwillingly, I opened my email
[00:34:56.160 --> 00:34:57.560]   and then I emailed my professor.
[00:34:57.560 --> 00:34:59.800]   I still remember how I emailed him.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:01.360]   So usually you will try to explain,
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.600]   I'm too busy these days,
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.560]   can you give me so and so days of extension
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:08.520]   so that I can submit my paper, right?
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:10.800]   So my email looks like this.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:12.080]   Oh, hi, professor.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:13.520]   I have no excuse at all.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:16.560]   It's purely my poor time management,
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.480]   but I couldn't meet the deadline.
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.480]   Would you grant two days of extension of the deadline to me?
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:26.960]   And I was like, I was struggling.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.280]   Who would he grant me?
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.440]   Like, it's such a bad email and without any excuse
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.800]   to ask for an extension and ask for some grace, right?
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:36.480]   But after a few minutes,
[00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:39.560]   the professor replied me with two words,
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:40.960]   extension granted.
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.160]   So I was like, wow, you're so gracious.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.600]   So I spent the next two days to just finish the paper,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.440]   to turn it in, and then it takes a while
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.160]   for the paper to get back to us, right,
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.320]   for the grace and marked paper.
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:55.960]   So after a few months,
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:59.640]   I got my paper back with my professor's grading.
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:04.080]   So I opened the paper and it has an A on it.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.720]   So I was like, does my professor forget
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:10.680]   that he needs to give me a great penalty because I'm late?
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.840]   So I was about to pull up my email again
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.800]   and ask him if he forgets to do that.
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:20.200]   But I heard a voice saying to me,
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:23.720]   Jennifer, seriously, must you do that?
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:29.720]   And I was very embarrassed at the moment.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:31.880]   I was in school in the library
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:34.040]   and I realized what I have been doing
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:36.240]   in the whole semester on this,
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:40.640]   especially on this matter is I just try to use
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:45.120]   my own strength, my own judgment to continue my faith
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:50.120]   without recognizing we are under the grace of God.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.640]   And I even tried to reject his grace.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:36:57.240]   You know how stupid I was,
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:37:00.680]   how foolish I was if I'm using Paul's term.
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:04.560]   And I think sometimes when we are like continue
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:07.040]   our faith journey, these days will come.
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.120]   Like we think that it's all our responsibility
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.440]   to follow God, to do certain things
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.040]   and to be good in front of him and forget
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:20.320]   that the grace of God is the most important things
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.760]   in our faith.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.840]   So, but I'm not saying that we don't need
[00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.080]   to make effort at all.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.160]   We don't need to do good works at all.
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:34.160]   But we should still give our best in whatever we do.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.280]   But like I said before, these good works
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:41.560]   do not give us life or bring us salvation.
[00:37:41.560 --> 00:37:46.280]   It is the spirit in us that brings us life.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:49.880]   So instead of attempting to earn the salvation
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:53.080]   through the good works and using our own strength
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.600]   to maintain our spiritual life,
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:37:56.920]   it is the other way around.
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:01.760]   Our good works should fall out of the conviction
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.760]   by the Holy Spirit in us.
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:08.880]   So I wonder what does it mean to be convicted
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:11.120]   by the Holy Spirit to you personally
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   in your spiritual journey with Jesus?
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:17.160]   And is there any area that you are trying
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:21.760]   to use your own strength or own effort to please God?
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:28.160]   And you might wonder how do we live a life
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:31.760]   relying on the Holy Spirit instead of our own strength,
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.840]   right?
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:36.160]   Again, our faith is about our relationship with God,
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:39.640]   how we listen and speak to God daily
[00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.920]   and submit to his will when he speaks to us.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.600]   But first, we need to be sensitive
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.400]   about how the Holy Spirit speak to us and convict us.
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.080]   I would say if you are familiar
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.960]   how the Holy Spirit convict you and speak to you,
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:57.640]   please continue to make room for that to happen
[00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.840]   in your spiritual life.
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.800]   But if you are not familiar, you're like,
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:05.760]   I am still not sure how God speaks to us
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.640]   and how the Holy Spirit convicts me,
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.080]   I would have a little bit of suggestion
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:13.600]   on how you can do that and practice that.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:18.200]   But again, it is your personal journey with the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.840]   It might look different to each person,
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.440]   but it always starts with time,
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.800]   spending time with the Holy Spirit,
[00:39:25.800 --> 00:39:28.200]   spend time to listen to him.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:31.840]   So I would say when you are doing your daily work
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.680]   or with your family, when you have a time,
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:39.200]   just ask the Holy Spirit how you can see his work
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:42.800]   and how you can minister his love to the people around you.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.160]   Every day when you have time,
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:47.480]   it could be when you are commuting to work
[00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:51.520]   or when you are making tea in your pantry
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.200]   or when you are having a break with your kids
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.400]   or even when you're working,
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:40:01.400]   when you remember, ask him how you can see
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.240]   God's work moving around you
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:07.840]   and how you can minister his love to the people around you.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.920]   And the second thing is when you feel you need to pray
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.240]   or when you see a need,
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:17.240]   maybe it's a person in your workspace or your children,
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:19.920]   pray immediately, even when you're working.
[00:40:19.920 --> 00:40:22.800]   Don't leave it to my midnight prayer before bed
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.040]   because you will forget about it.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.200]   It is not only for remembering his sake,
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:30.560]   but also to invite the Holy Spirit
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:32.680]   to all your aspects to your life.
[00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:35.160]   So whenever you felt led,
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:38.240]   you feel there's a need, pray immediately.
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:43.240]   And again, it is really about your personal wisdom
[00:40:43.240 --> 00:40:48.360]   and relationship with the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.600]   And I hope that by daily practice,
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.400]   you will eventually get to a point
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.600]   that you are familiar with his voice.
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:59.000]   You are familiar with how the Holy Spirit will configure you.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.320]   And there's not a shortcut to be sensitive.
[00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.800]   I cannot do that overnight,
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:06.440]   but it is really needs time to practice.
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.040]   So as we're closing today,
[00:41:08.040 --> 00:41:13.040]   may I invite you to stand and I would like to pray for us.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:25.080]   As Paul starts, he asks us not to be foolish,
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.360]   to just use our own strength,
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.480]   our own effort to please God
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.840]   and to continue our faith journey.
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:41.760]   And, but the reality is we might not,
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.200]   we sometimes we're busy and we just forget
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.760]   about the conviction or to forget about,
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:49.240]   to spend time with the Holy Spirit.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:54.280]   So I was preparing this sermon these two weeks.
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:58.520]   My schedule was very packed and I didn't know
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.560]   whether I can really finish it
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:06.680]   or whether I can understand the passage well enough.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:09.920]   And as I was preparing, I was reminded that
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.200]   maybe this is the perfect message for you to prepare.
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:17.960]   This is not about just my own strength or own time,
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.280]   own understanding of God's word, of God's will,
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:26.800]   but to depend on the Holy Spirit
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:31.160]   to explain the passage to me, to help me to prepare
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.840]   and even to give me strength to continue.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.360]   So I wonder, like, is there any area of your life
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:42.080]   you felt very overwhelmed or you're too busy
[00:42:42.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   to be inviting the Holy Spirit in?
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:52.760]   If there's anything comes up to your mind,
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:43:00.000]   let's bring us, let's bring these issues to God right now.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:03.720]   Let's spend a little bit time to quiet our heart
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:06.560]   and speak to the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:30.920]   Yeah, Jesus, we thank you that you have come
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.960]   and saved us from the curse by trying to be
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:41.880]   good in front of you, trying to be perfect in front of you.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:48.400]   We thank you that you have sent the Holy Spirit to us
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:53.120]   to help us and guide us in our journey of following you.
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:56.920]   And it is not always easy to do that.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:44:02.800]   And Jesus, I just lift up all that we have prayed just now
[00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:08.320]   there are maybe some areas that we forget
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:12.680]   to invite you to help us and to invite,
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:15.640]   to let your Holy Spirit to work among us.
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:19.640]   We now lift them up to you.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:24.640]   May your spirit continue to conflict us in those areas.
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:31.320]   And I pray that your voice will be louder than other voices,
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.320]   will be louder than our business
[00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:37.840]   and louder with the voices that we hear
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.920]   from the earth or from other people.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:45.920]   So Holy Spirit, we invite you to every aspect of our life.
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:54.720]   And I invite you to give us guidance and strength
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:57.040]   to do whatever we do.
[00:44:57.880 --> 00:45:02.200]   And we pray that we will live a life that glorifies you.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.560]   And we live a life that depends on you
[00:45:04.560 --> 00:45:08.840]   because this is your intention to come
[00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.320]   and help us to follow you.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:16.240]   Let us not to be foolish in your eyes.
[00:45:16.240 --> 00:45:20.800]   Let us depend on you.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:29.080]   And we thank you for what you have already done in our life.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.680]   We thank you for your goodness.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:33.520]   We thank you for how you have been leading us
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:35.240]   and guiding us.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:39.480]   And we invite you as one church, as one community
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:43.840]   that you will continue to work among us.
[00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.640]   And we pray in Jesus' name.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.720]   Amen.
