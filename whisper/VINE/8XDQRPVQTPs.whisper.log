[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   This is not a church in the singular, on its own and distinct,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   but a church in the plural, united across a nation, joined in purpose,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   focused on building up God's kingdom one life at a time.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   It is a church that has at the heart of its DNA
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   the grand narrative of the redemptive story of Jesus Christ,
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   and that celebrates in the freedom and grace that such a story brings.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   This church is not constricted by the walls of a building,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   but actively engaged in the community it is planted in,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   desiring for God's kingdom to take root and bear fruit in local soil.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   A church that sees salvation as holistic,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   transforming God's people for God's work,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   and equipping a generation to represent God's heart
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   to the poor, the weak, the oppressed and the persecuted.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Imagine this church committed to seeing the family
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   as integral to all that it's called to be and do,
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   involving intentional, committed and authentic relationships across all levels.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   It is the sort of place where both the young and the old
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   feel cared for, supported and equipped.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   A church where people of all backgrounds and traditions
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   come to feel at home, a cultural mosaic,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   that honours and embraces a richness in diversity
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   that marks us as the body of Christ.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   It is a church that is willing to innovate and express faith creatively,
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   reflecting the boundless limits of God's creativity as glory to Him.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   A place where people gather, hungry for the presence of God,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   and passionate to see this invade all aspects of their lives.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Where they seek to develop an intelligent, spiritual faith,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   rooted in God's word and driven with prayer.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   A church that does not make its Sunday services
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   the exclamation mark of its existence,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   but instead the comma in its ongoing sentence.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   A time of service, love and engagement
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   that inspires and emboldens all equally
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   for the conversation that lies ahead.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   A church that cares, disciples, rebuilds, renews.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   This is our city.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   This is our church.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   This is our home.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Good morning, everyone.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Everyone good?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   God is good.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   All the time, come on.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   This old-fashioned thing, come on.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   God is good.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   All the time.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Yes, we should have this, right?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Yeah, I hope you guys are feeling good.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   During our fasting period,
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   we are coming to the third week.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   I don't know how you're feeling, how your fasting journey.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   But for myself, today a little bit cold, I feel more hungry.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And when I'm hungry, I feel more, I need more spirit,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   like more energy.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I need more spirit, like fill me and really God.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   And then when I pray, it brings me to a, of course, scripture.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Let me read for you guys.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   In Romans 8, you are controlled not by the sinful nature,
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   but by the spirit.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   If the spirit of God lives in you, if Christ is in you,
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   your body is dead because of sin.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yes, your spirit is alive because of righteousness.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   And if the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   is living in you, he who raised Christ from the dead
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   will also give life to your mortal bodies,
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   food his spirit who live in you.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Wow, this one is so touch and encourage me,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   like my body is also belong to God.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   When I'm fasting, oh, there's some physical needs,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   but actually that's a good time to let the spirit
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   to take the control on us.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   It's talking about living spirit, living body.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   So when we worship, we should have a living body, right?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Not like a dead person, come on.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So why don't we stand up?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I invite you all like stand up and then let us have a prayer
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   and then let the Holy Spirit lead us to worship, to praise him,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   to lift up not only our spirit.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Our spirit should within us, but also exactly,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   completely connect with our body.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   When we worship, we are worshiping our God
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   with our whole heart and whole body.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Let us pray.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Father, we thank you for your spirit come.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Thank you for give us this room, this space,
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   this opportunity for us this few weeks.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   We can really hear your voice, really feel your presence
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   and really see your work in us.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   So Lord, we praise you.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   We lift up our voice and heart to worship you
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   so that your spirit will hear and your name be praised
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   and be lifted up.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   We pray that in the name of Jesus.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Amen.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   [music]
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like you.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   All of my days I want to praise the wonders of your mighty love.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   My comfort, my shelter, tower of refuge and strength.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Let every breath, all that I am, never cease to worship you.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   Power and majesty praise to the King.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Mountains bow down and the seas will roar at the sound of your name.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I sing for joy at the work of your hands.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Forever I'll love you, forever I'll stand.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Nothing compares to the promise I have in you.

[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   My Jesus, my Savior, Lord, there is none like you.

[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Nothing can come against.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   No one can stand between us.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   God with us.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   God for us.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   Nothing can come against.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   No one can stand between us.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   God with us.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   God for us.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Nothing can come against.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   No one can stand between us.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   God with us.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   God for us.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Nothing can come against.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   No one can stand between us.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   Where there was fear, you brought courage.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   When I was afraid, you were with me.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   And you lifted me up.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   And you lifted me up.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:24.000]   Where there was fear, you brought courage.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   When I was afraid, you were with me.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   And you lifted me up.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And you lifted me up.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   Where there was fear, you brought courage.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   When I was afraid, you were with me.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And you lifted me up.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   And you lifted me up.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   One more time.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   Where there was fear, You brought courage. When I was afraid, You were with me.

[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   When we were at the show, I saw a picture.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   There's a train.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   The train's supposed to be running very fast,
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   very quick, high speed.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   But I saw that there are lots of things on the cargoes,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   the containers.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   One, two, three, four, five, six,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   many, many of the containers,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   there's a lot of stuff
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   that make the train running so slow, struggling.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And when it arrives, it lands to a station.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   That station, the train can load on
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   all that heavy stuff, load it on.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000]   I sense the Holy Spirit telling us today,
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   we are holding too much on the train,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   on the cargoes.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   There may be some hurts, fear, death, a fate.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   There's something happened in our life.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   But nor today, here is the station for us
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   to really take this down, release it.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And then it being alive,
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   and then we have room to be filled by the Spirit,
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   filled by life.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And then we can run very fast.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   And then that train can even
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   to have more and more passenger to come in,
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   to go in, to go far,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   to go to that direction that God leading us to go.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   But nor today, here is the station.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   That station is for us
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   to really put these things down, the heavy things down.
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   I would like to read one more scripture for you guys.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   It's a few verses after what I read
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   in the beginning of service.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   "Now if we are children, then we are hearers.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   We are hearers of God and coherent with Christ.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.000]   If indeed we share in His suffering,
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   in order that we may also share in His glory."
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   Lord Jesus, we thank you for your suffering.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And you let us know, you understand us,
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   you know us, you feel us, and you're suffering for us.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And when we receive that,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   when we let you do your work in us,
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   we bring you glory.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   It's not by our own strength, but by you.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   Even though we are suffering, we are struggling,
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   when you come, when we let it go, when we open,
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   when we go to this station today
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   to let you do your work in us,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]   that glory is for you.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   That glory is for you.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Glorify you, Lord.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   Lord, may you be with us.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   So that when we are coming to the coming song for the worship,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   you speak to us, you let us know
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   how we can really, really low down these things,
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   and then to have the room for you to feel us.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   [music]
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   I just, I really feel like we need to continue singing this song.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   [music]
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   Whatever circumstances we face,
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   God is constant, God is unchanging, and God is unfailing.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   And his word remains truth.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   It's the standard.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   [music]
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Last week, my dad died,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   and it's been the hardest week of my life.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   And singing these words,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   "Where there was death, you brought life,"
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   is so difficult to sing with what has happened.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   But it doesn't change who God is,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   it doesn't change what he does,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   and it doesn't change his word.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   And just because my dad is dead here,
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   it doesn't mean that there's no life,
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   because he is living in eternity with the Savior.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   And so when we sing these songs and we go through things,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   we may often feel like there's a lie,
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   or that God is not consistent,
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   or he isn't who he says he is, but he is.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   And what we go through doesn't change or affect the nature of God.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   And so we're going to sing the bridge again.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   And maybe some of you are also mourning.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Maybe some of you are mourning a family member,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   or you've lost some part of your life that you never thought you would lose.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   But God restores.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   God is a healer.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   God is unchanging.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   And God knows how you are feeling,
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   and he is with you in this moment.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   So let's sing the bridge again.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   Where there was fear, you brought courage.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   When I was afraid, you were with me.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Where there was fear, you brought courage.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   When I was afraid, you were with me.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   Where there was death, you brought life, Lord.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Where there was fear, you brought courage.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   When I was afraid, you were with me.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   And you lifted me up, and you lifted me up.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   We sing God with us.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   God for us.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   Nothing can come against.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   No one can stand between us.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   God with us.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   God for us.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Nothing can come against.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   No one can stand between us.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   God with us.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   God for us.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:56.000]   Nothing can come against.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   No one can stand between us.

[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Holy Spirit, come to comfort us, to comfort our hearts,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   to heal us.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   There's no one like you.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   There's no one like you that much, know us that much.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   You know our needs.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   You know our heart.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   You know our suffering.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   You know our loss.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   You know what we need.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Holy Spirit, come.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Lord, we thank you for your presence.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   Thank you for giving us that hope.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   You lifted us up when we lost hope.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   You tell us you are hope.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.000]   You give life.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   You give hope.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   You give us to see the picture that we are with you,
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   and we will with you as well.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   We pray for Harriet.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   We pray for her loss.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   We pray for your presence to heal everyone who needs.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   Lord, may you-- may your hand just touch us,
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   by yourself.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   We know that that comforts have to come from you.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   We know that today you are coming to heal everyone of us.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   Thank you for letting us to put down these heavies
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   and fill with your hope and love.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   With the courage that you're giving us,
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   that's why today we can proclaim we are your children,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   and we have the same hope in the future.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   And now, this is our home.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   You called us to be here because you are with us here.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   Your spirit is with us here.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   We thank you for all your works, and may your will be done.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   We pray that in Jesus' name.
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   Everyone says, amen.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   Amen.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Why don't we give a round of applause to our Father,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   our God, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   I believe that God is really working something among us.
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Please have a seat.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   I think this is a quite special day today.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   Holy Spirit have special work in us.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   I believe that God is not tend to lead us to something super heavy
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   that we cannot stand, but there's some things like here,
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   as I mentioned in the prayer, we arrive at a station
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   so that we can let God to freely do his work on us.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   So I hope you're ready.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   If not, I pray for you guys.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   God won't push everyone of us to do anything we don't want.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   That's really what we want to touch us and love us.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   So, yeah, wow, wow.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   What a powerful worship.

[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   [Music]
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   Yeah, hello, I'm back.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   Hi, by the way, I am Ivan, one of the pastors of the Vang Yuen Long.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   So welcome again, and yeah, parents already settled.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   So as I mentioned, we are in our month, our January fasting month.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   So this is the third week we are coming into.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   And then next week, technically it's the 21st day.
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   And on that day, we will break our fast together, celebrate together.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   We can share how the Holy Spirit works on us individually and actually properly as a church.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   So that's why we have the fasting as church.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   So on that day, 28th January, we will have lunch of course, fast for a 21 days.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   So we decided to have a good lunch all together.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   So you can still fast in the morning, but during the lunchtime, that's the best time for us to connect one another.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And also we can share life.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   We will set tables there.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   You can have your own food, bring to us so that we can enjoy together the community time.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Is it good?
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Yes.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Bring your own lunch.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   And then next week, we will bring our own senior pastor.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   Andrew Gardner, yeah, from Wan Chai.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Yeah, he will come to speak to us, to have a message to preach.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   So in Cantonese service and also English service.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   So that day, yeah, next week, we can like have the fellowship time all together after the service.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And yeah, very important.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   It's not just for our own sake, right?
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   We enjoy our community time, but also Jesus called us to send his gospel.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   So we regularly will have a program called ALVA.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   That's a very good tool for us to share our faith and also connect people to church.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   So we have a video.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Why don't we first watch the video, and then I will share a little bit more with you all.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   Having conversations about life, faith, and Jesus is hard.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   And this is interesting, because at some point, everyone wrestles with life's big questions.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Questions about hope, purpose, meaning, and love.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   Imagine creating a space where people in our community, our friends, neighbors, and coworkers, can come and have conversations in a way that is authentic and unforced.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Where leaders don't need to have all the answers, and anyone can ask tough questions and share honestly about what they believe.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   That's what ALVA is all about.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   ALVA started in a church in London years ago with a simple idea to engage friends who might not typically go to church.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Lives were transformed, and it began to grow all over the world.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Today, you can find ALVA in schools, coffee shops, church buildings, prisons, and homes.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   And so far, millions of people have experienced ALVA.
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   So what is ALVA?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   ALVA is a series of interactive sessions exploring the basics of the Christian faith.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   In each session, you eat food, listen to a talk, and have discussions in small groups.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Eating food together creates space for people to connect, relax, and build friendships.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   The talks tackle core questions about life and faith from a Christian perspective.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   And the discussion allows people to unpack these ideas without fear of being corrected or judged.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   All of this is done in a fun environment where anyone is welcome.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   It is typically run over 8 to 12 weeks, with a weekend away where there are opportunities to experience worship through music and moments for prayer.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   By running ALVA, you're creating a space where people can connect with each other and connect with God.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   Sign up, get started, run ALVA today.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   Yes, sign up, run ALVA together.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   So I want to ask, who has joined ALVA before?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Wow, you are one of millions.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   So there are millions waiting for us as well.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   They have not yet joined ALVA.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   So I invite you all to invite your friends.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   We have won twice ALVA in our church.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   And just a few months ago, we won ALVA right here.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   It's so good, so amazing.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   And there's a lot of space.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   We can invite more people to join.
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   So I invite you guys to invite your friends and family to come.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   And I saw that there are many hands.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   So you have joined ALVA, so you can serve ALVA as well.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   But if for those who haven't joined ALVA before, you also can serve.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   We have a lot of, like, a few different roles to serve ALVA.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   So that's why we have a training on 4 February.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Then we have a one-off training so that we can equip you all, come together.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   We have one spirit altogether.
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And then we can serve ALVA to bring gospel to our neighborhood.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   And on 21st, the week right after Chinese New Year,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   there's a good start for us to winning ALVA.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   So, yeah, enjoy ALVA together, join and win ALVA together.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   So sounds good.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And if you would like to scan it later,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   our digital signage is always ready for your before and after service.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   So we can well use of that digital signage as well.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   And now is the time for us to have our offering.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   So I invite our welcome team to pass around the packet.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   We have a lot of way to serve and worship God.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   We can serve as a church, worship team, production team, K4C.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   We can serve as bring gospel to other in ALVA.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   We also can serve by the action of giving.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   That's why we always mention offering is part of worship
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   because that how we really use our whole to worship God.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   And that is a very good opportunity for us to, like from our heart,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   to ask God, ask the Holy Spirit, "Oh, what do you want us to give?"
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   We can give out in different way, different amount,
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   in physicality, digitally, and also maybe serving.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   So why don't we just pray?
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   Yeah, let us pray for our offering altogether.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   Father, we thank you for giving us this opportunity,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   this great opportunity to contribute to your kingdom.
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Yeah, thank you for your spirit to let us know how do we respond.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   We are not asked by anyone, but we are called by you
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   so that our giving, our contribution is used by you in your kingdom.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   So Lord, may you use it, receive it, and move us
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   so that we are so thankful to join this in this way,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   to join your work in this city, in your kingdom.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   We are praying in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   So today we have our lead pastor, Pastor Tim, to give us a message.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   So let us welcome Pastor Tim to come to stage.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Yeah, why don't we stretch out our hand to pray for Pastor Tim
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   before he gives our message.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Father, we thank you for your ways of your leader to lead us.

[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   But now you open our heart and ear to listen to your words
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   so that we can respond with our action.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   We pray that in Jesus' name. Amen.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   Hey, earlier I was taking back to my college days,
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   Shout to the Lord.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   So it's been quite a while.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   But that actually was a song where I fell in love with worshiping.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   And for me that was very special.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   So thank you so much for bringing this to us this morning,
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   you know, to worship God in that way.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   Now, talking about university, while I was at university,
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   I had a friend, a great friend, even to this day a good friend,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   who checked in on me.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   He asked, "Tim, how are you doing?"
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   And I was doing okay, la, you know, it was okay.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   And then he, I said, "I'm okay."
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   And he's like, "What's wrong?"
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   I was like, "What do you mean what's wrong? I'm okay."
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   "No, something's wrong, Tim. You should be happy.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   Jesus was always happy."
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   I was like, kind of caught off guard and thinking,
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   I was like, "No, surely Jesus wasn't always happy."
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   I was like, "What about when he died on the cross?"
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   And so that kind of ended the conversation.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   And we're still friends today, so it didn't end the friendship.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   But as I was reflecting on that,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   there was something in me just saying that I was okay,
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   or him perceiving that I was not doing good,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   where it brought him discomfort.
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   He felt like it was not right.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And that's a type of misguided spirituality,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   where you think when you're a Christian,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   you always need to be happy.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   You always need to feel great.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   And even if you're not feeling great,
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   you have to pretend like you're feeling great.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   And it can also have this toxic faith element,
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   where you believe, "If I have faith, then I will not suffer.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   I will have no pain. I will have no difficulties."
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   And so that somehow flowed into this conversation.
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   Now, besides misguided spiritualities,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   actually our culture is not comfortable with pain,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   with suffering, and with grief.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   I remember in the US, you walk around,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   you say, "Hey, what's up? How's it going?"
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   "Great!"
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   And if you ever actually answer that,
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   "Really, how are you feeling?"
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000]   People are like, "I don't want to hear that, man.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   I just want to hear you're great,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   and I want to move on with my life."
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Right?
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   So, even within our culture,
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   there is this comfort, "Don't be a downer.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   Don't rain on my party."
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   And so we're stuck with these feelings of grief,
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   of pain, of difficulty, of sorrow.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   And we feel like we're not allowed to express them,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   and maybe we even feel shame for them.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   And so then we're not sure,
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   "Can I bring this to my friends?
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   Do they even want to hear about this?"
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   Or maybe they want to hear about it once,
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   but they don't want to hear about it a second,
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   the third, the fourth, the fifth time.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   "Can I bring this to my Christian community?"
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   Or do they also reflect culture,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   and don't want to hear about it
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   after they prayed about it once,
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   they feel like it should be settled?
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   "Can I bring it to God?"
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Or is this a part of my life
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   that I need to hide from God
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   because I somehow feel,
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   or my environment has told me,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.000]   that I always need to be joyful
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   and feel great and happy,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   and then when I struggle,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   it's a part that God does not want to hear.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   And this leads us to,
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   a lot of times we don't actually know
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   what to do with our pain.
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   We don't know what to do with our suffering.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   We don't know what to do with our agony,
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   with the things that we're carrying around in our hearts.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   And I just wonder this morning,
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   who here woke up with tears this morning?
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Who went last night as you were laying in bed,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   was feeling sorrow?
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   I think it's quite a few.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   I don't think it's just like one, two people.
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   What sort of pain have you been carrying around?
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   Maybe it's even from a long time ago,
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   where this is just this thing
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   that just has not gone away.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   What do we do with that?
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   What I want to do with you this morning is,
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   I want to explore with you a question.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   And the question is this.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   How can we bring our sorrows and our grief
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   and pain before God?
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000]   What does God's word teach about that?
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   How are we supposed to process that?
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000]   So today we're continuing in our message series,
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   Fresh Encounter.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   We have been looking at fasting.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   So we also are doing this fast together,
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   which I don't know about you,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   for me this has been very encouraging.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   I love doing that together.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   I feel really strengthened
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   when I get to do this with other people.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   And I've experienced God in a deeper way in the season.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   I hope that is your experience as well.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   Then last week we talked about prayer.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   And we looked at Jesus,
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   how Jesus encouraged the disciples to come and pray.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:44.000]   And he encouraged the disciples with God's goodness,
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   that we have a loving father who loves
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   giving good things to the children who ask.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   And today our topic is personal worship.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   Now, one thing that we also want to do during the season is,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   if you've been in church,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   some of us have been in church for a while,
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   some of us might never have been much in church.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   But if you've been in church for a while,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   it's easy to get stuck in a rut.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   Like to get stuck in routines, how we relate to God.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   But God wants to encounter us in fresh ways.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   We don't want to talk about experience from 5 or 10 years ago.
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   We want to experience Jesus here and now.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.000]   Because he's alive and he's moving and he's at work.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   So as I was thinking about personal worship,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   now the first thing that didn't come to mind
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   was talking about pain and sorrow and grief.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   That's actually the last thing that came to mind.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:48.000]   But I want to, first of all, I want to share with you a practice
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   that is known as the prayer of lament.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   And then afterwards I want to talk a little bit more about
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   why I concluded that as we're talking about personal worship,
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:01.000]   to talk about the prayer of lament.
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   So here's a definition of the prayer of lament.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   A lament is a complaint to God.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   Yes, the Bible tells us it is okay to complain to God.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   And it shows us how to do that.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   It's a prayers of lament offer a way to approach God,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   acknowledge our circumstances,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:28.000]   and the genuine feelings of sadness, grief, frustration, sorrow, and fear
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   that overwhelm and consume us.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   Lamenting is an act of faith
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   that calls upon God for transformation and redemption.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Now what does personal worship have to do with lamenting?
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   Well, for me, personal worship is really bringing all of our lives
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   before all of who God is.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   It's bringing all of our, in every facet of our lives,
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   showing our devotion to him.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   And that means that we also do that in the painful parts of our life,
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   that we show our devotion to him,
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   that we come before him and bring the sorrows, the pains,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   the struggling, the agony to the one who loves us
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   and who can really do something about what we're experiencing.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   And I personally find when we engage with God
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   in the most difficult times of our lives,
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   that it is some of the deepest and most powerful worship there is.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   I was earlier moved, I assume you too, when Henriette,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   you heard what has happened, and she's up here,
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   and she is leading us in worship.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   Now that's deep worship.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   That's not easy worship, but that's deep and real worship.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000]   When our times are tough and we're choosing to come before God
[00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   with whatever is going on, that's an act of faith and it's an act of praise.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Now today we are in the Book of Psalms.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Now there is personal laments, there's also corporate laments.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   So the Bible actually teaches us how we can engage in this complaining to God.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   So we didn't just come up with that because we felt like it,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   actually God's Word leads us in that,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   and it shows us how we can do that individually,
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   but it also shows us how we can do that corporately
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   because sometimes there's things as a society,
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.000]   as a group of people that we are lamenting,
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   that we are crying out to God for.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.000]   But today we're going to look at a personal lament.
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   We're going to look at Psalm 6.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:56.000]   And Psalm 6 is attributed to King David.
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   Now the Psalms is the prayer and the worship book of Israel,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   of Jesus, and of the church.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000]   Jesus actually, when he was on the cross, he prayed a lament.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   Psalm 22, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   It's a psalm.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:29.000]   So Jesus was led by the Psalms,
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   even how to bring his agony and his grief and his pain to the Father.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   And so we're going to see how the psalm invites us to bring those things that are heavy,
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   where a lot of times we don't know what to do,
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   to the God, and to see how God meets us when we do that.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:51.000]   So we're in Psalm 6, and starting in verse 1 it says this,
[00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   "Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger, or discipline me in your wrath.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am faint.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   Heal me, Lord, my bones are in agony.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   My soul is in deep anguish.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   How long? How long?
[00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   How often?
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   How often?
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   When we go through painful and difficult things,
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   there's a thought that comes up in our hearts and minds,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   and we wonder, "Is somehow God angry at us?
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   Is he somehow disciplining us or punishing us?"
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   And we wonder about that.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   I don't know if you've ever thought of that.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   I have thought of that.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   I have thought of that as I've gone through painful experiences.
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   Is God somehow disciplining me?
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   Is there a sin that I need to confess, something that I need to sort out?
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   And sometimes there might be, you know, where there's something we need to work out,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   but a lot of times we just don't know.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   And we feel like maybe there's a distance, and we're just wondering what's going on.
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   Well, here in the Psalm, David, he doesn't confess any very specific sin.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   He does that in others where he's clear.
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   So it seems that David is like, "Lord, I don't know if I did something wrong.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   Take this away. This burden is too heavy."
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   The psalmist describes the circumstances.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   "For I am faint. My bones are in agony.
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   My soul is in deep anguish."
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   Now, throughout the Psalms, pain and suffering is described as physical suffering and pain.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   But it doesn't mean that it just refers to physical suffering and pain.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   Actually, a lot of times it's used as a metaphor to also talk about emotional suffering and pain.
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   And so we actually don't know the circumstance that triggered this pain and suffering in David's life.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   If it's an illness or if it's something emotional, something else has happened.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   We don't know.
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   But this is a cry, "I can't take it any longer.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   Do something.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   My circumstances, they're weighing me down and they're crushing me.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   How long?
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   How long?"
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   Now, that's the cry of someone who is at the end of the ropes.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   But it is also the cry of someone who is hoping God will act.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   So by crying out to God and asking God how long, David is expressing his hope,
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   even if it is a faint hope, that God can step in and change his circumstances.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   So I lament as a complaint to God, as a complaint to the one we believe
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   who can actually do something about what's going on.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   And this element of hope is important because when we cry out,
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   we come to the one who can actually help.
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   We come to the one who can meet us and deliver us,
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   who can show us mercy, who can lift us out of whatever difficulty it is that we're facing.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   Now, ultimately, this is a plea for God's mercy.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   You see it in verse 2, "Have mercy on me."
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   There's an Old Testament professor I like, and he comments on this verse.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   He says this, "When people in life are against us,
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   we have nothing to turn to but God's generosity,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   his grace, his mercy, his love.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   He's the one that delivers us. He's the one that meets us.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   He's the one that has the power to bring us out, to bring us through,
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   to sustain us when we are weak, when we have nothing left in our tank.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   Let's continue. Verse 4, "Turn, Lord, and deliver me.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   Save me because of your unfailing love.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   Among the dead, no one proclaims your name.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   Who praises you from this grave?"
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   Now, the word that's translated as "turn,"
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   actually a more literal translation is "return."
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   So David is saying, "Return to me, Lord."
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   He feels like God has abandoned him.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:03.000]   He feels like he's on his own.
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:09.000]   "Return to me."
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   And he also appeals to God's love, to his unfailing love.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:27.000]   So when we lament, we also call on who God is and who he promises to be.
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:33.000]   God promises his covenant people, which is also us as Christians,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   we're in the new covenant, that he loves us, that he's with us, that he's faithful.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   And so we call on this, "Lord, you say you're faithful.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   You love us. Do something.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   Show me that this is real." That's what we're saying.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   And verse 5 kind of cracks me up,
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   because David is making an argument why God should deliver him.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   He's basically saying, "I'm dead. Who can praise you?
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000]   What good is it? You're going to lose some praise.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   So keep me alive."
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:18.000]   Let's continue in verse 6.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   "I'm worn out from groaning.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   My eyes grow weak with sorrow.
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   They fail because of all my foes."
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   So right now the psalmist, or David, is describing just what he's been experiencing.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   It's also part of lamenting.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   We describe what we're experiencing, what we're feeling, what's been happening.
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:56.000]   And he says that he is worn out from groaning.
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   I remember being in Calcutta.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   I volunteered at the home of the dying for Mother Teresa.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   It's like 20 years ago.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   And this hall was full of people who were in their last stage of their lives.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   And Mother Teresa had organized this space so that people do not die on their own,
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   that they do die with dignity, that there's somebody with them,
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   somebody caring for them, somebody who softens their pain.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:37.000]   And I remember when I stepped in there, I mean the hall was full of groaning.
[01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:43.000]   Just worn out from the suffering of the sickness, the illness.
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   I also am reminded of my father when he had cancer and he passed away in 2007.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   Just the groaning when the tumors were growing and pushing on nerves.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   So David's saying, "I'm worn out, Lord.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   I've got nothing.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   I have nothing.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   I'm an empty."
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   And then it talks about the weeping and the crying.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   Now I don't know if you've had this experience.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   At night time, things settle down, we're not as busy, we're not as distracted.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   And then the stuff comes up that we're carrying.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   And then the tears start flowing.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   We start weeping.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   I've had that.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   I went through a difficult, the most difficult experience of my life, 2017.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   And almost every night I was weeping.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   Every night tears were flowing.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   And so we described to God what's going on.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   Well, what's amazing when we do that, He's not scared of what we're experiencing.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   He's not scared of what we're feeling.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   He's not scared of our complaint.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   God can handle it.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   He invites us to do that.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   People might get uncomfortable.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   God does not get uncomfortable with your pain, with your suffering, with your struggles, with whatever's going on.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   God is a sympathetic listener.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   He becomes a partner in our suffering.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   By lamenting, we move from feeling we are alone to being in dialogue with God about what is going on.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   So instead of carrying around whatever is going on in ourselves, now we're starting to bring it to God.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   That's actually part of the healing process, just being heard.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   Just putting name, naming what we've been experiencing, putting a name to it.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   And we can trust that God understands our pain, that He understands our suffering.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   We can know that because of Jesus.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   Pastor Ivan earlier read a scripture, talked about sharing the suffering of Jesus.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Jesus was betrayed by one of His disciples, so He knows betrayal.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   He was abandoned by His disciples, where they all just left Him.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   He was spat on, He was beaten, He was ridiculed.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   He was physically, ultimately put to death.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   So He understands your emotional and your physical suffering, because He has gone through it.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   He understands.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   A lot of times in some of my experience I felt nobody understands me.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   But God understands you.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   But He also went through that, dying on the cross and rising from the dead to lead us out of the suffering.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:30.000]   To turn things around, so that we can experience His healing, His forgiveness, His new life that He gives.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   And this is something that He can give now.
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   Earlier as we were praying, I had this vision of Jesus walking around this room, laying hands on people's shoulders.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   Just doing healing work in people's lives.
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   Just praying over us as a community.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   So Jesus, He loves releasing His healing and His restoration of people.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   And there are some things where God's Word also promises that they might not get fixed on this side of our lives.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   But we have a promise that one day God will set, for those who believe in Him, for those who trust Him, He will set everything right.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   That there will be no more tears, there will be no more pain, no more suffering.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   You can read Revelation 21.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   Now there's a psalm that I came across.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   Interesting enough, it even came up in my personal reading.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   Psalm 56, verse 8.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   It says this, "You keep track of all my sorrows.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   You have collected all my tears in your bottle.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   You have recorded each one in your book."
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   God does not miss a single tear that has flowed down your face.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   Not a single one.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   That's how attentive He is to you.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   In verse 7 it also says, "My eyes grow weak with sorrow."
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   Now what this means when the Psalms talk about eyes growing weak, it has to do with that they've been looking for God.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   They've been waiting on God.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   But they're growing tired of looking out.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   So it's another called God act.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   My eyes are, I can't look much longer.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:49.000]   And then to add injury to suffering, suddenly in verse 7, there's also enemies that pop up that have smart things to say to us while we're suffering.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   Maybe it's blaming you for what's going on.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   People always try to explain suffering.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   And then they try to find fault somewhere.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   And so a lot of times they put the fault on the person who's going through the suffering.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   Maybe it's somebody taking advantage of you while you're suffering.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   Maybe in your job or elsewhere.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   So this just adds.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.000]   But let's continue reading in verse 8.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   It says this, "Away from me, all you who do evil.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]   For the Lord has heard my weeping.
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   The Lord has heard my cry for mercy.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   The Lord accepts my prayer.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   They will turn back and suddenly be put to shame."
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:48.000]   So suddenly God's unfailing love, this love that David called for in verse 4, breaks into the situation.
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]   David has been hurt.
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   God has heard the complaint.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   He has heard the mourning.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   And that changes everything.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   This is a turnaround.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   This is a turning point.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   Now we don't know how much time has passed between the lamenting and this line.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.000]   A lot of times, sometimes God meets us immediately.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   Sometimes there's a longer period.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]   But don't be discouraged.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   Jesus is at work underneath the surface.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   He is working.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   Don't lose hope.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   Hold on.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   He's at work in your life.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:38.000]   And then suddenly, you know, His word will break through, His assurance.
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   We don't know what happened.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   Did God speak to David?
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   Did somebody have a word for him, come for him?
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   Was he encouraged through some of scripture?
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   We don't know.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   Now I've had an experience like that.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   I shared earlier that I've gone through a very difficult time.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:07.000]   And I went to, attended a church and was worshipping.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   And I was stuck.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   I did not know how to move forward in my life.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:19.000]   I -- my life had come to a sudden halt.
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   I was hopeless.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   I just really did not know what to do.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   And I really didn't care even what happened to me at that point.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   And so as I was worshipping, I had a word from Jesus.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   And I've shared this here before.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:41.000]   I'm not finished with you yet.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:43.000]   But I felt like He was.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   I felt like it was over.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   He said, "I'm not finished with you yet."
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   Now, were all my problems resolved in that moment?
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   No.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   I still was in the same situation, but I was heard.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   Because God had spoken to me in my lamenting and my crying and in my worshipping Him.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   And it released hope and courage to move forward.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   Suddenly my perspective had changed.
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   And then God bit by bit turned my life around and just poured His goodness and His love on me.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   So this is the transformative part.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   When we bring our pains, our complaints, our sorrows to God in a prayer of lament,
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   that God, one way or another, at one point or another, that He meets us, that He speaks to us,
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   that He provides for us what we need to move forward,
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   to know His steadfast love in the circumstances that we're facing,
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:58.000]   to know that He is going to see us through.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   Now, at the beginning of the message, I asked the question,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:06.000]   "How can we bring our sorrows, grief and pain before God?"
[01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   Well, the Bible gives us the prayers of lament to show us how to do that.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   And so we've seen that we can bring our complaints to Him.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   Now, I want to share with you five steps of how can I do it, how can I lament, what do I do?
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   Just very simple.
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   And this might be something that you use as you pray.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   This might be something you journal on.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   So can we -- yes, thank you.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:36.000]   So the first one is a lament is addressed to God.
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   We're talking to God.
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   The second one is we bring our complaint.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   We say what's wrong and what's frustrating.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:48.000]   We just say it.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   And this is not about being theologically correct.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   You just say it.
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   You just put it out there.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   And then we tell God what we want from Him, what we want Him to do.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   And then we describe your situation of distress, your weeping, your sorrow, your struggling.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   Whatever it is, you just put it out there.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   And then we end with a statement of trust, whatever that might be.
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   "Lord, I believe that You still love me.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   I believe that You will meet me in this.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   I believe it."
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:30.000]   We just end with a statement of trust.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   So those are five ways that we see in a psalm that we can lament, that we can pour our hearts to God,
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   and how the Bible teaches us to engage with those deep sorrows and pains that we're facing.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   And I want to ask the worship team to come up.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:56.000]   And God wants to encounter us in fresh ways, something new.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]   That's what the series is about.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.000]   And God can do something new in our lives.
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   And He invites us today to bring to Him our sorrow, our grief.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   So I want to do a ministry time.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   I'll explain what we're going to do.
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   If you're experiencing something difficult, maybe something that's been going on for a very long time,
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   it's just still there, I want to invite you to stretch out your hand before.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   I want to actually invite everyone to stand.
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   Maybe it's something, maybe it's just been tears this week.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   Whatever it is, I want to invite you to stretch out your hands.
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   And then one thing that God gives us is also community.
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   I want to invite those in the community, if you see somebody with your hand stretched out as a sign of God's love,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:03.000]   will you just gently place your hand on their shoulder and just pray over them?
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   So we're going to do this.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   We're going to pray over each other just for a few minutes, and then we'll go into worship.
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   So let's do that right now.
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   Let's lift each other up in prayer.
