[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   Amen.
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   Amen.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   Hey, earlier I was taking back to my college days, "Shout to the Lord."
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.160]   So it's been quite a while.
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.760]   But that actually was a song where I fell in love with worshiping.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.400]   And so for me, that was very special.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.480]   So thank you so much for bringing this to us this morning, you know, to worship God
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.360]   in that way.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:29.640]   Now talking about university, while I was at university, I had a friend, a great friend,
[00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.560]   to this day a good friend, who checked in on me.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.400]   He asked, "Tim, how are you doing?"
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.840]   And I was doing okay, la, you know, I was okay.
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.840]   And then he, I said, "I'm okay."
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.200]   And he's like, "What's wrong?"
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.720]   I was like, "What do you mean, what's wrong?
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.720]   I'm okay."
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.740]   "No, something's wrong, Tim.
[00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.440]   You should be happy.
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.000]   Jesus was always happy."
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.400]   I was like, kind of caught off guard and thinking, I was like, "No, surely Jesus wasn't always
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.400]   happy."
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.360]   I was like, "What about when he died on the cross?"
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.880]   And so that kind of ended the conversation.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.540]   And we're still friends today, so it didn't end the friendship.
[00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.920]   But as I was reflecting on that, there was something in me just saying that I was okay,
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.080]   or him perceiving that I was not doing good, where it brought him discomfort.
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.120]   He felt like it was not right.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.520]   And it's a type of misguided spirituality where you think when you're a Christian, you
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.480]   always need to be happy.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:39.500]   You always need to feel great.
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.640]   And even if you're not feeling great, you have to pretend like you're feeling great.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:53.360]   And it can also have this toxic faith element where you believe, "If I have faith, then
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.360]   I will not suffer.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.480]   I will have no pain.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.200]   I will have no difficulties."
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.480]   And so that somehow flowed into this conversation.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:13.040]   Now besides misguided spiritualities, actually our culture is not comfortable with pain,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.240]   with suffering, and with grief.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.360]   If you're, I remember in the US, you know, you walk around, you say, "Hey, what's up?
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.120]   How's it going?"
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.120]   "Great."
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.400]   And if you ever actually answer that, "Really, how are you feeling?"
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.520]   People are like, "I don't want to hear that, man.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.800]   I just want to hear you're great and I want to move on with my life."
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.920]   Right?
[00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.120]   So there is, even within our culture, there is this comfort.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.480]   Don't be a downer.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.220]   Don't rain on my party.
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:54.420]   And so we're stuck with these feelings of grief, of pain, of difficulty, of sorrow,
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.100]   and we feel like we're not allowed to express them.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.980]   And maybe we even feel shame for them.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.860]   And so then we're not sure, "Can I bring this to my friends?
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.220]   Do they even want to hear about this?"
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.940]   Or maybe they want to hear about it once, but they don't want to hear about it a second,
[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.420]   the third, the fourth, the fifth time.
[00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.420]   "Can I bring this to my Christian community?"
[00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.300]   Or do they also reflect culture and don't want to hear about it after they prayed about
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.940]   it once, they feel like it should be settled?
[00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.060]   "Can I bring it to God?
[00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.760]   Or is this a part of my life that I need to hide from God because I somehow feel, or my
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.140]   environment has told me, that I always need to be joyful and feel great and happy, and
[00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:50.940]   then when I struggle, it's a part that God does not want to hear?"
[00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.780]   And this leads us to a lot of times we don't actually know what to do with our pain.
[00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.860]   We don't know what to do with our suffering.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:06.380]   We don't know what to do with our agony, with the things that we're carrying around in our
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.580]   hearts.
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:16.060]   And I just wonder this morning, who here woke up with tears this morning?
[00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:25.140]   Who went last night as you were laying in bed, was feeling sorrow?
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.140]   I think it's quite a few.
[00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.620]   I don't think it's just like one, two people.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.040]   What sort of pain have you been carrying around?
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.940]   Maybe it's even from a long time ago where this is just this thing that just has not
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:42.940]   gone away.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.140]   What do we do with that?
[00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.620]   So what I want to do with you this morning is I want to explore with you a question,
[00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.380]   and the question is this.
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:58.180]   How can we bring our sorrows and our grief and pain before God?
[00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.860]   What does God's word teach about that?
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.800]   How are we supposed to process that?
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:11.600]   So today we're continuing in our message series, Fresh Encounter.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.680]   We have been looking at fasting, so we're also doing this fast together, which I don't
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.000]   know about you, for me this has been very encouraging.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.880]   I love doing that together.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.020]   I feel really strengthened when I get to do this with other people.
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.680]   And I've experienced God in a deeper way in the season.
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:32.160]   I hope that is your experience as well.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:37.520]   Then last week we talked about prayer, and we looked at Jesus, how Jesus encouraged the
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.720]   disciples to come and pray.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:46.560]   And he encouraged the disciples with God's goodness, that we have a loving father who
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:53.060]   loves giving good things to the children who ask.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:59.300]   Today our topic is personal worship.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:04.720]   Now one thing that we also want to do during the season is, if you've been in church, some
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.880]   of us have been in church for a while, some of us might never have been much in church,
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.780]   but if you've been in church for a while, it's easy to get stuck in a rut, like to get
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.220]   stuck in routines, how we relate to God.
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.260]   But God wants to encounter us in fresh ways.
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:23.060]   We don't want to talk about experience from five or ten years ago.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.220]   We want to experience Jesus here and now, because he's alive, and he's moving, and he's
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.220]   at work.
[00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:39.100]   So as I was thinking about personal worship, now the first thing that didn't come to mind
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:43.540]   was talking about pain and sorrow and grief.
[00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.240]   That's actually the last thing that came to mind.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.540]   But I want to, first of all, I want to share with you a practice that is known as the prayer
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.840]   of lament.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.440]   Then afterwards I want to talk a little bit more about why I concluded that, as we're
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.520]   talking about personal worship, to talk about the prayer of lament.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.480]   So here's a definition of the prayer of lament.
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.200]   A lament is a complaint to God.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.240]   Yes, the Bible tells us it is okay to complain to God.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.360]   And it shows us how to do that.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.560]   It's a prayers of lament offer a way to approach God, acknowledge our circumstances, and the
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:29.600]   genuine feelings of sadness, grief, frustration, sorrow, and fear that overwhelm and consume
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:32.200]   us.
[00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:44.720]   Lamenting is an act of faith that calls upon God for transformation and redemption.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:49.800]   Now what does personal worship have to do with lamenting?
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:58.880]   Well, for me, personal worship is really bringing all of our lives before all of who God is.
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:06.940]   It's bringing all of our, in every facet of our lives, showing our devotion to him.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:13.960]   That means that we also do that in the painful parts of our life, that we show our devotion
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:22.160]   to him, that we come before him and bring the sorrows, the pains, the struggling, the
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:32.320]   agony to the one who loves us and who can really do something about what we're experiencing.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:38.820]   And I personally find when we engage with God in the most difficult times of our lives,
[00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:44.320]   that it is some of the deepest and most powerful worship there is.
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:51.000]   I was earlier moved, I assume you too, when Henriette, you know, you heard what has happened,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.320]   and she's up here and she is leading us in worship.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.320]   Now that's deep worship.
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:04.120]   That's not easy worship, but that's deep and real worship.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:11.560]   When our times are tough and we're choosing to become before God with whatever's going
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:17.400]   on, that's an act of faith and it's an act of praise.
[00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.700]   So today we are in the book of Psalms.
[00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:25.640]   Now there is personal laments.
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:27.500]   There's also corporate laments.
[00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.480]   So the Bible actually teaches us how we can engage in this complaining to God.
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.000]   So we didn't just come up with that because we felt like it.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.960]   Actually God's word leads us in that and it shows us how we can do that individually,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.260]   but it also shows how we can do that corporately because sometimes there's things as a society,
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:48.220]   as a group of people that we are lamenting, that we are crying out to God for.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:50.200]   But today we're going to look at a personal lament.
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:59.400]   We're going to look at Psalm 6 and Psalm 6 is attributed to King David.
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:11.520]   Now the Psalms is the prayer and the worship book of Israel, of Jesus, and of the church.
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:16.680]   Jesus actually, when he was on the cross, he prayed a lament.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.120]   Psalm 22, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:25.160]   Is a Psalm.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:32.640]   So Jesus was led by the Psalms, even how to bring his agony and his grief and his pain
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.240]   to the father.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.400]   And so we're going to see how the Psalm invites us to bring those things that are heavy, where
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:44.600]   a lot of times we don't know what to do, to the God and to see how God meets us when we
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.380]   do that.
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:53.600]   So we're in Psalm 6 and starting in verse 1 it says this, "Lord, do not rebuke me in
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.960]   your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:00.480]   Have mercy on me, Lord, for I'm faint.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:01.480]   Heal me.
[00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:04.640]   Lord, my bones are in agony.
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:08.400]   My soul is in deep anguish.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.000]   How long?
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   How long?"
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:23.680]   Now often, when we go through painful and difficult things, there's a thought that comes
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:30.900]   up in our hearts and minds and we wonder, is somehow God angry at us?
[00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:36.560]   Is he somehow disciplining us or punishing us?
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.460]   And we wonder about that.
[00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:39.960]   I don't know if you've ever thought of that.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:44.280]   I have thought of that as I've gone through painful experiences.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:45.680]   Is God somehow disciplining me?
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.800]   Is there a sin that I need to confess, something that I need to sort out?
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.880]   And sometimes there might be, you know, where there's something we need to work out, but
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:55.600]   a lot of times we just don't know.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:59.280]   And we feel like maybe there's a distance and we're just wondering what's going on.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:05.800]   Well here in the Psalm, David, he doesn't confess any very specific sin.
[00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.640]   He does that in others where he's clear.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.280]   So it seems that David is like, "Lord, I don't know if I did something wrong.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:18.200]   You know, Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   Take this away.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.200]   I can't.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.360]   This burden is too heavy."
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:27.360]   The Psalmist describes the circumstances, "For I am faint.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.200]   My bones are in agony.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:31.160]   My soul is in deep anguish."
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:45.400]   Now, throughout the Psalms, pain and suffering is described as physical suffering and pain.
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.160]   But it doesn't mean that it just refers to physical suffering and pain.
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:55.560]   Actually a lot of times it's used as a metaphor to also talk about emotional suffering and
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:57.740]   pain.
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.160]   And so we actually don't know the circumstance that triggered this pain and suffering in
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   David's life.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:09.360]   If it's an illness or if it's something emotional, something else has happened.
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:12.640]   We don't know.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:17.880]   But this is a cry, "I can't take it any longer.
[00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:20.800]   Do something.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:28.140]   My circumstances, they're weighing me down and they're crushing me.
[00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:31.600]   How long?
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   How long?"
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:45.760]   Now that's the cry of someone who is at their end of the ropes.
[00:13:45.760 --> 00:13:54.180]   But it is also the cry of someone who is hoping God will act.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:59.780]   So by crying out to God and asking God how long, David is expressing his hope, even if
[00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:07.140]   it is a faint hope, that God can step in and change his circumstances.
[00:14:07.140 --> 00:14:13.140]   So I lament as a complaint to God, as a complaint to the one we believe who can actually do
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:19.340]   something about what's going on.
[00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:25.100]   And this element of hope is important because when we cry out, we come to the one who can
[00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:26.380]   actually help.
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:33.780]   We come to the one who can meet us and deliver us, who can show us mercy, who can lift us
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:41.740]   out of whatever difficulty it is that we're facing.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:46.900]   So ultimately, this is a plea for God's mercy.
[00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:51.900]   You see it in verse two, "Have mercy on me."
[00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:56.140]   There's an Old Testament professor I like and he comments on this verse.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:06.540]   He says this, "When people in life are against us, we have nothing to turn to but God's generosity,
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:10.860]   his grace, his mercy, his love.
[00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.300]   He's the one that delivers us.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.100]   He's the one that meets us.
[00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:19.820]   He's the one that has the power to bring us out, to bring us through, to sustain us when
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:28.860]   we are weak, when we have nothing left in our tank.
[00:15:28.860 --> 00:15:30.180]   Let's continue.
[00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:34.620]   Verse four, "Turn, Lord, and deliver me.
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.420]   Save me because of your unfailing love.
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.860]   Among the dead, no one proclaims your name.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:46.420]   Who praises you from this grave?"
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:54.300]   Now the word that's translated as "turn," actually a more literal translation is "return."
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.660]   So David is saying, "Return to me, Lord."
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:59.580]   He feels like God has abandoned him.
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.460]   He feels like he's on his own.
[00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:10.140]   "Return to me."
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:19.220]   And he also appeals to God's love, to his unfailing love.
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:28.100]   So when we lament, we also call on who God is and who he promises to be.
[00:16:28.100 --> 00:16:36.220]   God promises his covenant people, which is also us as Christians, we're in the new covenant,
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:42.860]   that he loves us, that he's with us, that he's faithful.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:45.580]   And so we call on this, "Lord, you say you're faithful.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.180]   You love us.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:51.660]   Do something.
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.300]   Show me that this is real."
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:56.540]   That's what we're saying.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:04.420]   And verse five kind of cracks me up because David is like making an argument why God should
[00:17:04.420 --> 00:17:05.420]   deliver him.
[00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:07.140]   He's basically saying, "I'm dead.
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:09.220]   Who can praise you?
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:10.220]   What good is it?
[00:17:10.220 --> 00:17:12.700]   You're going to lose some praise.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.700]   So keep me alive."
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:18.140]   But let's continue in verse six.
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:22.220]   "I'm worn out from groaning.
[00:17:22.220 --> 00:17:28.260]   All night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.300]   My eyes grow weak with sorrow.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:37.740]   They fail because of all my foes."
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:44.100]   So right now, the psalmist or David is describing just what he's been experiencing.
[00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:45.260]   It's also part of lamenting.
[00:17:45.260 --> 00:17:51.060]   We describe what we're experiencing, what we're feeling, what's been happening.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.460]   And he says that he is worn out from groaning.
[00:17:56.460 --> 00:17:58.900]   I remember being in Calcutta.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.420]   I volunteered at the home of the dying for Mother Teresa.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:07.340]   It's like 20 years ago.
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:13.020]   And this hall was full of people who were in their last stage of their lives.
[00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:20.380]   And then Mother Teresa had organized this space so that people do not die on their own,
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:25.540]   but they do die with dignity, that there's somebody with them, somebody caring with them,
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:30.580]   somebody who softens their pain.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:37.700]   Now remember when I stepped in there, I mean, the hall was full of groaning.
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:42.660]   Just worn out from the suffering of the sickness, the illness.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:49.140]   I also remind of my father when he had cancer and he passed away in 2007.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:56.140]   Just the groaning when the tumors were growing and pushing on nerves.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:19:04.380]   So David's saying, "I'm worn out, Lord.
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.580]   I got nothing.
[00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.540]   I have nothing.
[00:19:09.540 --> 00:19:10.540]   I'm an empty."
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:18.540]   And then it talks about the weeping and the crying.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.980]   Now I don't know if you've had this experience.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:27.180]   At nighttime, things settle down, we're not as busy, we're not as distracted.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.300]   And then the thing comes, the stuff comes up that we're carrying.
[00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:33.940]   And then the tears start flowing.
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:36.540]   We start weeping.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:38.220]   I've had that.
[00:19:38.220 --> 00:19:45.720]   I went through a difficult, the most difficult experience of my life, 2017.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:50.660]   And almost every night, I was weeping.
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:20:02.540]   Every night, tears were flowing.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:05.300]   And so we described to God what's going on.
[00:20:05.300 --> 00:20:10.980]   Well, what's amazing when we do that, he's not scared of what we're experiencing.
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:12.860]   He's not scared of what we're feeling.
[00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:14.540]   He's not scared of our complaint.
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.040]   God can handle it.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:19.300]   He invites us to do that.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.540]   People might get uncomfortable.
[00:20:21.540 --> 00:20:26.900]   God does not get uncomfortable with your pain, with your suffering, with your struggles,
[00:20:26.900 --> 00:20:29.740]   with whatever's going on.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:33.220]   God is a sympathetic listener.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:35.900]   He becomes a partner in our suffering.
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:42.260]   By lamenting, we move from feeling we are alone to being in dialogue with God about
[00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:44.820]   what is going on.
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:49.200]   So instead of carrying around whatever's going on in ourselves, now we're starting to bring
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.200]   it to God.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.140]   And that's actually part of the healing process, just being heard.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:21:04.620]   Just putting name, naming what we've been experiencing, putting a name to it.
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:10.980]   We can trust that God understands our pain, that he understands our suffering.
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:15.660]   We can know that because of Jesus.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.100]   Pastor Ivan earlier read a scripture, talked about sharing the suffering of Jesus.
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:29.460]   Jesus was betrayed by one of his disciples, so he knows betrayal.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.780]   He was abandoned by his disciples, where they all just left him.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:40.060]   He was spat on, he was beaten, he was ridiculed.
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:47.020]   He was physically ultimately put to death.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:54.300]   So he understands your emotional and your physical suffering, because he has gone through
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.340]   it.
[00:21:56.340 --> 00:21:57.340]   He understands.
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:22:03.020]   A lot of times in some of my experience, I felt nobody understands me.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.360]   But God understands you.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:13.580]   And he also went through that, dying on the cross and rising from the dead to lead us
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:25.780]   out of the suffering, to turn things around, so that we can experience his healing, his
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:30.180]   forgiveness, his new life that he gives.
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:33.300]   And this is something that he can give now.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:40.980]   Earlier as we were praying, I had this vision of Jesus walking around this room and laying
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:50.700]   hands on people's shoulders, just doing healing work in people's lives, just praying over
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:52.900]   us as a community.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:23:03.180]   And so Jesus, he loves releasing his healing and his restoration of people.
[00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:10.380]   There are some things where God's word also promises that they might not get fixed on
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:18.300]   this side of our lives, but we have a promise that one day God will set, for those who believe
[00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:22.140]   in him, for those who trust him, he will set everything right, that there will be no more
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:25.700]   tears, there will be no more pain, no more suffering.
[00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.500]   You can read Revelation 21.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:36.660]   Now there's a Psalm that I came across, interesting enough, it even came up in my personal reading,
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:38.140]   Psalm 56, verse 8.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.860]   It says this, "You keep track of all my sorrows.
[00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.120]   You have collected all my tears in your bottle.
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.500]   You have recorded each one in your book."
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:59.300]   God does not miss a single tear that has flowed down your face, not a single one.
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:06.540]   That's how attentive he is to you.
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:11.980]   In verse 7, it also says, "My eyes grow weak with sorrow."
[00:24:11.980 --> 00:24:19.900]   Now, what this means when the Psalms talk about eyes growing weak, it has to do with
[00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:22.780]   that they've been looking for God.
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:27.960]   They've been waiting on God, but they're growing tired of looking out.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:31.140]   So it's another called God act.
[00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:37.340]   My eyes are, I can't look much longer.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:42.620]   And then to add injury to suffering, suddenly in verse 7, there's also enemies that pop
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:49.140]   up that have smart things to say to us while we're suffering.
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:54.400]   Now maybe it's blaming you for what's going on.
[00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:57.060]   People always try to explain suffering.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.000]   You know, and then they try to like find fault somewhere.
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.800]   And so a lot of times they put the fault on the person who's going through the suffering.
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.380]   Maybe it's somebody taking advantage of you while you're suffering, maybe in your job
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:16.380]   or elsewhere.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:21.260]   So this just adds, but let's continue reading in verse 8.
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:26.740]   It says this, "Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.
[00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:28.900]   The Lord has heard my cry for mercy.
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.140]   The Lord accepts my prayer.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:34.660]   All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish.
[00:25:34.660 --> 00:25:40.400]   They will turn back and suddenly be put to shame."
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:47.740]   So suddenly God's unfailing love, this love that David called for in verse 4, breaks into
[00:25:47.740 --> 00:25:49.340]   the situation.
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:51.340]   David has been hurt.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:52.340]   God has heard the complaint.
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.500]   He has heard the mourning.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.300]   And that changes everything.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:25:58.940]   This is a turnaround.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:26:02.780]   This is a turning point.
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:10.140]   Now we don't know how much time has passed between the lamenting and this line.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:14.860]   A lot of times, sometimes God meets us immediately.
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.280]   Sometimes there's a longer period.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:20.140]   But don't be discouraged.
[00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:24.240]   Jesus is at work underneath the surface.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:26.620]   He is working.
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.620]   Don't lose hope.
[00:26:27.620 --> 00:26:29.060]   Hold on.
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.260]   He's at work in your life.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:38.140]   And then suddenly, you know, his word will break through, his assurance.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.220]   We don't know what happened.
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.620]   Did God speak to David?
[00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:45.700]   Did somebody have a word for him, come for him?
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:49.660]   Was he encouraged through some of scripture?
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:53.260]   We don't know.
[00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:57.860]   Now I've had an experience like that.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.780]   I shared earlier that I've gone through a very difficult time.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:07.260]   And I went to, attended a church and was worshiping.
[00:27:07.260 --> 00:27:08.880]   And I was stuck.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:15.660]   I did not know how to move forward in my life.
[00:27:15.660 --> 00:27:19.540]   My life had come to a sudden halt.
[00:27:19.540 --> 00:27:22.180]   I was hopeless.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:25.160]   I just really did not know what to do.
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:30.480]   And I really didn't care even what happened to me at that point.
[00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.820]   And so as I was worshiping, I had a word from Jesus.
[00:27:33.820 --> 00:27:36.580]   And I've shared this here before.
[00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:42.100]   I'm not finished with you yet.
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:43.540]   But I felt like he was.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:45.740]   I felt like it was over.
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.860]   But he said, I'm not finished with you yet.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.020]   Now, were all my problems resolved in that moment?
[00:27:52.020 --> 00:28:00.740]   I still was in the same situation, but I was heard because God had spoken to me, my lamenting
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:06.820]   and my crying and in my worshiping him.
[00:28:06.820 --> 00:28:12.540]   And it released hope and courage to move forward.
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:18.420]   Suddenly my perspective had changed.
[00:28:18.420 --> 00:28:26.380]   And then God bit by bit turned my life around and just poured his goodness and his love
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.700]   on me.
[00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.100]   So this is transformative part.
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:34.300]   When we bring our pains, our complaints, our sorrows to God in a prayer of lament, that
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:40.820]   God one way or another, at one point or another, that he meets us, that he speaks to us, that
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:47.660]   he provides for us what we need to move forward, to know his steadfast love and the circumstances
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:58.220]   that we're facing, to know that he is going to see us through.
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:02.820]   Now at the beginning of the message, I asked the question, how can we bring our sorrows,
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.340]   grief and pain before God?
[00:29:05.340 --> 00:29:13.140]   Well, the Bible gives us the prayers of lament to show us how to do that.
[00:29:13.140 --> 00:29:17.500]   And so we've seen that we can bring our complaints to him.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:21.780]   And I want to share with you five steps of how can I do it?
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:22.780]   How can I lament?
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.380]   What do I do?
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:25.380]   Just very simple.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:27.680]   And this might be something that you use as you pray.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:31.500]   This might be something you journal on.
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.100]   So can we, yes, thank you.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.420]   So the first one is a lament is addressed to God.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.700]   We're talking to God.
[00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.180]   The second one is we bring our complaint.
[00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.540]   We say what's wrong and what's frustrating.
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:48.540]   We just say it.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:50.140]   And this is not about being theologically correct.
[00:29:50.140 --> 00:29:53.100]   You just say it.
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:56.000]   You just put it out there.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:02.740]   And then we tell God what we want from him, what we want him to do.
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:10.500]   And then we describe your situation of distress, your weeping, your sorrow, your struggling,
[00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:13.660]   or whatever it is, you just put it out there.
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:19.180]   And then we end with a statement of trust, whatever that might be.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:22.860]   Lord, I believe that you still love me.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.780]   I believe that you will meet me in this.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:26.780]   I believe it.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:31.000]   We just end with a statement of trust.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:36.620]   So those are five ways that we see in a psalm that we can lament, that we can pour our hearts
[00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:43.180]   to God and how the Bible teaches us to engage with those deep sorrows and pains that we're
[00:30:43.180 --> 00:30:44.180]   facing.
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:50.340]   And I want to ask the worship team to come up.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:56.900]   And God wants to encounter us in fresh ways, something new.
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.580]   That's what the series is about.
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:05.340]   And God can do something new in our lives.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:13.420]   And he invites us today to bring to him our sorrow, our grief.
[00:31:13.420 --> 00:31:16.460]   So I want to do a ministry time.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:19.620]   I'll explain what we're going to do.
[00:31:19.620 --> 00:31:23.860]   If you're experiencing something difficult, maybe something that's been going on for a
[00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:29.200]   very long time, it's just still there.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:31.420]   I want to invite you to stretch out your hand before.
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:37.380]   And I want to actually invite everyone to stand.
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:42.140]   Maybe it's something, maybe you just spent tears this week, you know, whatever it is,
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:45.740]   I want to invite you to stretch out your hands.
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:50.780]   And then one thing that God gives us is also community.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.900]   I want to invite those in the community.
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:59.580]   If you see somebody with your hand stretched out as a sign of God's love, will you just
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:03.700]   gently place your hand on their shoulder and just pray over them?
[00:32:03.700 --> 00:32:05.460]   So we're going to do this.
[00:32:05.460 --> 00:32:13.620]   We're going to pray over each other just for a few minutes, and then we'll go into worship.
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:14.620]   So let's do that right now.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:16.340]   Let's lift each other up in prayer.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:26.340]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
